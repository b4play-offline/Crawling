0,"first of all, this game looks amazing. hats off to the team for producing a game this pretty. no bugs, bno glitches. however, i didn't like this game for how slow the pace was. the first life is strange is more interesting than this one. I just finished the game because i wanted to at least get my money's worth but even after finishing it, i still feel like i spent too much for what i got. the story focuses too much on the protagonist and his little brother; and it drags it along for too much. there were too many of the aesthetic moments where the game expects you to just watch and like it. The responses you can choose of the character your playing as are so conflicting with the moments that you cant select what to say. it wasnt long after i felt like i wasnt part of the story."
1,I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS MY FAVORITE LIFE IS STRANGE GAME AND IF U DISAGREE U PROBABLY LOVE TRUE COLORS LOL
2,"I do recommend this game, and I found it to be good. Although I really do think they went out of their way to make it more about race, and stereotypes. It felt like on and off I was back in the 2016 election all over again. I mean, they even put the Trump wall. 7/10. Had amazing characters, for the most part the story was solid minus the politics. I found the friendly characters a long the way made it all worth it."
3,this game is so obsessiv i so love this game ive already bought episode two because i couldnt handle to know more and just gonna let you know ive just noticed the game today so im excited for whats next <3
4,"Absolutely love this game. Out of all the LiS games, this is my favourite. I originally played when it first came out on PS4. Must admit, I've met some interesting bugs in the PC version! Example, Sean having a walkie talkie stuck through his hand for an entire chapter. Was rather amusing! 

What makes this one stand out to me more than the other LiS games is the fact that, not only do you have a strong bond and shared trauma with your companion (Sean's brother, Daniel), your decisions also affect him as well. The consequences don't just affect you in this game.

I feel like, after reading a lot of negative reviews, a lot of people have completely overlooked the point of the game, so from a PERSONAL point of view, let me clear some things up if you're not sure whether to go and play this. NOTE: May contain spoilers.

 - Firstly, yes, it has political elements but so did LiS 1. Ex: People being bullied and NOTHING being done about it, no matter what you, the main character did or said. 

- Next, DontNod are RENOWNED for having a ''choices have consequences'' narrative. Nowhere do they say the story CHANGES based on your decisions. You cannot change the main narrative of the story. While I understand it's frustrating saying ''no'' to a situation repeatedly and having to deal with it anyway, as it's written in the main narrative, the only thing that will change is how Sean will react to the situation as Sean is the character you are playing as.

- Okay, so, the beginning where the main storyline begins: Of course it's a little... Extreme, however, remember that these are KIDS. Without anyone there to guide them or tell them how to react, of course their instinct is to run. Explaining to authorities that your little brother has this power that can literally kill people... You think they're just gonna say ''oh, okay, well nevermind, carry on.'' Of course they're not! Sean was trying to protect his little brother. He said multiple times throughout the story that he didn't want to be separated from his brother, so telling authorities the situation would not have achieved that.

- The comparisons to LiS1... This game is not related to LiS1 in ANY way. There are a couple of mentions of the game but this game is its own. Comparing it to the previous one is pointless.

- You HAVE to remember, these kids have been involved in a LOT of traumatic experiences that they weren't prepared for. Of course they're going to change and react in odd ways. EX. A lot of people saying Daniel is annoying af and doesn't do what he's told etc. Read the start of this point again and you'll understand.

This isn't an attack at all, just clearing some things up. It may sound like I'm defending the game but I'm not. It does of course have its negatives, one of the big ones is, as some have said, there seems to be more cut scenes and aimless wandering around than there is actual gameplay. I also don't like that some things seemed forced, however, it is what it is. It's a fictional story that is allowing the player to experience the lives of these 2 young kids who lost their dad and were left to fend for themselves.


I could happily play this game over and over again as I just love the character building, the dramatic changes that occur and the people you meet make such an impact.

Definitely recommend this but be warned: As with any LiS game, you're in for a rollercoaster ride of emotions"

6,"Play the first episode, you will know if you will enjoy it based on that only. It's 100% reliant on really enjoying the two leads. There are not constant side characters and no major overall plot to pull you in like Life Is Strange. It just hits you in the feels the whole time, definitely a lot more than the first game. If you play the first episode and don't like it or have mixed feelings then you should probably skip the rest. ;)"
7,this hit me..better than the first one
8,"Very good story game

"
9,love it
10,"Quality time and a long complicated story. It was fun! Life is strange 1 easter eggs are few, but worthy"
11,Wonderful like the first one <3
12,"Game is great until episode 2. Daniel becomes unbearable as a character and you feel genuine frustration with him, pure pain seeing him whine and not listen whilst you cant do shit."
13,This is the best story game i've ever played
14,very nice game
15,good story
16,"Yawn.
After having played the first in the series and then the adventures of captain spirit, I was expecting a game with at least some basic similarities of game play. This one however is more like watching a very slow movie than playing a game. Episode 1 had very little user interaction for the duration of the episode. Few choices, nothing of real consequence, minimal participation on my part. Compared to the first game of the series which started off almost immediately with the character exploring her powers, this one took entirely too long to get to the point.
I was hoping that Episode 2 would get away from the drawn out storytelling and get to some meaningful interactions, but it's much the same feeling. Slow storytelling, too much dialogue, nothing really of consequence. I don't mind story-driven games but this one relies too heavily on interpersonal relationship development between brothers and not enough of effective use of the powers for something meaningful like LIS1.

It's just not my thing - the characters didn't make me really care much about them so the story wasn't appealing."
17,"great game, i think its very underappreciated in the fandom"
18,UWU
19,"First episode was good, but the second really let me down. The pace is much too slow and very little gameplay, the game is more than 50% custscenes and needs objectives to guide the player towards very meaningless goals, especially after episode one. You make choices, and then the game takes all the power away from you and forces you into a storyline you just decided against. The characters from episode one can only be contacted if you put yourself at risk which is dumb. Overall would recommend playing episode one but none of the rest"
20,"I was enjoying this game so much until it turned into a democratic hit piece all of a sudden LoL. Like wtf yep all hicks are like ""that's what we need the wall built for to keep you Mexicans out"" then you jump into the car of a democratic protester who lives in his vehicle and goes from place to place protesting ""to make a positive change""(unlike those rrrrrrrracist fkn hillbilly""s). Then just before that you come across a white family where they scripted them to be total assholes like the guy says when you walk up to them ""oh here it comes"" like he doesn't care about kids who need help because they are all the same (those begging Mexican kids) and they moved to a place where more hillbilly's are to get away from all ""those kinds of people"". The writers for this game have absolutely ruined the story to push agendas. Keep your fkn politics out of fkn video games. Video games are an escape, they are great stories and fun times with friends not tools to push your ideologies. If you like games that make 90% of white people look like racists or just straight assholes that live next door then this is the game for you. It also opens up with a cop drawing a gun on a fkn kid for fighting his ""of course"" asshole white neighbor kid then the cop goes and shoots his dad for no reason lol. I hate that everything in the game is based on real world democratic talking points. (because all cops are white little vag boys who draw guns on kids for street fights.) so fkn dumb."
21,"good game, I cried after the first part, and i cried at the very end. choices definitely hold a lot of weight which i loved"

23,"Huge, huge bummer. They did a great job with this one. Incredible research and a really painful topic but hard to recommend because again it's a huge bummer to experience. I guess if you can handle a story about homeless children being hit with everything America does to people then give it a shot. It definitely leaves an impact and is a game I think about a lot."
24,"i loved this game. i connected with all of the characters so much, the relationship between sean and daniel is really what got me hooked. the game attempts to tackle political issues but they feel forced. racism comes up in each episode and it only causes inconvenience without affecting the story itself, they’re like jumpscares really. also, your choices don’t really matter throughout the story. the story will continue the same way, mostly small bits that don’t affect the story will be altered (but your influence on daniel affects the ending  drastically). the graphics are amazing. great lighting. the overall look of the game is very stylized. outstanding soundtrack. if you like the idea of watching an interactive tv series, this is perfect for that. i almost cried multiple times."
25,amazing characters
26,"Honestly, at first I only really played this game to spend time with a friend. I wasn't interested in it at all and it seemed pretty boring from the trailers. I am so glad I pushed past it to try the first episode. After that I was hooked, I just had to see what happens to our main characters and I wanted to help them get the best ending possible. In the end I feel I achieved that but both endings feel sad in their own way. 

All in All I HIGHLY recommend trying this out if you loved the first game and want to know the reason why most people avoid Seattle."
27,Personally i find LiS 2 more enjoyable on many aspects like story and the variety of choices but still it feels like whatever you choose the outcomes just didn’t satisfied me and i believe the reason is quantity. Wished there’d be more epilogues you can get..
28,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's like watching an AMAZING movie, but you get to be involved instead of JUST watching. I've played 3 of the 4 life is strange games, and this is by far my favorite. Might just be the connection I have to the story, but no doubt it's partly because of how amazing it is, period."
29,i think it good for teens and big  brother   and little brother
30,jeu très bien
31,"5 out 5, made me miss my brother that i don't have."
32,good

34,Pretty good game. The first one is better though.
35,"this game is filled with such a unique story line. i can't lie, it always makes me cry, but i keep coming back to it because it's just that addicting. this game is by far the best lis game out there. i will forever hold sean & daniel close to my heart.

10000000000/10"
36,"Great story, but felt a little too disjointed with the huge leaps of time. I would've liked to experience settling into new locations rather than having it jump to me having already become acquainted with everyone around me."
37,"First one is better. But who knows, you may like it :^)"
38,"Another great installment of the Life is Strange series by Dontnod and Square Enix. Truly an amazing game that not only helps build onto the existing Life is Strange world but carved its own way with a fresh new story and characters! I was hooked on these characters and their story by the end of Episode 1. Visually these games are always great and the sound track once again knocked it out of the ball park. I personally really loved episode 3!  Overall this game left me just as teary eyed as the others and does not disappoint. 9/10 Would highly recommend and play again!

I own all life is strange games and i have to say that this is one of my favorites. Will not make you cry like LiS1 and LiS BTS but will leave you with a smile on your face if you pick the right ending. I recommend this to anyone who wants a long adventurous trip"
47,This game is a journey from start to finish.
48,Yes
49,i love it yall dramatic
50,daniel is so annoying
51,"Interesting story + commentary from characters. Not as riveting as the first game in episode 1, but still pretty good."
52,very pp game
53,this is the best disunion making game ever
54,"Beauitful story amazing visuals, amazing characters. A little slower than the original Life is Strange but it feels like your choices have more impact, therefore making this a more potent game."
55,"This post from reddit describes the game perfectly:

Life is Strange 1 is an interesting experience. It's very messy and poorly thought out in a lot of places, but it's forgivable as a stepping stone for future games. However, I don't think the developers learned as much as they could from the shortcomings of the original. Particularly, LiS 1 suffered from poor writing which resulted in cringe inducing dialogue, inconsistent rules, plotholes galore, etc. However, even if the writers didn't improve in any way, LiS 2 could still have a much better story and characters than the original game if the devs and writers focused on the simple parts and what they got right in the original game. So, what did the developers decide to do? Well, they decided to make a game that heavily comments on modern day USA politics. What?! Yes, middle aged French developers try to write a story about teenage Mexican immigrants and American politics.

Like, try to guess when this game came out based on this clip, just try to guess: https://youtu.be/nv5zvpQggXY?list=PLjk2J8_j79MwBGz8_UeNfiQckMxlBGo3M&t=322. Yep, we're providing ""commentary"" about America after Donald Trump became president. I say ""commentary"" because LiS 2 doesn't seem to be able to provide any thought provoking questions or messages aside from Racism is bad. Which is alright, but you need more than that if you want to say something meaningful. But I don't think the game is capable of saying anything more as the developers seem to have the most basic understanding of politics.

For example, the main character Sean runs into a hyper conservative Christian church that indoctrinates his brother Daniel and the female preacher uses him because of his telekinetic powers to spread the religion. However, the developers seem to have missed the fact such churches wouldn't allow female preachers, it's written in their scripture that they can't. It just seems that the developers at Dontnod weren't willing to do any meaningful research before making the game. This wouldn't be that bad if nearly every episode felt the need to have some right wing stereotype harass the main characters because they aren't white. And good characters potentially saving isn't happening as each episode has a new cast that you meet, interact with for a bit and then never see again once the episode is over. The game is so heavy handed that in the first 40 minutes you run into a racist kid that gets into a fight with Sean, which results in a racist policeman shooting Sean and Daniel's father. So, Daniel accidentally activates his powers, kills the cop and now the bothers need to run away to Mexico And in the final episode Daniel uses his power to break down the wall that separates Mexico from the USA. But, the best part is that the only way that Daniel can go into Mexico is if you make the wrong choices and he becomes evil. Yep, Daniel can only go to Mexico is he becomes evil. Which is kinda hilarious considering how left leaning the game is.

And the worst part is that LiS is an improvement in many ways from Lis 1. The playable character doesn't have powers, but instead it's their younger brother, so no more powers shutting off when there needs to be a dramatic scene like in LiS 1. The choices you make affect Daniels personality and there's even 4 different endings instead of just 2 that make your previous choices irrelevant. The character all around feel a lot more grounded and there are some well written conversations between them. While, episode 3 does kinda feel like it's mostly filler the characters you meet are fairly fun to hang out with. This is what really bothers me about LiS 2, the game could be good, even great, but it decides to ruin it every so often by focusing on it's poorly written political commentary. I can't really think of many games that have done good modern day political commentary. Deus Ex kinda does it, but it's also a bit of a parody as every single conspiracy theory is correct in the world of Deus Ex, it's fantastic, but political commentary isn't the main focus. Bioshock and Disco Elysium focus on the politics of their fictional worlds, which are very well explored and obviously parallel the real world in many ways, but aren't made to comment on the real world directly. MGS 2 is the only one I can really think of that did predict how politics would change with the age of the internet, along with things like safe spaces, censoring opinions, etc. However, the games I mentioned are a rare few, this is because to provide good commentary on something you need to understand the topic you're covering and that takes a lot of time and effort to do properly.

However, the devs seem to have some weird view of reality. Like, in episode 4 we meet Sean and Daniel's mother that left them after Daniel was born. Yep, she just left. And why? Because she felt like she was trapped by life and wanted to have more excitement in her life and thus left her husband with a young boy and an infant to take care of both without ever telling him about her plans, nor did she seriously contact her husband or the rest of her family again. And the game expects you to feel sorry for her as even picking the clearly hostile dialogue choice just results in you teaming up with her anyway. You cannot be angry at her, no matter what you pick. And that's not the worst part. The evil religious fanatics that kidnapped Daniel gave him a list of chores, which Sean comments and I quote: ""Wow, this place is worse than army camp!"", 100% seriously without any sarcasm and is proven to be right in the end. Wanna know what those chores were?

Daniel Household duties:

Make bed every morning

Clean dishes after every meal

Vacuum hall & room weekly

Take out the trash on Monday

Wash hair every two days

Help with Sunday laundry

Count your blessings daily

Yep, those are all the chores. I had almost exactly the same chores back when I was a kid, does that mean that I also went through army camp Sean? I haven't been to France in a while, but I'm pretty sure they haven't started throwing out the dishes out the window or stopped washing their hair.

Again, the game isn't completely bad. It has some good parts, like how Daniel starts using his powers for boring things like opening the door of a car of carrying his groceries and most of the characters are likable and compelling. However, the poor writing combined with technical issues, half of the final episode feeling like filler and poorly thought out road trip story, just makes me unable to recommend the game to anyone."
56,This game made me cry. Truly a masterpiece with a phenomenal soundtrack. Highly recommended.
57,"What a disappointment.
The first 2 episodes were ok and then it went downhill exponentially.
Ridiculous situations come up for shock value. Over and over. It's BAD WRITING. 
There's no ""real"" choices compared to the first game. I said ""NO"" to a situation 5 times and it still happened. Then in the next episode I said ""NO"" again 5 times; anddddd it still happened. Then in the next episode; I was strongly against a situation and said ""NO"" again and again and again and guess what. Your choices really DON'T matter. Not this game.
The characters are unlikable. By the last 2 episodes I was rolling my eyes over and over again.
Sean is WHINY and self-righteous and judgemental as hell. YET when he does something bad or immoral or literally physically hurts someone, he justifies it because it's all about him and his brother. No matter the circumstances. He can do whatever for his cause but complains and bitches throughout about everybody else (unless it fits the political narrative of course.) 
Daniel is just a little shit. Absolutely unlikable. No more to say about him. 
The political spoon feeding. It's possible to do creatively I guess, but having a game tell you this is good and this is bad. These types of peoples are good but these types of people people are bad. Watering issues down to extreme examples. Insulting. Game treats you like a moron.
The game doesn't flow like the last one either. It's just cut-scenes. By the last 2 episodes I just scrolled on my phone while the mass dialogue was playing. 
No connection to the characters while it jumps around and around. Story makes no sense. Forced myself to finish game because I paid money for it but mannnnn does it disappoint if you want to use the first one as precedent.
Pretty graphics though <3  +++

"
58,"The game is divided into episodes which is good because it allows you stop at any time. It is mildly intuitive, sometimes you'll get stuck but not for too long. Once you are invested into the story or the characters you will find it easy to continue. I highly recommend it if it's your first story based game. I did not play LIS 1 and everything was just fine."
59,"In my opinion, the best LiS game. I may be biased because Sean and Daniel are exactly like my brother and I and having a hispanic character I can relate to as much as Sean means I have a lot of personal attachments to this game. I still think this game could be a nice experience for anybody if you enjoy slower paced and emotional stories. There's a lot to learn from all of the characters and the perspectives this game offers are super refreshing. There's also a lot of moral conflicts and hard choices you have to make as is classic LiS fashion but I like the way it's done in this game in particular as someone who can relate to trying to instill good morals into your younger sibling but also making sure you don't try to overprotect him and make things worse. It may seem like your choices don't initially matter but they come into play very subtly and accumulate at the end as the choices you make and the things you do as Sean really shape Daniels character. 
All in all, I feel very fondly about this game and I'd love to experience this game again for the very first time. The soundtrack, characters and story are all beautiful and it's a lovely journey to be apart of. Definitely recommend."
60,"It was an emotional experience, thank you everyone who created this game"
61,"How much I missed the ""slap enano"" choice.."
62,"Second time I played this game, 3 years later. I'm on a LiS replay spree, and now I've finished the second main line, again. 
Different perspective, different opinions.

The first time I played it, it was still released in chapters. So there were big gaps between gameplays, sometimes as long as 3 months? So it never really felt like you went through a consistent story. But after playing it all in one go, I suppose I could grasp it in a more natural way of how things played out.

To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward too much to play LiS 2. In my first playthough, I didn't really think the game was as good as LiS 1 and BTS. 

BUT, myy oh my ....how much my opinion has changed about the game, now.
First off, the 3 year gap gave me a fresh start, new perspective. I'm a little older and see stuff a little different now. Perhaps that worked along side with it. In a nutshell, I've gotten MAJOR RESPECT for this game and the characters. 
Although it starts off kinda..meh. Daniel is the typical child that wants attention, and my mind flows back to the days I played it the first time. Like ""Ugh, I have to go through his tantrums..."" But that is the point! You're Sean, you're the older brother. You have to feel what he feels.
And in the end, now that I've seen and played through the story chapter after chapter, I see how much Sean and Daniel really have suffered through the entire adventure. I understand better what the relation is and means between the brothers, and the choices you make which adds to Daniels moral choices throughout. It was a living hell what they've gone through. Not all, of course...there were good and wholesome moments. But man, these two brothers, if I really think abou it... I think this is beyond anything what Max and Chloe have went through, Honestly.  And they went through hell and back as well, no denying that!

Overal, the story is insanely in depht and it gets really dark(as usual with LiS stories ofc), a big upgrade from previous games, despite I didn't think of that the first time I played this.
BTS will always be my favorite, but this one has really gotten close now, next to True Colours."
63,Finn is underrated.
64,epic story and game
65,"robbed me from all my dlc's that i bought a while ago. Be aware that if you buy dlc's (which you really have to in order to play the game) that your dlc's could potentially be stolen by greedy steam

Otherwise a great game, i just want my dlc's back :("
66,"Absolutely stunning graphics, Follows the Franchise very well and an overwhelmingly good story. The connection between the brothers is something we have seen before and man give this game a try. ITs worth it."
67,Great game love the series
68,bro
69,"Another masterpiece by DONTNOD,  i loved this just as much as the first game, and intend to play through both games again to discover the different endings, of which there are several. 

These are must play games, if you have not played them and like deep story and choices matter, then these are the best."
70,love it. play it. best lis game. cried a bit too much. Emotionally connected to the word enano now.
71,"Mixed. Good game, horrible sequel.
It's a tale of love, hardship, and the memories you make as you go along in life. Whereas the first game was about reflecting on your mistakes and growing past them, this game is more about keeping your eyes on the road (they fail this in the driving montages) and not rushing through the moments that matter. 
Except it falls flat in its presentation; exploration only serves to stall the plot, you're forced to make snap-decisions, and the colorful, lovable characters you encounter become irrelevant the instant they walk off-screen.
Compared to the previous games, the (corny) dialogue has significantly more effect on the story as a whole, though this comes at the apparent cost of shallower branches and less reactivity from the world.
The story is frustratingly predictable; near the start, I was distracted by the number of obvious emerging patterns, and by the end, I was betting with my friends on which cliche would be next.
Does it all come together in the end in a shower of reflection, feelings, and philosophical quandaries?
No. There's no bittersweetness; there's no point to anything that happens.

It's got good vibes. It's got fan-service. It's got an engaging, filled-out world full of enjoyable characters.
It's got none of the things that made me love this series."
72,"this is my first time playing a story-based where it's by your choices, I find Life is Strange in general very .. hm.. i don't know how to explain the feeling but it definitely gets you to deep to its story and gameplay. 100% must play."
73,"Brooooo this had me having feelings, the emotional story has you gripped from the start. Made me feel like I was part of the story."
74,:)
75,love the story  :p
76,"I actually think this is better than the original Life is Strange and way better than True Colors (which I played before 2). DONTNOD really tried to not only improve every single aspect from the first game but evolve and be more ambitious in terms of scope, themes, choices, representation, etc. I realize now why they left the franchise, because they tried to do so much with this game that probably didn't know where to go next. The easy choice would be to go back to basics, which is what Deck Nine did with True Colors, but what wouldn't satisfy a studio like DONTNOD and I respect that. Life is Strange 2 is a fork in the road, and Deck Nine decided to simply go back.

The journey Life is Strange 2 takes you through is incredible, and way more profound and varied than I expected. You feel these characters grow and you shape them at the same time. The relationship between Sean and Daniel feels authentic, refreshing and extremely well performed. The story goes unexpected places and doesn't end with a perfectly happy ending, but that's life.

Overall I'd say Life is Strange 2 is one of the boldest games I've played. From the themes it tackles to the way it defies expectations. DONTNOD said ""ah, you think you know what is a ""Life is Strange game""? Then watch this!"". Maybe your definition and theirs don't match, but it's undeniable they achieved what they set to make. And, luckily, it really spoked to me."
77,"V3ERY GOD VERY NICE

"
78,fun af and so slay girl yas queen.
79,"the Life is Strange series never fails to exceed my expectations every time I play them. that being said, I can definitely say that Life is Strange 2 is hands down the most brilliant one out of the first ones. I genuinely feel like they really captured the ""choices matter"" feel in the game, giving us so many different possible outcomes and endings in each episode, depending on what you choose. even the consistency of the kinds of choices you make plays a huge part in the game! like the first two LIS games i played, this one for sure reeled me in quickly with it's characters, story, and plot and left me with so many emotions. no matter what ending you get in this game, you will always feel some type of way for the Diaz brothers and even for the characters who you want to see appear again. definitely recommend this if you want to play a really good game where choices significantly matter! 
also if you've played the first LIS games, PREPARE FOR A SPECIAL CAMEO IN LIS 2!!! :D"
80,this game made my depression worse
81,"When starting it up, I really thought this would be an improvement from the rest of the series, and it is until 2/3's into chapter 2 when it suddenly nosedives in quality. Dontnod couldn't help themselves from writing a contrived and convoluted story.

Play God of War instead."
82,I love this! I just can't explain how amazing this is!
83,"This is an adventure game that feels like ""living another life"". I really love it."
84,great
85,"Loved this installment of LiS, became my favorite of the entire series right off the bat.
Yes, I understand that many people think it gets ""too political"" and that the (literal) hate crimes are unrealistic or too far-- and I honestly think that that perspective on the game is privileged and out of touch with reality. The protagonists of this game are POC Americans and they face many attacks based on their identity, which honestly just isn't all that unrealistic (especially based on the specific setting of some parts of this game). 
This game has classic LiS writing; I mean that as it's bad, but it is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the first 2 games in the series. If you like LiS or ""choices matter"" games this is a fun one, the topics it touches on really aren't handled any worse than any other LiS game."
86,my comfort game <3333
87,"rlly cool game, made me cry w my snot and tears everywhere fr"
88,"Life is strange 2 is not as good as the original. It's absolutely the better ""game"" with better mechanics, but it simply does not have the same charm and it feels like the choices matter way less. The choices have smaller effects that stack over time with the relationship between the two main characters so it's not so very clear when a choice has a real effect, they all do, just not as much individually.

The best part and what they've clearly put most effort into is the relationship you can build with between the two main characters and how the choices you make in moral dilemmas shape it going forward. There's a lot of interesting moral dilemmas to decide on, and every choice will affect our little 9 year old brother, how he sees the world and how he's going to try to solve problems

Life is Strange 2 and Life is Strange 1 should be seen as different games, because they are very different on so many fundamental levels. It's little use to compare them

Enjoy them separately for what they are, let them stand on their own two feet as both games are very much capable of it, albeit for different reasons."
89,"goofy ahh dad, good game !"
90,I LOVE THIS GAME BEST GAME I LOVE SEAN DIAZ
91,The best crust punk origin simulator I've ever played.
92,">> Blood Brothers 4 EVER <<

characters *goosebumps*
Story *goosebumps* 
Voice Actors *goosebumps*
Music *goosebumps* 

10/10 - just love it"
93,"This isn't a bad game, by any means. But compared to the rest of the LiS series, it's easily at the bottom. I couldn't connect to the protagonist in the same way as LiS 1 or True Colours. 

I miss having a female main character as well, and Sean in comparison to Alex, Chloe or Max feels bland. I really tried to like this game, believe me, and I adore LiS as a series. But this one just doesn't do it for me, at all. 

If you're a relatively big fan of Life Is Strange like myself, by all means, try LiS2 and gather your own opinion (you may love it). But if you're new to the series or having second thoughts, you can safely skip this entry. Life Is Strange Remastered or True Colours should yield a more enjoyable experience."
94,"It is a very nice game, for people who loves to make choices, thats the perfect game. I just don't like the ending, theres 7 endings in this game, I don't like all of 'em. But it was nice the whole gameplay"
95,"To be fair I've finished every LiS game there is all of them when I used to have a console, but tbh LiS 2 is my favourite with a story about 2 brothers, I loved this 1 and wish Square Enix or DONTNOD carried on a story similar with brothers"
96,best LIS game
97,"I see what you did there Square Enix ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
 
Marketing 101"
98,its really good and fun plus the way the characters display emotion is slay imo
99,"I honestly played the game for the sake of following the LiS universe. In my opinion, it does not even come close to the first game. It's very clear they had a political message they wanted to convey through the game, especially with the situations and interactions presented. This being said, I enjoyed it. I found the story very emotional and personal. The characters are pretty good. I have to say, though, I struggled a little with the whole older brother simulation dynamic. For the entirety of the game, you're pretty much responsible for Daniels moral compass. It's a good game. It was nice to see some tiny nods at the OG LiS. I recommend it if you liked the choice-based process of the first game, it's just as good, if not better because you can't actually go back in time to fix / change any decisions made in this one, which I found really fun."
100,i want a Happy Ending for these two. I love them so much.
101,"Ow. My feels. How do you always know where they are and how to hurt them? DAMN YOU SQUARE ENIX!

Seriously though, this game is amazing. Since you're probably here after playing Life is Strange 1, I'll just summarize and say that the new elements to this game make your many life choices just as hard hitting, and feel way more open ended. It feels as though your choices develop not only the story, but the kind of person your character becomes throughout it. Even something as simple as a kind gesture to another character has your character actually treat them differently to reflect the kinds of choices you've made. It's just so juicy and ripe with replay value. I've spent 20 hours on the first chapter, just trying stuff out."
102,incomplete game.
103,Wonderful story... 10/10
104,"Nothing in particular wrong with this game, but the story and the main protagonist just isn't compelling enough. It feels like there was some missed opportunities to strengthen my sympathy for Sean. I wanted to like this iteration of this franchise (enjoyed the other ones) but overall there's too many weak plot points and events that just don't make sense to me.

6/10"
105,THIS GAME IS SO YUMMY
106,"Life is strange > Life is strange before the storm > Life is strange 2

The game was good and i liked the bond between the 2 brothers a lot. But the game felt more like political pandering and it really broke the immersion.
I like when story games tell a really good story with good lessons without involving real life politics too much.
Overall, i would say it's worth a play if you love the strange of life series but nothing i'd say is much of replay value.

5/10"
107,"I can't believe I've been ignore this gem for so long. TBH, I was very skeptical with this game because of review. But after finish the game I understand why some people don't like it. 

Life is Strange 2 might be a sequel to Life is Strange but the two are loosely connected, so if you’re looking for LIS in this game then you won’t find it. I think that’s why people don’t like this game. They expect LIS all over again and the two are very different games.

Well for me, I was like that before playing the game but once I play the first episode I know I gonna enjoy it. The story might not as good and twisted like in the first one but once I play long enough I start to feeling attached to Sean and Daniel the bond of family they share.Sean is a teenager himself and Daniel is 10 years old, and Sean is now responsible for the health and life of his younger brother. It's not fully a game about baby-sitting, as Daniel often makes his own decisions almost the end of any episode base on what Sean teach him.

IMO, Play the first episode, you will know if you will enjoy it based on that only. If you play the first episode and don't like it or have mixed feelings then you know you like it or not for the rest of story. Nobody can tell you whether or not you'll like it. You have to approach the game on your own, with as few expectation as possible.

End of the day it’s up to you, I say at least give the first 10 minutes a try. It really is an emotional impact game in my humble opinion."
108,"I hate it.

Doesn't have anywhere near the same soul the first one had. (I loved the first one and it's prequel so this is unfortunate) Everyone's a racist dick just because the main character is Mexican and not white. The times where you're supposed to feel for the characters completely falls short outside of maybe 2-3 moments in the entire story. 

The main character makes stupid decisions just for the sake of conflict when any main character with any common sense would've wrapped up the initial conflict in the first episode.

SPOILER:
[spoiler]
The main character's first's instinct after his father is killed by a cop is to run away from the cops and go to Mexico because he has family there! Are you fucking kidding me? This happen in the first episode and it really sets the bar for the quality of writing you can expect for the rest of this game.
[/spoiler]

How can I support or relate to a main character that willingly decides to make things worse for themselves in the first episode!?

You can have political messages in your game as long as you're able to accurately relay both sides of the argument you're presenting. That way you don't end up telling a one sided/opinionated story which is exactly what this is!

This is a story about people with Mexican heritage being discriminated against JUST because they're Mexican or they're suspected of being one. So if you're expecting a nuanced view about racial discrimination then don't play this. Playing this will become a chore especially when you get to episode 4."
109,"Honestly amazing game, great art style and really wholesome story! Its cool making your own choices for the story and i like how they linked the 3 games together."
110,"After Life is Strange 1 and Life is Strange Before the Storm , this is the second and last best game of the LIS series. The bond of the brothers and the adventures as well as the atmosphere and musics are awesome. Graphics are also great, loved it.

Totally recommend it.

8.5/10"
111,"The graphics are good, getting to roam around more than the previous games is really cool too. Would recommend. They have made references to the other games for people who have played them, but they have also made it so you don't have to play them to understand the story. Overall good game."
112,"Disappointing. Yes the whole idea is really interesting and catchy.. but the story could have just ended if Sean wasn't a scared crybaby and instead of choosing to travel all America, to go to Mexico, would SIMPLY EXPLAIN THE POLICEMAN WHAT HAPPENED. Triggered. Most of the dialogues made no sense."
113,"this game ruined and saved my life...day in and day out i make my parents more and more disappointed with me. ive terminated all contact with my family, cut ties with my friends, and quit my job (after saving money to buy the episodes).. all so i can find out what happens next with sean and daniel diaz. Well folks its safe to say i dont have a single regret.. because this game is absolutely breathtaking in story, characters, visuals... it has it all.
i was depressed and didnt bother taking a shower for months before i played this game, but seeing what my perfect boys went through made me want to shower daily with soap and water so i started. i even started changing my underwear. well i hope this tells you how i feel about this game and i think everyone should give it a shot even if you dont think you will like it because max and chloe arent in it (there are easter eggs btw so shut the #### up) it will blow you away............ guarunteed"
114,"Life is Strange 2 is a good story telling adventure, with lots of goosebumps potential. But the game didn't catch me as much as the first game or Tell Me Why. You will like it if you liked the aforementioned. But also be warned: This one is not as strong as the others.

[b]Pros:[/b]

+Nice graphics and art style in between realism and comic style
+Cool soundtrack
+Deep story with believable and lovable characters
+Your choices do matter (for story development and ending)! Not all of them, but a big chunk does

[b]Cons:[/b]

-some bugs, sometimes even game breaking
-story develops very slowly; you don't have as much action or mystery as in other Dontnod games
-overall it is the weakest of the Dontnod games, imho. It still delivers a good story, but compared to the other ones this one let me quite cold, when I finished it. So don't expect too much out of this one, if you were amazed by the first installement of Life is Strange or Tell Me Why

[b]Overall:[/b]

6/10 for gamers
7/10 for people who want to experience a story"
115,i cried
116,LOVE LIFE IS STRANGE. AWESOME GAMES!
117,"Not a big fan of this game, I knew it was completely different from the other two that came out before, but still something feels out of place with this game. The story is good, I guess, the gameplay is fine, the graphics are beautiful. But I think, it's not supposed to be called a Life is Strange game. It seems out of place. 

I'll give it a positive review though."
118,"The game is not bad but I would much more recommend Life is Strange or Life Is Strange: Before the Storm.
Also if you've played the 2 previous games (and The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit) you'll recognize some Easter Eggs and characters which is amazing!

This game tries too hard to make it interesting and ends up just being really fucked up.
You always have to take care of your brother(Daniel), which over the course of the story gets more annoying he's always causing drama and things you don't want to happen.

I also feel like there are too many pauses and Sean(you/MC) always pauses after the first word to make his talking more dramatic so the game ends up being drawn out to an extinct where I felt like I was waiting more on the game than actually playing."
119,"So many sad parts in this game, have tissues handy for the tears!  Emotional rollercoaster for sure!"
120,"Life is strange 2 . Does what the origional did. But, makes the character ties feel more natural. Some of the story themes may not be suited for younger audiences. But, I feel this story is well worth younger and older audiences who have some kind of sibling. So, this story feels almost personal and more impactful.

 The first, episode I felt like I can tell where somethings may happen. Based on these types of games. An I know the ending of part 5 will end up being well worth it. If you enjoy nice stories and themes about family. This game will by the end send you through many ups and downs like life. An I think the money would be well spent. 

 The bubble bath momment mad me laugh. But, some parts near the end I get things had to happen narratively to make sense. But, as contextual / player wants. Logically some pather make no sense. But, I guess get answered in later parts. 
 
If you thought Life is strange had flaws. With the voice acting, character logic, and story, I'm proud to say. Life is strange 2 seems to listen to the feedback and improve on what the origional did. If you enjoy this free chapter. I recommend you get the rest in a bundle if possible ,"
121,"If you've played season 1 of LiS don't expect the same thing. Dontnod's gone in a different direction for this one which was a smart decision. There are of course some similarities but this is a fresh entry. 
The story itself was extremely enjoyable and intriguing, very touching, very emotional like it's predecessor. And sure there are heavy and touchy themes but it doesn't take away from the story, and makes sense to have it. The dynamic between the two main characters is also something I really took a liking to.
I'd say that the standout improvements are in the environments and models, character actions and movements are less rigid and more fluid, as well as the choice system having way more of an impact on the narrative.
This is a packaged deal like season 1, from music and atmosphere to the characters and acting (it's of equal quality is what I'm trying to say).

Overall Score: 10/10"
122,Like watching a very good and engaging movie. Great!
123,"If I had to describe this game in one sentence, I think it would be ""Product of Its Time"".  I played the first Life is Strange, as well as Before the Storm, and I went into this installation with expectations that were blown away in almost every capacity. The character development between Sean and Daniel is unlike any that we've seen in previous games in the series, and the choices that lead you through the story are more in-depth and personal than before. I loved the soundtrack and the visual effects, as well as the UI changes (specifically the ""tab"" section and the choice selection). Overall, this is a very great game and a wonderful sequel to the first. 

My ONLY criticism of Life is Strange 2, however, is that it's a product of its time. This installation deals with topics that are very specific to when it came out in the late 2010's, such as immigration and racism. It feels like this game, unlike the first, will forever be stuck in this time period and possibly fall to the wayside, whereas the story of Max and Chloe are more timeless and deal with issues that weren't just hot-button topics at the time in the real world. I feel like the use of hot-button topics in a game like this takes away from the overall longevity of the title, and does it a disservice in the end."
124,i got my eyepatch 10/10

151,"Due to Steam's abusive and punitive rule enforcement I no longer post game reviews or screenshots to the ""global community."" But I do highly recommended this game!"
152,Thank for your company！！！
153,"Although Life is Strange 2 probably did not top off Life is Strange in the hearts of many, the experience was nevertheless, breathtaking."
154,<3
155,One of the rare instances where a sequel lives up to the greatness of its predecessor. It might even surpass it in some ways...
156,"Although I'm not too keen of Life is Strange creators' hate for bearded middleaged men making them all the bad guys, I can't get enough of this series. Plz gimmie moar Life is Strange!"
157,Awesome!!! Love it so much maybe even more than the first one.
158,It really feels like life is strange
159,The visuals are really good. Background music is very soothing. Would recommend this game to players
160,Chloe is one of the best characters I've ever played.
161,"[h1] How much of ourselves should we give to those we love?
And how much must we betray them to grow up？"
162,gave me depression :(
163,"Overall, I like this game but still love LIS 1 more."
164,I can't continue life is strange Episode 2. I have just finished Episode 1 and It's saying that episode 2 needs to be downloaded. I have bought all the episodes last year and I have already reinstalled the game and still can't play episode 2. It's asking me to buy the episode
165,"ok
"
166,happy game
167,"good game over all, has the problem like most choice games were illusion of choice is a thing but at least if you treat Daniel differently you'll get a different ending"
168,"I recommend this a million times. The wholesome brotherly love makes the adventure between Sean and Daniel a sweet experience to play through, while also making sure you never get swept up in the hardships of life. 

It teaches the importance of family while instilling habits of money-saving, rationing, and patience. I would very much recommend."
169,"I would say out of the Life is Strange games I have played( One, Two, and True Colors) this so far is my least favorite. However, that being said the game isn't bad. I will put the rest of the review in spoiler cover if you'd like to read more.
[spoiler] The writing,story and direction of the game I think is actually good. It makes you feel uncomfortable in a way. If that is the direction the devs wanted to take it they nailed it. That being said I think that might be part of the reason I have a distaste for it at the same time. Video games I use to escape and this felt too much. I feel the characters didn't flow correctly either in their development. Especially Daniel. I felt his personality was so forced and faked just to push the story in a certain way. So many characters also didn't feel as important and they should have been. As the story progressed I felt it drag on more and more. Feeling a lot more forced than a natural flow.  I would still recommend this to play because while it isn't exactly to my taste I would encourage others to try it for themselves and make their own opinions. [/spoiler]"
170,"I can't believe how boring and annoying this storyline is. You spend the whole game dealing with a whiny kid and occasionally making a choice that makes very little difference in the gameplay. I thought I was buying the prequel for Life is Strange 1 but when I realized my error, figured ""what the heck, let's give it a whirl"". 

Really wish I had realized the mistake early enough to get a refund. I'd love it if we had the option to punch the kid and leave him behind but sadly, it hasn't popped up yet."
171,"Love it
"
172,
173,"This game has all the negatives of the original Life is Strange and none of its qualities. The story is unoriginal and its meaning forced. The characters are one-dimensional, annoying and badly written and there's no mystery to uncover, it's just boring."
174,gud
175,"I've played all the Life is Strange games and LiS:2 is just not it... 

The characters are bland and predictablem, the story was first good but it just got boring? The choices don't have any real impact and overall the game is just not enjoyable due to the characters being annoying to deal with half the time. I got to the final chapter and honestly I am not having any fun with this, it's just boring."
176,"Woke as fuck, boring teenage loser story pushing liberal propaganda... fail"
177,"this game is so good oh my god
"
178,"9,999,999/10 game made me heartbroken and sad 

I think people cling onto LIS1 too much to not really view LIS2 in its best light. LIS2 is a whole different plot and brings on a new take to the LIS franchise. However, I am not hating on anyone, I know everyone enjoys different types of teas.

I enjoyed playing as Sean and giving advice/teaching lessons to Daniel. In LIS1 you had a best friend bond, whereas in this one you have a brotherly bond. 

I think the traveling aspect was a really good twist, it makes sense to not hang out with characters for too long since you are on the run - it takes away a little bit of the character building; however,

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

you take notes and keep souvenirs and memories from every stop that you can check out and recall them. The characters may feel distant which is what it should feel like, its months in between you see some characters so it makes sense that they are more of memories and happy/sad ones at that. Like towards the end of the game Brody felt like an eternity ago, which makes sense because he was very early in the game, practically a year in-game by the time you got the finale. All the side-characters still had enough background for me to understand them and enjoy them as characters, it made me sad to leave them which makes sense. 

Little side note: I loved the wolf brothers story that they kept adding in between episodes to remind you of what happened. The ending scene where Daniel asked how the story ends is also heartbreaking.

I genuinely enjoyed having fear of teaching Daniel incorrect lessons, and I made sure to teach him everything I could in game morally. It was nicer to have more endings than LIS1 since you had an ultimatum. This game you have 4 endings, 2 if Daniel is moral, and 2 if Daniel is immoral. It gives you more of a sense that you are in control, you mentor Daniel and he can give you different endings. Yes it can be annoying if he does his own thing sometimes; however, he's a little brother, he is a sponge soaking up everything you teach him from stealing to not playing pranks on someone at the Christmas market. This predict what kind of ending you get. If you teach him to be immoral, he will go against what you say at the end -> he will either get you killed through Lone Wolf, or he will join you in Blood Brothers. On the other hand, if you teach him to be ethical, you will either get Redemption or Parting Ways. How Daniel ends up in all the endings makes sense if you taught him how to care about just Sean and himself, or if you taught him to be good to everyone. 

Some comments I have about the game or things that go unresolved in my head:

A few things that made my head hurt was the fact that at the beginning of the game there is literal footage of an explosion that happened to turn the police car over while jolting the police man back. How was that not sufficient evidence to prove Sean Diaz was not guilty of convicting the murder on the Seattle cop?

Another reason is why did Sean immediately run away instead of just sticking around for the cops and explaining yourself. I understand he is a 16 year old and wanted to look out for his younger brother Daniel; however, no one logically would plan a whole route through multiple states rather than just explaining to check the footage on the dash cam and that you were unaware what happened in the situation. I mean even Agent Flores was discussing with Sean that the death of the Seattle police officer was still unexplained. 

Lastly, all the endings felt heartbreaking. It is both a positive critique and negative critique. I play games because I want to get a fulfilling ending that makes me happy with my decision. All of the endings disregarding lone wolf because that one is just depleting since Sean dies, all feel too bittersweet and unfulfilling. If you redeem yourself as Sean through the redemption ending, you lose out on 15 years of your teenage-adulthood years to see Daniel and Karen greet you (and Lyla if you called her back) after you being falsely convicted for the death of the Seattle police officer. It makes no sense when there really wasn't any evidence, an op test would tell that. Blood brothers felt heartbreaking in a sense that you both get to live together, yet Daniel and Sean just feel immoral (I get it because you set up Daniel to be immoral to get this ending), but Daniel did not even show any interest in Mexico to begin with so I feel like he had to sacrifice in this ending, and his childhood. Parting ways is probably the best ending but it separates the two, which just sucks cause the whole game they became dependent on each other and if you teach Daniel moral standards after breaking through the wall/gate, he leaves you to go to Mexico on your own and he stays in the U.S. with the grandparents. This is personally the best ending imo just because they get to both do what they wanted to do, Sean wanted to start over in Mexico, while Daniel wanted to stay in the U.S. and keep all his close buddies and go to school. Just the hardest pill to swallow is that Daniel seems to have an ankle bracelet that seems to prevent them from visiting Sean - which tore me apart because they both seem happy but they don't have each other anymore, like Sean went through hell for him in episode 4 when he had to open Daniel's eyes in Haven Point that he was being manipulated. 

Overall, this game was heartbreaking and had me thinking for days about the story. Sorry for the really long spiel, I like looking back on my reviews and reflecting after a while."
179,"The wolf brothers have kinda grown on me now. Took a lot of twists and turns to get to the end, but it felt satisfying. Beautiful game."
180,Literally so good
181,"Best game of the series, 10/10"
182,"you buy a game and you think that you will have a comfortable time playing it, but in reality you experience an emotional fuck-up - you really have too many feelings and too many thoughts because of everything that happens.  the latter, however, is very pleasing with extremely atmospheric music, beautiful surroundings and interesting dialogues: you are completely immersed in the story of Sean and his younger brother, you worry about them, rejoice, share their pain ... the current circumstances make you think about a lot and take something  take note as a lesson.

 the second part of this franchise not only exceeded all my expectations, but also just turned me inside out.  from the very first episode, there are so many things and emotions going on inside that you just lose all words.  therefore, I definitely recommend this game for passing - you will be hurt, but you will not regret it."
183,"Cried a bunch! Can relate to Sean. It is hard to act tough when you're actually weak esp when someone depends on you. When his father died, he is now responsible for his younger brother. Like him, things got crazy. I love the scene where they built a campfire together. It is a dangerous ride, but you'll meet amazing people like Brody. Lesson? If life is tough, you have to be stronger. Life goes on! The only way to learn is to be on the road.

The story line is heartwarming. Had a bunch of reflections while playing the game! Should I buy the chocolate bar or steal it for my younger brother? 

You can lose a life in just a sec. While it's still alive, protect it. As for Lyla, true friends will meet again someday. Glad I took the call before throwing the phone!

Will I buy the next eps? Yes! Same with the first season. Totally worth the time!"

185,Really likeable characters. Loved how the story unfolded. I will actually miss playing the game!
186,this game reminds me why I'm happy being an only child
187,"It's not as good as the first game in terms of the Story, but is still good. It has the same mechanics, same type of game, same sort of length. Easy 100% as it's just getting 6 collectables per chapter and sketching 1 drawing per chapter. The most annoying thing in this game is actually the main character, Daniel. I don't know if it is just me, but he always sounds like he is about to cry, has an annoying voice and is just a boring character overall. Very odd."
188,"Both LIS1 & LIS2 are masterpiece and amazing in their own ways.

In LIS2, your choices DO matter that your decision will affect people around you and the final outcome with different variations."
189,<3
190,"it's a good game, sad but good. I actually cried during a few of the scenes. I would recommend this to my friends if they are interested"
191,I f*cking got emo playing this f*cking game
192,i played for 55 hours
193,The only LiS worth playing is the first one.
194,I LOVE THIS GAME PLS BUY IT PLS PLAY IT AND THE BUGS ARE ALSO FUNNY BUT STILL
195,"Holy fucking shit, just like LiS 1 ... it was fucking amazing."
196,"great story game
play it"
197,10/10 worth every penny its just so good the character writings is amazing that you'll get attached to characters you've just met and the story is so sad (in the good way) and the way you see your choices perfectly effect everything around you is phenomenal
198,"love the franchise, still after a couple years after its original release, it feels vital as a stepping stone to the kinds of storytelling this franchise wants to do."
199,w
200,"Not the worst interactive movie, but the first Life is Strange is so much better. Perhaps Dontnod set the bar too high with that one, but I just felt the writing in LiS 2 is not great, the majority of characters are not interesting, and Diaz brothers were not as likeable and relatable as Max and Chloe (their story made me cry, this one didn't). And yes, the superpower here is far less interesting than in the first game.

But overall, I recommend getting the game on a sale."
201,"I prefer the two in Arcadia Bay, starts out pretty strong, some cringe moments and illogical decisions by Sean but it's a decent story if you don't read to much into it. Episode 2 & 3 is clearly the best, 4 & 5 are ass. 1 is good. Buy on sale"
202,"very good game, 10/10 recommend."
203,"Where do I start with this game, it is so good. I played the first game and got attached to those characters, so when I saw there was a second game with new characters I thought it would never beat the first game. Oh how wrong I was. The story is so much more deeper than the first game, its not just a bunch of college kids taking the piss, its about real issues. The art style is just beautiful and you fall in love with the characters (I will fight anyone that hurts Sean or Daniel). The music is great, I found so many good songs from this game and it really sets the feel. Play the first chapter it will get you hooked. Also I literally cried during every part in this game its so sad."
204,"Story was amazing.
I highly recommend.

9.9/10
"
205,Too political and the story was not as good as the first one.
206,"This game can get quite political so if that will bother you, it may be tough to get through certain sections of the game. It is definitely quite different from the first game due to the nature of its narrative. I still enjoyed it and recommend!"
207,GOOOOD
208,Masterpiece.
209,"finish this at 1 am, spending the rest of night staring at the blank ceiling.
definitely gave me depression 

as a minority spend some of my time in the states the conflict this game bring to the table is no joke some of the scene literally got me in tear.

there are some animation bugs that you can see character fly across the camera to spawn at triggered event point or skipping between animation in later chapters but it's not that major for me.

beautiful game"
210,"Bad writing. You make the ""right"" decisions but the outcomes do not reflect it in any meaningful or satisfying way."
211,"New story, new perspective, new gameplay. This time you do not have any power, but your mission is to train Daniel in how to dominate his new ability and how to use it correctly. The fact that his skills and personality depend on how you raise him up is the best characteristic of the game.
As regards the story, it might be a bit too slow from time to time, but you can actually feel Sean's desperation on yourself. It is just another time when Life is Strange makes us empathize with the main character. They found the way to make only the necessary connections between the original story and Life is Strange 2, that way the game plays with our nostaliga but avoiding being repetitive.
Gameplay is good. It is much more explorable than the previous games, for obvious reasons. To be honest, I had to replay it in order to take all the collectibles, since the story itself is so dramatic and tense that it might be difficult to spot them on your first gameplay. You will meet so many characters during the adventure, so eventually you will like and miss some of them.
The final conclusion is that it is an amazing game with an incredible and deep story. Is it as good as LiS1? Debatable. Many people would say that Lis2 is not even a 20% as good as the original, but I think that they are different experiences. I gave it a chance and it was a great decision. 8/10"
212,"I played this game like 4 times already (I've got it also on my PS4), and I still think that it's the weakest one of the Life is Strange series. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game. Decisions are often tough, game is action-packed, but after all, I think that exactly that game is the weakest link in the franchisee. Other games made me more attached to characters, but in this one it's hard to relate to characters and their loss (I won't tell more about it, don't want to spoil ;p), because we don't have enough time to sympathize with them. In other games character development of tragic people is much more... developed. What this game lacks is a moment to stop and reflect on characters we met, but because this game is full of action, we don't get one. After all, I still recommend playing it to the players familiar with the series, but as for the new players; you should try the other games of the series first."
213,episode 1 so far so good.
214,in my opinion the game really drags you around in a good way so good job guys :)!
215,;)
216,If you have a tin heart you wont understand and you wouldnt be expected to so be free and dont worry about.
217,Game is bad don't play!!!!!
218,"So.... Life is Strange 2. Played it way past its due, after the craze of playing LiS 1 and being blown away by it. Hopefully that will help me with my judgement a bit.

Life is Strange 2 follows in similar footsteps to what LiS 1 did, in the sense that it follows on the adventures of a character with powers. In this particular case though, you control one character whose brother has powers. Not time travel, but... telekinesis. This is what pushes the plot forward which, by the way, will be the biggest focus of this review, spoiler free, but still.

The main beats of LiS remain; It's an episodic release, with each episode lasting about three to four hours each, however some tend to be shorter. In each episode, the main characters have to endure several different situations, and this is where DontNod does it again; the way they handle the character's interactions is usually very good, and while the dialogue can be sometimes... strange, it doesn't break away too much from what you'd expect.

With that said, I do have some complaints, mainly in how the plot is driven and the direction it takes right from the beginning. You see, the main two characters are of mexican descendant but American, and the game pushes that agenda down your throat like no one's business. Outside of the social dilemma that entails  (how the typical american views mexicans as aliens, the idea of patriotism and whatnot), it makes a lot of the decisions you make very obvious, and sometimes the effect of them is so clear that it's easy to make decisions based on what kind of end you want, and not what you would decide naturally. The ones regarding your main characters' relationship are good though.

Continuing with the characters, their voices are REALLY good in general, and while some lines may seem off putting, which I think it's due to the writing rather than their delivery in addition to their lip syncing, it really makes you take their word for it, despite the crazy situations you have to endure.

Graphically, you can tell the engine got a touch-up, both in its use of dynamic lighting and shadows, and how it performs; It is now riddled with details, both in its environments as well as in the character models. The sound design also got better, and while some voices may sound off (maybe due to different EQ settings or recording conditions) they are in general really good. Sadly, the soundtrack is a bit muted in my opinion. Where Syd Matters really shone in LiS1, there aren't that many bangers in Life is Strange 2, and the ones that are, are mostly relegated to one specific character and one or two chapters. The rest are mostly single guitar instrumental tracks which fit the setting, but I kinda expected more I guess.

All in all, while it didn't hit me as hard as LiS1, maybe because of the nature of the character's adventure, or something else, Life is Strange 2 could very well be considered a better Life is Strange than the original for some. For me, it was good, just... not as good as the original."
219,"Ugh, I know I am in the very rare section of reviews here but I can't help it.
 The game itself is beautiful like anything from the Life is Strange franchise. 
The story though.. is just so many holes. 

*SPOILERS*
Now, I know it's a game and it's fantasy but I wish it made sense. The first incident ever that kick-started this whole shizshow did not make sense. Sean punches out the neighbor who falls on his back and has a flat rock puncture his...?? his back? He didn't even hit his head. Then the cop randomly pops over and instead of just treating it like a fight, he pulls out his gun like a moron? Like any other fight, I just feel like they wouldn't of gone that extreme. NOW THAT BEING SAID, yes, I know police brutality (and stupidity) is real and let's say this situation could of happened. Fine, the idiot cop shot the dad
without any true reasoning. But what about the autopsy on the cop and the surroundings? And the camera from the police dashboard which clearly shows a blast. The lack of explosives or anything that could actually determine that someone was capable of doing all that without any bombs. The fact that there were no bomb residue/holes on the ground and it simply looked like a tornado. I just really doubt they would be calling him a cop murderer?? Also, I REALLY don't feel like Sean would of ran away. The way that Daniel kept showing off his power after NUMEROUS times Sean told him not to, you would think they would just show the power to the fudging feds/cops/scientists whatever and be cleared on some things instead of going on this insane runaway spree which was also just as moronic and written stupidly. I get it. You gotta make some drama til the very end or else what's the point?
But Life is Strange 1 had a different concept. Turning back time and the consequences of turning back time in that game made sense. The drama that did occur and even the bad characters flowed together and it made sense. 
Life is Strange 2 makes no sense. 
I was getting annoyed by every single person I ever encountered. NO ONE WAS TRULY LIKABLE. The only person I felt for a little is Sean because tbh, I hate Daniel. I hate him so much. Yeah, yeah.. he's a child blahblah. But my LORD from the very beginning he has no sense or respect. Even if the neighbor is a d-bag, doesn't mean you squirt red fake blood on his white shirt. And then the way he honestly thinks that nothing is his fault? Like on the pot farm? His actions cost everyone their wages and for them to get kicked out of the farm. It's truly disgusting how he refuses to see how much damage he has caused. 
I suppose he ""redeemed"" himself at the end when he gave Sean his freedom (at least that's the ending I got) but still. Daniel is UGH.
I also felt like the writers were trying SO hard to put every unlikable category of people - every white person was practically a white supremacist, a sprinkle of religious cult, a dash of hippies, a whole lot of annoying cops, drug lords (that were pretty good people until DANIEL MESSED IT UP), and the list goes on. OHHH, and I loveeee the whole like Karen situation. I like how they had the audacity to really make her like this hero/you gotta know her to understand her. Like, I don't really give a rats BUTT that you like freedom and float where the wind takes you.. but once you have children. 2 of them?! They are your responsibility and dipping out on them is inexcusable so I find it hilarious that there is even this notion that all she needed was to be understood. Like Karen, if you knew you weren't for motherhood, should of stopped at child number 1. And yes, I know the game gives you a choice to reject her to the very end but the way they were trying to portray her did not sit right with me.

I wanted to like this game so much because I fell in actual love with the first LiS but all I felt was so annoyed by EVERY little thing that happened. Every time I was rooting for them or wanted a break emotionally, something else hits the fan. And yeah, bad things happen irl but shit even the dog.. like why kill the damn dog?!?!? RIP Mushroom, you should of just been left at the damn store. 

Anyway, I am so sorry for this rant cause like I said, I really wanted to love this game too. But I don't. It was EXHAUSTING. I felt exhausted playing this and wanted it to be over.

Oh, and could they of just started each episode without the full wolf brothers story? Maybe just add on the new piece to the story instead of retelling it from the beginning?
THAT WAS SO ANNOYING TO ME >_<

ANYWAY, okay I'm done lol tata"
220,
221,"cool lol
"
222,"played 1 episode, its quite different from the first one but very damn fun, bought the whole bundle now, definetley worth playing. I like how they have included subjects like racism tooo"
223,"i love the lis series but finishing this one now will give me a month of sadness
"
224,"Though the gameplay gimmick isn't nearly as interesting as LiS1, I think the story's themes are not as... difficult to grapple with. And there's a much stronger emphasis on relationship (sibling, this time). And the writers have clearly changed hands because the dialog is no longer cringe and not what teens would say."
225,"Overall I do recommend this game, specially if you liked the first part and these kind of storyteller games with some decisions involved. I did like many things but I also disliked many others. In general it does not live up with the expectations after the gorgeous first part (both the main game and before the storm). 
- Things I liked: The OST is very good, although not as good as the first game, it has some good pieces. The voicing and acting is pretty good as well, there is a great variety of scenarios and characters. The possibilities with the different endings is better than in the original game. 
- Things I did not like: The story is entertaining but nowhere near as good as the first game. Although there are many characters most are just temporal, forgettable and/or irrelevant for the story no matter how you interact with them. In the first game most characters where relatable, had personality or where very important for the story, not the case here except counted exceptions. Your relationship with Daniel is weird as you are supposed to train him, but more often than not it does not matter at all what you try to do, he will end up doing whatever he likes (although everything pays off at the very end, depending on how you tackle some situations, Daniel will be more willing or not to do certain things). Although you can use Daniel's power form time to time, its usage is mostly irrelevant and underused to be honest. The worst part is the feeling that 90% of the time irrespective of the choices you make to try to avoid certain situations they will end up happening no matter what. For instance, you are trying your best to do the right thing, steering away of dangerous situations, keep a low profile, not exposing yourself, leaving out some interesting things that could be done so as to keep you safe etc...and in the end the bad things end up happening anyway. Sometimes, you are ""asked"" 2-3 times if you want to do A or B. Well, even if you choose A every time, B will end up happening, which is very frustrating, the game gives you the false sensation that you get to choose what will happen (or not) next, when in reality everything is scripted and will happen irrespective of your choices. Why then making you choose? It was not like this in the first game...
In summary, if you like this type of game you can safely play this one as it has its moments, but in my opinion it is worse than the original LiS in every aspect. Still enjoyable."
226,"Despite the cringe, I had a great time playing Life is Strange 1. This, however... Man. Great concept, strong theme, beautiful in some ways, but way too dull and anti-climactic. I felt the game was just a montage of cutscenes with some walking and talking inbetween. Too many tiresome tasks and pointless interactions."
227,Truly heartbreaking
228,"Have loved the series ever since I first played LiS1. Finally got around to playing this one. Really enjoyed it.
Hits the emotions different than LiS1 and LiS:BtS did. Different hard hitting themes to it as well.
Like LiS1 more though.
"
229,A heart breaking/heart warming game. I enjoyed the story more than the first one actually...maybe because I'm the older sibling
230,"favorite game ever
"
231,"One of the best experiences I've had playing a game. The life is strange series is truly something special. I did, unfortunately, get a not-so-happy ending (not spoiling anything) But the journey of this game, the lessons that were made i will never forget. The same goes with the first game. Again truly amazing"
232,"nothing can beat the great gaming experience of the LIS franchise

now I'll be returning to Skyrim"
233,"I've played through this game in its entirety twice now, and full-on sobbed at the end each time. I like the other Life Is Strange games, but this one is definitely my favorite. It has much more content and story too it, and I feel that the characters (especially the main ones, Sean and Daniel) are easy to get attached to and make you want to root for them. If you like emotional story games where your choices have a real impact on not only the main character, Sean, but his brother, Daniel, you will love this game."
234,"Life is Strange is a game like no other. The story line of the Diaz brothers show the stronger connection they build on the way while facing the tragic event's that happened in Seattle. You make the choices in the game, whatever choice that can bring a good or bad effect to the story line. If you enjoy story games, then this is the game for you."
235,veri veri good heart touching game
236,PLAY IT !!!!!!!
237,WOW what an amazing game!! I truly and deeply loved this story. The bond between the brothers was so strong and had me emotional all throughout. I cannot recommend this game enough. 10/10
238,kinda shit but playable
239,"this game was emotional damage
i've never cared more about a fictional character"
240,Such an emotional game i really love the story The special relationship between two brothers It was a very unique experience
241,"The worst game from the franchise yet, the ending feels pointless, the story is pointless, and the over the top non metaphorical politics are just too much. Really poor game."
242,i cried and then i cried and then i cried and then i cried and then i cried and then i ate some ravioli and then i cried and then i cried and then i kissed a boy and then i cried
243,"I am a 56 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing LIFE IS STRANGE 2. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son recently started playing LIFE IS STRANGE. After less than a week, he already had 20 hours of playtime. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my Son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so i was quite lost. I asked my Son for help and together we spend hours playing LIFE IS STRANGE. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my Son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. LIFE IS STRANGE reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
244,"Extremely touching, i want to save them all. ill try my best"
245,ok
246,This game is masterpiece. I cried the every emotianal big brother and brother scene. BUY THIS GAME
247,.
248,"A well-executed game, though I think the idea of a road trip was a poor one. It meant that the supporting characters never got enough attention, since they were always left behind. 
Also, the game is not quite as radically left-wing biased as sometimes claimed. The opinions expressed are usually those of the characters themselves and need not be accepted by the players. There are quite a few sympathetic conservative characters. And perhaps most importantly, when the main characters are mistreated it is usually because they have either deserved it or because there is good reason to believe they have deserved it."
249,"Very nice game, was cool to play it in couple."
250,Great game just I wish we could've seen the one and only Max Caulfield !!
251,Story based games like these are interesting
252,best life is strange possibly. a blend of the first and the third and reminded me of a childhood fantasy :)
253,LOVEEEEE this game so much definitely one of my favorite. if you liked life is strange 1 this is a must play and to be honest even if you haven't i still very much reccomend playing 100% worth the money
254,"Very much like the previous Life is Strange game this one is an emotional roller coaster. You start out as a jerk brother that seems to only care about himself, so your a normal teenager. As the game progresses and you make your choices the game had a way of making me feel like a shit brother and honestly made me cry a few times and probably gave me a bit of depression. Unlike the first game your choices do effect the ending of this time and there are multiple endings that can happen depending on your choices. Definitely a must play and if you don't think so download the demo and try it for yourself."
255,i love this game and all it brings from its raw emotion to suspension its overall one of my favorite games
256,Great game with amazing world building and I absolutely love the art style. Worth playing.
257,"I don't know man, story side this one isn't catching me, i feel like it just lacks.. engagement? concept is too broad for me, found it hard to relate. Take my comment as a grain of salt, unfortunately this ain't it, simply said."
258,OK-ish
259,"I really enjoyed playing this. It told some really nice stories of brotherhood and youth. I went into the game not expecting much; I figured it'd have the same cliche and story-telling skills the first game had. They did an awesome job making Sean and Daniel feel realistic as the protagonists. I had a lot of fun seeing how my choices would affect the story line, as well as soaking in the details of the world - hell, i probably clicked ""Look"" on every single item that I could. 
   
This game was great for making me feel relaxed, despite everything that was going on. It was great for the first three episodes... but I think it truly shined during the last two, as I saw everything come to completion and the brothers come to trust each other. The ending that I got was bittersweet and so much more satisfying than I expected. I really enjoyed this! If you're looking for something to get into for a bit, this could be it."
260,"its an awesome game, and it keeps giving me chills!"
261,Very fun and awesome game :)
262,yes very good >:)
263,G
264,"A worthwhile adventure with plenty of beautifully heart-wrenching moments. I've come to be attached to the characters, they're very well developed and the dynamics are solid. This game will definitely stick with me for a long while."
265,I'll always love Sean.
266,dfdsfsdf
267,"HOLY FUCK THIS GAME MID
TOP 10 MOST BORING GAMES 
LIS>>>>>>>>>LIS2"
268,i really love the story line!! you can empathise really well and actually feel conflicted when the choice is up to you
269,"LIS 2 came out in a period when so many of us were pulled into the culture war and both political Left and Right were left frustrated and at each other's throats. When I first played this I was so anti-woke, that the racial parts and any mention of LGBT+++ subject matter made me cringe. I quit on the last chapter, and could not stomach the game enough to continue.

Fast forward to now where my viewpoints are much more nuanced and apolitical: something told me to go back to this game. I told myself I would just try to not let the ""woke"" parts bother me so much and since I knew what to expect, I felt more encouraged to play through again to try to enjoy the story as a whole. 

I'm so glad I did. This is an incredible game with such attention to detail. It also tries its best to be honest with the racial subject matter. It is not simply demonizing one race as our news media tends to do today. You meet diverse people who serve both as help and a hindrance along the way. Make no mistake, the choices do matter in this game. On top of that, because you are Sean who is teaching Daniel, moral choices can change the way Daniel acts even down the same decision path. This is next level when it comes to narrative games.

LIS2 is more refined than the beloved original, and takes more risks in being raw compared to LIS3. The story can be intense and relentless at times, and will rip your heart out in the end."
270,Great Game
271,󠀡󠀡
272,"Worth the money! I really like how this installment have more endings than the previous one, and how the brothers interact is realistic and grounded. If you liked the first one you'll like this one too!"
273,"Worthy sequel to the first Life is Strange.

8.75/10"
274,Great story driven game and shows how not only in the game but shows how life is and can be!
275,Good music and some characters are okay but too political and repetitive in that.
276,"Como sempre a franquia que nunca deixa a desejar. O jogo é caro, mas contando com a arte, equipe de design, roteiro, trilha sonora, vale muito apena. 
Os artistas que compõe essa obra fazem dela uma obra-prima de modo que você se sente imerso e parte da história. Vivendo pelos olhos do protagonista Sean, um adolescente em contato com a arte (e isso vai dar um interesse forte na jogabilidade), que passa por uma experiência traumatizante ao lado de seu irmão, Daniel.
Aqui as emoções são a flor da pele a todo momento, você sente a angústia, ansiedade, tristeza, felicidade e todos os momentos de um adolescente em transição para a vida ""adulta"" onde é preciso lidar com as novas responsabilidade e por um certo motivo, tudo isso fica muito mais intenso.

Diferente do primeiro jogo de Life is Strange, o universo aqui tem uma ambientação completamente diferente e dessa vez o ""poder sobrenatural"" que alinha as obras não é parte do nosso personagem. Trazendo uma dinâmica completamente diferente para a forma de jogar e também de lidar com as coisas.

É uma história tocante de irmãos e realmente consegue ser aconchegante e como em todo jogo, dramática na medida certa. Você vai querer chorar e sentir os impulsos melancólicos que são criados, o quão a realidade é dura, ela vai ser um murro muito forte aqui, talvez assim como Max teve que enfrentar a dor de lidar com o tempo e sua sensibilidade, existe um ""q"" amais a todo momento nesse jogo.

Adquirir esse jogo é ter a experiência imersiva e repleta de emoção, uma história que como faz parte da proposta, você constrói, joga, acessa, desmembra e se emociona."
277,its good to play this game but believe me its not like lis1 i mean for me it wasnt in to me lis1 is better than this
278,"the first episode was a solid and interesting start to the game however , the story was lukewarm at best past the 2nd episode , maybe it was because of the choices but, even still all choices should have some kind of hook to keep things good , overall totally would not recommend."
279,This game is beautiful and will break you.
280,Fav <3
281,the game is good the graphic is fine and the story is not bad it's great definitly 8/10 nice game
282,"Life is strange 2 is a lot more mature than the first game, and I love it. An absolute masterpiece!"
283,"ahoooooo
"
284,"I don't usually post reviews but as a massive fan of the LiS franchise, I had to.

This game is TERRIBLE. The story doesn't make sense, and so do the characters' choices. They're also very bland, the big brother is extra boring, and don't even get me started on how disgustingly dumb and annoying the little brother is. Unlike the first LiS game, there's a massive lack of fun little puzzles or small choices that make the universe more immersive. Also, due to how the story is written, it's impossible to get attached to any character since they don't last more than one episode.

Most importantly, the choices DON'T MATTER ! I was asked 3 times if I would allow my little brother to do a specific thing, said no all three times, and yet they still did it. What the fuck ? That's also something that reoccurs everytime, I could press random choices and the story would still be the exact same.

I still gave the game the benefit of the doubt, but even after finishing it and getting all the achievements, I think it sucks and is VERY BADLY written. A kid's movie could make more sense than this. Don't waste your money.

I'll point out the only thing i found good : I like how it talks about how problematic racism is and how incompetent and violent the police is."
285,Just no.
286,I loved LiS so I had to play LiS 2 and I loved it as well!
287,very moving game.  very emotional and realistic.  great graphics and gameplay.  10/10
288,it is a strange game indeed
289,"We do not get to see the whole adventure that main characters are going through and it causes the player to not always catch up with the characters. After every episode there is a time skip. Before you start a new episode, you start to relate or like a character and then that time skip messes everything up. Characters start to act differently after those time skips. It is natural for someone to change as time passes, but it leaves the player out of a part of the experience and makes the characters a bit unlikeable. 
Other than that there was moments I really enjoyed. I still liked this game but not as much as the first one. 
In the first one player is always a part of Max's journey even if she jumps in time. Because she is also just as confused and clueless as the player."
290,"Coming into this game only really knowing what happened in Episode One, this game has far exceeded (and subverted some of) my expectations in all of the the following episodes. It was a lot fun watching every character develop and feeling connected/attached to them. It did feel like your choices had a bigger impact on the story and ending than the first game. Loved the music and how the game rewarded you for exploring. It was always interesting at the end of each episode when browsing the choices statistics being like ""wait, you could do that?"" The money system did seem a bit pointless at times (save for one or two scenes), with the amount of money you have bouncing all around from episode to episode, or even scene to scene. Wished we could have gotten to know some of the characters a bit more. All in all though, amazing game."
291,Worth every little thing! Even more worth it with having played Life is Strange 1 before!
292,"I loved the first game, but this one-- has got to be my fave. I cannot keep this game out of my mind. I asked my sister to play this since I've watched numbers of playthroughs already when it came out. I sat along her side the whole series and we both found ourselves bawling in the middle of the night as we finish it. I thought I was emotionally prepared and got no tears left to cry for it's been more than a year since I've last seen the game. But I cried worse than before because someone else was also crying next to me lol. We somehow got emotionally attached to the characters. 

LiS2 gives me a pit in the stomach every time I think about it. My sensitive side just turns out for this game.

Another thing is the soundtrack- the ambient tracks matched with the beautiful sceneries of nature- [i]Mi encanta[/i]. I listen to it sometimes and I can't help but tear up because of the memories it reminded me of. It's something I'd definitely plug on road trips and mountain hikes.

One of my favorite parts of the game is whenever Sean sits and draws for awhile, it's so relaxing and the art is just gorgeous! I'd pay money for Sean's journal >_>

I wish I could just wipe my memory and play this game all over again.
ps. [spoiler]Yo! Sean is the man bro T^T he's been through so much. It's so sad that in those different endings, it's either you get: depressed Sean, dark Sean, separated Sean, or dead Sean. WTH[/spoiler]"
293,Boring as hell. No wonder why this game is free.
294,"I piss off Daniel as much as possible but then man Sean is a very good character cause he misses eye like pirate arggggg

all jokes aside an amazing game"
295,AMAZING NO WORDS.
296,"This game is the first game I’ve played on a theme like this, and I have to say it changed my view of the world, the first time I was so attached to the characters in the game and the story. A masterpiece of a story, well-written characters, exciting and sad endings. Here it is shown that every decision you make is important and can bring consequences in further play. The more the story flowed, the more exciting and interesting it became. I was very attached to Sean, I liked the way he always took care of his brother, at all costs. Such masterpieces are rarely seen and appreciated in our community. Would play again, miss you wolf brothers."
297,"What. An. Amazing. Journey.
I've waited for so long before playing to LiS 2 because I was scared it wouldn't be as good as LiS 1, but I was so, so, wrong. This game definitely teaches valuable lessons about life. The kind of things you don't understand until you are old enough or have seen some shit.
However, there is one thing I've really disliked: [spoiler]the last 30mn of playing are a complete non sense for me, it felt like useless drama.[/spoiler] 
But I still recommend this game because imo it's a masterpiece amongst narrative games."
298,Sean & Daniel :3
299,<3
300,"First of all, let me get out of the way that I'm not the best person to review Life is Strange 2 as I am someone who has not played LiS 1. 
But I still want to give out my opinion on the Diaz's journey, specially after spending almost 16 hours with both of them and having finished it minutes ago.
The game is amazing. Yes, it does contain many political aspects as other reviews state. Yes, perhaps the storyline could be better. But what did it for me was the music, visuals, and contrary to other's opinions, the characters. Maybe for me, as someone younger, less mature, and with Hispanic background it was easier to resonate with these characters. However, throughout the journey I grew attached to the relationship between Sean and Daniel, and honestly I could not help but look forward to the next interaction between them two, whether it be a stupid board game or running away from cops in tense moments. I will note that the advice given by the adults does seem relatively irresponsible and forced to move the plot forward, but I for one did not care as I enjoyed the game's bizarre storyline.
Overall, although the game does have areas that are not perfect, what is done well makes it worth it.

 However, as I mentioned, I am not a perfect reviewer for this game due to inexperience in the genre (or maybe any game at all) but I do think it is worth giving it a shot, even more with Episode 1 being F2P. 
All I can say is after playing the first Episodes, I had already bought every other LiS game, which is what I will be playing now. Perhaps my opinion on this game will change after playing the other games from the franchise, but this is my current stand on the game."
301,Loved this game.
302,"Clumsy start, clumsy plot, clumsy story. Music is ded! And why is there political propaganda here srsly?
Trust me you rather play LIS 1 again 3 time and still not wanting to touch this game."
303,yes
304,"Excellent adventure about two brothers who are on the run, after their dad and a cop accidently got killed. The pacing is a bit too slow for my taste and there are some useless fetch quests, but most of the story and characters are the best I've ever seen in a video game. My favorite are the companions in chapter 3; they are SO incredibly well designed! I even wished I could live with these guys for a few weeks! 

On the other hand, chapter 4 (the church) was a huge disappointment for me. The events and characters are cliché, and the weird ending isn't exciting at all. Luckily the last chapter is great again and the finale gave me goosebumps. Life is Strange 2 is not perfect, but it does so many things right that it's definitely worth playing. Very recommended!"
305,panders too much to left wing politics and has a mediocre storyline that is far inferior to OG life is strange
306,I cried
307,I almost cry when Sean eats the chocolate bar
308,"Only play for 1 episoode, but i already watch other people walkthrought, so i kinda recommend this game but its missing something from the original game.
Overall story decent enough, the Voice Actor is good"
309,"Really lovely game and the story was so fucking good too!
Mushroom was adorable<3"
310,very good
311,Flee America Simulator 2022
312,"Best in the series imo. You'll hate it sometimes, and you'll love it just as much. Angry one minute, and crying with joy the next. It's a long ride for sure, but one that is worth it in the end."
313,Fun.
314,i cry
315,Hands down the best single-player game I've ever played!
316,"It's a great game and provides a similar gameplay experience to its predecessor. Going into this, people told me it's a boring game, but I disagree. The story progresses slowly perhaps, but each episode tells another tale within the main story arch. 

Unfortunately I didn't really connect with the main characters, and so many scenes weren't as impactful as intended. Nevertheless it was great to meet new people and even see some old faces and places! 

What I think was really cool was going from Seattle to Arizona and everything in between and getting to see all these cool, different places and meeting nice - and not so nice - people along the way. 

I would definitely recommend the first game over this one, however if you want more Life is Strange, then this is a fun follow up game to play."
317,Good game
318,"I've played the first two episodes. The Life is Strange series of games is supposed to be character-driven, but this game fails at developing a close bond between the two main characters. The pacing of the story overall is terrible, as the most action and tension is present at the beginning, and afterwards the game is fairly stale. Life is Strange 1 is so much better, this game does not live up to the expectations of being a sequel game to the first title."
319,"Not amazing as the first game, but still a great game and story and yes where is some BS moments in the game."
320,peguei depressao
321,hella amazeballs!!!
322,love it
323,<3
324,Gave me a month of depression!
325,cool
326,This game broke my heart.
327,very good
328,"This game is so beautiful and touching. Most sequels to successful franchises are not that good but in my opinion Life is Strange 2 does an excellent job expanding the universe! The bond between the brothers is well developed and you really feel for them throughout the game, not just because they're brothers and you have to, but because their relationship is developed properly.  The voice acting in this game is terrific and you can really feel the emotion. Sean is a well written character and his relationship with his father has to be one of my favorites. Daniel is also a lovable character and seeing his character grow up throughout the game is bittersweet. This game is well paced and contains special moments between the characters such as hiking together, solving puzzles, and many more (I enjoy the little things).  The soundtrack of Life Is Strange 2 is my all time favorite of any video game I've ever played. There wasn't really anything that bothered me about this game and I really enjoyed it.  These brothers have to be my favorite duo in the entire franchise of Life is Strange. I highly recommend this game. A masterpiece!"
329,Wow.. I'm speechless.. Great game !
330,very good yes yes
331,Can we get part three of it? heheh...
332,"made me cry, good game"
333,"So... Life is Strange... Again.

Bottom line up front - yes. The dev team definitely pulled it off again. It is still an emotional journey that is extremely grounded in reality. Unlike the shit wave of modern Hollywood blockbusters, this story actually explores the supernatural very well. However, some episodes are much stronger than others.

Things that are done extremely well:
Overall sense of journey and extraordinary circumstance. The game doesn't rush to advance the plot line. The world is rich enough in settings and conversations to let you really take it in. The level design (environments) are absolutely incredible. Some of the best work I've ever seen in a video game.

Things that I'm not super stoked about:
The supposed ""choice"" game actually offers you a lot of false choices. Let me explain. In the first game there really wasn't such thing as a right or wrong choice. In this game there is. One of the endings is heavily affected by morality, which in many cases throughout the game is presented in a strange way. Like you're forced to pick between being a good brother, or setting the right example. A lot of plot lines are forced. Like you can make several hard choices in a row to prevent something shitty from happening, and then it happens anyway, because that's how it's written. It feels like some parts of the game were written by different people. There is a lot of complex themes that are being explored in a very mature way, and then you get hit with some very shallow political messaging. It's almost like the devs don't trust the player to be intelligent enough, so they can't risk being subtle. Basically the villains are extremely one dimensional.

On the technical side - let me repeat again. The environments are mind blowing. Whoever is the level designer is like a damn Roger Deakins of video games. Sound design on the other hand has a lot of room for improvement. The ambient sound is done very well. The locations definitely live and feel real. But the dialogs sound like they are just studio recordings, and do not at all fit the environment. If you've ever been in the forest at night - you would immediately notice that."
334,"Emotional , mature and fun , all nicely wrapped together."
335,Underwhelming.
336,Cool adventure.
337,"So far so good, finished Episode 1 and looking forward to the seonds one. Very emotional and no more, no less on the same level as LiS1."
338,"  I didn't enjoy this game as much as Life is Strange, I just didn't full connect with the characters.  I did like the notebook drawing angle, and going back to read it.  It was just an ok game, but would never play again."
339,Yah it fantastic >8(y
340,YES!!!!!
341,"I've never cared more about an npc in my entire life.
This game will break you.

Edit: It's been a month and I still think about them!
This game broke my heart."
342,gay haha
343,"Hands down, the most emotional story out of them all, and for that I give this a fully fledged thumbs up on my recommendation list. 

Life is Strange 2 tackles alot more political and real life stories, like racism, prejudice, teenagers getting thrown into ""adult life"" in the blink of an eye.. It's alot to take in, and it's a very emotional journey. 

The game overall has less feeling of ""community"" that Arcadia Bay had in LiS 1, or Haven Springs in True Colors, but you meet alot of interesting people, you get attached just enough before you have to do something else. It's heartbreaking, and you're on the edge because you never know if you'll ever see them again or what the future holds for Sean and Daniel. 

The OST is absolutely beautiful, the places you visit all have its own charm, no matter how dark the backstory of the place is, and it really brings out some hard decisions. This is the one game I really, really want to experience again and again to get different endings (From all I know, there's 4.5 different endings, where one of the endings have a slight variation depending on what you did in previous episodes) and it makes everything up until the very last choice very impactful, as every decision up to that will deter between 2 endings, where as different decisions through the game impact if you'll get the other 2 endings with the choices made. 

It's such a beautiful, but heartbreaking story. It's beautiful in a very sad way, if that makes sense. 

PROS: 
- Beautiful OST. The music really sets the mood in this game. 
- Great variation of different characters you meet. 
- Decisions really matter in this game, up until the last decision
- While at times, you get annoyed by your little brother, you really get a feeling of brotherhood.
- Character developement. You see a strong development throughout the entire game
- Pacing is slower, which means alot more emotional narrative at times where it's needed. 

CONS:
- The power can feel under utilized at times, and overall doesn't feel as impactful as the other games
- Some ""timed"" decisions doesn't show a timer, so at times you might miss out on answering due to not actually knowing it was timed or not.

Overall, I don't understand how people can throw this game under the bus. 10/10 experience for sure."
344,"With Life is Strange 2, Dontnod throw away absolutely everything new and unique about LiS1 to present a pretentious, ponderous, heavy-handed ""choices DON'T matter"" game that clings to the stale Telltale formula like a security blanket.  Don't bother trying to make wise choices, the game sets out to screw you over at every possible opportunity - while trying to convince you to feel guilty when your choices INEVITABLY lead to tragedy.  The bland central characters, episodic story, contrived twists, and lack of compelling side characters all add up to a genuinely weak narrative adventure that can only be recommended to those utterly hooked on the format.  Otherwise, play pretty much anything else from the LiS-verse, or from Dontnod, before this one."
345,"Nothing but pain... the amount of pain the MC gone through is insane
I came here to play this game to chill 
not to get depressed -_-"
346,"good story plot, a different twist in terms of characters and storyline compared to the first game yeet"
347,"i loved this game but goddamn did it make my anxiety go BRRR

i got the redemption ending and i cried so much. this game is amazing but damn its a tragedy."
348,"makes me cry every time, i would die for the diaz brothers"
349,"Life Is Strange 2 is easily the most interesting in the franchise. The plot somehow managed to keep you awake long enough to make sure you pay attention when they send hamfisted racist stereotypes at your face and expect you to believe it's deep.

Overall it is a good game, but as a Mexican myself I hate the way they went about portraying the racism in America towards them. But if you're looking for a decent way to kill 14 hours and you want to try the game I wouldn't pay more than 15 for it."
350,Its a very good story and i 100% recommend it
351,"While it's quite different in tone and subject matter compared to its predecessor, Life is Strange 2 is fantastic and emotional story-driven experience that hits its stride far more often than it stumbles. Sean and Daniel's journey is one that'll probably stick with you for a while. While there are some moments that feel like the outcome is the same no matter your choices, you'll find the narrative changing in subtle yet noticeable ways depending on your actions, at least more so than in the previous game."
352,The first was better
353,"Wistful Musings 2:   ̶E̶l̶e̶c̶t̶r̶i̶c̶ ̶B̶o̶o̶g̶a̶l̶o̶o̶   America Sucks so lets go TO Mexico instead.
(Also I need to brag that I got my character laid in my first playthough  no guides or walkthroughs.  Your welcome, Sean.)

Wow, quite the story.  This plot has some interesting new characters with an odd cameo later on.  Not as much of a fast pace as the first game but lots of drama and tearjerking moments which is expected of this franchise. The main duo deals with a LOT of hardships, so if you are sensitive to the suffering of others, this might be difficult for you to get through.  Or maybe you arent remotely sensitive to the suffering of others and consider the game ""too political"" which is a dog-whistle for certain kinds of people who dont like stuff in their gaming having to deal with people that are different from them or dont like that they have to care about situations that do in fact exist. Not political enough I say!

Anyway, I really liked this one and its just as good and worth playing as the others.  It really opened up my eyes and my mind to the plight of immigrants, the abuse of authority and forgiveness.  Youll find yourself wanting to come back and see how things change with your decisions.  I like checking the percentages to see how many people chose what I chose, then I choose the least picked option just for the heck of it on my next playthroughs, heh.

Cant wait to play True Colors once I can afford it."
354,"===============================================================
Bom depois de finalizar Life is Strange: True Colors , Life is Strange 1, é agora finalizar o 2 que o episódio 1 já me deixou ainda mais apaixonado pela franquia, me deixou um pouco decepcionado,Bom os irmão são uma parada muito foda!
===============================================================
Daniel Diaz é muito legal um garoto que não tem problemas no começo você sé apega muito fácil a sua Personalidade  é criatividade, gostei muito dele um garoto muito gentio e inteligente com uma a Imaginação  incrivel você quer fazer tudo oque ele pede tudo, muito bom a alegria e a paz que o personagem te traz muito legal a interação dos dois.
===============================================================
Sean Diaz cara no começo vemos um jovem que sabe oque ele quer, você criando a sua sua Personalidade ao longo do jogo, suas escolas afetam muito a interação dele com o Daniel, ele sabe que sé conta sobre o seu irmão Ninguém vai acreditar é sabe que os dois vão ser entregues para adoção.
===============================================================
A historia desse game e praticamente ajudar os irmãos a Saírem do Pais para que tenha uma vida, já que seu Pais acaba falecendo por conta de um pequeno desentendimento com um Policial no início do game, e bem rápido, os dois acabam fugindo do local e deixa pra atras toda destruição que o Daniel acaba criando por conta do acontecimento, Sean vai para floresta tenta entender e digerir tudo que aconteceu, agora tenta busca um plano para siar do EUA ir para o México tenta ir para para a família do seu Pai, ate o momento sabemos que a Mae dos garotos abandonou os três, a historia e muito boa então não vou me aprofunda mais que isso, mais recomendo muito!! :)
===============================================================
Lyla Park cara uma personagem tão legal ela vem no inicio do game e te mostra uma amiga ate mais que amiga para o Sean uma personagem que na minha opinião foi muito mau aproveitada, ela no começo mostra muita preocupação com os 2 tentado intender tudo oque aconteceu é sé mostra disposta a ajudar o Sean e Daniel, eu sei que o sé o Sean Aceitasse a historia terminaria claro, tem escolhas especificas que você pode deixa ela ate em depressão profunda, as escolhas com ela no final do jogo com ela e muito ruim poderia ser melhor, quando você tem o final bom em que ela aparece vemos apenas um abraço entre ela e o Sean eu queria mias que um abraço afinal ela gosta muito do Sean é no final não vimos isso, opinião minha mais você tem mais 2 personagens que você pode ter um relacionamento ou não.
===============================================================
temos Cassidy e Finn são personagens que você pode ou não ter uma relação, mais eu não curtir muito os dois a Cassidy e a mais interessante ela que ajudar os Sean e Daniel, mais o Finn por outro lado sé mostra um cara que quer abusar dos poderes do Daniel é usar ele muitas das vezes achei ele meio chato é claro isso e a minha opinião, então não me aprofundei por que não achei muito interessante os 2 mais e sei que tem bastante influencia no final do game!! 
===============================================================
Por fim o que achei do jogo no geral e 8/10 gostei muito não e melhor que o  Life is Strange 1 que pra mim tem a melhor, mais todos os game são incrível ate o momento esta faltando só mais um game da franquia para eu zerar é life strange before the storm que pretendo compra quando entra em promoção!!

355,"LIS2 is definitely different from other titles in this series.

For this I think it gets a bad rap. Where LIS1 took place in 1 setting and allowed for the player to get to know and flesh out a large cast of characters, LIS2 never spent too much time focusing on one place, constantly moving forward with its setting & its side characters. Some think this is its weakness; I think this is its strength.

Forcing the player to put all their attention on Sean & Daniel's relationship makes for a large investment in its outcome and it makes the long journey and highly anticipated resolution all the more impactful. 

This game is definitely worth the play, especially for older siblings who don't mind a heavy handed approach to politics or very outdated teenager slang."
356,amizing lov it
357,"""Okay kid, don't open the door, I have told you multiple times to not open the door, so don't"". Opens the door anyways and the MC agrees. This game really likes to reassure to me that choices dont matter, so its main premise is out of the window. This game neither has drama or action or anything that would make my goblin brain fire on its synapses which makes it incredibly boring. The one thing this game does have though, is politics, and reminding me of how shit the world is. Overall this is a fucking terrible video game."
358,"Out of the three LiS games, this is truly the one that broke me emotionally, especially as someone who never had a brother. People seem to complain about it being it too political, racially connected, religious etc. but it's what make LiS 2 special and somehow connected to reality, while still maintaining the supernatural aspect of the game without it overwhelming the other parts of the story. And if you're into that kind of thing,
it gives the player a chance to roleplay with their values e.g Stealing, Killing, Hatred

11/10 Made me cry at the end.

359,i am in love with sean diaz
360,"ooof this is one of my favorite story games man i loved this story soo badly i want an 3th part! 2 brothers along. the fun about this is when there is super powers not like the other life is strange had super power im not sure if its because its 2 brother or because its fun i think its both and more i played this 2 times and finished it there is diffrent ways to finish the game by the options in the beggining, half way trough, the ends is great! i suggest you try this out and dont want an review or something its not worth asking about it you just need to get suprised from it, loved it soo much, well i suggest an 3th part of the 2 brother being older an continue!"
361,I wanna cry<3
362,"I liked LiS 1, even if it was far far away from my world. I enjoyed the trip. 
LiS 2 was very awkward. Even if I understood it was about two children lost in a ruthless world, I didn't appreciate some of the character's self-indulgence. It didn't feel right. It's not about the characters themself or the choices they make, it's the way the game tells us the story. 
[spoiler]Example : Mom left her children, no phone call, not a letter, nothing, but you can listen the lamest excuses known to men with sad music and all, so it's ok i guess ?[/spoiler]"

i love the characters and the adventure they face. Square Enix is amazing at environmental features and just environments in general. The voice tracking and human features definitely need more work but its still impressive improvement from life is strange 1."
366,An immensely beautiful interactive film. The story has more depth than LIS1. I would also recommend other titles from DONTNOD if you're into this kind of games.
367,Life is Strange 2 is a great game. It has many different endings depending on what choices you make. Very emotional game with a really good story and characters. Would definitely recommend!
368,Better than Lis1 and especially overrated Lis:True Colors! 9/10
369,"I have played all of the Life is Strange series including the 3rd one, ""True Colors"". I can definitely say that ""Life is Strange 2"" is by far the best title in the sequel. Besides being a great road trip adventure, you finally feel the choices you make really matter. The personality of the little brother Daniel and his bond with his older brother is shaped by the decisions you make, resulting in different outcomes (especially in the end). Political references are progressive but could be more subtle. In overall, it is a great experience."
370,"My honest review of Episode 1,
This game is amazing, but can be a little sad for some people, Im not going to spoil the episode, play it for yourself. But this game reminds me of when I lost my mom when i was only 11, I almost cried, but I made it through it.
Great game!"
371,"Steam Deck Review 

Story: 4.5/5 - An amazing story and narrative experience, where you really feel the world and characters be affected by your choices throughout the game, especially the way Daniel will feel at the end with the culmination of all your decisions playing into what happens at the end. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great story experience with choices 

Gameplay (When it worked): 4.5/5 - Super smooth, lots of ""exploring"" and paying attention to detail to open more choices and layers to the story

Gameplay (When it didn't work): 1/5 - I exclusively played on the Steam Deck so I'm not sure if this issue exists anywhere else, the game crashed a lot, only during ""cutscenes"" but far too often regardless of the graphic settings. It added a lot of unnecessary annoyance to the game, especially when you were forced to keep redoing your choices up from the last checkpoint/save to where it crashed. Definitely hurt my playing experience heavily

I would 100% recommend people who are into a strong narrative and immersive stories but play it anywhere except the steam deck"
372,I cryed on this game
373,"At first, this game was such a chore to go through. Initially, I very much disliked the younger brother. I was selfish, neglectful, and resentful of his behavior despite all efforts to ensure his safety, and that definitely effected my choices for Sean. After completing it. I had to really sit back and think about their situation and their ages to truly appreciate just how real and raw these characters and story lines were. 
For some, it's too easy to say that this game sucked and didn't live up to LiS. Looking deeper into it, I feel that it surpassed it, and I say that as an avid fan of the original game. I may not have cried for any of the endings in LiS:2 like I did for ""Bay over Bae"" in LiS, but the rest of the game brought me on such an emotional roller coaster, it definitely made up for it.
If you can't appreciate this game for all it's worth, you're really missing out."
374,I just love this Game. the charakters are so good and the story is fantastic.
375,masterpiece
376,I love playing this game on my free time :D
377,Awesome. Loved it !
378,"This game makes you want to vote for Trump, build the wall and deport illegals."
379,"Brilliant storyline, had me invested from the start more so than than first one. This was a unique perspective rather  than playing as a character that had the powers. Enjoyed every episode and eager to back to see what the other choices turn out like."
380,good
381,"A masterpiece, and a better game than the first (in my opinion). Play it!"
382,ePiSoDe 1 nOw FrEe!¡
383,A-fucking-mazing
384,"chill game, and nice story. just finished episode 1 and I like it!"
385,lil dood goes swoosh with powers and never listens
386,"Life is strange to is a visually stunning project. The Vast World to explore with the story makes it different to the previous installments which were more secluded to areas in a town. It doesn't get to the epicness when we talk about the super power of Daniel compared to Max, but still overall this is a must play. Episode 5 has the most stunning sceneries."

PLAY IT TO BECOME ALPHA FR FR"
390,"It was a very unique experience and one bloody emotional rollercoaster, but it was so worth it in the end. Really enjoyed the story and journey of the two wolfbrothers. AWOOOO!"
391,"[b] One of the worst gaming experiences of my life. [/b]
Life Is Strange 2 gives you an illusion of a choice, when in reality if something needs to happen for the sake of the plot, it will. (Examples: [spoiler] your brother wants to take a dog? You can refuse but the dog is going with you. You have a ""choice"" to steal food or not: you will be treated as a thief either way. Your brother wants to go to Christmas market WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE; you are going there no matter what you say. Your brother wants to break into a closed room - you can be against it but you will still take him there. Got the idea? [/spoiler]) Daniel (our little brother) is infuriating and poorly written, ""racism is bad""- narrative is constantly being shoved down your throat, and the situations you find yourself in become more and more ridiculous and unbelievable with every chapter. Good things about this game? The music and the visuals. 
Don't waste your money."

399,This is one of the most emotionally riveting games I've ever played and I can't recommend it enough.
400,MAN.

402,MTO FODA RECOMENDO #JOGUEM
403,"10/10 for storyline, graphics, and almost everything else about this game.

0/10 for not working as a Family Share game. It's literally the only game I care about having as a shared game, but it refuses to behave properly. This has made purchasing this game a second time feel more like an expensive convenience fee instead of a willing, desired purchase. Yes, I know that there is a hacky work around involving the other family member reinstalling the game on this computer then deleting the free episode from my library, but it didn't work. Twice. So I'm begrudgingly buying it a second time because why not, right? I don't know if this family sharing problem is a game dev issue, or a steam issue, but it sucks."
404,"It hurts. This game really hurts in the heart.

This game tells a heartbreaking but also bittersweet story about brotherhood and moral. And that is the real question you should tell yourself after playing the game:
What would you do to survive something out of your control and also protect someone dear to you which is vulnerable? Do you rate yourself over others to achieve your goals, NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE? There is no correct answer here. Like there is no correct ending in this game."
405,"I honestly really enjoyed this game. For me it is definitely on par with the first game and I'd give it a solid 9.5/10. I kind of regret watching Jacksepticeyes playthrough before getting a chance to play myself as it ruined a few surprises and made it less impactful so I'd recommend going in blind. While I do agree that Daniel can be very annoying and ruin everything, overall I didn't mind too much as everything else made up for it. Great soundtrack, choices actually have a large impact on the ending and very nice characters, environment and pacing. Good contrast of calm moments and intense ones. So pick it up on sale if you can, but nevertheless a good purchase."
406,"I just finished episode 4 and I think it's a good game like last one! I cried sometimes...

BUT if you don't want to watch too many story scenes and prefer to do something by yourself, it won't be very interesting. I still recommend it!"

408,"Saved all potential love interests in hopes of a sequel that will likely never happen, and ended up killing myself in the end via just enough bad choices.
Well played game, well played."
409,Good story.
410,"anti-2016 ""build the wall"" propaganda, and that on it's own is enough to buy it. buy it and piss off some pissboy magas :)"
411,"I didn't think I liked games of this ganre that much before I see this game but when I saw and I started playing it and then I rolled it, oh man this game is amazing and everyone needs to play it! It can tell you much, this is all I can say!"
412,"Didnt even finish it. Nothing much interesting happened, it was like one major event at the start to pull you in, and then basically a walking/running simulator with an annoying child. Also you dont even have a power, the child does and barely even uses it. Was just boring and unrelatable. Maybe it gets better.
Maybe its because of the male protagonist, or just the characters were that bad. The other games stuck with me, this one I couldnt even bother to finish it."
413,The Game is depressing but hits different love it so much its like playing the movie with your own choices to see how it affects you and how it all plays out they both went through so much its a definite recommendation. i keep replaying it on each console i get.
414,I cant lie this is one of the  greatest story games ive played in a while the creators put so much effort into this game so much detail and theres so many little things in the game. its a 10/10 game i would 100% recommend this game to anyone
415,8
416,"remember the fun part of LiS1 where you had time powers so you could rewind time and test out multiple choices AND see their consequences? 

yeah, you have no powers in this game and your annoying little dipshit brother is the one having all the fun, not to mention making the stupidest choices.
  
it feels like every episode is separated from one another, with no recurring or continuing characters, no compelling overarching story. things just kinda happen.

you built up so many characters in episodes 1 and 2. where tf did they all go?

LiS 1 must've been a fluke because they took out every aspect that made that game great from this game.

Tumblr level of storytelling.
Graphics are sweet.

the ""racism bad"" recurring theme interesting, but it's hamfisted and should've be fleshed out more.

So many boring mini scenes tone setting scenes that feel like they're just flexing their game world (which you can barely explore).

for $14 it's not too bad

WOLF GANG AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
417,Don't buy this. It's not half as good as the first game. Simply bad
418,"nice game 
"
419,I like the game but compare to the previous series this one is quite depressing trough the journey. Graphic is nice thought.
420,"Definitely the best LiS game in the collection - none of the endings feel ""good"" but that's kind of the point of the story, nothing is ever perfect there's no perfect ending to the story, just whichever one feels right according to the road you took. Love Sean and Daniel - wish we could have more of their story."

422,very good i like
423,"Like most people, including myself, you will likely get in your feelings playing this game.
The games art is special and something you need to experience for yourself.
The game can get super cheesy, but that's the charm of the game.

This is still my favorite game franchise without a doubt.

424,"These series are incredible, and for those that like the decision-making to change the story-type games, it's a most have."
425,this is the best game i ever played
426,"It's a Great Game
"
427,"It's a movie-game, a really good one. You mostly watch cutscenes and get to make some choices at pivotal moments. There's some exploration involved in the areas that you do get to move around in, and that can affect the story as you go. I'd say the story is better, it's much more impactful and memorable, than the first Life is Strange tho the gameplay isn't quite as fun without the time travel ability. It felt like watching a really good indie film about the journey of two brothers learning to live on their own and find their way in life. You have a good amount of control over how their lives are shaped thru the course of the journey and that's pretty awesome to see as it recaps your choices for you at the end of each chapter."
428,"I haven't have a game swing me around emotionally.
If you want to get depressed and smile at the same time this game is for you."
429,"Life is Strange and Before the storm are some of the best games I've played, but this game was good/bad. The end of episode 3 killed it for me, When Daniel hurt Cassidy for no reason i cared a lot less for Daniel because it was unrealistic if he liked Lyla and i never saw more of her which would make a better story, i also would have wanted to see Layla more in the game it was a loss of drama and action. And that Daniel was sorry about almost getting everyone killed and then did not follow Sean when he was in a cult made me wanna leave him there. Karen was a bad character too. She let the cult guy hit Sean and did literally nothing to help or show some kind of remorse for leaving him. I didn't relate to much to Sean's emotions and it just felt forced. The everyone is gay agenda also seemed a bit forced. In the earlier games i didn't mind it but you can put it in a less forced way if you really feel like everyone should be gay. Sean was a great character though and it was a missed opportunity of giving him a power later didn't need to be story breaking but just something. The ending was somewhat good and would like to see a follow up with Lyla and Cassidy. But it has a potential for a follow up for sure. Overall until Season 3 the game was good, i don't know if i will buy True Colors, its seems forced too. I'm sure that in the future there will be better games but they are yet to prove that."
430,"Awesome game, story, graphics, characters.. as ever :)"
431,"Story is not good as first Life is strange, kinda little boring.

But its pretty fun to mess up with the choices to see what will happened LOL. We just travel around to ruin everyone's life.

Life is Strange 2 -- Evil Brothers"
432,I just completed the game with all of the achievements unlocked and I had a good time every step of the way while there is not so much to talk about in the gameplay because its a choice based story game but the story is without a doubt one of the best stories I experienced in a videogame its emotional its fun and it has excellent character writing I would definitely recommend you play this game and follow Sean and Daniel's story to the very end just play the first episode that is currently free and you will know what I'm talking about ...
433,"The story is very good. Nice narrative for each interaction and very good voiceovers. The storyline is unique and you will love the characters. Sean and Daniel are two brothers looking out for each other and as Sean, your job is to make sure Daniel is raised good or bad. Most of the story interactions fall onto the two. Other details such as cinematography, audios and the gameplay are awesome.

One of the things I noticed in Life is Strange 2 is the potential to have a lot more interactions with minor characters. The only problem I had was the lack of interactions with your wanted characters, may it be Cassidy, Finn, or Lyla. While it is understandable in the story the two main characters have a goal they want to achieve, personally I think that the writers should have thought of not leaving the country and keeping a low profile due to the incident instead. That way, Sean can enjoy much more time with other people. While it is understandable - that Sean is the main character you control and Daniel is the one with the ability, I would honestly think it would be better to have more alternative endings especially with Sean and the relationships. It is unfortunate that the minor characters do not have a lot of showcase especially on any ending available in the game. Still the story and the voice acting is enough to make you ride a rollercoaster of emotions.

Once you play this game, you will not regret it. The only cons are the storyline above that I have mentioned (although did not give much detail to it). Plus, if you only have limited storage place, you can uninstall each episode and download a new episode to save space. Overall 8/10."
434,"Hard choices always and how it affects to the story in long term! Can be so happy and heartbroken at the same time, but love all about this game like beautiful sceneries, words, people (sometime suck ones) and our experiences brings to the ends."
435,"Only up to the end of episode one so far and oh my god!! this is absolutely incredible, i've never felt for video game characters quite like this. wonderful game that makes me feel angry in all the right ways"
436,gut
437,yes
438,This game is so good and so much fun. It's definitely better then the first and third one.
439,"4 душних Данила з 10

440,"Life is Strange 2 more like Life is Unfair

Life is Strange 2 has a story very similar to Detroit: Become Human's, a story of those who did nothing wrong seeking for freedom. Yet in the end of Detroit, the game actually rewards players for not doing evil, sadly in Life is Strange 2, it doesn't quite work that way. The more I love the them the more I wish the story could have gone differently. Although I finished the game and loved it, I still kinda can't get over with the silly plot and how inconsistent Daniel's character is. Yeah, he's a child, but I couldn't help but feel that the game forced Daniel or even Sean to do stupid things too many times only for the plot's sake. Overall, the game is entertaining and so beautifully crafted in every detail, would recommend."
441,"Having played LiS1 and BtS, i expected this entirely new story to take it a step further, but it ended up taking it 10 steps back.  Both of the characters are boring at best, and depressing in reality. I really wanted to like it, up until the end, but the kind of story this game is trying to tell does not fit the universe that the previous game successfully built. 

This time around, your main character isn't the one in possession of cool ""superpowers"", which by itself is already a huge downside. I can't say that he's particularly interesting either. There's only a handful of interactions in the entire game, where you use your powers to do something, and even then, it always feels like all of those choices were designed solely around moving the plot forward, rather than it being an interesting part of the story"
442,"7/10
I enjoyed the story even though I didn't really like the outcome, but that was based on the choice I made. 
(Got myself to blame)
Would rate this higher if there was a bit more puzzles to solve during gameplay. 
It felt like I was just walking around and didn't do much."
443,Amazingly beautiful!
444,"lyla best girl, they could've incorporated her throughout the whole story tho.. bummer  

i have a crush on lyla"
445,"This game doesn't have that much impact over your choices like Detroit: Become Human but overall the story is amazing, heart - touching, have to say really recommend it and will play again"
446,"I only played the first episode and I don't think I'll bother with the rest. If you're a real die-hard fan of DONTNOD then you'll like this, but it's not as compelling as the original Life is Strange. 

Unfortunately,
-The entire plot is how *not* to handle the bad situation when the shoe drops.
-Instead of getting your own superpowers, you're escorting the kid from Twilight Zone's ""It's a Good Life"". And you're supposed to like him.

It's far from terrible so if you like story-rich choices matter games then this is more of what you're already expecting. Go ahead and get it if this sounds like you."
447,I enjoy this series. The story lines are excellent.

453,"The following is my review for Life Is Strange 2 and it may contain spoilers. Please read at your own risk.

GAME INFO:
What is the title and what platform did you test it on?

The title of the game is Life Is Strange 2 , coming from the previous Life is Strange series universe. It was developed by Dontnod and Feral Interactive. The current testing was performed on Windows OS- PC.

STORY:
What is the main plotline of the game? Is it easy to follow? Interesting? Who are the main characters?

You are following 2 main protagonists Sean Diaz and Daniel Diaz in their journey to escape to Mexico after being wrongfully accused of murdering a police officer. The story line is linear but branched to enormous amount of choices, leading to 7 final possible endings. The game's unique perspective comes from the point that you directly affect the behavior and choices of Daniel, during your own playthrough. Unlike with Life Is Strange 1, you are not playing the remarkable protagonist, but you have a choice of playing the game with high morale factor, or low morale factor. 

SOUND:
Does the music fit with the story/action? Is it nice to listen to? Are the sound effects well done? Can you hear the voices well? Is the volume balanced?

The music corresponds to the other Life Is Strange series where a lot of indie atmospheric songs are placed into the game to enhance emotional parts of the game. Sound effects are well branched and help with overall immersion throughout the game. The voices are well balanced, and allow you to listen to conversations which are not related to the main protagonists. The volume of the songs can be too loud at some specific cut-scenes, but not problematic.

GRAPHICS:
Are the graphics oldschool/cutting edge? Does it look real? Is everything clear?What about the background?
Are there videos? Are they well done?

Unlike it's predecessors, LIS2 shows more details in graphics and sometimes does lose the ""cartoonish"" style which it had in LIS1. Some factors are still present in the Game UI. The Unreal4 engine contributes and enhances the LIS environment, which gives it a more immersive style then before. Character design was clear but the speach animation was not well adjusted at some points. The graphics are overall clear and sharp, which as well give more insight to smaller detail adjustments which were missing in LIS1. The cutscenes made a big impact and the atmosphere of the part. They were well put together and connected the stories ,especially the tale of the Wolf Brothers.

Controls:
Were they easy to figure out or took some time to learn? Can you change them to suit your preferences?

Controls are the same as in LIS1 ,but have a small difference when it comes to the smoothness of how the character moves. The game will guide you throughout the game on how to use special keys during some of the main storyline. The controls couldn't/shouldn't be altered to ensure full immersion.


Content:
Was there enough stuff to keep you busy or did you finish the game quickly? Are there side games and miniquests or just the storyline missions?

100% of the game takes approximately 34+ hours,dependably of the exploration factor. The game itself only has the main story, which is linear but branched according the choices. The side quests are not included. Every choice eventually leads up to the main quest which needs to be followed.

Replay:
Do you think you could play this game again and enjoy it or is once enough for everything?

I personally believe that any game from the LIS universe can be played multiple times as there are so many details or hidden easter eggs to uncover, that it takes some time to find them. A lot of lore is not specifically pointed out during the gameplay, so you must look into the details post game.

Fun:
Did you feel this game offered you a lot of fun or did you get bored?

The game has its unique playstyle ,especially with the fact that you're not playing with the protagonist who has the powers, but his brother, which provides you with the unique perspective of being a protective side-kick. You will take on an emotional journey which will show you how your choices can affect others around you.


Your Opinion: 
What did you like/not like about the game? What could they do better? What was the best thing? Would you tell your friends about this game?

I love that this game was not in the same pattern from the other games in the LIS universe. You are not a hero, you are your brother's universe. You provide him with the correct way of growth and choices. You teach him the consequences and how to adapt to situations. 
The game itself has some small bugs in graphics and objects clipping, but rarely. From the story perspective, nothing should be changed. The best thing about this game it actually does tackle the real issues that happen in the US ,especially showing the racism, bigotry and overall kind strangers which you can meet on your journey. I would definitely recommend giving this game a go, and replaying it. 
P.S This game will take you on a emotional rollercoaster.

456,"While it was going to be impossible to live up to the standard of the original, Life is Strange 2 was a great story in it's own right.  It really picks up in episodes 4 and 5, and there were enough Easter eggs from Life is Strange to satisfy anyone who loved the characters from Arcadia Bay.  It took me far too long to finally play this, but I'm glad I finally did."
457,"Even if I somehow overlooked the fact that the game is way too political for my taste, it would be still pretty boring. Although it has a few stronger moments, I wouldn't say it's good enough reason to suffer through the rest of it."
458,"The most hopeless and soul crushed I've felt playing a game in a long time, and i mean this as a compliment"
459,this game is a freaking w
460,"if you're unsure whether to buy this or not, give it a shot, play the first episode since it's free. I kept delaying this game because i heard so much complaints about this one. This is a lot different than the first one that people adore so much, but in my case, this was much better and i liked sean a lot as a protagonist. The game relies a lot on how much you are willing to do for someone you love. so did the first one too, but this feels different. when in LIS 1 you also had a mystery, the plot in LIF 2 is all about family. it was emotional for me to play this and if i could forget my playthrough and play this again, i totally would, it was such a beautiful story :)"
461,"Really great story telling and choices. There is definitely a biased political agenda in this game, but i mean its a Life is Strange game so... not really surprised. Everything aside the agenda was great though."
462,VERY FUN AND EMOTIONAL GAME!!!
463,"Easily my favorite installment in the Life is Strange franchise. At first I was a little put off by the different characters, hoping to carry on the story of Max and Chloe and what awaited them after Arcadia Bay. Quickly, however, I fell in love with the main characters, as well as the others they ran into along the way.
There is a diverse number of friends and enemies you make along the way, and you are presented by quite a few decisions that alter the different endings. While the choices (for me) were not difficult to make, I can see how they may be. You switch between several different locales, which I felt added to the overall story. It was such a fun, enjoyable experience to watch their adventure and adaptation to different situations.
Spoiler: 
[spoiler] Although I received the canonically 'bad ending' first time around, I felt it was so well done I chose not to really go back to change anything aside from googling the other endings to look them over. The death of the main character made me cry as I had come to love Shaun so much over the course of 15+ hours of gameplay. [/spoiler] 

This game makes you fall in love with the main characters, which is something I felt really added to this installment.

TL;DR: If you loved Life is Strange 1 and you're debating buying this, buy it. You won't regret it."
464,"I love this game so much, the ""Dontnod artstyle"", the music, the scenery shots, them not shying away from uncomfortable themes. I've played it on PS4 back when it came out and i'm now replaying on PC.
If you have an open mind the game teaches you patience and responsibility instead of being the one to go wild with a power, it teaches you to enjoy the moment but also to let go when you have to move forward.

It's just my personal opinion, but to me LiS2 is still the best game in the franchise. Having the option to choose what happened to Arcadia Bay is pretty cool too and should the gap the ending(s) of LiS1 left to some."
465,لعبة جميلة
466,If you tear-up easily whilst watching movies then get your tissues ready.
467,amazing storyine amazing characters amazing writing amazing everything
468,i just finished the game and... god why does every life is strange game make me cry
469,"Its very simple.

You're babysitting a kid who can use the force and plays Minecraft."
470,"Less mystery and more politics than Life Is Strange 1, but still worth playing imo. Somewhat unbelievable characters but the other games have that problem too."
471,This is 10 times better than the previous Life is Strange. Excellent Story.
472,"i'm going to start with the cons: 

- this game was very triggering due to the racism the two main characters experienced. i know the majority of the game was centered around racial issues. but can we please have a f**king game that doesn't have to be ""realistic"". i know it was meant to be ""educational"" to white people and bring awareness to the systemic oppression. however, as a poc i experience racism irl and i don't need a game to contain that as well. the point in a game is to be transported into a different reality, not the re-live the same one i'm in. there are other ways to highlight issues than to graphically show it through a game. this is trauma p**n for white people and i'm not here for it. 

- there was no need to kill mushroom like what the hell. i'm sick of animals being killed for the sake of it or for character development. can we just halt with the non-stop tragedies. the whole shock value thing to keep a gamer interested is not the way to go. there are other ways to keep the story engaging 

- alot of choices i found were weird and was not impressed when it made you choose between daniel and sean's happiness. iykyk.

the pros:

- i loved the classic ambience of LiS series, had the same charm when it came to the environment, soundtrack, characters. that constant air of suspense, even if everything appeared to be calm; that low-key creepiness

- realistic characters; while i did find daniel annoying to deal with majority of the time, that is the reality of children. you had to teach him morals and ethics as a big brother. 

 - easter eggs! =^.^=

overall i give this game 8/10"
473,yes
474,absolutely cracking game
475,fum
476,Amazing game!! It doesn't hit as hard the first one. Weak story.
477,"10/10. really good game in my opinion, be careful if youre a crier tho"

I laughed, i cried (a lot). I cried again.
Thanks for such beautiful feelings.
I really loved this episode."
482,my most loved franchise
483,"I really enjoy most of 'Life is Strange' series. This is a really good game and pulled hard on the heart-string many times. Depending on how you treat and influence your little brother really pushes which ending you're going to get, I do wish there was a better way to tell how meaningful each choice is, but oh well, still a very good play."

488,"The game being really unpolished in Life is Strange 1 was understandable and a little charming. But by the time Before the Storm launched, it got old. By now, it's just a part of the series' identity.

The writing is overly dramatic half the time, and the other half it's just boring. Daniel is understandably irritating beyond belief, as are all children, but so is the main character, whatever his name is. The moral choices are weak, the lack of time travel powers means a lot of the appeal is gone, and overall the game is a mundane chore, stringing together moral dilemmas about as impactful as deciding what I want for lunch tomorrow. What shit do I give whether or not the kid spares a mountain lion or whatever it was? Nobody is likable, from the bland and whiny MC to the grating and even more whiny Daniel, and the two love interests I couldn't even feign investment in, each episode is just a couple hours of telling yourself ""Oh man the game's gonna get good this time, I can feel it"" and inevitably being disappointed when the episode credits roll after a wolf analogy as subtle as a semitruck in your livingroom. The characters lack depth, the choices lack intrigue, the consequences lack impact, and the story lacks a sense of progression.

Life is Strange 1 was a hurricane in a bottle that the devs have been trying to live up to ever since. It feels like they don't even know what was enjoyable about it. It wasn't the hipster cliches, or the overwritten dialogue, or even any of the high school musical stereotypes it had for characters. It was that it introduced a unique mechanic to a genre otherwise desolate in the innovation department, and built interesting situations based on that.

I'm sure LiS True Colors is fine and all, but it's clear the devs don't understand what made the first game so enjoyable, and I can't find anything enjoyable about the later entries."
489,"Im gonna cry, best game ever"
490,Special.
491,Life is Strange 1 is one of my favorite games of all time. I am into chapter 4 now and I'm so bored I want to open another game on the other monitor.
492,I really like the story line just like all the other games in the series. I miss that you can rewind time in the first one to see how the choices play out but its still really nice.
493,"I loved season 1. This one didn't live to the same expectation. The voice actors were flat to me at times where they should've gone all in with emotions. The episodes' endings weren't gripping enough to keep your interest or to keep you guessing what will happen next, because the whole season was basically [spoiler] moving from one location to the other - the forest, the grandparents, the hippies, the church, the other hippies. [/spoiler] There was not much development in the characters and every setting or character that you've visited or known is just left behind after the episode ends. 
I hope True Colors is better."
494,"xenophobia, racism, politic, religion, LGBTQ, parenthood, drug, what more could you ask for the game that can put all of these topic into 5 episodes. Though, I think at least it had an up lifting moment more than The Last of Us 2."
495,"Another wonderful Life is Strange game. Its totally worth a try, you don't need to play any life is strange games before this one. Maybe just for Arcadia Bay but its just a little thing in the game. It has a wonderful story line, good graphics and everything a good story game needs. You totally should try it!"
496,loved it
497,very fun and hard to make chocies
498,very good game.
499,My favourite Life is Strange game. You truly feel like you're on a journey with these two brothers just trying to survive.
500,Hardest game I have ever played.
501,"Wow!  Amazing journey.  I had so many tears.  I really loved this game so much.  The relationship between the 2 brothers and the sacrifices made.  Man what an excellent game.  Recommend highly as the story , characters, and everything was just so great.  A must play more anyone who loves story driven choices and consequences game.  A really great friend bought me all 3 life is strange games and all are truly great Games and I am so happy I was able to experience this and the other games."
502,"Having only completed LIS: True Colors before, LIS2 was an absolute surprise.

Words are not enough to describe the journey you take, you'll be in tears by the end. Beautifully written, best to experience this by going in blind."
503,"Life Is Strange 2 is an utterly rubbish game, horrible in literally all aspects except visual. I could go into a full rant about the story, the 'gameplay', or literally anything else. The characters are cardboard and pieces of plastic, the story so thinly and easily poked holes with that I think a literal child with mental illness could make a better story than these horrible French Canadians who have tried and only horrible failed at interpreting american sociological issues and political matters. If you like this game, you are objectively and clinical retarded and belong in a mental institute where you can do no further harm to the people of this fine world, unless you live in Canada. 

I advise looking at better more in depth reviews by actual people who took time to play the whole thing to see why it is rubbish, as I did. But to play the first episode is only a taste of the cancerous tumors you will grow during this horrible meaningless 'game'. Do not give money to these people, they failed at a choice driven game, failed at literally all mechanical aspects and made a borderline movie with a couple meaningless choices. If you want a true narrative game with good story, good gameplay, and good meaningful decisions. Go play Disco Elysium, even David Cage games are better than this schlock, or The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe. Please, even though I know if you are interested in this game, you are already lost, do not buy it or even get the free episode. Dear lord, have mercy on your soul if you do."
504,A la hauteur du 1.
505,"As a fellow Burrito this one hit home and stirred me all the way to my beans
Biased 10/10
impartial 8/10 Awesome game
-Burro inexplicably caring/cold at times (gotta show some development)
-Taquito annoying at the beginning (def best developed character later on tho)"
506,"Don't mind my hour count but I bought this on console and finished it, I've played all of the games and I love this one more than the rest. They've improved so much from the games before this, and even though it isn't the newest its still the best one to get into the series with. 9/10 in my top five games"
507,love this game
508,fckn amazing
509,this game is based on choices and a great story line.
510,one of the best games I've played!
511,"Before I decided to give this game a shot, I ruled it out because of the general bad reviewers calling it too political and ham-fisted. But boy I'm so glad I got it. This game is foremost about Brotherhood and family. At first Daniel was annoying and [spoiler]the reason for running was stupid on Sean's part[/spoiler] but eventually I grew to love their bond and the obstacles they faced together. You, as Sean, play a huge role in guiding Daniel into being a moral human which ultimately pays off in the end (whichever way you decide to go). I'm going to miss these boys."
512,"A very heart-breaking game... 

Playing feels like you are the director of a movie. The only issue I had you can't control every action, the game lead you some of the important events. I wish I had more options on those.

Overall: Good story in a nicely knitted world."
513,
514,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
515,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
516,yes
517,"Dontnod's last outing in this universe is a game that is stunning but also challenging in ways you would not expect. It deals with heavy topics without getting too preachy or too cheesy. LiS2 is not as easy to get into compared to the other entries in the franchise, but it also has the most fleshed out ending in the entire series. 'This action will have consequences' finally lives up to it in this game. For the curious, it also pays homage to the first game, and more importantly, your choices in the first game, in subtle, beautiful ways. It's not in your face, but when it does appear, you will notice and it is likely to move you.
LiS2 is a story about family, and families aren't perfect. Mechanically, it has the same pros and cons as other entries in the franchise. It's not always a relaxing game, but it is a reflection of the times."
518,"Played this game fully first on PS4. 

All I can say this game is really disappointing compared to the first game.

The character you play as has no powers and your job is to babysit very entitled child, who has actual powers and seriously the whole game was frustrating because of that.

Compared to the first game which had some politics involved, but nothing too much to bother with. But this game if it wasn't just babysitting the child all the time, then you deal with enormous amount of politics that are thrown at your face . At first I kind of ignore it, but later on in the game you can clearly see, how the developers trying to show their political view on certain group of people. 

I mean I get the message that they are saying here, but they are pointing out only from devs point of view and really one sided.
Displayed it inaccurate and over exaggerated and obviously blaming it on certain group of people.

The game is pretty much nothing, but about how to let annoying child do anything IT wants and VERY political game. 

Buy the first one and forget that this one exist.

"
519,Bromance ?
520,"awesome game, though Daniel is the most annoying life is strange character EVER. However, he's still a cutie sometimes. Nice graphics, good music, perfect representation of america tbh especially regarding racism and their hate towards mexcians."
521,"I enjoyed Life is Strange 2 infinitely more than the original. The struggles that Sean and Daniel go through as siblings, plus all the other problems they run into, had me heavily invested in their journey. The ending I got was the sadder one and although I'm upset about that, I like that it's realistic. I tried my best to get a ""good"" ending but life is unfair/unpredictable... there are things that will not go your way no matter what you do. Also, the voice actors did an incredible job. They truly put their heart and soul into their characters, they felt so real to me. This game was well written, emotional, complex, and captivating. I rate it 10 out of 10."
522,"I enjoyed this part of LIS more than the first one, everything seemed more mature to me. I liked that my decisions affected not just me, but also the brother. The story was very touching - I'd like the big sad to be gone now, thank you"
523,"I liked this game but I can see why people wouldn't. It's very calm and ""undramatic"" and not much is happening in the story. Life is Strange 1 is a teenage drama while this second game is a slow coming-of-age journey. It's something completely different.

I cannot compare this to Life is Strange 1 at all. This is more similar to Telltale's TWD if you removed the zombies. If you enjoy a slow burner, you might enjoy this game, but if you want something more fast paced you will think this game is boring."
524,"great game so far but a bit laggy 5/5
"
525,"A really nice followup of the first season. Completely different characters, but same kind of atmosphere overall. I've found the story intriguing and touching, which is of course the main goal for a game like this, so thumbs up."
526,"Solid game. Underwhelming compared to life is strange and before the storm, but the concept here is as good, just not as well executed. The 5th episode is phenomenal, but the 4 first episodes are pretty slow and kind of uninteresting. Makes the final episode hit much harder though. The prologue is fantastic as well. The dialogue is painfully cringe at some points throughout the game, but doesn't destroy it. I actually really like all the politics they shoved into this, very understandable that they did this with this game when you think about when it was relased. Recommended, but beware it is a slowburn deluxe.

7/10. 5th Episode 8.5/10"
527,"im fucking obsessed with this games lore and scenery, minus points for the remaster"
528,Absolutely beautiful game and the story line is very interesting and [spoiler] and when they stopped at arcadia bay my heart melted because i thought of chloe and max together[/spoiler]
529,asd
530,yes
531,amaing
532,"As someone who had watched almost the whole game back in 2018 but never finished it for one or another reason, one day, I just finally decided to buy the game for myself and try it out, and oh boy-

I will start by saying that I have watched LIS1 many times, even played it myself years ago, and I loved it, but do not remember too much of it aside from some highly memorable stuff like the ending. 
Sitting down to play this game, I had pretty high hopes, and were they over satisfied!

I played the first two episodes for eight straight hours from 10 P.M 'till 6 A.M, the only thing stopping me being school. I cried 8 TIMES just in the period of these 8 hours.
Continuing with the other three episodes, I finished them in 10 hours in one sitting one day later.
 I explored all the game had to offer and 100% completed it with the help of a guide (I made sure I did not spoil anything).
Now, be aware I knew what would happen for most of the game, yet I CRIED THE SH*T OUT OF MY EYES. Happiness, sadness, HYPE! I felt so many emotions playing this; it felt so different from everything else I have ever played. Why? Let me explain.

When I started playing this, I did not expect this to be such a relatable experience, but I could relate to the main characters and their lives so much right from the beginning. The way Sean was speaking, how shy and unsure about so many things in his life he was, it just hit like home.
Something else that hit home was when the game showed that the developers behind it are actual, thinking humans with emotions. I felt so touched because of how open the game was with topics like racism, religion, homophobia, etc.
Having the choice to like girls or boys made me feel like I was living in Sean's world. Having a stand on religion and so many other points made me shape the world around my boys just like I'd shape mine. It did not feel like I was playing a character; it felt like I was there and choosing my faith.
A game openly talking about sensitive topics like racism and conversion therapy had me crying and smiling like an idiot for hours. I LOVE THIS, and I LOVE THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS!
This game finally showed all other games in this genre that you do not have to follow the typical American plot to make something entertaining; instead, it let me choose my stand on everything.

Overall this is the best game I have played in years. It's definitely going to be in my top 10 games when I get old.
And that ending? How many emotions were put there and the stress of something going wrong? Did I play a game, or did I teleport myself into a different world?

Daniel is just like the usual ten-year-old kid, cute and annoying, 
Sean; hot and full of emotions that I felt like I experienced right next to him. For the first time ever, I felt attracted to a character in a video game. Finally, a game where everything is not oriented around the interests of hetero people.

10/10 MASTERPIECE <3"
533,ITS SO GOOD
534,"Awesome game.. and personally i really love the soundtracks.
Each chapter really feels like a journey, and each cliffhanger was a pain.

Wolf brothers/10"
535,"Much better than the first game, as you now have an actual purpose. The first game was confusing to me. It didn't really have a story, yet it somehow did? I dunno. I couldn't answer that question even if you asked me. I don't want to spoil anything.

Grab it when it's on sale and/or when you need to chill from DOOM or something :)


6/10 from me."
536,game is boring as hell theres only a few moments when it comes alive and by few i mean few out of the almost 13 hours i played i would say there was only an hour of enjoyment total
537,yes
538,"I love the story of this game, Its one of my favorite games. It has so much to do and the options are really a game changer. One of the best game I have played and I recommend it"
539,"Well I finished the game. Honestly it was not bad. Story was fine and really reminded me how much of a shit sister I am to my old brother lol. But I was expecting like an actual combat where we use daniel's power to kill a boss or something, but that didn't happen :( But overall I enjoyed the game. 

For those who haven't played yet, go in with an open mind, and it really helps if you just pretend LIS 1 doesn't exist. They only get referenced twice if I remember correctly and it really doesn't change much whether you did destroy the town or not."
540,Cool
541,"I really liked LiS1. The story was different and interesting. This is not. This game is just frustrating. The story is unidirectional and no matter what you try to do, the character always takes the stupidest decision, the only thing you would not do. It is incredibly frustrating and I don't relate at all to his story.
This should be called ""Life Is Strange: forcing you to take the absolute worst decision in every situation""."
542,how to DONWOALDO !!#@!@!
543,Almost as good as the previous one
544,ö
545,Very emotional. It manages to merge you as if you were in the game.
546,"good game tho i wish i could play all the episodes :/
"
547,"Very good game, we stan!"
548,so good
549,"The synopsis looks decent on paper, but the gameplay is surprisingly boring and cringey most of the time. There are too many exaggerated messages about racism and politics that feel forced. I'm not saying that you can't have real world issues represented in a game, but they have to be well written. The pacing feels awkward, the game doesn't know whether it should be fast or slow, and does both frequently. The characters don't feel very connectable due to how average and disposable they are. This game has 10 hours of gameplay, but it took me a week to finish it because of how burnt out I felt when I got done with 1 episode. I played this game for free and I still feel ripped off. Even if this game was good, I still wouldn't buy it because of the Denuvo digital rights management. DRM only hurts paying customers, and supporting it enables corporations to screw over its customers even more."
550,"Wokefest.

Edit. Thanks for the badges, virgins"
551,Great story telling. Sound tracks are super good.
552,It is a very great game I just wish it was straight up buy for all the episodes
553,"I liked LiS 1 better because I felt I could relate to the protags more, but LiS 2 was an incredible journey of its own, telling tales of tragedy, escape, love, trust, faith, and more."
554,this is a really good game. i recommend this. story line is good i love it.
555,
556,"I definitely  enjoyed the first game much much more. I got to chapter 3 of this game and was too annoyed to finish. This game has too much of an illusion of choice, which while the first game also has this its nowhere near as bad. By this I mean while the first game it was mostly in the end that destroys the illusion of choice, they also did it in a fantastic way I think. However, in this game its constant throughout the game. No matter what you do your annoying little brother gets his way. I get he's a child and what they're going through is very traumatic but the fact that no matter how much you try to protect him, he always gets his way. Idk, I just was very annoyed with this game, especially considering how much I love the first two games."
557,A good story! :)
558,"I loved LiS 1, but I hated this game. First thing to know is that you aren't in control of the ""power"" like you were in LiS 1. You play the role of the older brother Sean and your kid brother Daniel has the ""power"". And that's the problem--you're a babysitter! This poor teenager is thrust into the role of caretaker for an ungrateful little snot with powers.

Many parts throughout the game I wanted to kill the kid brother not protect him. Unfortunately Sean is such a doormat he takes repeated punishments from the consequences of Daniel's actions and just continues to put up with Daniel's terrible behavior. By the end of the game I understood what they were doing--the ending(s) reveal this, but the game was such torture to get through, by the time I got one ending I just watched videos of the other endings rather than be tortured by Daniel another moment.

Points for the morality, but man this game was not fun."
559,Great
560,
561,awesome game
562,"This is an amazing game, the art and everything is beautiful. I've just finished the game and I'm so sad, I did get a good ending and everyone lived besides a lot of police officers.. lol. This game is amazing and its so perfect. I recommend this game to anyone whose searching for a game that looks pretty, you get attached to the characters, has gore, and has magic in it."
563,"easily the best life is strange game, had me crying not even 30 mins into the game, amazing."
564,Voice acting sucks balle
565,ITS REALLY GOOOOOODDDDDDDD
566,"The game is not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. As a fan of games with deep plots where choices matter, I expected to love it. I thought I was the target audience for this game (also, I played the original Life is Strange and liked it quite a bit, even though I wasn't a huge fan either).

Without going into spoiler territory, I found the game too slow and boring. It failed in getting me invested in most characters. I liked the little brother at the beginning, but ended up tired of putting up with him. I played the whole game, from beginning to end, at every moment expecting it to get better. Always hoping to get to the next part, and seldom enjoying the present. I didn't feel like I was playing a game, I felt that I was doing a chore.

Also, I wanted romance, and there's little to none. And that's if you make the right choices... in terms of impressing your crush. Do not buy for romance.

My advise for newcomers is this: play the first chapter, which is free. See if you like it. The first one does a good job hooking you up. But then... buy the second one, but not the whole season. Play the second. If you don't absolutely love the second chapter, don't expect it to get any better. The real game, after the first chapter, is quite like the second: slow and slice-of-lifeish."
567,The story line never disappoint
568,hay
569,hio
570,story is good
571,"Very Good Life Is Strange Game. One Of My Favorites.
I Wonder How Moms Played This One lol"
572,"No Life Is Strange game could ever live up to the original. That said, this is a pretty solid game.

The game still manages to throw really difficult choices at you making you think about what is more ""Morally Correct"" or ""What is the best choice"". Having multiple endings depending on Daniel's morals was also a nice touch but I felt that so much more potential there.

I don't think it should have used the title ""Life Is Strange 2"" as it almost doesn't involve any of the characters from previous Life Is Strange games with the exception of a cameo and some Easter Eggs. I think it would've been more fitting for this game to be a spin-off or have a title like ""The Tale of the Wolf Brothers"" or something along those lines.

I like the backpack patches and keychains system except that they aren't the most visible throughout the game. Either way, its still pretty cool.

One other thing I don't like about the game is that throughout the game, Daniel pretty much doesn't listen to what you say and gets everyone into trouble several times. For example, Daniel knows what would happen if he were to tell others about his power but he does it either way. 

[Slight Spoilers Below]
And there is no way he doesn't know how bad of an idea it is to rob Merril but still decides to do it anyway.

At the end of the day, this is still a pretty enjoyable game. It has that Life Is Strange nostalgia feeling or something to it that makes it so enduring and enjoyable."
573,ong
574,"Definitely one of my favorite life is strange games and by far underrated. At first i wasn't such a big fan as well because i wanted to see more of Max and Chloe, but then really started getting into the story. Matter of fact, I love the story. Everything took a turn so fast like the first game, it was intense. But with that being said, here are my favorite things i liked about LiS 2, but also the things I disliked.

(Spoilers ahead, if you want no spoilers go the the ""Overall Rating"" section where there are less details and spoiler free)

Liked:
- The story's writing and voice artists (the writing was decently realistic and detailed and i loved making a run from Seattle to Mexico, the voice actors were able convey the emotions almost perfectly and i give props to them for such a great job)
- The settings/places (Mount Rainier, Beaver Creek, the camp in Humboldt)
- Captain Spirit demo teaser (loved the way they teased the next game with a game)
- Some characters such as Sean & Daniel (i love the writing and the relationship the two hold), Lyla (more on her in disliked), Brody (cool dude), Cassidy (personally think she's cool, good singing and fun), Finn (hes pretty chill, but what he did wasn't cool and i think hes a little deceptive), David (its DAVID, i love David hes the shit idc what anyone says), and Mushroom (maan RIP) are some well written characters (besides Lyla, more on her in a min tho)
- Multiple endings (In total 4, one more emotional than the other)
- More choices mattered (especially compared to LiS 1, for example, if Sean were to steal something, Daniel would then think it would be okay to steal since his big brother is doing so. Awesome)
- Music choices (Major spoilers ahead for those who haven't played - If you were to listen to whats played at the end of episode 3 {Milk and Bone - Natalie} it is literally Daniel's thoughts after whats happened, its PERFECT)
- Graphics (Took the graphical gist from the first game then made it more realistic, the game is beautiful)
- Collectibles (fun and easy to get with some being slightly hard to find)
- We don't have the power (This is definitely a personal thing, but i think not having the power was so cool and different. To have to train Daniel how to use his power and control it is sick

And now onto the..

Disliked:
- Lyla (Now the reason she is in the liked section is because i liked her character and personality, but i just wish there was more of her, shes in about 4 parts of the game, one being the beginning, two being on phone calls which one isn't promised depending on choices, and one in the end hugging Sean in a cut scene. i feel if we had more emotional attachment with Lyla it would've made rejoicing with her feel more meaningful and emotional)

(Now i can't really think of much that i disliked about this game at the moment, so until i can think of more, this is it lol.)

And now, onto the overall rating for a more simple format your used to and spoiler-free review

Thank you so much for taking your time reading my long azz review and hopefully you found it helpful :)

Summary for Life is Strange 2: ""𝘈𝘸𝘦𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘗𝘰𝘴𝘴𝘶𝘮!"""
575,😍
576,Beautiful. Will not be disappointed.
577,"I only have season 1 but, i can't stress enough how much of a draw i had to this it definitely pulled on my big brother strings maybe i'll get all the seasons"
578,"It took me 20 hours and over a year to finish this game, because it is too boring. Which is an absolute shame; afterall, the premise is really interesting. But there's hardly any gameplay at all, most of the time you just sit and watch video sequences. Sometimes you get dialogue choices, but most of them don't matter. And then there are those annoying quick time events..."
579,"This is my first review on a game to which i am recommending no. I personally had to drag myself to the ending as it was really boring and never felt like it is ""Choice matter"" Game. The big choices weren't there, All dialogues from my own self weren't there and the biggest issue was that the gameplay from myself wasn't there. I felt like I am watchin a boring movie and sometimes i get to play it. The story was okay but it could be a lot better in my opinion. Graphics and scenery was great as ever."
580,"Lovely game. Touches on some topics that might rub people the wrong way but there's nothing wrong with that. 
Characters are interesting and the plot very suspenseful. I was always on the edge of my seat wondering what was about to happen. Also one of the few story-driven games where all the choices you made throughout the game add up and influence the ending in a severe way.

Take care of your little brother!

Very different from the first game though, don't be mislead by the '2' and go in without any expectations."
581,"Ottima avventura grafica targata Square Enix. Mi è piaciuto poco meno del primo, che è uno dei miei giochi preferiti in assoluto. 

Ho apprezzato molto la storia, così come i dialoghi e le diverse ambientazioni. Mi sarebbe piaciuto poter giocare qualche livello anche come Daniel (o avere un indicatore sul grado di ""moralità/fratellanza""). 

Ho notato un miglioramento nella gestione degli episodi: è infatti molto più semplice e veloce rigiocare un episodio per fare scelte diverse rispetto al primo capitolo. 

Altra nota positiva sulla musica, sempre sulla scia Indie del primo, ma a cui non mancano bellissime tracce di elettronica o Hip-Hop. Consiglio l'acquisto a chiunque, ma se non avete intenzione di rigiocarlo non spenderei più di 15€"
582,"First one was really good, although the story was really depressing. Now in the second one the story doesn't advance very quickly and you get to travel with a whiny little brother, who is constantly messing things up, no matter what you do. I don't recommend playing the second part. I think it is mostly boring and the story isn't very interesting."
583,Not as good as the 1st life as strange but its about even with True Colors (In my opinion) get it if you like playing the Life is Strange series. 8/10
584,"i wasn't crying multiple times throughout the first episode alone, you were!"
585,"the best game I ever played, highly recommended"
586,"This one felt less grounded than Life Is Strange 1. Characters would come and go but I never felt like I could get attached to them because of the structure of it all. There were lots of great moments, but lots of dull ones too.

Some minor technical things where lines would get skipped meaning I had to reload from a checkpoint."
587,g
588,very good.cried.
589,"There is a puppy named ""Mushroom"". 10/10"
590,nice story
591,"really loved playing this game, love the story line, the graphics are amazing and really really love the music.
great job done on this cant wait to see more"
592,"good graphics and scenery, story is okay, dialog is good, but imo there are some plot that really weak though, overall good game.

8/10

* if only Sean just stay put and wait for the police to come, probably they will end up live with their grandparents"

594,Awesome story
595,one of the best story mode games ive ever played
596,I LOVE THIS GAME SM ITS SO FUN
597,very interesting game
598,"This is a fantastic story.  It's like the days past when we read books that let us decide the end of the story in a video game.  The graphics could use some help, but the story and character development is there.  You'll find your self addicted and keep going as you uncover the story as you play."
599,banger of a game. will always prefer the original LIS but this game is still pretty sick
600,"I think I'm depressed now, in a good way"
601,"I recommend this game reluctantly. Story driven games like this are hard to find. It's always highly recommended to play them as an interactive narrative. However, after finishing this game and as the dust settled too many problems with the story and characters emerged making it difficult to have any lasting impression.

The political commentary was hard to stomach (and I don't mean it's message, I mean as to how it was delivered) The writers lacked having any nuance or subtlety into a social problems that have many layers and variables. This is often a problem Hollywood has as well. All it does is stop the momentum of the game as your preached at with no ability to skip the sequence.

Don't get me wrong. I think having commentary of our current social issues should be encouraged, however, if done badly it can disrupt the enjoyment of a game (or movie).

I still recommend this game because even though I disagree with some of it's delivery on social commentary and that there is an illusion of choice when it comes to story progression it's still worth diving in to."
602,Worth of my time
603,good

605,"Awesome Story-line, For those who love Graphical story-lines choice based consequences, This is a must game for you, Absolutely love the game, Gonna play the next Sequel once finished. WOLF BROTHERS!"
606,"The Developers DeckNine, Square Enix and Dont Nod have created an amazing set of games in the Life is strange series, mixing both the ESP/psychic side with real life issues and situations that play a huge part in every day mental health, and really brings to light the power of choice and free will, that all decisions have consequences .

It's Hard not to feel connected to the life of the characters and really embrace the situations in these set of games.

are the games perfect... no there are a variety of things that the Developers should spend time on refining but the same can be said about any game, especially games that have been remastered.

All in all, The ""Life is Strange"" Franchise is an incredible set of games with great amount of content and replay value.
and i would highly recommend playing this to any person"
607,life is strange
608,"Before I play this game, I always though I loves kids. 
After I played the game,I now hate these little shits.
7/10 ""Daniel is a little shit and Sean's a pussy"""
609,"I couldn't be more sad, for real, but it's a great game."
610,Amazing Story Gmes just like the previous ones
611,goood
612,I <3 BRODY
613,I am. going. to. enjoy. this!
614,"Very good game, but a bit too short"
615,"honestly, been fighting with myself to play this or not because of how many people dislike this game, but I then still decided to after I heard that the og story showed up. it's something different than after and before the storm and the episodes feel WAY longer to play than the first two games, which I loved. I would've wished that for the the ogs, but I found many things just way too quick. felt kinda rushed to me. also the multiple outcome of endings. I hella loved the two choices you had in the first game and how both of them were kinda canon, with lis 2 here it was confusing how many different endings this game offered. however, I still enjoyed playing it a freaking lot, especially with the diversity of themes that were presented. nonetheless, NOTHING can beat the first two games. they're always gonna be superior to anything else and I'm really happy they at least brought some of the good old arcadia bay story back ;)"
616,"I mean... wow.
If you like games that takes you on a journey (an EMOTIONAL one), and don't mind it being slow-paced, this is the game for you.
It IS a sad game, I liked my ending even though it made me cry like a baby (which I did MULTIPLE times during this game), but I've watched the other endings on youtube and all of them are more or less bittersweet. I kind of wish there was a way we could get a through and through happy ending, but I guess that's not how life works. Life is strange and not fair by any means.
Although some parts of it were really slow (and kind of dull), it was all and all an amazing game. I really wish I could turn back time (Max, hit me up lol!) and replay it again for the first time. For me it's a 9/10, def recommed it."
617,amazing game and story!!!!!!
618,"amazing story, beautiful pictures, made me cry and made me invested
i usually dont cry at stuff but this really made me cry"
619,Awesome like the 1st one :D
620,"OMG, yes to everything. It does get quite political at times but I understand where it's coming from. Great game!!"
621,"A complete emotional roller coaster that makes for a powerful addition to the Life Is Strange series by dealing with very serious topics and having very realistic writing. Although I love the characters from previous seasons more, the ones from this game are still pretty solid."
622,I would sell my soul just to experience the emotions I felt when I played it for the first time
623,two kids go to mexico and kill a couple cops
624,<3
625,"The story and characters are beautifully written, and the music and visual style are great. I definitely recommend this!

PS: You should read Sean's sketchbook and texts as soon as you get the chance and every time they're updated."
626,One of the best story games i have played in a while in an adventure with plot twists and sad things it is a super good game.
627,👍
628,absolutely EXQUISITE!!!!! very fun. much fun. 10/10 its so underrated pls buy
629,no
630,
631,nice story
632,Very entertaining and heart-wrenching story of two brother's and their journey to find peace.
633,"Fuck this game, Fuck children and Fuck Daniel"
634,"This game is so good, if you liked the first one, you're going to like this one, the story is really good and overall I liked it more than the first one. Maybe being a brother put me more into Sean (the big brother) character and I really liked seeing the progress of the two brothers."

636, OMFG literally THE best storygame EVER!
637,yep
638,play the 1st part of life is strange before this. one of my fav game series <3
639,"If you like to play as a main character in a movie, then Life Is Strange 2 is for you!"
640,"Such a great game, would recommend this to anyone I met."
641,So cool
642,sean diaz i love u & i love this game so much everyone should play it 11/10 tbh tbh best game in the series ngl also banger soundtrack makes me wanna cry amazing best game ever tbh
643,"Beautiful. Sad. Amazing. Play it. You won't regret it. The characters, the music, the lighting, the STORY. My goodness it is.. <3"
644,interesting
645,W
646,"Really great game. Not as great as the first game, but still really great!
If you haven't, play Life Is Strange 1 and The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit. Those games will effect some stuff in this game."
647,"this game was so amazing during my first play through and i love it when i play it again and again it just has a amazing story to it and your choices really matter 
10/10 on my list"
648,"When this first came out I remember putting it on a shelf so I could binge every episode when they all came out because I knew after the first episode, I was going to love this journey. I just didn't know HOW much I was going to love it. Ended up leaving it on the shelf for so long that I forgot about it. But it recently found me, and I'm so glad it did, I fell so deeply in love with these characters and their journey.

This is without a doubt the most touching story I've experienced in my life. Which did catch me off guard because the first didn't leave me the way this one left me... With a face full of tears and the emptiness of knowing one of the best stories I've experienced is now over. I don't know how I'll recover, but I'm so glad to have finally played. I cry a fair amount with these games, but this broke the flood gates.

Sean and Daniel Diaz have my whole heart."
649,"The first Life is Strange is genre defining for story-based games
The second though is genre-perfecting
You may not have this big mystery to figure out like you did in the first game but rather a big adventure filled with the good, the bad and the ugly of the United States
You can choose to act on emotions and be a bad example or choose to be the bigger man and be a shining example of a big brother and this will affect your overall feelings and experience. To me this is easily the best in the series excluding True Colours as I have yet to play it. I highly recommend this experience to everyone.
"
650,Still a pretty good game
651,A roller coaster of feelings. Haven't finish it when i write this but it's so good. And the soundtrack too. Such a banger
652,"Episode 1: Alright, which one of you spilled their Every White Person is Racist in my Life is Strange?

Episode 2: The fun of Life is Strange was making the tough choices. The biggest disconnect between Before the Storm and its predecessor was not having a second mechanic (time-rewind) to change up the gameplay. So far, all of the tough choices have been made for me. Instead of being given the option to follow or break the rules, you just go along with Daniel's stupid ideas, not once, but twice, resulting in the exact bad outcomes I would have chosen otherwise in hopes to avoid. Couple that with the lack of a second game mechanic essentially making this a point-and-click adventure, this subverts my expectations in the worst way. I wanted Life is Strange, but instead I got discount Telltale. At least Telltale gave me the option to make the tough decisions. Life is Strange 2 has just not been fun so far.

Episode 3: This episode was particularly bland for the first bit, but then it goes back to making the decisions for you, all bad ones of course. Somewhere around the beginning of the second half of the chapter there's a part that, for the first time while playing LiS2, it actually reminded me of Life is Strange. Then everything after that is just stupid. I'm particularly amused by the fact that [spoiler]we get lectured by the criminal about stealing and how he has to protect his family, despite literally stealing from us all by refusing to pay us[/spoiler]. I don't even FEEL like I'm in control of the game anymore. I know in most 'choices matter' games your choices usually don't actually matter, but at least they make you feel like they do. This game fails miserably at that, which leaves my anger directed not at my own decisions, but at the game itself."
653,The first Story Game I have cried at ever. Very emotional and pulls at your heart strings. With the multiple endings its sad to keep seeing these sweet boys have to deal with this trauma over and over again
654,kill me please
655,good
656,A really good game. I give it a 7/10
657,"Nice toony graphics.
Good smooth animations.
Good environment.
Story i slow but you get to enjoy it more."
658,like.
659,"It's a great story-based game, very much what you would expect from a Life Is Strange game in terms of design, but it is unrelentingly miserable. I ended up playing this over a few months because I needed to take (long) breaks from the hopelessness and futility evoked. As a result, I am not sure I enjoyed the game but I definitely appreciated the experience. The characters, overall ambience, voice acting, presentation and music come together to deliver a powerful game."
660,Love This Game
661,"Powerful storytelling and perfect characters are the most strength of this game.
but in my opinion life is strange 1 and before the storm are better than this."
662,not better than the first one but it's still kinda good.
663,balls
664,跟前两部的差距有点大，但还是不错的
665,"this game was really interesting at first i thought it was the second episode for life is strange, but it starts off kinda basic but the story really picks up on the road, i think the story line is nice! but will i get the second episode, well see"
666,"I played the first game a couple of years ago and loved it - despite some issues it had with moment-to-moment dialogue, the larger story and the atmosphere were enough to pull me in and remember it years after.

This game initially didn't hit as hard - on my first attempt, I stopped playing an hour in, as the plot started dropping bombs before I was able to get familiar with all the characters.
On my second attempt, I played a little faster, knowing what's about to happen, and pushed the story further than before. That's when the relationship between the brothers starts to solidify and I got pulled in, finishing the game within a couple of days. I didn't find it to be such an emotional rollercoaster as the last game was, as it seems to feature less upbeat moments. Still, there are certain story beads that hit really hard.

One thing I found myself missing a bit is time to know other characters better. Due to the story of the game, it's not unreasonable that you cannot form relationships that last multiple episodes, but I missed it nonetheless. The moment-to-moment dialogue issue from the first game is almost gone and talking to others feels more natural and insightful, so having more characters return could be really powerful. Although, the upside of that is that the bond that's formed between the brothers is unlike any other - it feels special in that way.

I liked the graphics and the soundtrack too, the end, 9/10"
667,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHSO FUCKING GOOD
668,very good
669,"When you take 2 minutes to take a breath and think on your ultimate decision... And then you get the best finale you could have had. Badd@ss! 
Such an emotional journey <3"
670,"If you love Trump don't get this game because they make him out to be a bad guy.
If you hate Trump also don't get this game because you're gonna have to listen to characters talk about him.
Keep your politics out of our video games."
671,"I abandoned my friends and real life for two days just to binge play this, lol. was it worth it? ... yes, 100%, I'm having withdrawals. It's not as interactive or (in my opinion) as good as life is strange 1, but with that being said, I think this was a worthy game... with a different story, (very different from Life is strange 1). Overall, I would recommend this game, especially if you're a poc or come from a broken family, some of the events that occur in the game can hit close to home. It really makes you think.. from a different perspective. I personally did not cry playing this game, but there were pivotal moments that shook me to my core. Don't hesitate to purchase this game! :)"
672,to hell with that annoying little shit
673,THIS GAME WAS AWESOME! I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN THE PRIOR ONES AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT. GREAT STORY AND CHOICES!
674,yes
675,"Basically a playable chose-your-own-adventure story, I loved it. Great story, interesting endings, just really well done."
676,this game is absolute masterpiece! very detailed and realistic. cried too many timed x)
677,good
678,"This game is amazing, It has an amazing story line and great graphics. I highly suggest playing it."
679,nothing i disliked. amazing.
680,An excellent game in the series. If you loved the previous games. You will love this one too
681,the most cute relationship i've ever seen <33
682,boobs
683,Amazing storytelling just like its predecssor
684,"haha emp go brrrrrrrrr
"
685,"I have played both first game and before the storm which I really really love and enjoyed however this one, on the first Episode feels really great and interesting but the next episode is what made me refund the game without thinking. Its didn't feels like LiS games anymore. Your choice doesn't really matters. That stupid little brat Daniel gotta do what he want to do  anyways and ruin everything everytime. Like some people said this is Babysitting simulator. So its a NO for me. Disappointed !"
686,I just really love Daniel
687,Slow as dirt. Characters are losers. No fun
688,"I started playing this after finishing the first and Before The Storm. I loved both of those games. There was so much character development, your actions and choices actually made a difference, you played a female/feminine protagonist (I'll be honest, I've played plenty of male/masculine video game characters over the years) and the entire game was about the relationships you made with the people along the way. I truly felt like this game lost almost every aspect and essence from the first two. Your choices truly don't matter much, because each episode there are very similar endings (just with SLIGHT differences.) There was little to NO character development, SPECIFICALLY when we are talking about Daniel. Without spoiling anything, I will say this: chaos, problems, and violence continually occur due to Daniel's actions and choices, but he continues to make the same ones repeatedly so bad things keep happening. Then, after every single one of those happen, after NOT listening to his older brother Sean or actively acting against his wishes and requests, he BLAMES Sean every single time. Playing as Sean was extremely unfulfilling considering his entire character revolves around being a people pleaser and Daniel is above all else (even thought he is truly the source of all of their problems.) There was not one point in the game where I didn't feel like I was simply playing it to finish it. Other than Sean and Daniel, there is NO character development. There are new supporting characters/NPCs each and every episode, making it impossible to develop truly meaningful relationships with them and see them grow or change. I also found it extremely annoying how there was a 1 to 2 month time gap inbetween each episode (almost like they had to pass time in order for there to be a story?) There was a continual lack of plot other than the situations Daniel gets everyone into (traveling to a city your father mentioned in passing hardly counts as a compelling plot.) There were definitely some positives: I had sooo many glitches playing LiS And BtS, but had no visual glitches playing this one. I also thought it was a pretty visually stunning game, but I did play the remastered version. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this game. I would have rather watched the playthrough on YouTube and then played True Colors instead. Oh well!"
689,story is amazing and so emotional
690,"Dontnod doesn't fail on delivering the best kind of storytelling through deep character development, pleasing visual aesthetics, and of course, their peculiar ""hopeful-yet-melancholic"" music.

In LiS2, we follow the journey of two brothers, Sean and Daniel, who have their lives turned completely upside down following the tragic death of their dad. Fearing prosecution, The brothers decide that it's best to be on the run. We play as Sean, who has the colossal responsibility of looking after his younger brother through many ups and downs.

Personally, I've felt a deeper emotional connection to the characters in LiS2, compared to its predecessor. Maybe because the issues being tackled in the game hits a little closer to home, like siblings' relationships, family abandonment, and the heavy theme of racism.

All I can say is well done to the developers, you guys set the bar high with LiS1 and LiS: Before The Storm, but still delivered. It's wonderful you're able to continually produce something this magnificent. However, to be comparing the different titles would be unfair, they all have a special place in my heart.

I just love how finishing a LiS game leaves me feeling happy but also, at the same time, depressed. This is Life, I guess. Life is Strange."
691,Daniel is a little shit.. Game is a 5/5
692,raise a wizard boy simulator
693,beautiful
694,ezzz
695,great
696,"The first Life is Strange is a fantastic game and the sequel is nothing like it.

This game feels like any other visual novel. You keep playing it hoping that it will get interesting at some point but at some point you just give up.

The first game made you feel like a magician as you bended time to your will. The sequel offers nothing interesting.

I have only played it for a little over 5 hours and most of the time was trying to skip an unskippable cutscene.

Rarely have I been so disappointed in a game."

698,very nice game
699,I love the Life is Strange games. They are visual pleasing and have mastered story telling. The games sound track is one that i could listen to non stop. I cant wait to see future installments.
700,Political preaching simulator with a story on the side
701,ITS SO GODAMN GOOOOD
702,best game I've played in a while.
703,"This was f@cking awesome touching story in all episodes! 
It was like reading an exciting book.
I would like more American punk rock. 🤘"
704,its fun
705,Great opportunity to determine if it's only in the real world that you make poor life decisions.
706,This is a wonderful game. It's one you can play over and over and the story will change and evolve according to your choices.
707,"I really wanted to like this game because I loved LiS1 and BTS, but I just couldn't get myself to enjoy this. The premise of the story sounds great on paper but the execution was done poorly. You the player, as the older brother Sean are supposed to mentor and influence your younger brother Daniel to make the right decisions and use his powers responsibly, but you only end up with two options most of the time: either you are a complete pushover and you allow Daniel to do really stupid things and use his powers irresponsibly which ends up with both of you getting into boatloads of trouble, or you are a complete arsehole to him and you scold him every time he uses his powers irresponsibly, which makes him hate and despise you and not listen to you even more.

Daniel is extremely possessive over Sean and doesn't want to share him with anyone and will use his powers to physically assault people who form a close friendship with Sean if Sean is not careful. Sean is Daniel's property, and if Sean doesn't act like a yes man to every bad decision Daniel makes, then Daniel will eventually use his powers to bully Sean and sometimes even physically assault him or threaten his life. Daniel even eventually causes a permanent life long injury to Sean that causes him to become permanently disabled and is somehow not held responsible for what he did to his own brother.

Either way the whole premise of the game is: Daniel can't follow basic instructions and ends up getting both him and Sean into life threatening situations. Sean is then blamed for the bad decisions Daniel makes and has to pick up the pieces as Daniel heads on to the next horrible decision that will put both their lives in danger. Whether you treat Daniel as if he can do no wrong or you treat him like shit every time he does something stupid, ultimately Daniel's horrible decisions are baked into the story and can't really be prevented by player choice.

Daniel is the villain, but he is sold as the protagonist. After what Daniel did to Sean at the end of episode 3, I just wanted Sean to go to Mexico alone and leave Daniel to his own devices so that he could become the super villain he was clearly meant to be.

Some would say that Daniel is only a 10 year old child that was traumatised, which is why he acts out the way he does, but there are clear flashback scenes in the game that show that Daniel was a selfish entitled spoilt brat before all the trauma happened. Before the Seattle incident, Daniel's father Esteban would already blame Sean and coddle Daniel when Daniel did something wrong. Daniel would steal from Sean and lie to his father when he did bad things to Sean, and when all the trauma happened and Daniel discovered he had powers, it just escalated Daniel's already problematic behaviour to much higher levels, and Sean as always ended up being victimised by Daniel.

Either way, Daniel was written as an extremely unlikable character who has the mental and emotional capacity of a toddler rather than a 10 year old. I really grew to like Sean as a character, but seeing him being constantly put through the wringer by his selfish idiot younger brother and then getting blamed for it made me eventually quit this game before I could finish it.

The game also skips very important story plot developments between episodes and then expects you to read your journal to catch up on what happened, leaving those entire sections of the story without player choice, and you just having to deal with the consequences of what happened when you had no control.

Overall it was an unpleasant experience and I would not want to go through it again. Again, I loved LiS1 and BTS even with the cringe teenager slang and Chloe doing irresponsible and dumb stuff, but at least Chloe had a growth arc and she learned to be a better person as the story progressed whereas Daniel is completely irredeemable after episode 3 and just keeps making worse and worse decisions as the story goes on. So far this has been my least favourite entry in the LiS series, and I really am a big fan."
708,"Ep 4 and 5 are the only interesting ones. The way ending is decided is a very good idea, where you basically teach your brother to follow norms of society or to follow you.

But I will still give it a negative review, because the other games is the series are just so much better.

Lis 1 has good story
True colors put all the budget into world and characters 

This game lacks both"
709,"This game is truly amazing - it takes a second (at least for me) to feel connected to the characters, but as the game progresses, it's definitely easy to form a bond with Sean and Daniel. Unlike its predecessor, the second installment of Life is Strange doesn't have that central location that the player knows and loves, but instead takes you along as the two brothers travel across the country, so if you're the type of person who heavily prefers games that focus on one place, I'm not sure if I'd recommend this. One criticism that I've heard is that this game is too political and pushes a certain ideology - personally, I do see this, however, I don't mind, and it doesn't affect my opinion on the game, since I generally find it to be well-written and relevant to this day and age. Many people are going to disagree with me on this, but I find Sean's character to be more likable and relatable than Max from the first game, which makes me love this version a lot. Don't expect this game to be a sequel to the original, since it's very, very different. You don't have the supernatural power, but your younger brother does, and it's up to you to teach him how to use it safely and morally, as well as raise him in general. Contrary to the original, (IMO) in this Life is Strange, your choices have a substantial impact, even the ones that seem minuscule and don't clearly show that they matter after you make a decision. Overall, I love both games, and it's hard to compare them since they're so drastically different, but this one appeals to me more. Sorry this review was so long, but I love this game, and I hope you enjoy it too!"
710,If you hate a retard children don't play this game i warned you
711,"Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. I rarely cry, but it made me tear up. An amazing experience."
712,hmmmm this one is not time travel
713,well this doesnt need a review to buy u know what i mean....its a lis game
714,I bought this game so i can get with lyla at the end of it over all poggers
715,"I love the Life is Strange games. Life is Strange two was much better than I expected. The first one is my favorite so far, but I actually loved this one too. Very beautiful scenery and music."
716,"Got to kill a woman, feels good."
717,Uhm I actually forgot how good or bad this game was. Soo...
718,"It a good game, great story but really long for me. Compared to the other 2 games from life is strange, this one seems very long and dragged. I stopped playing after the 3rd episode because I did not feel like waiting around 3h per episode to find out what is going to happen. If you like the genre, the change is big you will like this, but it's definitely not for everyone"
719,"I'm going to be completely honest - I've enjoyed Life is Strange 2 more than the other Life is Strange games. Yes, you don't get a power, and your brother is the one with the ability - but it's not really about that for me. For me, Life is Strange 2 is about the way the brothers interact with each other, the influence on the world that they have, the relationships and character-development. Life is Strange 2 also takes place in far more environments than any other Life is Strange title. It's the perfect game to binge-play in one sitting (If you can handle around a whole days worth of sitting around)."
720,"Too long at some points (for example the part ""in the previous game"" that we can't pass). I thought it was less interesting as the first one because you can't try the different possibilities. But still a good game. But I would recommend the 1st more."
721,"★★★☆☆ Alright
What's Good:
- Better graphics than LIS1.
What's Bad:
- Worse story than LIS1."
722,[h1][/h1]
723,Love It
724,DNC simulator
725,Just wonderfull...
726,"the storyline will have you hooked and you will grow to love the brothers like they were your own. I think the pacing was really good, plus the actions you take lead to realistic endings. Personally, I would say this is my favourite installation out of LIS 1, 2 and True Colours."
727,Seth Rogan is best character
728,so good
729,The best game of the whole series. It's a pity there is no continuation
730,"like it
"
731,another godlike game dontnod doesnt miss
732,"As a bug of story-based games, I could say that ''OH, What a game! that was!''

I love series of LIS. Creators of it exactly know how to stole our hearts. Even though it is undeniable that the mechanics of the game is quite challenging; the story, characters, musics, and beautiful scenes of it compensate the backdraws. I internalize myself with our main characters Sean, and Daniel. This unique story reminded me again of what an extraordinary bond brotherhood is. Goodbye to my strong cutie wolves! ❤"
733,mega coolio woolio game very fun also very sad though there are lots of scenes that legit made me tear up lmao but its really fun very recommended
734,Another great game from Life is Strange series.
735,great game
736,"Having played the 2 previous Life is Strange games I thought I would give this a try as it was on offer.
The story and mechanics are very different to the other games but I still found it very enjoyable. The story is gripping and as always, matched with a top sound track.

I would recommend this game for others that have played other LiS games. Before playing I recommend you you the The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit as there is a slight over lap in the story."
737,"This game was great. Took me about 3 months on and off to finish it. It was a little slow paced at times but the story was still great and it showed the journey that the two brothers took. Throughout this game, there were many choices that I felt were impactful to the story. This game is still a masterpiece, with powerful graphics and just the right soundtrack. Really recommended."
738,An amazing sequel with some hidden callbacks to the original game!
739,"i like turtles
"
740,Best game I have played in a very long time played through episode 1 and just had to buy the rest
741,"It's been a few years since I played the first LiS and its expansion. And while it was full of tropes and some cheesy moments, I liked it for the ambivalence of its characters. My main takeaway was: Even the people that treat you worst probably hide some pain inside that, if uncovered, may lead to some common ground. The most stereotypical school bully may end up being somewhat relatable, empathy unlocks many doors.

And I can acknowledge that this is mostly a point of view of privilege. Some people are mistreated by the system in place, not just some people. So empathy won't help them very much. But still I think LiS 2 swung the pendulum too far in the other direction: This game is like a fairy tale with a clear cut good vs. evil plot. Some people are more or less angels, and others are assholes beyond redemption. I missed the gray areas that made LiS 1 so compelling.

Sure, this game can pluck on heart strings. But still I felt betrayed by the standards set by the series' first incarnation. I found no subtlety here."
742,nice i cried
743,"Yes, I recognise this as a well made game. I would like to point out however, that the writer didn't provide for a proper fully ""right"" ending. In this, no matter what you do, someone is screwed in the end."
744,"What a beautiful game, i loved it :)

it made me cry"
745,"i said surrender, he said no, i get killed, peak game"
746,"traumatised by the ending i got 

but other than that this game's right up there with lis 1"
747,no need to repeat my mistakes... no need to rob anyone
748,bread
749,made me cry
750,"I can't wait for the Life is Strange 4: Cornpop. Cause, you know, he was a bad dude!

Who's laughing now? I am. While I pay $4.30 a gallon and the world is on the brink of war. BUT MUH TRUMP'S FAULT!

Jerks."
751,"Too many cutscenes, kills the immersion totally, whats the point of this game then? LiS was 10x better than this. This is some cringy SJW movie thats all. You just sit and watch and watch and watch and watch the never ending gay scenes and you have no control over them other than clicking on a mouse button when youre told to click. I regret buying this.

Edit: Deleted the game, cant stand anymore"
752,"The game play is the same as the original Life is Strange i.e. a story driven adventure game. However, that is where the similarities end. The overall story is not compelling and doesn't make any sense from start to finish. The characters are not likable and don't even like each other 90% of the time. Whereas the first game, you immediately felt connected to the story and to Max and Chloe in some form. 

***Spoilers ahead***

I just can't connect with Sean and Daniel. They make stupid choice after stupid choice throughout the whole game. As a 16 and 9 year old I find it highly unlikely that they would just run away in the very beginning after their dad was shot and killed. They seem to have had a pretty decent and ""normal"" life up to that point; some racism aside of course. But you didn't see the racism until the police officer made an unlawful discrimination against the 2 boys after the neighbor kid fell and hurt himself. Then the story just shoves the topic of racism down your throats the rest of the game with everyone they meet that isn't white except for the hobo kids. Even their grandmother imposed some racial stereotypes on the boys. The topic of racism and the scenarios that the boys go trough are believable as I've heard similar stories from friends (thought with less violence as the outcome), but not every redneck is a racist story designers. That in itself is diving into stereotypes. 

Racism and stereotypes aside, the story is just not compelling like with Max and Chloe. Its just a story about 2 kids that ran away from home to escape potential racial persecution (which we don't even know if that is truly the case, but the story designers make us go down that road). There may be some people that can relate to this, but I cannot. Similarly to the first game, I'm not a female nor a possible LGBTQ person, so I can't relate to some of the decisions in the first game, but not every choice in the first game leads to the main characters being together intimately. This game doesn't give you an option of finding a solution that doesn't involve Sean going to jail for crimes he didn't commit or running away to Mexico and away from his past or just plain dying because of his dumb choices. If it had that option it may have been a little better.  But for me it is a thumbs down."
753,Pretty nice follow up even though it is more of a side story than an actual sequel. I do appreciate the strong brotherly bond this game has. Definitely a recommend for me!
754,GOAT
755,"This one is so good, it hits hard in so many real life issue aspects that just makes you have to stop and think so much. An emotional rollercoaster is no where close to how I'd describe the journey this game took me on. This was an experience I'm glad I took and I'm very pleased with the one ending I got that I actually don't think I want to play it again, despite how much I loved it. How the wolf brother's story ended, for me, was beautiful in all its many choices. <3"
756,"One of the best life is strange games, the bond between two brothers really makes it unique and beautiful."
757," - Would I recommend this game?
Absolutely loved playing this game, I just finished the last chapter and the story it tells is truly unique. An experience i can highly recommend to anyone up for a great story.

 - How does it stack up against the other Life is Strange games?
I played both the first part of LIS (Life is Strange), as well as Before the storm and i must say this one can definitely keep up with those amazing other games i played before!

 - What is this game about?
It tells the story of two brothers, Sean and Daniel that are on a journey to find peace and a new home. But I don't want to give away too much, it's a great game, see for yourself :)

PS: I bought the game & dlcs (because every episode is a dlc) on sale for 12€ but what you get is definitely worth more than that."
758,"Believe me, Max and Chloe are near and dear to my heart but I love my wolfie boys too. The heart of this game is the raw and real bond between brothers and even though I'm an only child I loved every second of their relationship"
759,yes
760,"An awesome adventure full of beautiful moments.

At first I didn't know where the story would go, but along the way it all made more sense.
It's probably meant to be like that, since Sean and Daniel don't exactly know [spoiler]how to get to Puerto Lobos either.[/spoiler] That's how adventures start!
In the end, I was happy to experience that (what I think) is the best ending: [spoiler]Sean spends time in prison and after that they all meet again.[/spoiler]

The game has beautiful graphics. Especially the lighting looks very good. It is a high quality game.
There are so many detailed environments which you get to explore!

In a way quite different from the original Life is Strange, but I liked the references to it. It is really cool to see that all characters exist in the same universe!

Play the original first, then Before the Storm and then this one.
Totally recommended."
761,good storyline.
762,the story is fascinating and I was wrapped in it from episode 1
763,I like it
764,"this is the second game that makes you cry every minute after telltales the walking dead 

No way you won't like it

Actually yeah, you won't like it...cause you're gonna love it..."
765,none of these endings happened actually theyre lying
766,"Dismissed this game for years due to the mixed reviews, but finally decided to play it during lockdown and was blown tf away. Wished I didn't listen to negative reviews at the time and experienced it on my own. I went in with no expectations and no idea what to expect other than Daniel's telekinesis power.

It is an amazing game with a meaningful story that leaves a lasting impression and is my favourite title from the franchise. It also felt like the most relatable game for me.

The characters, locations, moments and music are so memorable. 

To this day, Life is Strange 2 is the only game in the LiS franchise where your choices actually matter and effect the ending. 

First playthrough I got the Blood Brothers ending, second playthrough I got the Parting Ways ending."
767,"Wow, so I finished Episode 1, and everything was really well done! It is a huge improvement from the first, in terms of visuals and interactions. I'm really having a blast so far, and I can recommend this, the relationship between the two brothers is so real, lots of sad moments, but also uplifting."
768,"I'm a massive fan of the first Life is Strange, and it's sad that this game just doesn't cut it.

I'll start with a few positives that were appreciated (though by no means enough to compensate for the negatives):
+ The game looks beautiful, the graphical improvement is a big one compared to the first game.
+ Gameplay is a lot smoother, and is a proper upgrade with a bunch of quality of life improvements

Now for the bad parts:
I didn't get past episode 1 because of the way the game handles politics, it is laughably bad. The first LiS had politics, but it was portrayed in a subtle way and it made sense. In LiS 2, the characters are straight up cringe worthy stereotypes, no one acts the way most of the characters are written. It's the whole ""white people evil"" and ""murica bad"" narrative, it's forced down your throat. It's really sad, because I wanted to like this game, but it's ruined by bad writing."
769,noice
770,its so good
771,it a really good game
772,Epic
773,"game is very symbolic to depression, very progressive gameand the art is beautiful HOWEVER the writing was not the best, voice acting was comical, and if we are comparing this to Life is Strange 2 there is zero comparision."
774,"This game is incredible, even if it's left me an emotional wreck, I cried at least once in every episode and spent all of episode 4 in tears or very close to tears and cried the entire ending. It's fucking emotional but also brilliant, its a wonderful story line, with compelling characters and SO much emotional life between all the characters, I 100% want to play again (to get another ending + revisit my favourite brothers + get achievements) but I think this game has genuinely left me too emotionally distraught to do that right now. 

It takes a hell of a compelling story with good characters to create such a powerful reaction from me so I definitely recommend this but maybe have caution if you're over emotional... because I'm genuinely not over emotional or sensitive in general and I was still reduced to tears multiple times."
775,"This game is so good! I love the characters, the choices, and the voice acting! It's easy to get sucked into the world of Sean and Daniel! My favorite is Finn and I'm so glad that he's a romantic option for Sean."
776,"Played this again for my Let's Play on YouTube and man, this was a journey worth revisiting. Very strong story that touches on a lot of issues but the main focus is of course the story of the brothers. It is quite intense with a lot of upsetting moments but very good and like the first LiS game, your choices do matter. Highly recommend it and the first game by a long shot."
777,"This game is hands down my favorite game of all time, and the best of the Life is Strange series. Would highly, highly recommend to anyone remotely interested. Played it through fully three times and it never gets old, and always manages to leave a big hole in my heart at the end-- in the best way."
778,"amazing
"
779,"i am in love with this game, i love the emotion it invokes"
780,This game is horrible compared to LiS1 and LiS Before the Storm.....it shouldn't even be called Life is Strange.......but its still worth a play through. 5.5/10
781,A very boring game.
782,good story. Just play!!!!
783,"Highly recomended, bonus that David made it in the story. Also a very sad and heartbreaking story"
784,"In my opinion, this is the best Life Is Strange game. It was a risky as hell follow up to the first game and the reviews reflect that. Some of the risks they took:

- You don't control the powers anymore. Your nine year old brother Daniel does, and he disobeys sometimes.
- Daniel behaves like an actual kid. He's a brat, and annoying depending on your tolerance for kids.
- Dontnod tackles racism in this game, and more specifically the political climate around Trump's election.
- They completely drop the ""wish fulfilment"" aspect of the first game.
- You're on the run, so there aren't many recurring characters.

By taking these risks, they alienated a lot of the audience of the first game... but for those of you who played the first game and enjoyed the realistic portrayals of pain, the themes of grief, the absolutely novel (in gaming) main characters and experiences, and the kickass music, you'll find something here to love.

I didn't appreciate this game the first time I played it as much as I do after playing Life is Strange: True Colors. That game is a safe, watered down sequel to Life is Strange 1, with all of the wish fulfilment and none of the risks. That's what this game could have been, if Dontnod wasn't amazing.

Some of the things I love about this game that distinguish it from the other LiS games:

- Your decisions affect Daniel's personality. He's watching and learning from you. This makes the usually shallow choices add up over time, together having a much larger impact.
- The way they handled the big end-of-game choice was smart as hell.
- There aren't many games out there that put you into a parenting role to the extent that this game does. I would LOVE to see more of this in games.
- The relationship between Sean and Daniel is really special. Chloe and Max's relationship was special too, so I guess this isn't really a differentiator, but I had to mention it because goddamn do these developers know how to write the ups and downs of a close relationship."
785,I cant even put it words how much i love this game and the series. HANDS down one of the best games that i binged. My next one is True Colors.
786,"amazing  game ,love the art and the story ,my all time fave"
787,Good start. But then nothing makes sense few minutes later. There is lack of plot credibility. The setting is beautiful though. Had to drop the game after 2 hours. I loved Life is strange and that is why I bought it. I hope next one is better (true colours) but I will pay attention to reviews and to walkthrough on youtube before buying it.
788,good game. made me tear up at the end. i feel empty now. recommend playing unless you're already depressed.
789,"At first i was upset at the turn the game had taken from the previous one, i wanted a carbon copy, but the more i played the more i started loving the characters and the braveness of the game in exploring difficult subjects. I'm now glad that they didn't make a copy of the previous game and it was such a twist to (SPOILERS FOR THE VERY FIRST CHAPTER:)





find out that Daniel was the one with the powers, i was confused at the narrative and how it would work, but it ended up being an interesting way to include Daniel into the story more fluidly. Gotta say I cried a few times, the only issue was that while the facial expressions got better from the previous game the mouth movements were a bit silly, so i didn't get the full experience of bawling my eyes out to emotional faces, instead bawling my eyes out to muppets. (That's a joke, love 'em). Anyways! i would recommend this game for the people who are into adventures, meeting new people and seeing where the story takes you.

Also i have to mention this, the story options were a bit misleading at times LOL, as in the things Sean had the option to say were either confusing or didn't match what i wanted to say, often being too agressive. But then again, i'm a very passive person. Great story <3"
790,cool
791,"amazing game, love the story"
792,"A few years late but this game lowkey sucks.

the powers are just some dumb thing that allows the devs to push the story for no reason,
the choices feel like they have no real impact to the story,
the forced political agenda is usless and has no need for the story,
overall shit and lowkey dissapointing"
793,I finished the game a year ago and I'm still not over it.
794,it is really intense but it gives a good story to play and love
795,"Finished the game.. This is one of the best game in my opinion.. The graphics is intense, BEST STORY GAME.
The ending to this game made me cry. Honestly its my favourite game of all time... I love this single player game. ❤❤❤❤❤😍"
796,Boring as fuck boyos
797,I always liked this genre of games. And this game is one of the best i played in this genre.

800,THIS GAME IS AMAZING
801,GOOD
802,This game is the reason i cry to sleep at night
803,nu
804,"This is frustrating, and it doesn't have the magic of Life is Strange 1, it's a good game but not for me."
805,IT IS SO FUN
806,loved it!
807,Throughout my time playing this I was captivated by the brilliant story. Totally recommend making a cup of tea and play this in 30-60 minute session every evening.
808,"Life is strange 2 is one of my favorite visual novel games. It has a great music with a great graphic that make a player have lot of great experience while playing. I like how they’ve developed the quality of the game a lot from their previous game. 
          This game is about 2 brothers who have a problem in their hometown so they design to escape from that situation and start a new life with each other. The game show us about the relationship of the sibling and development of the characters in each episode. From the very beginning, I actually like the story that representing a relationship between sibling so this game was made me buy it even easier. 
          The main characters are 2 brothers, the oldest name’s Sean and the youngest name’s Daniel. Their character design is very pretty and they’re looking like the real Mexican teenager, for other characters they have a very unique design too so that they can be easy to remember. For the voice acting I like Sean’s voice the most because his voice can show how he feel from the situation he’s facing with really good and into the character especially when he’s in the hard situation his voice also really into it while Danial’s voice isn’t show the feeling of the character that much, when he have a hard time or use his power I don’t feel the feeling of him through his voice that makes me have a little disappointment but overall Daniel’s voice also fit with his characteristic and his age. 
          The scene of this game is great and it has a different kind of places that very beautiful and charm with the music that give me a really good mood and good atmosphere for each episode and story that make me enjoy all of the moments.
          The story of this game is very interesting for the first episode because they’ve been through a lot of problem and a lot of hard time especially for Sean who need to take care not only himself but also his younger brother but for another episode it far away from the original presented story because it has negligible moments that does not matter later in the story but they’re just put it in the game and make the player feel  afraid of making mistakes for only not to hurt Sean or Daniel that doesn’t really make sense and I feel bad for seeing Sean hurt because he’s my favorite character. I like that there’re also have character developed that make Daniel more grown up (a little) for each episode. For the consequences of all of the story that I’ve been through I want to say that I play this game twice from the first episode to the end and I got different consequences and didn’t knew why but it’s great to see that the choices that I make can impact the ending part. 
          For people who like to play the story that have many different endings and have good atmosphere that you can feel along while playing the story I think this game is very worth buying. You will like the relationship between 2 brothers and their journey like I do. 
          Overall, this game is very good to give it a try once even though you played Life is strange 1 before but they give a different feeling and atmosphere and this game focus on a relationship of sibling more than the previous game so who’s into this relationship shouldn’t miss it."
809,"A great Life is Strange game
I am a big fan of the series!! Just love the pair of Sean and Daniel in the whole story!"
810,"this game is better than life
"
811,"I love the adventures, the stories, their bond.. It feels so real and emotional. There's so many beautiful place in this game, which make the game longer. I wish there's another story of this awesome wolf brother. Awooooooo"
812,"If you want an action oriented game this is not for you. If you like an engaging story, with lots of twists, and the ability to choose your own choices, well then you are in luck. This game marks all of the checks. Good story, good characters, and enough input to keep you engaged. I've love this series thus far, and i'm sure i'll love it going into the future. if you enjoy a good story without the need for a crazy amount of input, this series is right up your lane. 9 out of 10 in regards to the story."
813,"Things change
People changes
Never feel like you see through a person
Everyone has his own pursuit

Just like what Sean says
No es un Eldorado"
814,"it kinda didnt meet the expectations i had for it, since i loved LiS1 and LiS: before the storm. first two eps were kinda boring, ep 3 and 4 were amazinggg, ep 5 was okay. the music is cool, i loved the minigame it had in the store, i love how we can teach daniel high/low morals. its really good, some of it was meh i guess. also the character designs arent cool at all. theyre boring and average. so yeah play it its great. 7/10"
815,"[ SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING AND MORE ] The game it self was pretty alright I loved the game that is for sure. I do how ever have a LOT I did not enjoy and do not recommend this game for everyone. First off I understand the time of which this game was made it touched on issues they felt needed light shed on which was cool and ballsy. It was a game that took me a while to get past the first 2 episodes. This game tho should have and shouldn't have gone down a news coverage route and did something a little different. I also understand racial stuff was high at the time and so on but to use a police shooting and ""The wall"" was a bit annoying. As someone who plays games for a living I play them to escape the reality and not to be put back into it. Which this game kept doing. I do however enjoyed captain spirit and it's touch on the achololic abusive household and more. I also enjoyed how I got to meet david and know what went down with the first game. Seeing him amazed at daniels power and did not know about max being clueless was enough to get me cheesing for hours. Now for my biggest issues, the last episodes final moments. I did not like how daniels power was a possible ploy to get them to use his power to well ""Break down walls"". I think they should have used it diffierently. The next big thing that was annoying which I really pray for the series was to see a good ending where Daniel used his powers for good, they lived in mexico, and did not grow up into 2033 where maybe they could have made a game with tons of people who had super powers. Still depending on your views of religion, sex, or border stuff. This game won't be for you that is for sure. I just wish it dealt with smaller topics but I did enjoy the art aspects and the drawing. The best part still is the plack for Arcadia Bay, and david now takes poleroid pictures lol."
816,"Life is Strange 2 is primarily about the transformative nature of the loss. In the first plan, it is a literal transformation, where again one of the characters is endowed with supernatural abilities. In the second plan, it is again an introspective and inner transformation of characters who face everyday problems, but which are even more emphasized and dramatized by the addition of supernatural forces. Again, the game adds a lot of meta elements, a good dose of references to pop culture and political commentary on current topics. All wrapped up in the form of an independent road movie.

We get to brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz, who live happily in Seattle. However, with such a surname, it is not entirely without confrontations, as there are more Sasquatches than Mexicans in the state of Washington. Add to that a slightly dysfunctional family, tensions between siblings with a larger age difference, and the daily pitfalls of gradual adolescence.
The first episode starts on a positive note, but it doesn't take long. A common skirmish with a slight hint of xenophobia between two young men results in a tragedy, which is immediately followed by another, which awakens in the younger Daniel the supernatural abilities of telekinesis. But you don't know what he can do. He doesn't know about it himself and you will embark on the next journey with him. In addition to growing up and running away, he is also on his way to getting to know his new self.

Like the first part, the second part does not address where these abilities come from and why they manifested in this character and in this form. The game deals with how it changes the character. However, there is a new perspective compared to the unit.
However, not in the first part, a character you do not control has abilities here. So you ""work"" with abilities, and moral aspects still come into it. However, Daniel's ability is more destructive, and at a young age you must also think about what pattern of behavior you will gradually begin to present to him. Not only in dialogues, but also in how you push him to use force in certain situations.

Take into account that you are facing a series of difficult situations. Escape from home is just the beginning of it all. Even the obvious moments of happiness do not last long here, and somewhere deep within you you feel that another hard slap awaits you around the nearest corner. [b] 80%  [/b]"
817,GOOD GAME!!
818,Nice game
819,heartbreaking but beautiful <3
820,"[b] A lot of things have changed in ""Life is Strange 2"", although it is basically the same as the series' previous entries. Yes, It follows the same exact movie like recipe that already worked perfectly, but storywise it is about the adventures of two entirely new characters (we are still inside the same universe though). Artistic visuals, well built protagonists, awesome voice acting performances, fantastic music and a touching story complete a great experience. Unfortunately secondary characters are a lot shallower than the previous games, while sometimes it feels more like a messy teenage road adventure. Yet, it manages to criticize some serious social-political issues and offer some strong emotional moments inside this unique journey.


Manometer: 8/10[/b]


The good
- Gorgeous visuals. Artistic, painted like graphics with vivid colors and atmospheric lighting. Some sceneries look absolutely majestic.
- Fantastic world design with many regions to visit. From forests and mountains to deserts and villages. Interiors have also tons of details decorated with every kind of small objects. Its world is a lot bigger than the previous two games.
- Deep, well built main characters. The evolution of their personalities through all these events during their journey is remarkable and smooth. It's awesome to see Sean and Daniel grow up and get mature. It is very interesting to watch their relationship evolving too.
- The story is good and has some great moments full of strong emotions and touching moments. Maybe it is too messy for my taste at some points, but It will firmly hook you till the very end.
- It feels like a movie. Fantastic direction and photography. Ιt is patient with a lot of atmospheric filler and establishing shots between the important scenes.
- Outstanding voice acting performances. Characters feel so natural and emotional when they talk.
-  Does not hesitate to be political. In fact the whole game is a criticism on some serious social and political issues like immigration, racism, families' structure, stereotypes, police brutality, religions' role, sexual orientation and more. It does a really good job to expose many social norms and make players rethink of them.
- Great music that fits perfectly to each scene and always manages to enhance the atmosphere.
- It seems like the choices you make have much bigger impact than the previous two games of the series. The whole experience changes a lot by alternative choices. Also now a set of decisions determine the final story's outcome and not a single one towards the end. 
- Well written, interesting dialogues. You will never get bored of having one more conversation.
- You can perform a bunch of small actions scattered around the world. Although they are practically insignificant they play an important role on the atmosphere's built up and the way you experience the story. They also motivates you to explore more.
- Awesome characters' visual design. It is great to watch Sean and Daniel change haircuts and clothes, get wounded etc. from scene to scene. 
- Facial animations are decent and for sure a lot better than previous games' emotionless poker faces. Body animation are good and pleasant enough.
- There are some interesting gameplay implementations mainly when you have to order Daniel on how to use his powers.
- Diary, backpacks' inventory and souvenirs are well designed offering a bunch of useful information.

The bad
- It seems to me that it lacks the calmness and inner strength of the previous two games and it is closer to a messy teenage action - road movie at some points. There are too many twists and a lot of events have to do with Daniels' power. It is still a well balanced story that sometimes it just gets a bit extravagant.
- Instead of focusing to human relationships between three or four strong main characters (which is already a complex task) the developers decided to throw inside the story a lot more shallower secondary ones. From hippies and lonely travelers to religious cultists and mafia bosses, most of them seem to be caricatures, they don't have an important role and the game fails to make you bond emotionally to them.
- Drawing with Sean is a nice addition that could offer some moments of calmness if only the drawing mechanics were not that boring and uninspiring. There was much more potential there.
- Controls could be better. You will often find it difficult to select the desired object if there are others close to it."
821,This game is so sad i love it!!!
822,"As a die-hard Life is Strange 1 fangirl, I've adored the first installment in the series for many years now. I've heard negative press and have seen bad reviews for Life is Strange 2, which ultimately led me to sleeping on it by shoving it further and further down my backlog. Wow, what a mistake that was. It's not that I was never going to play it or give it a chance simply because I saw people complaining about it or giving it bad reviews, but, let's just say that I wasn't as excited about playing it due to a number of factors. I really wish that I disregarded all of these variables and played this game much sooner.

In my opinion, Life is Strange 1 and 2 evenly trade blows. One will have weaknesses where the other has strengths. In Life is Strange 2, you do not have the luxury of becoming too attached to a certain place or person because you are constantly on the move. You also do not get your own superpower, however, you are constantly in the company of your little sibling who does have a superpower. That being said, despite the fact that your little brother does have a superpower, be aware that it's scarcely used and doesn't have as prominent of a presence as the first game's power did.

However, this game does one up Life is Strange 1 in a few ways. For starters, this game is longer. You get more playtime due to having to compensate for the main protagonist not having his own superpower. The original game spent a lot of time rewinding and having you re-trace your steps. Subsequently, Life is Strange 2 features longer scenes and locations where you must perform certain tasks. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage will depend heavily on whether or not you vibe with the game. The graphics are also much improved from the original (not taking the remastered collection into account) and lip syncing and facial emotions are much more aligned with what the characters are saying or feeling. Also, your choices matter much more with this game. While Life is Strange 1 gave you two potential endings, this one gives you seven potential endings. The choices that you make along the way heavily factor into how the ending is going to play out. As much as I loved Life is Strange 1, I can admit that some (though not all) choices were rather trivial and did not factor into the grand scheme of things.

Ultimately, Life is Strange 1 feels like home while Life is Strange 2 feels like going on a journey. In the first game, you have the constant denominators of Blackwell Academy and Arcadia Bay. Here, you are on a seemingly endless quest towards a goal that requires you to never stay in one place for too long. You don't get attached to the friends that you make or the places you see because you simply do not have time to. However, I do feel that this is part of Life is Strange 2's charm. In a real life scenario of this sort, being on the run for real would make it impossible to form the same level of connections that Life is Strange 1 had you form. This doesn't make the game better or worse than the first one, however, they are both just very fundamentally different in this regard. You do feel a sense of deep bonding akin to Max and Chloe, although this time it's the familial bonds of two siblings who are strengthening their kinship towards one another.

I know that some people feel as though the political matters in this game were overblown or overly exaggerated. I somewhat agree, however, I also feel as though they were tactfully used to build the atmosphere of the game. The atmosphere is that you are an outcast who was dealt a very bad hand which was very heavily attributed to your ethnicity. If they downplayed the political nature of the game and made it more subtle (even though I do feel as though many people face such issues every day, so it's not overly unrealistic) then the impact would have not hit you as hard. After all, you are in the shoes of the protagonist, and the main driving force in the game is how badly the world around you ends up treating you. This ends up being the motivational raw force that makes seeing the journey through to the very end, come what may, a satisfying and very rewarding experience.

As usual, in Life is Strange fashion, there's a gorgeous soundtrack that is very heavy handed on the good indie stuff that you otherwise would be unlikely to come across on your own. I do feel as though the songs from Life is Strange 1 were more memorable for me, however, Life is Strange 2 still had its own moments of musical brilliance. Cassidy's acoustic guitar ballad was dreamy, for example, and oozed with the classic Life is Strange soundtrack vibe that we all know and love. In fact, the musical presence in this game actually makes it very nostalgic and relatable to the first Life is Strange, if I'm honest. Even though you have new protagonists, a new superpower, new environments, new side characters, etc., the music itself feels very Life is Strange, and that was a constant mood throughout the whole game.

All in all, this is a beautiful game that is very much worth playing, regardless of whether or not you are an OG Life is Strange fan. It is different, of course, so don't go into it expecting it to be a carbon copy of the first game. Similarly to the game Tell Me Why, which has strong Life is Strange vibes, that was its own standalone game. This one might have Life is Strange in its title but also feels like a standalone game. This isn't a bad thing, though. It's just vastly different from the first one. People will either embrace the differences or will absolutely hate them. I loved the differences. I loved the new characters, the new environments, and the new journey that these two brothers set out on. I still love Max and Chloe, Arcadia Bay, and Blackwell Academy as well. Both stories and both sets of quirky characters have made a home in my heart, where they co-exist peacefully, and I will forever have a fondness for the Life is Strange game franchise."
823,the first title was better for me! but thanks for setting the first episode for free!!! <3
824,balls
825,"good game
"
826,"The DONTNOD team outdid themselves with this game, a very emotional experience. If you enjoyed Life is Strange 1, you should definitely give this one a try! Both games are different, they tell different stories, different characters, different lessons, however this game series (1, 2 and probably also ""True Colors"") shines the most giving you choices on really small things that carry weight in the long run."
827,"Don't get me wrong, the story is great, with amazing character development and twists, etc. but I've played this game for 12 hours, and I haven't played the last episode yet, and the reason for it is that it's... boring. Too many cutscenes. This game feels like a movie. A game. Feels like a movie. This is not what videogames are. I'm tired of the game industry feeding us scenes instead of gameplay.
It feels like videgames are dying, to be honest... And a slow death to that because of the players that think scenes and story is more relevant than gameplay."
828,"this game is boring, as a creator, the worst you could do is to make a boring game. You just walk and then a cutscene starts, walk again, then another cutscene and so on... oooooooooh and by the way, YOU CAN'T GET YOUR  MONEY BACK!!!!! I tried, EVEN IF YOU PLAYED WITHIN 2 HOURS!!! This is a total ripoff. DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH! It's boring and pointless, I wanted to give it a chance and when I played it, I got bored immediately."
829,just a good game
830,"David is a hippie, 4/5 game.

831,very good. i cried
832,Pretty cool game and interesting storyline
833,"Holy shit another game that made me cry, this series seems to be good at that"
834,i'm cry
835,this game would be better if i was overdosing
836,"Just overall a fantastic game. My favorite out of these games so far, hell, one of the best games i've ever played (I like to keep that list long lol, but still, earned)"
837,"The characters are ANNOYING. You may say, am I overreacting? Nope. The game fails to keep me interested. The main character who we play as gets on my nerves. I can't deal with him, and his stupid actions. We can't influence his personality, basically making me annoyed the entire time. 

Do not buy. Not worth it. Spring for Life is Strange True Colors instead if you want a good Life is Strange game."
838,"Great story, great soundtrack, great graphics, great everything. Same as LiS 1, definitely one of m favorite games ever"
839,Raising a kid with all the trauma but without having to get milk if you f it up 10/10
840,"this game makes me think life is strange
Good
"
841,"made me cry and sob for and hour, 10/10"
842,"I don't know the people that hate this game but i find this game enjoyable, slow plot at the middle but it will get you punched at the last"
843,"Pretty cool extension to a Life is Strange Universe. Definitely worth checking out, even if only for a one-shot playthrough. Maybe not for a full price. 
Overall quite an enjoyable adventure."
844,"at the time of writing this, i am in the middle of episode 4. 
easily one of the best story-based games i've ever played so far. the characters are unique and their actions and motivations feel very relatable. excellent soundtrack, decent graphics, smooth gameplay, max settings at 3440x1440 on budget hardware.
it features almost every human emotional state, depicted in a realistic way and almost all of your actions and decisions matter and change the course of the story in different ways. which is also one of the hardest parts of the game (given you don't want to google the implications of every decision you make). the overall mood is heavily accompanied by melancholy, so i understand if it's not everybody's cup of tea. 10/10 for me though, what a beautiful journey!"
845,Discontinued ;) smoke ganjhaaaaa

"
852,I definetly didnt cry when my brother turned into a phycopath and got me killed at the end
853,"life is a drag
pacing is hard
endless, empty cutscenes
should not pass for art

0/10

pro-tip: use the cutscenes to make coffee while not missing anything of importance to the story, or step out for a smoke to make sure your Life is Short 2"
854,"its just so good, the story-line is incredible and the graphics are amazing. This is definitely my favorite life is strange. I love the fact that the choices you choose always impact the game in further episodes and its just so good! The only thing about this is that it does glitch out sometimes and i would have really loved a Jacob romance."
855,"A love letter for woke people.
Left propaganda."
856,"It's good, but it has lost a lot the magic of the first game. The success of the first one was accredited to the emotional story, but LiS1 was more than just a movie. There were light puzzle mechanics, satisfying gameplay/decision making, all wrapped in a mystery story. [spoiler]The only aim of this sequel is to raise your brother to be a good person (or fail to) and uses interesting mechanics to calculate morality vs relationships [/spoiler], [spoiler] with 4 possible endings as opposed to the polarizing 2 of its predecessor. [/spoiler] 

The issue I have with this sequel is that it takes the gameplay out nearly entirely. It fits thematically, as you are not the one with powers and are merely a witness most of the time, but it does not make as fun of a [i] game [/i]. 

The first game was a game AND an experience, while this one is solely a story with alternate endings. 

Also content warning Hate Crime [spoiler] They make you a victim of three racism fueled hate crimes over the course of the game which you can not stop, avoid, or skip. Kidnapping, assault, and than another assault.[/spoiler]"
857,"I played this game during two separate occasions. I stopped the first time at chapter 3 because I felt kind of annoyed by Daniel, the little brother, since I'm not a kids fan. Every whining or cry or acting like a spoiled kid just made me want to shut down the game. Then I came back fresh new after a year and finished it, thankfully.

Even if I had issues with the character I could sympathize and get involved with the story, which is narrated wonderfully. Like the first LIS this game focuses on the story and tells it in a way that you can't hide your emotions when facing some situations. The world is real, unfortunately sometimes too real, and heartbreaking. It shows you the difficulties of being an immigrant in a country where there are many people that are not that open minded. It also shows love, though. You live through injustice the whole game and end up with an ending (of five available) that will stab your hearth with pain, sadness and maybe a little bit of joy, just like life does. 

A chapeau to the music and directions of the scenes, super high quality just like in the first LIS.

One small note. This game was published in 2018 and still they can't make good facial animations? Like, really? The whole game revolves around the actors and the characters and it's such a shame to see two people hugging in tears and watch their faces like if they were emotionless toys from a cartoon with tears dropped on their cheeks."
858,"First off, I want to say that I did not hate story, I just never got truly invested to it, but I did appreciate the story that the game was trying to tell, the story was okay, most of the characters were annoying, the soundtrack was fantastic, the choices were a bit lacking, the art style was good. I feel like the power this time around was under utilized as there were not enough instances for Daniel's power to be used. Most of the characters introduced either annoyed the hell out of me or I did not care about them at all. I did enjoy the fact that most of your choices can affect the ending you would get compared to the A or B ending of the first game. I would only recommend that you buy this if it was on sale, otherwise don't bother and just stick with the first one. I would give it a 6/10"
859,Awesome!!!
860,Super great game!
861,An emotional roll'n coaster(Episode 1). Can't wait to play rest of the episodes!
862,Did not like the writing.
863,Very immersive storyline. You really feel with the characters. Music and sound is spot on. Drawbacks are that there are a lot more cut scenes than there are clues/puzzles. Most of the time it also feels too much like running down a corridor rather than an open world. The story still makes up for these shortcomings.
864,yes
865,"I love this game. It's such an interesting concept. It's about brotherhood, parenthood, control, friendship, and living up to your actions. I think it's my favourite LIS so far. Even tho I got frustrated a lot, it also got me thinking why. And well it's amazing frankly."
866,sobbing
867,very good
868,ive played games since i was little and there has been no game like life is strange 2 the story is amazing and the game is so beautiful you can tell that they put lots of effort and time into the game and characters thank you to all the developers that could make this game possible
869,very well put together game with amazing storyline and characters
870,This game is so good the ending had me bawling for 2 months straight! I've never thought I had a strange relationship with characters that don't exist. I love drawings and I'm planning to copy Sean's art work on my old sketch book one day if I want to. I give it a 10/10! What a masterpiece!

873,good good
874,"For storytelling gamers, this is a great game."
875,The story line was impressively immersive. I felt a connection with the characters as the story went by. Also loved how certain characters are not who they seem they are at first glance (e.g. Broody who turned out awesome). There were certainly a lot of plot twists which made the story way more interesting and action packed scenes which leaves you yearning for more.
876,"I would recommend this game to others if they haven't played it already. If you like Life is Strange 1 then you will probably enjoy this game, at least for the graphics upgrades if not the story. They are still using the same Game Engine but the Graphics have been updated, True colors is also out which i recommend."
877,"I really enjoyed Life is Strange but I have hard feelings with its sequel so far.

Contrary to the first episode, I really struggle to empathise with the characters, maybe it's the fact that the main character is not the one you are in control of, or it's because there're on the move and I can't get a feel of community has I had at Blackwell.

Or maybe it's because, as for A Tale Plague, I have to deal with an idiotic brother that makes me want get a vasectomy and never have kids ? Seriously why have kids to be that stupid in video games ? Hopefully they do not have to hide during war times because they would not survive 24 hrs with Daniel around.

Last but not least, Sean makes me feel like I am suffering depression. Max lived through very difficult experiences but she tackled them brilliantly  and it was great to empathise with her. Sean come on, you can do a round of laundry without complaining about it. The characters lacks nuance even Victoria Chase displayed at the very beginning of LiS.

I may change my review later in the game, but so far the experience does not compare one iota with the one I had with Max. Honestly, I would have enjoyed a story about Captain Spirit way more. There were much to dig up in his relationship with his father and how he escape in his own imaginary world.

Edit: Completed the game by now, still hate that kid."
878,"Boring plot, you dont have ANY powers, always moving, so many racist people, your little brother is pain in the ass etc...
Ending is predictable, decisions dont matter that much.. I was very disappointed, because I loved the previous game."
879,"Great game, great story, great character development, first game i ever cried because of"

882,"love the game,I played the 1st one and I have enjoyed it so much,I'm very sad I dont have any money to buy more eps"
883,Bro this game is some heavy stuff right from the beggining. Strongly reccomend!
884,It is a great game!
885,"Really enjoyable, lots of impactful choices, but oh my, why is it so sad?!"
886,One of the best Story Game i ever Played So Heartbreaking
887,"Basically depression sim 2.
But its a great game, unique. Melancholy is strong."
888,"This game is beautiful, touching and holds a wide variety of set pieces that differentiate it from prior and latter entries to the series. It is sad to see this game relegated to a place of relative obscurity compared to its masterful predecessors and its more flashy successor as this too is a great game in its own right."
889,good game
890,Really good game I dont think it has any flaws and I think this one is even better than the first game. I recommend.
891,very gud
892,"ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOOOVE THIS GAME AHOOOO one of those cases of the sequel hitting significantly harder than the original.. (though ig this doesnt really count as a sequel, just the second game in the series)"
893,"Strong story driven game, with many outcomes and surprises that will get you in an emotional roller-coaster for most of the desitions you face. Also it shows both sides of the coin with certain social problamatic people has to live with, the injustice and unfairness the main characters go by, made me try to help and think which would be the best choice to go for.

Hits harder than LiS 1"
894,BEAUTIFUL ADDITION TO THE GAME SERIES <3
895,"I love this game. I have watched  the playthrough of this game before playing it myself. Let me tell you the experience is different. I will definitely play this game again in the future. It does worth your time!
Bonus: If you love The Last of Us, there is something in this game that awaits you."
896,"Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
This game fucked me up,
And it'll do the same to you, too. (Strongly recommend it though!)"
897,"When I compare this game to Life is Strange 1, it is just ""meh"". You move from place to place, so you get hardly attached to any characters. You don't have your powers – your brother does, which I am not a big fan of. Big decisions are made kind of indirectly, depending on how you ""raise"" him. The special power for this game is telekinesis, which is super lame when compared to time travel. For most of the game I kinda hated the brother because he acts like a little asshole. The ending is anti-climactic and little predictable. You for some reason encounter so many racist and mad people it feels forced and stupid. 

What really pissed me off is that I expected the characters to build up, since they are on the run, in some way. For example, I expected money to transfer from episode to episode and your decisions to buy some food or eat from trashcan will make a differece. Unfortunately, you can spend as much as you can when you get the opportunity, your money and other stuff resets on the next stop. It could be a cool little RPG element, but nah. Instead of making advantage of the fact that every episode is somewhere else to complement the insufficient character attachment, they did nothing. 

The decisions mentioned above are straight-up opposites of why the first game was so awesome. I would rate this game 5/10, but since I have to choose to do or do not recommend, I would not recommend it."
898,this game is amazing but i do think that all of the episodes should br free considering that i paid 45 dollors for the game before it became free with the first eppisode other then that totaly would recomend
899,"This is prob one of the best story games i ever played. The story is well written and there are so many possible endings, luckily i got one of the best endings. Daniel and Sean's story was so touching and the chemistry they have was amazing. They been through ups and downs and this is how life is. Totally recommend this game WORTH"
900,"Let me start by saying this game doesn't hold a candle to LiS 1. 

This game is more a virtue signaling simulator than a game, to the point it could almost be parody. I'm all for politics in games if done correctly (see Disco Elysium), the ever-present, hamfisted moral of this game is ""racism bad"" - which any sane human can agree - but it's about the lowest hanging fruit a piece of media can try to pass off as some deep message. Hell, within the first 2 hours of the game our Latino protagonists are attacked by a evil white Republican good ol' boy stereotype with no development or motivation beyond ""I don't like Mexicans"" - there's even a border wall quip. 

Then, of course, in comes the overweight bearded white liberal from Portland to come to your rescue! What proceeds is effectively a circlejerk of ""everyone in America hates brown people other than us friendly white liberals amirite?"" where our Latino protagonists apparently live in an alternate reality of the US where anyone who isn't white is hunted for sport. I have hopes that the devs legitimately wanted to shed light on an issue that means a lot to them, but this game ironically almost seems to have the opposite effect - the story seeming to illustrate that every minority in America needs a benevolent white liberal to help them out at every turn.

Anyway, I'm ranting. Couple this with needless minigames (grocery shopping, cooking dinner, gathering wood for a campfire) that do nothing to really progress the story, I really hated this game."
901,"Awesome game, where your decisions have effects on the story, the 1st episode wich is for free was awesome, and i´am definitely going to buy the 2nd episode when it´s on sale again."
902,"How it only takes a split second for life to change completely. and allthough something completely different from the action adventurea I usually play, it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. and anxious to see what happens in the next episodes."
903,"This game was okay, in my opinion. I like the storyline, but I definetly do think LiS 1, LiS BTS and True colors are better. I still recommend it though. The graphics are pretty decent, and the lighting is very pretty. I like how this game focusses on the bond of the brothers a lot. I recommend this game, but the others are better, in my opinion. You don't need to play this game to understand the other games. I did have fun playing this, and it's definetly worth trying."
904,"Love This Game's Story not it's politics.  It's framing of people on the right/conservatives is off putting, but I can see past the GABO Lefty agenda to a gripping story of two brothers making their way in crappy world."
905,ITS RLLY GOOD BUT NEEDS MORE FINN AND SEAN
906,It is a good game it and a really good story and i love the characters yes it is a little slow in the beginning but in my opinion it starts to get good in about the third chapter
907,Great Story telling but not best.
908,So I've played almost all LIS games and now I'm emotinally broken
909,superwolf... ;c
910,"amazing story, love the characters, graphics are phenomenal. this is my favorite game so maybe i'm biased."
911,"This game is masterpiece in story and then teach us as the player how to be patient especially with your younger brother, how to train him to face the cruel world & shape his character based on what path you have chosen."
912,great story awesome game
913,I really do like it. it's a really fun  game 1000/1000
914,"It has an amazing story line, plus Sean is hot af"
915,"such a heart wrenching story, will make you sob completely. but, it is absolutely beautiful and such an amazing game."
916,"this game goes so slow, it feels like for an hour nothing is happening. sorry, uninstall."
917,this is a great game. its very political but a great game.
918,"really good story, great characters, and it was fun adventure really gonna miss this experience."
919,insane
920,long and gud
921,8/10
922,"its an amazing game. out of all of the life is strange games, this is the best one."
923,"Emotionally intense. I cried a few times during my first three playthroughs. This game is a masterpiece in both visuals and storytelling. This well-written story has an actual impact on people. It makes you think about the little things in your life and how objects or people you ignore can go away from you… forever. We all need to appreciate what we have, because one day, in just one second, everything can disappear, become dust. Poof ... it's gone. The game shows us how strong the relationship between two brothers can be, how even in the most difficult moments for a person, you can get away unscathed if you have someone to rely on. The path that our heroes take is difficult and long. However, they succeed because of their powerful brotherhood. 11 out of 10 definitely. Totally recommended.
"
924,good game i like life is strange
925,"Life is Strange 2 is an amazing game, that improves upon the first game in every aspect from story, graphics and gameplay. The story is just as amazing and heartbreaking as the first, the improved graphics help flesh out character's emotions with better face mocap. With multiple endings, unlike the binary last choice of the first game, makes gameplay feel like it has more meaning and that this time your choices will actually affect the outcome of the story, in my opinion this is the biggest improvement in this instalment of the Life is Strange Franchise.

If you enjoyed LiS1 you will defiantly love this, even if you haven't played the first game this is great for those whole love storytelling games. If you even the smallest desire to purchase this game, I urge you to give it a shot. :) 

Story = 10/10

926,BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED
927,Amazing
928,"it's awesome Love it, strong story.10/10"
929,"Неоднозначное кино: история неплохая, но конец меня разочаровал."
930,"Great storytelling, probably just as good as part 1. Soundtrack is god tier once again, world building is more spread-out, cast of characters is much larger. 

Gives you the power to train your little bro to become a mexican cartel sith lord, which is cool i guess."
931,Love it
932,"Good story, great characters, it's a game you won't regret playing ^^"
933,Personally a let down. I feel like the story should focus more on where these powers are coming from. How people are getting them. I'm not super fond of there approach and the sequel after this game seemingly doesn't fix or answer this. Played and just lost my enjoyment midway through Chapter Two. I'm sure there is some good stuff here. I just can't find it.
934,Definitely a good story. Love it!
935,Not bad
936,"boring. couldnt play longer than 10 minutes. also the graphics got worse? 

+ after i played more (in the middle of ep 3 right now), i can say with confidence that i don't like the game. the story is so DAMN REPETITIVE. like shit happens, ""daniel don't do this,"" daniel doesn't listen, sean overreacts and gets a little too angry, and that shitshow repeats for about a million times throughout the whole game. god, i tried so hard to like the Diaz brothers and i succeeded in the beginning, but the developers ruined it by being lazy and using the same dialogue over, and over, and over again. and i won't even comment on the side characters. lame. 

+finished ep 3 just now, i don't think i will be purchasing ep 4 and 5. don't waste your money on this garbage. you just can't win playing this game."
937,"Terrible game playing on feelings of the weak
imagine your relative mother, sister, kids, close friends etc playing this and get a fix and you seeing this all from backside
when you try to explain what the game based on drama is shit they ready to crucify you
i don't recommend anyone to play such games or if you do treat it with absolute criticism

My objective score 3\10
This is not a story, you basically can sit on toilet whole day and write such scripts and dialogs really hahaha"
938,"So, first of all I must say is I definitely liked it more than the first installment of the series. Story is good, thrilling, sometimes letting you to catch a breath for a while, just to let your heart rate pace a bit faster in a moment. It's like when you're watching a really absorbing tv series and totally get into it and don't want it to end. Big kudos to the creators for including some LGBT content here (Sean gay romance option, portraying homosexual couples) and the migrants dilemma cos these are very important topics nowadays and should be spoken aloud and clear - that freedom is for everybody, no matter the gender or ethnicity. 
So if you want a good piece of a story about responsibility, trust, friendship and brotherhood in a long road to justice, then go and buy it."
939,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
940,Love the story so far <3
941,good game just episodes are too short for 8 dollars 5 would be better but other than that it is a good game
942,good game goods
943,"LiS 1 was innocent. This is way too political, iritating and it is just a first episode"
944,Amazing game!!!!
945,One word: insufferable
946,"
After playing the first installment of the Life is Strange series, I grew a unhealthy addiction towards the franchise. 

I played the second game right after I finished the first. This is something I cannot recommend anyone who wants to check this game out. Because of this, the first chapter felt slow and underwhelming. Life is Strange 2 really starts kicking off when you hit the midgame (around chapter 3). The characters, beside the two brothers (if even present), are least interested than the first installment. The story mainly resolves around the two brothers which leaves less room for side-character development (which I found a real shame). I was also under the impression that the supernatural power would be the same as the previous game, which got me all hyped up to play. Turns out that the supernatural power you possess in this game is completely different, which left me kinda unmotivated. After finishing the game I can confidently say that the supernatural power didn’t really give an extra dimension to the story, like the first installment did. 

Overall, Life is Strange 2 is a good game with a solid story and interesting character’s. The supernatural power felt lacking at times and gave me the feeling it would have improved the game more if they elaborated further on it. Compared to the first installment of the series, the second game is slower and more focused on a smaller poule of characters with a less interesting narrative. Still a solid 7/10 though!"
947,Yes
948,"Starting from episode 3, the game has a very annoying bug which causes character model to be blacken/pixelated. There are a lot of online threads regarding this issue, even the new game has the same problem. Can't make a refund request. Don't recommend to play this."
949,"Its been years since I've played Life is Strange, but from what I remember, this game is a huge improvement. Choices feel more consequential [spoiler] most of the time [/spoiler] and the narrative was a whole lot better at least in my opinion. I like Sean as a protagonist, and Daniel is surprisingly fine. Usually kids in games get on my nerves but he's up there with Clementine and Ellie for perfectly fine companion characters. 

I would have enjoyed more player input. I know this is hard to do and every choice based game has this same issue, but still its a bit disappointing that I can't get a different episode ending no matter what. 

Story is depressing as Life is Strange usually is, but I don't regret playing it. It's sad but not without reason. This is a good story in this game that I think most people will enjoy."
950,ntaps
951,It's a Life Is Strange game what do you expect of course it was good. I like the others better but this was also so good.
952,"The Life is strange franchise really brings a special feel with each game and this one is no exception, Good characters, way longer than the first and prequel and overall a really good game. 
9/10"
953,Mushroom is the best part of this game
954,"I liked the first game and also Before the Storm. 
This one is lacking. The story felt boring, bland, at times stupid and unnecessarily elongated. The unskippable repeating wolf story for every episode is incredibly annoying if you play all the episodes all at once. It also feels like the player isn't in control of it all. The game creates somewhat of an illusion that your choices matter in a way that it feels like you have more choices than the last two games but they are too similar and lead to the same outcome so it doesn't really make much sense.
Also like others have pointed out, characters are undeveloped. What happened to Lyla? Jenn? Finn? so on and so on... But brace yourselves, the worst part is coming!
This game feels like watching a Netflix movie. I am sure you know what I'm talking about. Annoying political matters being brought up in such an intruding way is beyond me. Obviously the authors are pushing a certain agenda here. LGBT, hipsters, supposed racism, everything else of this sort.... leave it out. This is a game to be enjoyed, not a US presidential debate.

Just play the older titles and don't waste your time on this."
955,"My 2nd favorite game in the franchise i really recommend playing, worth your time and your money."
956,"I love Life is Strange 1 so much. I waited years and hold myself tight for a day I could get a better device so I could play this game when I heard DONTNOD announced LiS 2. The day has come and I finished the story of Sean and Daniel Diaz now.

I love the graphic update. Everything look so much better now compared to LiS 1 and Before the Storm. Although the game received a better visual, DONTNOD still brought the same LiS' styles in this sequel. Not only the visual, but the game mechanic is better now. Instead of the big-text-choices style in LiS 1, now we got a much simpler and smaller choices box (for less impactful), and bigger yet contrast between each choice (for a more impactful choice). The game also features inventory mode now and collectibles that let you customize Sean's backpack, although this one is not a really big thing in the game, it's nice to have something new like this.

In terms of choices and impacts, this game is far better than its predecessor. Instead of having Max with her rewind ability, now we have Sean (the player) and Daniel Diaz (the one with the super power). While going through stuff, Sean needs to be the father figure for Daniel, and this makes things harder for us because we need to be a good example for Daniel, while also doing the ""right"" thing. Every actions that Sean takes will have consequences in the future; either impacting Daniel's point of view of what right or wrong or shaping Daniel personality. In terms of story, I love LiS 2 more because it feels ""bigger"" and more serious. After playing this game, I feel like the Diaz brothers had gone through a lot than Max and Chloe. Making it feels like the first game is just a child's play when being compared of what the Diaz brothers need to face.

This game feels like a road trip rather than something that takes place in one setting. It feels like we are following Sean and Daniel Diaz's journeys, and each episode is introducing us to new people with their own stories that will be a lesson for Sean and Daniel. 

I know that many people said this game feels too politic, but I don't think so. I think Life is Strange 2 is showing us what is going on in the world. LGBTQ+ is not politic, it's just loves. Immigrant is not politic, it's a real thing that people need to deal everyday. Racism too, it's not politic, it's something that is happening everyday. People are afraid to see these things in their game, but I feel we should see these more often. People need to know what is going on and how these groups must feel. Life is Strange 2 is not a game that is trying to be woke or spreading the LGBTQ+ movement and supporting immigrants, it is a game that is telling stories for us to hear.

This review would not justify my true feelings to the game. But if you're reading until this point, please buy the game and experience it by yourself. Of course, buy it from Life is Strange 1 first.

10/10"
957,"After the first time playing I thought it was the least one of the series, but to be honest, after the second time of playing it kinda grows on me. I like Sean, he's cool! Sometimes you are forced into some choices where I would have loved to have a decision moment. On the other hand, the story is very exciting and I love that you meet Captain Spirit again :)"
958,this game is good.
959,"Soundtrack 100
Good Father 100
Flying stone 100"
960,Very goodd
961,fave game of the lis series
962,"*In Sean's voice : (Soo.......)
Here's what I think and some life lessons I learned from this game after I finished it : 
- This game is adventurous. Its filled with lots of stunning views of sceneries and places where you've been to in the first game ;) It feels good. 
- Families are important. No matter what people throw at you, its important to educate your family members into becoming a better human being in the society. Also try not to smoke.
- Respect the nature by visiting them and treat them nicely as they were but try not to let them cross their lines into your territory.
- Music is great.
- This game's lines sometimes is cheesy as hell. 
- Small choices sometimes made Sean an asshole. Like what the?? Calm down bro

Ok serious review... Overall, I think this is great game if you love to know their end story if you've played the first episode for free. Its a very sad tragic story filled with action packed moments and QTEs that actually changes the outcome of the game if you did not do anything. Its a rollercoaster of emotions in this game and its crazier than the first game. 8.5/10
"
963,"cried playing it.
amazing story, loved playing"
964,the music and gameplay is amazing
965,"Lots of games have done the ""wandering duo"" archetype a lot better; (walking dead, god of war, last of us to name a few).
The main cast of characters are very underwhelming and the supporting cast of characters are all disposable, meaning once they appear they won't likely appear again in a later episode. 

If you want to make your supporting cast of characters all be throw away characters that's fine but USE them to develop your main cast of characters better. Half of the time the supporting cast seemed more interesting than the main cast and their development aren't fully explored here.

Also the main gimmick of LIS 1 which having a ""interesting supernatural power"" isn't here. One of the boys has telekinesis and it's just a very boring idea compared to a fun idea like ""traveling though time in photographs""."
966,"My most favourite LIS game! The story between Sean and Daniel is absolutely beautiful and watching the story slowly build up to where it ended (depending on what ending you got) can either be heart warming, bittersweet or just heart breaking. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who liked the first game, it's such a beautiful story and I cried quite a few times aha.."
967,Made me depressed but overall a good story
968,brody is fuckable
969,theres tits
970,what da dawg doin
971,great story
972,"Lots of people like to compare this story with the first one, but honestly I don't think thats fair. The two are different in so many ways, the biggest one being the setting. In LiS2 you're constantly on the move, meaning the side characters you meet don't have as much screen time as those in the first LiS, but I felt like that played perfectly into the whole 'journey' theme. I came into this game hoping it would be similar to the first, and when I realized how different it was I got disappointed initially but kept going. After finishing the story and seeing all the different endings, I think I can say I enjoyed this one more than the first. Patience is key in this one because the ending is worth it."
973,"Spoilers!!!

Overall this game was misery porn. Just as one of my favorite reviewers GC Positive said. 

I liked how---
Actually Daniel was nonsensical in the game and even at the climax he decided to contradict how he never want to leave his brother. Daniel dove out of the car and left his brother. 

I suppose Sean is supposed to be the beat up hero a la Kyle Reese. The guy the risks it all and tries his hardest, but in the end still ends up on the shit end. 

The whole story was somewhat irritating since the very first game was so heart warming by comparison. The prequel was even better. Then they sorta regress into this odd mixture of making me sad and then intense contradictions. 

I rate this game a Daniel out of Sean getting beat up for no reason. (3/10)"
974,Heart gripping story. I can relate to some aspects of these boy's life journey. F*** racist!
975,"I didn't care about this story (what I actually wanted was to go to the party, and what I REALLY wanted was another game with Max and Chloe and not this bullshit setting that had as much to do with Life is strange as Indiana Jones got to do with Star Wars!), I didn't care about these characters, and I especially didn't care about being brother to that fucking spoiled brat of a child. The ""wall"" line by that redneck oh so transparently called ""Trumper"" or something like that was a huge WTF what are you thinking Dontnod moment, totally uncalled for. But all that could be forgiven. What can't be forgiven, EVER, is forcing a fucking DOG on me. I said NO to keeping the dog. The game still forced that unnatural vile creature on me. As a result I will never again buy a Dontnod, or a Life is strange game. Vote with your wallet, that's the only way you can beat the fucking corporations. PS: that includes Steam of course. Spend as little as possible here.

PS: gotta love the irony of Mexican descendants going BACK to Mexico though. that's more unrealistic than telekinesis, eh

PPS: another insulting thing was that the characters are likened to wolves. that's digusting. these characters aren't wolves. wolves are awesome. these characters are dogs, or sheep, or headless chickens. anything but wolves"
976,wolf bros go brrrrr i love sean diaz
977,"Not as good as the first two games, but still really good"
978,Just for the story this game is worth every penny
979,"i cried, a lot"
980,"Come and join us in the world of Babysitting Simulator 2, we have:
- Unskippable 2min recap at the start of every charpter.
- Unskippable wait times on cutscenes and gameplay sequences.
- Sean, the useless (and superpower-less) bipolar main character that likes saying sorry for things that he didn't do.
- Daniel, the spoiled annoying little brat whose superpower is being a pain in the neck and get Sean in trouble for the whole story.
- Dozens of useless side character you don't have enough time to get attached to.
- Facade choices, whatever you do the result is the same, and besides Daniel always do random things to make everything worse.

984,i just finished this game for the first time after watching several playthroughs when it first came out and let me make it clear: i love this game so much with every single fiber of my soul. such an emotional story about family and bonds. everyone play this right now. and be prepared to cry multiple times.
985,i dont think there was a single character in this game that didnt annoy me
986,"Choosing right is complicated. Life tends to go without care about our wishes. But we always have the power of choosing, even if it's not our way. 
Does define us, how we deal with life. Specially on the hardest days.

Life is Strange bring home as always stories about problems and choices, in my case it always lets me re-examine what is going in on with me and for that I'm always happy with these games."
987,"I had an emotional breakdown on stream playing this game. 10/10 would play again.
Seriously a good game.

I also have a younger brother, so I guess you could say we're wolf brothers."
988,Fascinating.
989,"Game works great on Pop OS 20.04 (GeForce RTX 2070). So far it works quite stable and I did not encounter any crashes.

I didn't really enjoy this game. Somehow all side characters was just there for a few minutes and I didn't get attached to anyone. That's why all choices and results was unimportant for me. And for me it was story about young brother, who almost killed me and then watched, how random men try to kill me in church. Then finally killed me in border. How only girl, who I cared about was just a short voice in a phone call. Game, where my decisions should matters, but they aren't. I told twice, that I don't want a dog, but we end up with it. I didn't want to rob, but we end up doing that. Most of the time I had feeling, that game pushes me to the road, that I didn't choose. And I really hate that wolf story introduction before all seasons without option to skip it. And such ""waiting game"" was in many places. Developers tried to make this something unique, but I think they overdo it.

But I did like drawing. Looked kind of cool. I wish, I could draw, like him. But all in all, first par I did enjoy much more."
990,Yes.
991,"Its good but not good like the first game.
But still when you want a awesome time get it."
992,While slow at the start the story gets better after the first few episodes.
993,"I'd like to start by saying I *really* enjoyed this game. The story was fantastic and there were points that I felt like I was truly immersed in what was happening to the characters.

At the same time, that's truly what it was. It was similar to a ""choose your own adventure"" meets the occasional walk in a straight line to the next cutscene. If that's your thing, cool! I'd check this game out. If that's *not* your thing, it's probably best to skip over this one. The original was great but I haven't decided how I feel about 2."
994,"Very nice story, wonderful soundtrack. Sometimes the dialogue is a little awkward but I enjoy it overall."
995,ouch my brain
996,"6/10 - I did not like this game. Beautiful scenery and music but that's about it. I personally didn't like the story, seemed more like a movie (really slow one, to be honest) with a few choices and clicks. The ending was kind of forced onto the player and I didnt connect with the characters. However, I must admit that I enjoyed the first 2 chapters. I know some ppl said it was amazing, but I can't agree. Wouldn't recommend and will definitelly doubt before trying the LIS 3.

6/10 No me gustó el juego. Tiene lindos escenarios y la música está genial, pero no me pareció la gran cosa. Nada que ver con LIS 1. Parecia una película muy lenta de 14 horas con algunas elecciones y clicks por ahí, mas un walking simulator que cualquier cosa. En LIS 1, la historia y los personajes parecian mas desarrollados. De los 5 caps, los primeros 2 fueron los mejores; después la inercia de terminar el juego (me llevó mas de medio año terminarlo, me aburrió mucho) fue mas fuerte que las ganas de terminarlo. No lo recomendaría y pensaria seriamente antes de comprar el proximo LIS. 
Besi desde Argentina"
997,Better left buried in the 7th circle of hell where Lucifer is
998,Made me sob for hours
999,Love the Life is Strange series. I just wish that there was a mode where you could skip through the cut scenes without having to have played it before.
1000,This game....... Is just amazing but at times can be abit sad because i have cried multiple times playing this but this is an amazing game. :)
1001,underrated LIS game
1002,meow
1003,"I had high hopes after the first game, and I was not disappointed. I loved seeing a different power at play in this story, and unlike the first, you weren't playing as the character with it. Character personalities and relationships were much more developed than in the first game, and I was brought to tears more than once. Sean and Daniel's brotherhood was realistic in the sense that you'd do whatever is needed to protect your siblings, but they can annoy you like no other. I loved that there was multiple endings you could get this time around, so your choices didn't feel completely meaningless. This is my favorite game franchise, and I look forward to seeing what DONTNOD continues to create."
1004,masterpiece
1005,Amazing game so far. Love the story and the choices that we get to choose. On episode 2 now but loving it so far! =D
1006,"incredible aesthetic and great soundtrack; overall such a heart-wrencher, and the message still remains incredibly prevalent for today's society"
1007,Luv
1008,Bruh.
1009,Beware of the evil WHITE person!
1010,"Great story settled in a beautifully designed environment.
It's possibly even better than the previous LiS games. Totally worth your time and I hope it's not gonna be the last ""original story"" of the series.
I feel like in some cases the choices made could bring to some more ""serious"" or meaningful consequences, but still there is a variety of results of consequences and endings to any action and decision.
For those who are getting to know the series now, please look away and start from the previously released games, as you will miss some touching connections, [spoiler]especially in the last chapter of this game.[/spoiler]"
1011,"Other than some small graphic bugs and the Voice actors not really capturing some moments as emotionally as i would've liked them too, i have absolutely no complaints!

I am a huge fan of the Life Is Strange series. I am always so sucked in by the story. I get so emotionally pulled in, i forget the time because the story is so emotional and good. I was a little bit skeptical that Life is Strange 2 would hit me in the heart the same way as ""Life is Strange"" and ""Life is Strange: Before the Storm"" did because i felt so attached to those characters, and i thought nothing would ever get past that. 

But here i sit, with tears down my eyes as i played the last 30mins of this game. I am now sitting here, feeling empty inside, not knowing what to do with my life. And that, my dear friends, is something that only a stunning storyline can do, and only a handful of games have ever been able to bring out in me. 

I definitely recommend this game to everyone who liked the previous games, and to everyone who wants (Or doesn't, it won't leave ya much choice anyway) a game where they can get emotionally involved in. Speaking of emotional, there is one Character in particular that surprised me quite a bit ;)"
1012,"My favorite LiS (I haven't been able to play True Colors yet), I love the wolf brothers so much, this felt like such a trip of emotions, after I finished it I felt like I totally lived the entire way trough with them, even tho it was only a few week playing"
1013,"A very fun story game! I like how even the tiniest choices can affect how your story goes. Of course, most of the story things in the chapters will always happen no matter what option you pick."
1014,not so good
1015,i
1016,"good graphics, great story"
1017,"Even though I didn't like it as much as the first one, I think the game introduces a fresh new perspective, playing from the point of view of Sean who lacks supernatural powers. It's a great way of spicing up the 'choices matter' aspect because you are not only influencing your own path, but you also have a responsibility of guiding and raising Daniel to have a moral compass. This game creates a new balance of those aspects and I think it's a great idea. 

However, I think it's also due to this that the game might feel slower (I didn't have the drive to finish it all in one go as I did for the first one). Also, I feel the relationships built along the way with the side characters aren't as special. Overall, the main story is much heavier than the typical 'high school' stuff from LiS 1 and it delivers a really good emotional experience.

The soundtrack is again amazing as expected of this franchise :)"
1018,verry verry nice
1019,"A beautifully horrifying twist and turn story where anything and everything can and will go wrong.

Will definitely write a more detailed review later

Game is a 10/10
"
1020,Not disappointed at all. I looking forward to playing all the episodes. Just as dark and deep decision making as the first ones. I highly recommend this game
1021,yes
1022,"You spend the entire game worrying that you are doing the right thing for Daniel and fearing what the bad ending will be (spoilers, it's viscerally upsetting). But the good ending is great. All your efforts to preserve Danny's innocence and adjust his moral compass pay off, even if you fucked up halfway through and turned him into a foulmouthed brat. This game made me feel things for a little brother I never had. Definitely worth the buy.

SEAN IS A FURRY!!!"
1023,I ultimately did enjoy this game not nearly as much as the powerhouse that was Life Is Strange 1 but it never was gonna top that game. This story was in my opinion too focused on choices that did not really have a meaning to them and it affected the quality of life of the game into episode 2 and beyond. The games premise was bizarrely political in my opinion and had nothing to do with the forwarding of the story. With all that in mind I did enjoy the character progression in Daniel and the way the episodes tied in together very nicely. Game-play was stellar and the music and art teams did an amazing job i would give it around 3.5/5 stars. Certainly nothing groundbreaking but a game worthy of buying on sale.
1024,"Again, we got a masterpiece from the developers!
Brilliant story, brilliant realization! It also supports cloud gaming through Geforce NOW! Unfortunately not Stadia, but don't be discouraged. Their latest game, called True Colors, is also up on Stadia and Geforce NOW. :)"
1025,"I'm only an Episode in and absolutely love the music, the character development, and overall atmosphere. Anyone who enjoys a ""choices matter"" interactive experience, this is absolutely top notch so far. Take in the scenery, allow the ambient scenes to play out. Sit back sometimes and absorb the gravity of where you find yourself based on decisions. You'll cycle through so many emotions... and that is what I feel like most folks are looking for with these games and this DEFINITELY delivers that with flying colors.

A lot of wokeness sprinkled in, but given the theme and audience this is meant to cater to, it doesn't take anything away from the depth and art involved here.

Edit: Holy Damn, what a game. Finished it, loved it, can't wait for the LS3."
1026,Just went through a rollercoaster of emotions. Seen a few youtubers years ago play and wanted to play myself. Worth it. Can't wait for the remaster for the first one.
1027,和第一部比起来差太多了，其实游戏本身不错，故事也算引人入胜，但是没有对比就没有伤害，7分，再玩玩本色看看吧
1028,"Good playable movie :-) Sometimes terrible, sometimes cute or funny..."
1029,Sean. I get my bitch pregnant imma be a better you.
1030,Amazing storyline. I just wished we know more about Layla
1031,"Sean is the star of this game. He's a lovable, shining example of non-toxic masculinity AND has wholesome brotherly vibes. 11/10 bought the game to give him and Daniel the best ending"
1032,Favorite LiS game ;;
1033,"Life Is Strange 2 genuinely disappointed me like no other game. I really wanted to like it, but the story and its pacing were all over the place. Majority of characters (including the main ones!) were written just terribly, while the choices, that were supposed to help players ""shape"" their story, only made Big Bad Brother Sean behave like a person suffering from a bipolar disorder. I grew to hate Daniel's guts and it is a damn shame that [i]The Spoiled Brat Babysitting Simulator[/i] is the best Dontnod could've come up with. ESPECIALLY after the success of the superior first entry."
1034,really good story.
1035,"It was like watching a movie, but U are the movie."
1036,"This is a game not for the faint hearted and explores very serious themes. You may be playing as a teenager with his young brother but don't let that fool you, this is by no means a children's game. Whilst not as impactful or enjoyable as the first Life is Strange, this is actually a great game to think about where we are as a society and where we want to go.

The gameplay is relatively simple in itself. As a graphical novel, this is purely story driven but the player's choices do matter and will affect the story, sometimes in ways that seem obvious, sometimes less so and sometimes, just as with life, your choices don't actually make a difference. With that being said, there are 4 main different endings that you can obtain but personally, after finishing the story once, as powerful as it was, I don't think I'll be replaying to see the other main endings (I have looked up and watched them). 

A feature I particularly enjoyed was the diary section of the journal. This filled in the thoughts and gave more of his artwork on what had been happening both in the gameplay we see and we get some small sections of what happens between episodes. 
  
Achievement wise, it's also fairly simple to collect. Look around during the times you have a bit more free reign and look in your journal at the collectibles page and match the image clue for where in the story you'll find it. Don't fret if you miss any, you can go back into a chapter later in ""collectible mode"" which means that your choices here won't save (so feel free to explore some of the other options if you can!) but when you get to the point with the collectible, that will save. And just remember, like with the first game, check everything TWICE. Nothing worse than having identified where you thought it would be and the problem was that you didn't check it twice so couldn't pick it up!"
1037,IS GOOD 【7/10】
1038,10/10
1039,"liked it, but wish full game was free was free"
1040,rip shroom :( great game tho really sad
1041,"I loved every second of this. Whenever I play a Life is Strange game I get so attached to the characters and story, and whenever I finish one I feel so empty. That's how good this game is. The soundtrack is always so good as well. The characters and character development are top-tier. I'm so glad that they also tied in some of the story from the first Life is Strange, it was a nice surprise. In the end, I genuinely had a hard time making the decisions because I was so invested. I like how there weren't just two endings, and how all of your decisions made a difference in the end. There were some minor differences depending on your choices that I really enjoyed because it made it feel more personalized. The attention to detail was amazing. Overall I would give this game a 10/10. I loved playing it and couldn't put it down. The story and characters were great. And I hope you get a chance to play it sometime :)"
1042,boy what the hell boy
1043,"i get effect from this game like ""sensitive""
idk why am still cry when i think about this game
it's the most beautiful game i ever play"
1044,Wow What a great story based game!   The game is basically a story that puts the player in the drivers seat. your choices shape how the story unfolds.  You can replay the game to change out comes of the choices that you make.  I found the players to believable and relatable.
1045,.
1046,very good story!
1047,Very good game
1048,.
1049,This game manages to make us get attached to the characters at any given time and allows us to get many endings.
1050,"I totally recommend this game
It has a GREAT storyline and awesome characters, you easily could get attached to them.
I cried at the end cause i could not hold it anymore.
The game has a strong message and the brother bond is out of this world.
I  LOOVVED IT!!!"
1051,"I bought it while it was on sale, as I read many negative comments about it and was scared to not like it, and I must say, I was not disappointed.
LiS 2 deals with heavy topics such as racism, politics or police brutality, and I personally see this as an important aspect for a game.  You travel a lot in this game, and even though I wish there were more interactions with minor characters, I think there is a bigger journey and adventure compared to LiS 1. Many people dont like how you are not the one with the powers in LiS 2, but I see this as a quite interesting and nice aspect actually. You dont get to control everything around you, but have to teach your little brother about the world and his powers. I liked how you build a nice platonic relationship with your brother instead of focussing on the love interest (as in LiS 1). What I have noticed, is that every single choice matters in this one. Even choices that dont seem important, as they are really small, have an impact on your game, relationship and especially your ending. In total, there are seven endings, that heavily differ from each other. I havent played them all yet, but I plan to do so! Even though I got attached to LiS 1 and its characters, I started to like this one more soon after I finished episode 1. 
Its my favorite game and I recommend it to everybody who likes games with a complex storyline :D"
1052,Though provoking dramatic story. Most enjoyable
1053,"Its honestly such a beautiful and touching game.I loved it, I hated to finish it, The way your actions really can affect the rest of the game is amazing. I got emotional several times. I loved playing through it."
1054,Good Story
1055,Best story game i have played. This game has also no boring moments in my opinion so i would highly recommend this game to anyone 10/10
1056,"Played it through on my old Xbox One and decided to get it on PC now. This game is even better than I remember it being, I really enjoy the relationship and connection you get to see grow between Sean and Daniel. It's a bit of a controversial opinion but I prefer this game over the first one, I just think the story is better written and I personally connect with the characters more."
1057,Sad but fun game i love it 🥰
1058,Sean deserved better im literally crying so hard rn
1059,"A good overall game, falls short on some parts of the game, feels like theres some filling in some parts, but I liked it overall. Pretty dramatic game."
1060,-
1061,"With the exception of Daniel's power, this was a very realistic and personal story that shows the horrors that people of color can have to live through. But it also shows the kindness of strangers. This definitely wasn't the game I was hoping for after playing the first Life is Strange, but it did keep me entertained with its rich story telling and detailed characters."
1062,"It's not as disappointing as I thought (so far), but... what the hell did they do to the mouse?
- No cursor in the game. Just wtf, I have to move the mouse around and get where the cursor is pointing without seeing it...
- Huge mouse capture issues: I play in windowed mode, and if my cursor is outside of the game for some reason and I accidentally move over the game, it's captured (even though I don't click the game). And then when the mouse it's captured, it's hell to release it :x

Big fat -1 for that horrible UI choice. I'm not a console potato FFS."
1063,"5*
The wolf brothers made their way"
1064,"Accidentally left my computer on overnight running this, and I'm only on episode one, but it's a good game so far!"
1065,You can talk to your 9 year old brother about minecraft.
1066,"This game is really great, I recommend you play it and maybe buy a few episodes if you can."
1067,"I feel both empty and satisfied finishing it.
Love it even more than the first installment of this series.
Wolf brothers forever."
1068,i love this game. sean is the loml
1069,insomnia
1070,"I love this game and Sean
"
1071,"Absolute dookie story, this game was really just made as propaganda. It was cool to see the choices I made in LiS1 come up again though, that’s the only cool thing about it though."
1072,holy sh*t this game just made me sad and happy i played it..... what an expirience
1073,I love the life is strange series. Very well written story lines and a rollercoaster of emotions.

1088,"[h1]Story[/h1]

Life is Strange 2 is essentially one prolonged, terrible road trip. At the outset, brothers Sean and Daniel are forced into a life on the road after their father is killed and they're blamed for his death. With few options, the pair decides to head from Seattle down to their dad's former hometown in Mexico.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Life Is Strange 2 is a graphic adventure game played from a third-person view. The player takes control of a teenager named Sean Diaz (Gonzalo Martin), who is on the run with his younger brother, Daniel (Roman Dean George), following a tragic incident. Throughout the game, the two brothers encounter various non-playable characters who interact with Sean via dialogue trees.Sean must make choices during crucial moments of the game, which lead to different branches in the storyline. Sean's actions and interactions with Daniel in particular affect Daniel's morality and the state of brotherhood between the two characters. For instance, encouraging Daniel to be rude will prompt him to swear more later in the game. Daniel will grow to resent Sean if his actions do not align with his advice, and he may no longer follow Sean's lead if he is not able to maintain an adequate level of brotherhood with Daniel. Staying morally sound and being a caring and trusting brother may not always be compatible with each other in the scenarios presented in the game.The game tracks how many players selected which option and lets the player compare their choices to the rest of the player base. While the main events of the story remain the same regardless of the player's decision, the game features several different endings.Sean can interact with the environment and obtain objects, which can then be stored in Sean's backpack and used later When Sean picks up an object, he will comment on them, providing players the backstory for each item and adding context to the world. Sean's backpack can also be decorated with souvenirs he collects in the world. As Sean and Daniel explore various locations, Sean can also enjoy moments of calmness at designated locationsand sketch the environment around him.

[h1]Plot[/h1]
In 2016, 16-year-old Sean Diaz lives with his 9-year-old brother Daniel and father Esteban (Amador Plascencia) in Seattle, after Sean's mother Karen (Jolene Andersen) left them following Daniel's birth. The day the game begins, Sean intervenes when their neighbor Brett (Robert Shearer) harasses Daniel, inadvertently injuring Brett as a police officer passes by. Esteban arrives at the scene and is shot and killed by the officer. A sudden explosion damages the environment, and Sean flees with Daniel before more police arrive. Now fugitives, Sean aims to take them to their father's Mexican hometown of Puerto Lobos. Near Mount Rainier, the brothers are recognized by the owner of a gas station, but escape with the help of travel blogger Brody Holloway (Bolen Walker). Brody arranges a motel room for the brothers, where Daniel learns of Esteban's death and becomes angry, revealing he has latent telekinetic abilities that were the cause of the explosion in Seattle.The brothers then spend a month at an abandoned cabin, where Sean helps train Daniel's ability. After Daniel falls ill, Sean decides to take him to their maternal grandparents, Claire (Nancy Cronig) and Stephen Reynolds (John O'Connell), in nearby Beaver Creek, Oregon. At Beaver Creek, Claire and Stephen accept the brothers, despite resenting Karen's abandonment. Daniel also befriends Chris (Chandler Mantione), an imaginative boy that lives next door, after using his powers to save him from falling from his treehouse;[b] Chris comes to think he has superpowers. Daniel coerces Sean into breaking into Karen's old room to learn more about her. The police soon arrive on word that Sean and Daniel have been sighted in public or traced by making a phone call. Claire, Stephen, and Chris then help the brothers to escape.Sean and Daniel join freighthoppers Finn (Matthew Gallenstein) and Cassidy (Sarah J. Bartholomew) traveling to California, and the four secure paying jobs at a cannabis farm in Humboldt County, California for a cultivator named Merrill (Ben Jurand). Sean spends more time with their new friends, leaving Daniel frustrated with being unable to show his powers. One payday, Merrill discovers Daniel snooping around, resulting in Daniel revealing his powers to the others and Merrill refusing to pay the group. Finn secretly coerces or Sean accepts his plan for Daniel to use his powers to steal money from Merrill. The heist fails and Merrill threatens them with a shotgun. In a panic rage, Daniel destroys Merrill's house with his powers, knocking out everyone else and causing Sean's left eye to be impaled.Sean wakes from a coma two months later under FBI custody. He finds a letter from Jacob (David Valdes), one of the farmworkers, which states Jacob found Daniel after the accident and took him to his hometown of Haven Point, Nevada. Sean escapes from custody and travels to Haven Point. There, he finds Daniel has been taken in by Lisbeth (Victoria Hansen), the leader of a religious cult who is presenting Daniel's powers as a divine gift to convert her followers. After an initial attempt to recover Daniel, Sean meets Karen, whom Jacob had also contacted for help. Sean and Karen begin to reconnect and establish a plan with Jacob to save him. They ultimately convince Daniel to come with them, but Karen may burn down the church in the process.Sean and Daniel travel with Karen to the secluded community of Away, Arizona, where Sean makes the last arrangements to cross into Mexico. Sean befriends David Madsen (D.W. McCann), a former security officer from Arcadia Bay, Oregon, who suggests that Sean turn himself over to the authorities for a better outcome for him and Daniel. Authorities have tracked their location, but Karen allows her sons to escape by staying behind to be arrested. They arrive at the Mexico–United States barrier, which Daniel breaks open with his powers. Before they can cross, Daniel is wounded by a bullet from two vigilantes, and the group is soon captured by the local police. Daniel breaks Sean out of interrogation and the two flee to a Mexican port of entry, but find it blockaded by FBI and United States Border Patrol agents.Sean must decide whether to surrender or attempt to cross the border, with the outcome depending on whether he raised Daniel with high or low societal morality through his past choices. If Sean chooses to surrender, he is either taken into custody while Daniel lives with Claire and Stephen before a reunion fifteen years later after Sean is released from prison, or he is killed when Daniel forces them to cross the border which causes Daniel to grow up in Puerto Lobos alone and become a career criminal. If Sean chooses to cross the border, he will cross into Mexico with help from Daniel, who then either surrenders to the FBI and lives with Claire and Stephen while Sean lives in Puerto Lobos either alone or with Cassidy or Finn, or stays with Sean in crossing the border where the brothers open a garage in Puerto Lobos like their father had and use Daniel's powers to become career criminals.
10/10"
1089,I just finished this game and I feel like apart of me is missing. This Life is Strange hurt my heart. Everything Sean and Daniel went through. I was constantly rooting for them to get their happy ending. Beautiful game about two brothers who experience so much loss and pain. This game will always be in my heart. I would definitely recommend this game. 100/10 stars.
1090,"Un juego magnífico, con una excelente ambientacíon y muy lindos paisajes, con una historia alucinante, lo recomiendo mucho, si les gustó el life is strange 1, no hay duda de que este les va encantar."
1091,I don't recommend playing this game.
1092,"I generally think Life is Strange games are good.  I enjoy the characters, the settings, the stories.

However, Life is Strange 2 is the only game in the series that I would pass on if given the chance to start again.  For much of the game, you feel like a glorified babysitter.  You have no powers yourself, your brother is the one with the powers.  And he is a child, and an annoying one at that.  Despite all of the attempts to make you grow to like Daniel, it never happened for me.  By the end of it I was glad to not have to listen to him anymore above anything else.

Additionally, there are massive time skips that really pull you out of the immersion and the sort of ""your decisions matter"" mentality of Life is Strange games, because it feels like you miss massive swaths of the journey."
1093,wonderful game
1094,"I literally just finished this game. so I might be biased towards the shock i just experienced but I heavily doubt that I will ever not recommend this game.
Compared to the first game, this one improves on the overall storytelling greatly. I much preferred this story because in this one [spoiler] you are not the special one. It's your brother who's special and you just try to help him learn to use his power. [/spoiler] But for everyone who is not into spoilers, that wasn't my only reason. I like the progression of the story a lot more. By far my favorite part of the game are the consequences. They are way more realistic in this game. Compared to the first one where your actions [spoiler] spawn a hurricane that wipes out a whole town, [/spoiler] they are way more subtle and realistic.
The only thing where I think the first game is better are the relationships. The relationship between you and Chloe and all your other schoolmates, I simply enjoyed better since I can relate to it more. (..?)
Even taking this into consideration, this one still has two relationships that I enjoyed way more than any in the first one. If you play, I think you will find out which ones they are. And no, I'm not talking about Daniel.

Life is Strange 1 + 2 are games that I can wholeheartedly can recommend to anyone who likes emotional games for impact.
Don't get me started on Before the Storm though. That was not a good game."
1095,"This is probably one of the best games I’ve ever played
Definitely recommend this for 6 and 7 year olds"
1096,"My name is Sean and was the same age as Sean, and i have a younger sister so it made the game easier to relate to haha
i cried so much and my heard ached like someone died"
1097,"I was skeptical about the Life is Strange: Before The Storm Prequel just cus it didn't have the time rewind stuff. I just love time themed consepts, so anyway I just ignored rest of the series until I saw this up on the sale and just wanted to see where has the series go? God damn isn't it short but very fucking cool. The thing about LiS games is the story. They make it better and beliveable then Telltale Idk if they're using magic or something, but GOD DAMN isn't this game have cool choices and characters! The story-line and the characters makes you really feel for them even it is for a moment it. Makes. You. Feel. And that is what Telltale lacks. 
Spoilers ahead! Read below at your own risk! 
Soundtrack: 11/10 I don't know who manages the overall soundtrack, but he did an absolute banger
Gameplay:  ? This is a story-heavy game with selectable choices that'll effect you and your brother. So there's really not much of a gameplay I'll leave at that. 
Story: 9/10 Why the 9? Just because of the last episode. The last episode felt really rushed, and didn't really have any cool plots. As for the endings (I got the Sean escapes Daniel gets captured) none of 'em seem to really have a 'good' ending, but I think the one I got was the best one so far. 
Choices: So what about 'choices' I meant; similiar games to this (Telltale's twd) makes your choices really not matter too much except for few dialogs, I thought yeah it's gonna be the same for this one too. I was kinda right, but the niche little details sells you the illusion, tbh I'm okay with it :D  
Overall score: 9/10 (10 if you don't include the last episode)
^_^"
1098,"I love this game so much, I played the first life is strange a while ago and I also loved it. I am just after purchasing the next 4 episodes of life is strange 2 after getting the first one for free and I cannot wait for it to install so I can play. This is a great game and is very fun to play and control and I really recommend it to everyone !! :)"
1099,"The story has so much potential and despite some slower moments its really good, I was truly enjoying the game but the political aspect of it, forced dialouges combined with unrealistic characters are harmful to watch. I see the point of it but the amount of extreme racism and stupidity added to way too many situations is completely redundant which ruins immersion. I hope LiS 3 is gonna focus fully on the story not political views. 
PS. Sean is one of the best characters I've ever played, glad to witness his journey and hope to see him someday in another Dontnod game!"
1100,Fantastic music and absolutely stunning game. Was awesome that the brothers were able to become gang chads at the end. This game is different from the original life is strange though...
1101,"I was worried that this wouldn't be up to the standard of the first game, but the story-telling is still very compelling. There are a few inconsistencies though, so not quite as good as the first, but still very good. The game world is a nice place to be and explore, and the more you explore, the more is revealed about various characters and relationships. The soundtrack is once again fantastic. I encountered a couple of bugs, but these were easily resolved by exiting to the menu and restarting."
1102,"Daniel ruins everything he touches. Including this game.

(No, that's not him being a traumatized little kid, that's him being a pea-brained brat whose only superpowers are getting Sean into trouble and ignoring the entire concept of responsibility despite Sean, who's also a traumatized kid, trying his absolute best.)"
1103,"Amazing! I've just started playing it again, and it has such a nice storyline! I would definitely recommend it :D"
1104,👍
1105,"Amazing storyline, finished it immediately, doesn't compare to the first one but I like this one too. Looking forward to the third one"

1107,It really cool/emotional
1108,I absolutely love how this game makes you care so much about the brothers and also makes you regret unfortunate decisions at the end of the game. This game is golden.
1109,this game is awsome so much fun
1110,make you think---part one yes i got for free....part 2 and more...i paid for
1111,"(Spoilers about the ending!)
Addicting and heart-wrenching. Had a couple of moments that almost made me quit playing completely (Mushroom...). But then I had to come back to it, because I wanted to see if the brothers would end up being safe and happy together. So I loved the game, but the ending was VERY disappointing for me. :( I played the whole game as ""good"" as I could, because I thought that teaching Daniel to have a high morality would reward me with a happy ending. I was wrong... Very surprised to find that the ""crime bros"" ending is really the only one where Daniel gets to grow up with Sean and they can be together."
1112,Hmm Liked it
1113,Yes
1114,"Not my style, first game is much better

Edit after playing first episode : Well, it's okay...."
1115,"Such a great game dude but i kinda hate how you have to Pay For each episode like isnt there an option to just pay for it all tf?
"
1116,"Hello to anyonme who is cxonsidering this game. I played this when it first came oput, when the episodes were still releasing. 
Where do I begin? First, let me give some context. I was as 16 year old, playing in my swister';s room, and when I found out about the two main characxters, I FREAKED OUT because I saw ourselve in them. The story had me in tears every episodem, the characters are written so well,. they have their flaws. BLONDE DANIEL ESPECIALLY^ WITH THE FLAWS.. but nonetheless this game has remained in my heart ever since I finished it (blonde daniel excluded). I HIGHLY RECCOMEND. 11/10 even. Met Gala Behavior type of vibe."
1117,"sean marry me
update i finsshed and i have never sobbed so hard before"
1118,Feeling like crying your eyes out? Great! That's a perfect game for you!
1119,"Game is fun, adventurous and love how they interconnected many story lines!"
1120,
1121,LOVE ME SOME LIFE IS STRANGE
1122,"This game really made me realize just how racist my family is, loved the game made me emotional :)"
1123,An emotional rollercoster game. My personal favourite of the life is strange series.
1124,Emotional...
1125,did not care for this one the whole idea was disappointing even though you do nothing wrong you run from the cops and Daniel is just a awful character he never listens and your choices don't matter and all the good side characters you only spend 5 minuets with
1126,"Absolute Masterpiece everything about this game is fantastic music,characters,story, voice acting, everything this game took risks and did it right It has helped me accept a lot of things about myself especially episode 4 with Jacob and the homophobic bs he went through it helped me be able to be strong
 thanks for making the great game
"
1127,YES
1128,Buen juego 10/10
1129,"I loved the story-telling, and the hard choices and decisions that had to be made along the way. I liked that the endings I got weren't 'perfect' endings. Collectibles could have been harder to find, but other than that, a very good game!"
1130,Great experience!  Really enjoying this delivery of story telling...
1131,GREAT FANTASTIC AMAZING
1132,Amazing game. The beginning is a big too slow but once you know what the game is about you will not stop wanting to keep playing.
1133,A truly amazing rollercoaster of emotions.
1134,"Another great hit by DONTNOD that hits you right in the feels just like the first two games. What DONTNOD does great is blend reality with fiction in a story that pulls you in, makes you think, and shed a tear. You play as big brother, Sean Diaz, to Daniel Diaz who are both caught up in a terrible situation that touches controversial real world topics. By the end of the game, I was sad to see it end but happy to have been part of the journey. Let's break the game down:

MUSIC: Fantastic! The LiS games do an excellent job matching music to the various scenes throughout the game to convey joy, sadness, danger, etc. A good chunk of LiS is the music and without it, the game would feel hollow. As always, there are plenty of spots where you can sit and let the music play in the background as the character contemplates the scene they're in. I've always enjoyed the nice break from the main gameplay and just listen to the music.

GAMEPLAY: Unlike the other entries in the LiS universe, you play as dynamic duo with your little brother who has the superpower. As a result, the choices you make influence your brother's morality. There are many opportunities where you have the option or are required to use Daniels' power to progress the story. Like any brotherly relationship, you'll both disagree at times with the choices you make. But like the other LiS games, you'll get to explore and interact with your surroundings and other characters. Sean doesn't have a superpower but like Max Caulfield, he has a creative gift. Overall, the gameplay in this game is a nice change that feels different but creative compared to the other games.

STORY: In terms of continuity, the story takes place after the events of the first LiS game. Some things are referenced in this game but you don't need to have played the first one. This game's story runs parallel and independent. I love the way DONTNOD tells their stories and the story in this game is no exception. You'll face situations that span the entire spectrum of emotions and I found myself tearing up. I love the relationship you build and try to maintain with your little bro that isn't too far off from reality. Your choices do matter and by the end, you'll be faced with two choices that vary depending on what type of brother you were to Daniel.

Overall, this is a great addition to the LiS universe. If you enjoyed the first two games, you should check this one out."
1135,cool i like it
1136,I felt so bad for Lyla
1137,"It's alright. (I've changed my mind, this is the best life is strange game in the history of the games, it touches so much emotion and is so detailed. I loved the characters and the plot, recommended to everyone who loves story games!)"
1138,very nice
1139,Life is strange 1 and 2 are the best stories I came across.
1140,love it >:)

1142,This is one of the best games I have every played in my life.
1143,"Amazing characters, amazing storytelling, not too boring, emotional, just so much is going on while playing this game!"
1144,"i love the whole game
"
1145,"Absolutely loved it. The story was at least as compelling as that of the first game, which is surprising because the bar was set very high :)"
1146,good
1147,g
1148,"the games awful, point taken."
1149,Absolutely love this game!! Only cried a dozen times 😂
1150,Beautiful story and atmosphere. It's as good as the first game.
1151,"Years after the games release I'm just now playing it. I just finished it... Never have I cried so much at almost anything. However, don't let the fact this game is sad prevent you from buying it. It's incredible and worth every penny.

I also wanna say that in my opinion the ""exaggerated racism"" was perfectly accurate to the regions the game takes place in and aided in shedding light on realistic issues. Was it mayyybbeee a bit too much sometimes? yes... but it was necessary to drive the motives behind story elements.

Also the brother relationship was A+ and very well done. I thought it was rly cool to not directly play as the person with powers and instead be the mentor for the power holder. vry cool and I loved this game with my entire soul/"
1152,"First off the graphics are amazing, the game is just beautiful itself, and it almost got me in tears in the first 20 minutes. Its amazing and if you're thinking of downloading it you should :)"
1153,beautiful story!
1154,"Best game ever! I love how it portrays what immigrants from Mexico and even from other countries and/or continents go through and suffer at the hands 12 in the United States. Prejudice and history couldn't be more faithful to reality (unfortunately). I'm grateful to my brother for showing me the first game (LIS ORIGINAL) because without him I wouldn't have discovered the franchise and consequently this one that is currently my favorite in the saga. I recommend it to everyone. Very chill to play and kill free time. Besides all that, the references of Puerto Lobos with the wolf icon attracted me a lot. Couldn't say less than: perfect."
1155,The game manages to tell a new story with the same vibe as the previous games. though i do feel that because your moving around so much in the story its hard to get great side characters because they always almost leave in one episode. It did almost make me tear up at the end and the two brothers are what keep the game interesting
1156,"Game doesnt make sense at all. Whatever you do the things that happen in between the game dont change regardless. Also, the main character feels like a pushover always saying sorry for things that arent his fault (which was very annoying). Game has creative satires regarding gender and helps gamers have awarness in some of society problems but in general it was a non-cohesive game that didnt make sense in comparison to the firsts Life is Strange."
1157,Good.
1158,An emotional journey coupled with heavy choices..
1159,"If the game wasn’t so political and leaned heavily to a specific political side I would have enjoyed it.  
Some of us play video game’s to get away from all the  political garbage and relax.  It’s not relaxing to have listen to all the political stereotypical and racist lines.  

I will not be purchasing any other games from this company.   If I wanted to deal with the type of politics in this game  I would just turn on CNN and listen to their propaganda instead."

1168,"Finished episode 1. Oh Daniel is so cute.

Finished episode 3. Forget what I said.

Finished the game. The ending was... wow.

Personally, I like LiS 2, it made me think about the blurry lines of injustice, racism, and morality. I appreciate how the game brought up political issues to remind us these problems, and also remind us the good people that help others along the journey.

*SPOILER ALERT*

This game made me think of realistically, what would I do if I'm facing discrimination, to comply or to think about my dignity, to make me think of what would I do if I am Sean and Danial's mom, to pursue what I want for my life or take responsibility, and to make me think of the moral decisions I would make in front of someone who look up to me, of what person would they become if I make these decisions, and what kind of person do I want them to become."
1169,"If Life is Strange didn't give you enough depression and heartache, try Life is Strange 2"

1172,Trigger warning: racism. A frightening amount of it.
1173,"I saw a review before I bought this game about this being a, ""babysitting simulator."" I ignored and now I could not agree more. All the brothers do is whine. Oh is you also like games with politics this and politics that, this game is for you. Honestly if the politics were not so up in your face, I probably would have rated better. For now, 4/10"

1180,I FKING HATE DANIEL
1181,"You and your brother are escaping to Mexico after an accident with a racist cop. Game is highly political in episode 5 with politics every now and then in the previous episodes. The prequel didn't really matter because that character is never seen again after the second episode and game keeps that after every episode. The only consistent characters are you and Daniel with an exception in episode 4 to 5, but they leave that episode as well. You don't get to connect with any characters unless you experience extreme racism every day."
1182,fun kinda sad story love it
1183,"got this game thinking it was like the last two but its the worst money ive spend glad i got it on sale. The last two games had a special place in my heart and still do they both had me thinking about them fro days but this game ive not play for weeks im not even interested in playing it doesn't have me hooked nor does he make me wanna play more and more if anything i just wanna get through the episodes. last time i played i couldn't even get through the second episode without turning it off. 
i feel like its just a really bad version of the first one the little boy had powers so does max its basically the same"

1186,So far I haven't really seen anything that would make me want to finish even the first episode. The game seems to put a lot of effort into making it feel like your choices don't matter duck shit. Not highly motivating.

1191,"Awesome story, definitely worth a shot"
1192,HSISJXUOWJSISMXJXKWKSJS YEAHHH FINNSHSKS SEAN????)/$/$2$2$2
1193,"Life is strange 2 a slow and the encounters are characters along the journey never get deep enough for you to get invested.
Every episode is a routine of here are a bunch of new characters, get know them, now move on. By the finale I just didn't care anymore.

PROS
-Captain Spirit (play that instead)

CONS
-plot decisions which had me rolling my eyes! I'm not talking about character decisions which the player makes but rather the narrative decisions. For example; The catalyst which prompts the two brothers to go on their journey never felt strongly warranted in the first place.

RATING: 6/10"
1194,AMAZING
1195,"Lacks the same ""charm"" as LiS 1; but overall, I felt this game to be the better of the two. Daniel and Sean have far more depth than Max and Chloe. Their story feels more exciting/desperate vs teenage angst crime drama that was easy as hell to deduce the ending of by Ch 1. 

Where I feel LiS 1 did much better is pacing. LiS 2 hits the ground RUNNING in Ch1, then has these peaks and lulls until the end of the game. LiS 1 consistently got more exciting and Ch 5 was where shit hit the fan. Ch 5 for LiS 2 felt weak in comparison. The other drawback is, given how the story works with the brothers traveling, they don't have the opportunity to build deep bonds with many others. LiS 1 did a better job of world-building in that sense as you got to know most of the kids in the academy.

Aside from the above, LiS 2 is a step up in every way. Better story, better characters, more exciting powers, more decisions that actually have tangible impacts (how you mold the brothers will lend to 1 of the 4 endings available), and the game doesn't pull as many punches.

If I game LiS 1 an 8/10, I'd give this one an 8.5/10. Both are great games, LiS 2 is just *that* much better than the first. Excited to see future iterations of the series and really hope they keep expanding on the LiS 2 formula vs the teenage angst in the first game."
1196,words cannot express my love for this game
1197,"Absolute stunner of a game, much recommended!

That is if you like slowly painted atmospheric scenes, where characters come to life."
1198,Best storyline among 3
1199,;-;
1200,Enjoyable and entertaining game if you want to take a break from the shoot em up games.
1201,Gave me a month of depression
1202,I will never get tired of these Life is Strange series. Rly great game just Sean's voice is annoying and cringe like he wants to cry all the time.
1203,Steal...everything...
1204,"good story, good game"
1205,This game is amazing. Great story line. Great characters. I love it sooooo much.
1206,shitted and cried like four times
1207,"very fantastic, the soundtrack, lighting and graphics, the story and storytelling, i love how it the firs game actually matters to play this one and they're both amazing"
1208,"life is strange 2 is by far my favourite from the universe. ive played bts, life is strange and aaocs and lis2 is BEYOND them all. the characters, represantion, storyline, endings, visuals. just, amazing
ive never enjoyed a game this much! wish both cassidy and finn had equal parts as sean’s love interest, finn is not appreaciated enough. loved the way we have to actually watch our actions and influence someone. teaches a lot. 
sean is one of the best written characters, game did so good with expressions and shi. and I LOVED the soundtrack.
i just cant get enough of it and i believe it is criminally underrated."
1209,"Great story game where your choices actually feel like they matter
"
1210,10/10
1211,"Fluctuates between ""melancholy"" and ""emotionally traumatizing"", especially due to how grounded the story is in the reality of being a minority in the wrong part of the US. Strikes a good balance in showing the best and worst sides of humanity."
1212,water
1213,Good game
1214,"At the beginning it was hard for me to focus on the story of the 2 brothers, because I missed Max and Chloe. I was happy there were some references to LIS1 and with time I got used to new characters and felt sorry for them since the very beginning. It was interesting that after finishing certain episode, the game would recommend you to download and play another game for free (Awesome adventures of Captain Spirit ) which was connected with story of LIS2. It was a nice game but I would appreciate if they had included it in installation of LIS2. In general this was a beautiful game and I enjoyed playing it, also I feel sad I finished it. :("
1215,"The only good thing about this game is the music.
And even that isn't as good as it was in LIS 1."
1216,<3
1217,"The first story based game I played was Telltale Games: The Walking Dead. While I enjoyed it, I much preferred (Square Enix and Don't Nods) Life is Strange games. I was a little late to the party playing the first Life is Strange but I fell in love with it. After finishing, I went and watched all other possible endings on Youtube. After learning there was a second game, I immediately purchased it and started playing it. The story of Sean and Daniel is heart wrenching. The things that these boys have to endure are intense. The bond that they have is very strong and it's what gets them through to the end. I would absolutely recommend this game. Now it's time for Life is Strange: True Colors. :-)"
1218,COOL
1219,"A very raw and emotional game, but also visually stunning. It is not as good as the first Life is Strange, but regardless I still loved the story, and getting to know so many different characters' stories."
1220,good and scenic
1221,"Short version

Game is shit 4 of 10 

And i'm not homophobic

They just overdid with the drama and the writing LOL

I had cringe all over my face"
1222,.
1223,delicious
1224,"its no lis1, but it is still a lis game, aka its still incredible, definatly worth a play"
1225,its so good!!!
1226,"I loved life is strange and the prequel too. They did a wonderful job of creating a story that was realistic were one could see it happening in real life. This one now starts off very promising but is quickly ruined by the whole premise which starts the story. There are so many things that are wrong with it that make it horribly unrealistic destroying the my ability to enjoy the game. [spoiler] Now for what ruined it. The whole part where their dad gets shot there are so many things wrong with it. The cop acts like a literal 5 year old given a gun and told to go to a crime. The whole situation is so fucking stupid in how it happens I just can't be bothered to play the rest of the game. It feels like a cops are bad that is the popular things so we are doing that. If the situation was actually well crafted and told in a way that had it make sense then it would be good. But that would require work on the developers part. I am sure the rest of the game is good maybe even amazing, but it is ruined by a shitty intro which when you creating a story is so critical to it. [/spoiler] I say try the game if you want, but it was pretty shit in my book."
1227,"Definitely would recommend this game, it really captures the essence of an explorer's perspective and intertwined with racial minorities sprinkled throughout the episodes. My favorite episodes would be 1, 3 and 5. Those really highlighted the main themes of the story, the only thing that lacks is the pacing in some episodes that could be perceived as draggy or boring in some cases. 

The main problem throughout the game is the buggy glitches sometimes the characters might have and some background audio or comments made by the protagonist would be cut off by another cutscene. 

Overall 8.5/10"
1228,"Life is Strange 2 is one of my favorite story-tale games ever. This game have everything that a Story-Rich game needs. You're gonna love all the characters and the Game. Try LIS Games if you haven't yet... Try now. 
Honestly I gotta say I hate Episode 4 (Faith) and it was the most cliche Episode. But the other episodes are great, even more than great. 
I love this Game! How can you not..."
1229,"Another good story for life is strange 2. I just have mixed feelings about the story and how things happened because sometimes the events felt weird and sometimes you feel that a forced action had happened. It is just introducing new characters that I didn't care about that made the big problem and sometimes the story try to tell things in a wrong way. But other than that, I liked the story with sean and daniel and how they faced problems along their way. A good story overall, just some weird problems and many things I didn't like. But I still recommend it. Just to mention, The first life is strange game and before the storm are way better in terms of story."
1230,Love The Characters And Story Along With Dialogue Choices And The Repercussions Would 100 Percent Recommend Picking This Game Up
1231,"Dontnod games have carved out a niche as one of the best “telltale” style game developers out there..  With Life is Strange 1, Life is strange before the storm and Captain Spirit, they have shown themselves to have an awesome track record at crafting experiences that can leave the player feeling emotional.. Whether it’s laughter, or tears, joy or sadness, their games tend to get you right in the feels..

Which brings us to Life is Strange 2, expanding upon the Life is Strange universe with another emotionally filled joyride.  A game which touches on numerous real life issues, racism, bigotry, homophobia and Xenophobia.  All tightly bound in a masterfully told story.. 

The Story - You play as Sean a 16 year old living in Seattle, with his Father Esteban, and younger brother Daniel..  The game starts off with Sean sharing a moment with his best friend Lyla, discussing a party they plan to attend and generally acting like teenagers act..

After an unfortunate incident/accident (depending on how you view the events), the boys find themselves on the run from law enforcement officers, scared, alone, and suspected in the murder of a police officer, Sean and Daniel will go to great lengths to avoid being captured..

Along the way, they meet new and interesting people, some good, some bad.   As mentioned above the game touches on numerous real world issues, as Sean and his brother have a few run in with some nasty individuals who let their hatred and xenophobia come out in numerous ways.. These issue have been viewed unfavorable by some people, but isn’t that the point of telling a story that touches on certain issues, to get the player/viewer/reader to look outside their own safety net and take in new information?

Gameplay  - “Telltale” style adventure game, move around hubs freely until something happens and you move to a new hub, interact with other characters when available, solve some minor puzzles, and the most important aspect of the game is choices..  The story is designed around the choices you make.. Most of the “Major” choices will see you presented with a split screen, where you’re then tasked with selecting which one you’d like to do..  

Pro’s
tremendous Soundtrack
Amazing Story
Beautiful Scenery 
great character development  

Con’s 
Ending left a lot to be desired
recycled parental storyline
Power wasn’t that interesting compared to LIS1

Recommendation  

It’s hard not to recommend Life is Strange 2.. While the second game wasn’t nearly as enjoyable as the first, its still features a tremendous story, that will leave the gamer engaged, and wanting to stay up late just to find out what will happen next.. During my playthrough I nearly broke daylight finishing the fourth chapter, because I couldn’t wait to see what happened next..  With that said, some people might get turned off because of certain themes or characters in the game, I would implore someone who may be turned off to the ideas and things presented to take them in like you’d take in a movie, sometimes a movie may feature themes that you disagree with, but it doesn’t take away the merits of the movie because they are there..

So I’d fully recommend the game to people who enjoy story driven adventure games.. If you liked Life is Strange 1, you’ll love this game as well.. So buy it, and enjoy your journey with Sean and Daniel.. (BTW, if you hate Daniel, just remember he’s 9 years old and part of being that age is acting impulsively and trying to be independent..)"
1232,I only played and finished episode 1 but it seems like a good game
1233,Unimaginable beauty
1234,it's sh1t (based btw)
1235,"I loved all parts of this story driven game, I felt very attached to all characters and once it was all said and done, I wished the story would go on, it had that strong of an effect on me. The game touches very real issues in the world, it really puts thing in perspective and shows you things some people don't believe exist, like racism and bigotry. 

Game does an excellent job to make you really care for the main characters and while sometimes, some decisions and events may not have clear indication of what its going to affect, the ability  to continually adjust the story to one of better outcomes for the characters has always been an important part of this kind of game, for both its replay factor and to get to know the other side of the story being told.

 I seriously recommend this game 100%, of course... the tone for some may not be to their liking, but that is for each to find out, within the story( If they do continue) or personally as a way to reflect certain situations."
1236,"beautiful story, beautiful visuals. a must play !"
1237,So awful don't play this waste of gigabytes
1238,"Incredible game. Extremely well done. You really feel the relationship develop between the two brothers. Very atmospheric and sometimes even mundane, in the best possible way. Felt like a real, lived-in world. Lots of meaningful choices along the way. Would recommend to anyone who liked the first game, or is into story-heavy ""choices matter"" games. Moving and believable all throughout."

1240,"While the story line is a bit harder to get into than the previous game, It will leave you crying just as much. Amazing game, definitely worth a play!"
1241,Holy shit.
1242," In my opinion, the best ""choices matter"" game ever made, even surpassing the emotional toll of the best of the best Telltale games, and even the first Life Is Strange itself. I was not prepared for the absolute perfection of this game's quality, in all aspects.
 A truly epic journey through the damaged heart of contemporary America, and a testament to the heights the narrative gaming genre can aspire to. If a person was to be honest with themselves, this would be a top contender among the best writings and characters gaming has ever produced."
1243,Another great game but a great developer  team! i will admit though this game does not top life is strange but it does top many other story games that i have played. But overall the story and the plot gets you emotionally  invested only wanting more. These games are always like watching movies! One thing that i can say i dont like is the lack of detail with my ending (game Rating 8/10) (spoiler dont read beyond this point) i havent seen any of the other endings so correct me if im wrong but alot of the past and future was left out when you cross the border. like what happened with layla and everyone in my old town and what did Sean and Daniel actually do when the reached purto lobo. like leaving out the past is fine and all becuase realistically they dont know what heppened either but it wouldve been nice to hint at somethings other than layla posting on social media that she is back. but what happened after in future shouldve hade more detail. Overall Rating 8/10

1245,"After playing the first episode, I love the characters and am invested in the storyline. The political commentary is unsubtle but realistic and an important part in telling the story. The graphics are visually appealing, especially in the nature scenes, and convey both the mood of a scene and the emotions of the characters well."
1246,life is cool
1247,:)
1248,my fav life is strange game<33
1249,No lo he jugado mucho pero esta bueno
1250,"9/10 an amazing game. Really makes you question your moralities. Some parts drag on a bit too long, but other than that everything was amazing."
1251,"Annoying story 
BUT better than true colors!"
1252,"It's an adventure game with a focus on player choices. The things you say, the things you do, and even the things you don't do will influence your little brother, Sean. Do you try to keep him safe by doing everything for him, not letting him take any risks? Regardless of your decision, Daniel will watch you closely and learn from you. If you tell your brother that stealing supplies from gas stations is wrong, but you still do it, he might just stop listening to what you say. Leading by example is the best way to lead in life, but words remain important too. There are a few areas where you can explore, look around, and talk to people, but the game is mostly linear. Sean's art skills will also allow you to draw a number of collectibles including pins to put on your backpack. As nice as the collectibles are, the focus here is squarely on the story and the choices you make."
1253,Love this game. Amazing story.
1254,"Even if you are not a fan of story based games, this one is a lot of fun. I loved the voice acting. The art is beautiful, there's very good music and there are a many choices that can change your playthrough."
1255,"The game is lovely in every aspect. I think everyone who has played one of the LiS games before, knows how great they are. This one is by far better than the first game and it was a real joy to play.
The graphics are nice, but the atmosphere and the characters are what makes the game special. Not only did I end up falling in love with the two main characters, the side characters are really likable as well. 
Now when it comes to choices, the developers really stepped up and improved. The choices you make not only affect the events that happen, they also heavily affect your relationship with all of the characters. Furthermore, your relationships affect your upcoming choices, so they really influence your gameplay.
Now, if you're not really into walking around and discovering stuff, this game probably isn't for you. You really need to take your time and enjoy the experience. I spent 21 hours and still ended up missing some stuff, so I'd advise you not to rush yourself.
For everyone who has played LiS 1, there is a nice little surprise in the final episode ;)
So, would I recommend this game? Yes, absolutely. The details are adorable, the story is great, the characters are wonderful (most of them at least) and the choices are totally aggravating at times. 
If you end up buying the game, please enjoy it and cherish the nice, calm moments, because it's one hell of a ride, once you get closer to the finale of the game <3"
1256,"the game is really cool, the graphics are good, the characters are great and the story is good, but in my opinion life is strange ""1"" was better."
1257,"Personally, this is by far my favourite LiS game.
Although absolutely not perfect, they definitely learnt from the first game and BtS.
I love being constantly on the move and the areas are just stunning to see and explore,
the endings are more satisfying than in the other games in my opinion, I also love how
based on how you teach Daniel how to do things it can impact decisions, and seeing
Sean + Daniel grow and mature over the 5 episodes is so wonderful really, would absolutely
recommend, def one of my best latest buys!"
1258,first was better but I loved it too
1259,Yes
1260,A beautiful story and probably the most powerful game I have ever played. This is the best of what video-games can be.
1261,"This game makes us travel through so many places, as much in various kinds of landscapes as emotionnally. 
Life is Strange 2 is quite different from Life if Strange 1, although what they still have in common is the greatness the game has. In the n°2, you can travel through so many different places, with such different landscapes, that are dreamingly made graphically. I felt as if I was transported there, I feel like I remember the places as if I was there, especially the second episode which is beautifully done graphically ☃️. 
The story is also so powerful. It speaks about so many different topics that are very important in this world, especially nowadays. You won't get through this game without learning and feeling a lot of things in your chest (or what you call heart).
It has been an amazing journey to play this game, and I look forward to playing the next Life is Strange : True Colors.
Thank you to everyone who worked on this game for making us have wonderful moments and making us live such a deep story. You did this splendidly :) 🌟"
1262,"I recommend this game, story so rich and good, gameplay cool and this squel from lis1 and lis2 is best to play who like good story in game. I think  I will play LIS3 soon. I hope the story is related from lis1, lis2 and lis 3. Thanks for this great games."
1263,smooth and easy to play
1264,"This game absolutely devastated me in the best way possible, amazing graphics, great plot line, well developed characters. However, the game is pretty glitchy in some areas, the game has two white characters with dreads that are central to the plot which is very disappointing, and I really would have liked to see more romantic interaction with the male love interest( who's name ill leave out because its kind of a spolier.) Despite the games flaws, I actually really recommend it, I had a pretty fun time playing and i really enjoyed the story overall.

"
1265,"Gotta say I'm walking away feeling pretty disappointed.

The choices offered to the player, which are the focal point of this game, are often nonsensical or simply don't resonate with me personally.

The physics of the characters are very outdated, even for a 3-year-old game. Their movements feel clunky, objects don't always line up, and facial animations are just decent which isn't good enough for a game of this type.

The ending is a bit frustrating too, because Sean and Daniel could have easily avoided the final confrontation/choice entirely if they just repeated what they did earlier in the final chapter (keeping this intentionally vague so I don't spoil anything).

And $40 CAD for 26 hours of gameplay isn't a great value proposition from my point of view (I definitely stopped to smell the roses along the way and did not rush through the game). If you buy Life is Strange 2, get it while it's on sale."
1266,"dope game... all i can say it;
She not with him tonight
She not with Jim tonight
She in the gym tonight
Workout in that p*ssy (ayy)
I'm gettin' ripped tonight
R.I.P. that p*ssy (ayy)"
1267,Criminally underrated and overhated
1268,I finished playing this tonight and bawled by eyes out. It's a heavy game. It really puts you in Sean's shoes and faces you with some tough choices as you try to survive and take care of your brother. I love the way the choices you make - both in relation to big plot points and smaller choices about who to interact with and what to say to them - affect the options you have available to you later on. I'm intrigued to go back and play again to see how things could have ended differently. But will need to spend some time playing silly/happy/light games before revisiting this emotional rollercoaster!
1269,not bad
1270,"I must admit, I didn't have much interest in playing Life is Strange 2 for awhile, due to paying too much attention to the negative feedback it garnered and letting that affect me. But I went into this game trying to put aside everything I'd heard so I could form my own opinion, and I found once I let go of expectations (both good and bad), I was able to immerse myself in the story and take my time with it. I really feel like it's an underrated addition. 

That's not to say there's anything wrong with making comparisons between the games. Both have strengths and weaknesses. I have fond memories of playing as Max because she was relatable to me at the time, a shy, ordinary high school girl who discovers she has power. And though sometimes I find DONTNOD leans too far into tropes, and writes some cliche or obvious characters, I quickly became invested in Sean and Daniel's story.

The decision of the devs to have you play as a protagonist without a power was kind of an unexpected, and probably unpopular, choice. At first, I was hesitant because it seemed the narrative could have been stronger if our choices were directly in relation to our powers, but the story delves less into the mystery and practice of powers (except for a few scenes) and more into finding the balance of guiding Daniel, and setting rules and boundaries. The most frustrating thing about that, which is also quite convincing, is that despite trying to influence Daniel one way or the other, he will often completely disregard you, no matter how many times you try to persuade him. But as the game progressed, I realized a lot of it deals with earning Daniel's trust, and also realizing that not everything can be controlled.  Yes, Daniel rarely seemed to realize the full consequences of his actions and the implications of his powers, but I found his portrayal to be realistic, as tiresome as he could be. He is still a kid, and while that doesn't excuse his entitled and bratty behavior, it makes sense for a character who witnessed tragedies and hasn't had the chance to properly process his trauma. He's not likable a lot of the time, which can be grating in the game, but is intentional. Add in a supernatural power that he's being told to hide, and you're going to have a rebellious kid who's at the core confused and dealing with waves of emotions. 

I never would have believed that I'd relate to Sean, but I thought his inner monologue was well-rounded and perhaps better than Max Caulfield's. As much as I will always love the first game, it sometimes felt like Max was more of a blank canvas and the side characters more engaging. Here, there is more background to Sean, and I love that the game gives Sean room to voice his emotions too. It felt honest and authentic. He's sensitive, angry at times, yet has a lot of self-reflection and his character growth really made this game stand out. He is constantly struggling with how to be a better brother, and though some may feel Daniel doesn't deserve that (understandably), his loyalty and wanting to get them both to safety is admirable. 

The graphics, specifically in the lighting of Episode 3 and the scenery of Episode 5, were fantastic. The voice acting was fairly consistent throughout, my only complaint being the overly long pauses in Sean's dialogue, and the overlapping of dialogue if moving forward too soon or having Sean's inner thoughts mesh with the in-scene dialogue. The soundtrack, especially in the first half, gave me the same vibes as the first game, and made me feel even more in tune with the story. There were some surprising song choices, like D.A.N.C.E. which at first felt out of place, but there also awesome throwbacks like Lisztomania and introductions to bands I'd never heard of, like First Aid Kit. I also never would have predicted a Life is Strange game to have a Gorillaz song, so that was fun to hear! I wish that there were a few more licensed songs, and some instrumental songs added to a some dull and silent moments in the later parts of the game, but that's just a nit-pick. The only other technical critique is that I, too, ran into some visual glitches, and thought the loading times were too long between scenes. 

The improvement to me from the first game is in regard to the endings. With four routes, it felt slightly less linear than the very binary choice in the first. Of course, I got the worst ending (that only 8% got), but I'm looking forward to a replay, and I like how much the interactions and how we treat/deal with Daniel personally felt like they had an impact on the ending. I tried to play in the middle-ground, finding a fair balance between scolding and letting Daniel have freedom, and that led to the emotions of trying to do the right thing, yet realizing that we can't REALLY control Daniel. Yes, some of the agency and strength of the game may be affected because of that, but I thought it was engaging enough of a story to not weaken the game too much. I wonder how it would be different if we would have had the power, or if it switched perspectives in episodes. There are time skips between episodes and it takes place over a longer period of time compared to LiS1, but I liked the focus on the journey and the impact of those you meet along the way. In some ways, I felt more emotionally connected to this story than the first, despite the flaws or weaker moments.

For those who say it's too political, everything is political now, as one character points out directly. I've never dealt with racism and I have immense privilege, so I think it's easier for me to say my life is not involved firsthand by politics. My existence and rights aren't being questioned and threatened in the way Sean and Daniel's are. While my continued criticism stands about DONTNOD's tendency to rely too heavily on on-the-nose dialogue, at least they brought to attention the realities many marginalized communities face. Since I've never experienced it, I can't say if the racism was accurately portrayed, and there's always room to talk about microaggressions and the subtle ways racism is normalized in everyday life that doesn't consist of the very vocal racial slurs and statements heard in the game, (not to mention the way racism is systemic), but also, these things still happen too. I think the game exemplified how common police brutality is in the US and how racism still benefits many, and why Sean was scared in the first place to stick around. 

I felt it was poignant that Daniel and Sean were trying to go back to their roots, when you usually hear stories about people trying to cross the other way; it was a good juxtaposition of how the US is referred to as the land of opportunities. People still refuse to treat immigrants as anything more than subhuman. People still adamantly yell for stricter border control, without caring to understand that the legal process is flawed and often targets people who simply seek asylum, yet are punished for wanting a better life. It's not a simple or kind process trying to cross legally, families are separated and people are treated like cattle. And this is not the same as a difference of opinion. It's a documented and blatant disregard of human dignity. There was growth and exploration of humanity throughout the game, and all of that felt even more present with certain characters in Episode 5.  

Overall, I felt Life is Strange 2 did a good job of the relationship between brothers, and the complexities of it. Sean had wanted space before, and quickly finds he has no choice but to take care of Daniel and try to lead him. While it's often very apparent how much Daniel's powers exist to forward the plot regardless of what we tell him, and how we end up in the same situation nevertheless, I really enjoyed the experience of this game and thought the story to be moving and genuine."
1271,its bussin.
1272,"[spoiler] God damn Mushroom. I literally restarted the checkpoint 3 times to try and avoid what happened, only to find out it was inevitable. Had to stop playing for a couple hours because I was legitimately heartbroken over it, sobbing like a baby. [/spoiler]

Not entirely like LIS1 where I felt more connected to who i was playing and having more control over the  outcomes. It felt a little more scripted with events, where my choices didn't seem to drastically change the next stages,

Although, without a doubt, the music choices they use for these games are 10/10. Whether you like the music or not, what they choose to use for every scene, or a choice, adds more emotion behind the choice you are about to make. Or the mood they're trying to put you in. I appreciated the immersion a lot this way. 

Disappointed with a few things. [spoiler] I think the game was always meant to have a sad ending. The journey along the way makes you feel that there's hope to turn it around, with a possibility of a ""happy ending"" though. All of them have a tie into something sad, painful, or lacking in my opinion. Still super good, but I felt some things were left a little unanswered for me.[/spoiler]

There are a couple of Easter eggs tied into LIS1 in this, which I appreciated. Relatable characters, tackled real life issues and scenarios accurately (unfortunately and fortunately) and made you feel a lot of things. 

Overall, it's absolutely worth trying, an experience with replayability if you want to see [i]some[/i] different outcomes, and a it's a good story."
1273,played on my xbox was great played it again on here and got a better ending really good game.
1274,Dont buy it buy weed instead you will get much more joy out of it.
1275,"I was very skeptical about this game, that's why it took me so long to finally play it. I'm very impressed that they managed to create a touching story that makes you fall in love with the characters again. I loved it, and I wish I had played it sooner. 
I also loved that the minor choices you made in Captain Spirit get to be a part of this game."
1276,Bros before hoes
1277,gg
1278,"I got hooked by the trailer, and the context of a Trump era USA got me curious. Good game, great ambiance and visual style. But still a frustrating experience to me, I couldn't get interested enough by the story (except Chapter 3) and rushed to finish the last two chapters..."
1279,"Just play like your in the characters life and it""s awesome"
1280,Dontnod Entertainment <3
1281,"""not fair"" -Daniel Diaz"
1282,vary good atory and chosice
1283,"After an absolutely unforgettable first game and an awesome prequel, I bought this game with very high expectations. After a week of fully deepdiving in this incredible story I can clearly say that this series has become one of my all time favourites. As you start the game and the plot massively escalates, you can't help but share the emotions felt by the boys over their journey in a way only the Life is Strange games allow. This game ended up blowing my mind and heart with a deep plot and beautiful graphics. The major disadvantage in this game is actually not being able to reset your memory to replay the story."
1284,"Best Life Is Strange game so far, even though I haven't seen True Colors...
Do not wait, just buy it and enjoy it.
"
1285,Nice Game
1286,Good
1287,"this made me cry. i loved it. and you may to :)

1288,Story line is excellent recommended
1289,Good story as always!!!
1290,Good story but way to much sand got in my eyes...
1291,i cried.
1292,"Life is Strange never disappoints me. What a beautiful game. It has such a strong message. I love how natural and fluid the storytelling feels. It is such a good series. I hope they make many more games. All games made me cry at some point and I've just finished episode one in tears already, so I know it's gonna be good. It's just so sensitve. I appreciate a good job when I see one, and this is it. It's wonderful art."
1293,it's a really good game
1294,"This game isnt only fun, but very emotional. In this game, you arent being controlled by anyone other than yourself. You make your own decisions and youre in charge of your own fate. You can make so many decisions and the game totally doesnt feel like a 12 dollar game, its very cheap for how good it was. If youve played the first game or if you havent, youll for sure love this one."
1295,"super cute
"
1296,Game cringe did not like
1297,"This is my favorite game of all time. This game features about 14-15 hours of gameplay to emotionally devastate you in a never-before-seen way. I can't even pick up life is strange games anymore because I don't think I will ever be ready in my life again to go through a game. 100% recommend to all types of gamers, especially those who's personalities allows them to get attached to a character."
1298,only completed the first chapter and already cried.

Really strange... like mine"

The Emotional Bonding between Sean and Daniel is simply outstanding.

1303,"Enjoyed this game as much as LIS 1. Get this if you enjoy choice based gameplay and story focused games.

Pretty scenery, nice music, enjoyable people (though not all of them). It's not all rainbows and sunshines, there's also a storm in these games. Enjoy it. I did. Worth my money."
1304,always enjoyed the life is strange chapters and this one i def recommend playing
1305,Amazing game
1306,"I LOVE DRUG TRAFFICKING BATCHEST ! :D
"
1307,wow like play game amazing
1308,I prefer Life is Strange 1 and the Before The Storm. I can't agree to like this one because its involving a brother and hits too close to home so it can be pretty annoying.
1309,"This is an immersive story based game. I personally enjoy the choice aspect the most. Your choices make certain interactions more difficult, or easier."
1310,great story always loved the series more story than game but in a good way.
1311,"Another part of Life is Strange, another love for this series. In this part the game talks about how unfair a life could be for some people. Btw you get to see a photo from Max too!! Can't wait to buy True Colors now!"
1312,One of the better Life is Strange games in the seires!

Really recommend!"
1321,"A good story following LiS. Big fan of Sean and how the story is progressing in a very interesting way. In some ways very relateable (in terms of sibling relationship, issues growing up, minority groups/racism portrail). Some ""choices"" seem kinda stupid, but I guess that depends on the perspective."
1322,"As I always say, Square Enix games are super fun and rich of story. Life Is Strange Franchse will always be my favorite franchise of all time. The story development, the graphic, and even the elements used in every aspect are very epic and not repetitive. keep it up Square Enix, You guys are the best!!"
1323,"yes, rly good game, you should play it :3"

1328,"God, how do I make multiple reviews because I have so much to say about this game. The characters feel so real and raw, the relationships don't seem fake. The struggles the main characters face are so unique. This game is (in imo) better than the first and is 100% in my top ten games of all time.

1344,"They should have named this title “Life is babysitting an entitled brat”.

You have no powers.
You have no power over anything that happens.

You’re given an illusion of choice but in reality everything that happens is already predetermined. The entire game is basically you trying to be the voice of reason while your every action is controlled by an extremely entitled, spoiled, selfish child. It’s nothing but a sequence of one frustrating event after another. I just got to episode 3 and I don’t think I can suffer this any longer. 

LIS 1 is a masterpiece compared to this game."
1345,YASSSSSS!!!!!
1346,"love the storyline, got me crying at the end"
1347,9.5/10
1348,"Since November 4th i have played through the life is strange series which includes: Life is strange, Life is strange before the storm, The Amazing Adventures of Captain Spirit and now Life is strange 2.

Life is strange 2 starts once again in Oregon however in Seattle instead of Arcadia Bay, the game focuses on two brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz. You play as Sean throughout the game as you mentor Daniel to ensure he becomes a good person as they are running away from the law after their father was shot by an officer due to the officers assumption of the boys crimes due to them being Mexican which is an unfortunate prejudice which is target towards them through out the game however its mostly the crimes they have to commit to survive that pushes Sean and Daniel to continue running to their fathers hometown of Puerto Lobos. 

For some reason the Life is strange series likes putting a significantly important character into their stories and seriously tread the line of them being likeable like Chloe and Rachael. This creates a divide as you really wonder if the character will become better over the game and in some cases they do for the most part. Unfortunately this games version of the character is Daniel i personally hated when he go against Sean for no good reason or become angry and nearly destroy everything around him however if you teach him to be nice and respectful it does reflect later into the game.

Another aspect of Daniel is of course his power which is telekinesis like Max he discovers/gains his powers because of a traumatic experience however unlike Max there is a lack of consequence to him for using his power. Early in the game Daniel develops a bad cough and i initially thought that was this games form of nosebleeds and that near the end of the game Daniel would have to spare his power to spare his life however none of that was true he just legitimately was sick and after some medicine his fine and his power is apparently only based on his strength to use it basically creating no stakes for it throughout the story and more of a gimmick.   

Life is strange 2 is a significant departure from the original game in some ways good and some bad, for one Daniel is the character with the power rather then yourself making the importance of Sean's guidance prevalent in various parts of the game. The game also takes you throughout America rather then staying in one spot however the amazing visuals of this game allow for interesting diverse and dynamic environments, however a negative about that aspect is the homely nostalgic feel of the original was a big reason for its success which unfortunately meant i really enjoyed any content in the game that associated with Seattle which means the first hour of the game and whenever you call Layla in the earlier parts of the game which isn't the main focus of the game but oh well.

The game has four endings which are based on two parameters, morality and brotherhood so basically how good of a person you are to society on Sean and Daniel's behave but also your bond to each other, from what i have seen having high morality and brotherhood is the way to go for the ending and the entire game as it is the path of least verbal resistance from the characters in the game the ending i got was very sweet and positive too so i wouldn't want anything less to be honest.

However i do feel this game is good i do believe it is an overall good experience you just have to realise how different it truly is, as i said in my AAOCS review i would appreciate a true isolated sequel which for about 90% of the game it does with only an overlook of Arcadia bay and a conversation with David which can be different depending on your ending of the first Life is strange.

The game however was a bit of a chore for me to complete it only took me two days to complete LIS and four days for Life is strange 2 as some parts felt so out of place and a tiny bit unnecessary which is the entirety of the third episode of the game until the very ending of the episode and then it becomes quite important however the characters you meet in that episode are quite important and some of the best in the game and even the series.

Life is strange 2 was developed on the Unreal 4 engine which does show the game looks amazing while still maintaining the artstyle of the series so far as i said before i would like the whole franchise to be put into one big collection however we shall wait till the series is over.

Overall i do recommend this game just be aware of its drastic difference and im excited to play the most recant game in the series true colours :)"
1349,"LIS is getting better with each game
Those 28 hours (or more in the future) wren't fooling around in the Game Menu."
1350,"I remember reading alot of bad reviews when this game first came out and that kept me from playing it for a long time. Now that I have played through it, I don't think those bad reviews were warranted. It's a pretty good game. Not as good as Life is Strange 1/Before the Storm, but those games are pretty hard to top. Life is Strange 2 is definately worth a playthrough."
1351,One of the best narrative game so far.
1352,It's story is so interesting and fun! Having a blast playing this one!
1353,yeah
1354,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
1355,i love life is strange so much
1356,"holy shit this fucking kid is so annoying. played the first episode after loving the first life is strange. In Life is strange all the characters feel real to themselves, their actions make sense. also the developers know how to use music perfectly to emotionally charge situations. this still feels true in life is strange 2, but instead of playing the ""main character"" you're just the older brother to the ""main character"". and the ""main character"" is an annoying whining little kid. unfortunate. 

it would probably be better if you played the kid, so you could choose to not be a cunt. :/"
1357,best story game
1358,"To be honest, I have encountered mainly bad and poor reviews for this game. You know, ""sequels are always worse"" type of things. However, this piece has not failed to impress me. I got same vibes and received a majestic experience once again, just like when I played Part 1 (and the Prequel). 

Ultimately, I think that purchasing this game will not be of any regrets - 8.8/10."
1359,"Don't get me wrong, the first game slaps but this one just goes so much harder"
1360,"Gameplay and story inferior to the 1st game, plus political propaganda in games is not a good idea."
1361,"A good new direction for the franchise, filled with memorable characters, plots, and locations. Absolutely loved this unique take on LIS!"

1367,"I was fantastically excited for this game, even though the original characters were not going to be present. Having played through LiS and BtS multiple times, and feeling invested in them and the characters, I was fairly shocked at how much of a letdown I felt with the new characters and their story.

This really comes nowhere close to the original. The story feels like a phone-in by comparison that leans too heavily on cheap manipulations of the player rather than standing on its own and building relatable and interesting characters in an interesting world, as the first game did.

Still considering playing the latest entry before the LiS remaster, which is why I bothered re-visiting this for a review."
1368,Wow I'm surprised it's letting me review this game as I only played it for 80 minutes and stopped giving a shit
1369,"novel, movie and game in one.."
1370,Game allows you to pick choices that affect your consequences. The graphics are high quality which allows for a fun and unique experience.
1371,very grape!
1372,"[b]After being critically successful and bringing a passionate community to life, Square Enix's experiment eventually became a franchise. The publisher hired an extra studio to do a spin-off and let Dontnod create a new story. That's how Life is Strange 2 was born, which brings a narrative along the lines of its predecessor, but with a totally original plot: now, the player makes the choices of teenager Sean, who is trying to escape the United States after a traumatic event, taking with him his brother Daniel, an eight-year-old boy with telekinetic powers.[/b]

[i]If the first Life is Strange managed to get many players out of their comfort zone simply by putting two girls to star in a teen narrative, Dontnod's new game takes the experience to another level. In Life is Strange 2, the main name of the adventure is American teenager Sean Diaz, but who is placed in a much more difficult situation than an art school in the Oregon countryside. While the first game in the series had a story that took about a week, here we have a trip of months in different scenarios, with flashbacks and temporal gaps, bringing the two brothers as the main common point between the chapters. The variety of locations makes it difficult to develop some interesting characters, as the protagonists are constantly on the run. In addition, the slurred rhythm in some parts can also make a tiring experience for those who are not used to games of the genre.

On the other hand, the long journey gave the French studio the chance to tackle different political and social problems in just one game. The player feels, almost at all times, how it is to be seen with prejudice by society. And Dontnod gets tough when it comes to addressing the topic. In addition to moments that make you cry, Life is Strange 2 is packed with many scenes that cause annoyance and indignation. And this shock caused while the gamer is with the controller in hand is what makes the title so important these days. In some cases, you will be placed in morally intense situations and even if you have made good choices, the eyes of society will end up leaving the ugly situation on your side anyway. It is an agonizing and revolting feeling, which manages to translate the xenophobia portrayed in the story into gameplay.

More than a chronicle of young people of Mexican descent trying to survive in the United States, Life is Strange 2 is also the story of two brothers who have just lost their family. The large number of heavy subjects covered in the narrative backdrop may end up taking the focus off this segment of the game, which also deserves to be outdone. In addition to the powers and a quirky situation, it's also interesting to see that Dontnod was careful to portray the two brothers at various times simply as brothers. The duo fights, falls out, and feels jealous. But, in the end, the two are still traveling partners, something that will surely thrill anyone who has been to a similar one. This proximity to reality can even make the player review some real-life concepts, as the multiple possible outcomes are quite impactful when showing how their decisions affected Sean's life and, mainly, contributed to Daniel's growth.

The main difference in the gameplay of Life is Strange 2 compared to its predecessors is the fraternal relationship between Sean and Daniel, which offers a new layer to the system that made the franchise famous. While in the first title of the series you dealt with the consequences of Max's decisions and even had a power that allowed you to regret in almost any situation, the hole is deeper in the new game. As the player controls the older brother, who has no powers and becomes the adult of the pair, each choice affects not only the protagonist but the younger's growth as well. And we're not just talking about dialogues: in addition to the teenager's speeches, actions and behaviors end up influencing the child throughout the journey. The complexity in the system ends up leaving a fear of making the wrong choice at all times, making the gameplay quite exciting and unpredictable.[/i]

[b]Life is Strange 2 is a niche product that will definitely not have as much reach as other blockbusters and even certain 2019 indies. Still, the title is loaded with relevant subjects with its heavy and revolting story, bringing messages that deserve and need to be played by the gamer audience. With a more drawn-out narrative that leaves you out of the role of ""superhero"", the game brings great evolutions compared to the first game in the Dontnod franchise, both in terms of graphics and in the way of telling a story. It does have its pros and cons, but I'd certainly recommend it to someone who is looking for an intriguing 20-hour story.[/b]"
1373,"Chore simulator.
I am sorry but it's a 10 minute story wrapped with a 10 hour chores and objectives like making food and cleaning and finding a lighter...

Miles off LiS1 or True Colors.
A really bad continuation to their free ""Captain Spirit"" experience.

Bad! Bad Dontnod!  I nodded off!"
1374,The story is so deep i cried but it is a very good game :D
1375,"If you are a fan of the first part, you will be disappointed by that one. It seems to me the creators didnt even understand why the first one was so well received by those who played it. Technically this is way better than the first, storywise it is just painful. after a big start it constantly drops until it hits bottom. I think it is because the story was build around some kind of subliminal political agenda. To transport a message there has to be a particular skill in narration, but that was lacking here."
1376,"A game that throws a ton of interesting and tough major issues at you followed by being forced into doing stupid things no matter how you've played up until that point.
The total lack of reaction from your brother in episode 4 was enough for me and I stopped played.

"
1377,"good soundtrack, good game, slow paced, decent overall"
1378,it  is really good game
1379,"Good adventure game. Not nearly as good as first game, but still good.
Too much filler in the game."
1380,"That was a really exciting experience to travel with the brothers and live through their moments! I guess it's not my fave game in the LiS series. The ending (there are 4 of them, 7 if you count minor differences) has really shaken me.

What I would like to point out specifically:

1) An interesting concept of playing not the superpower-gifted guy, but his companion - it's not only your choices that matter but also how you influence Daniel. I really don't remember to see  any similar idea anywhere else. 
2) The ending depends on all of your actions throughout the whole game, which is neglected in many other games of the genre.
3) Really interesting and inspiring characters and locations. Specially liked Lyla, the brothers' grandma and Captain Spirit. 
4) Nice atmosphere of a road trip movie. Every episode has a new location and a new story to tell.
5) And one more word about the endings! They really give you some food for thought."
1381,"its fun, great story even though its one of the worse in the series
"
1382,"동생을 지키고 보호해야하는 형의 무게감과
힐링을 주는 그래픽, 감동을 주는 스토리로 돈이 아깝지 않은 대작이다."
1383,"Dang... Even the episode one is enough to change the way you see things.. 

Honestly this is the best story game i ever played, i definetlely recommend this one and i will also look forward buying every episode"
1384,"While better than 'Before the Storm' and a fun enough game to play through, Life is Strange 2 feels hollow as if it is missing something and because of this it loses its replayability in my opinion.

The characters are well written in this and the story is completely different to the first one and tries to go for a different style and tone whereas Before the Storm felt way to tied down to the first game, it helps that this game isn't tied at all to the first one only with a few references here and there of the extended world, such as brand food or mascots ect. This allows this game to become its own thing without really worrying about connecting to anything else. 

however, there are some problems with this game which makes me not want to go back and play this again, one of them is that you dont play as the person with the power, which is a interesting concept that of having you take on the role of mentor but this makes the power feel way more scripted than having it worked into the game organically as in the first max could use her powers whenever, and anyone or anything you interact with could be undone potentially leading to new information being discovered, whereas Daniels power is only used when he is with you and when there is a need for it.

Another problem is the 'Players Choice' as it seems that no matter what you did it always led to the same outcome at the end of a episode; again in the first one things like saving Kate or being nice to Victoria can actually have a impact on the main plot but because you never stay in the same place in each episode you never really see the impact of your choices as the episode is going to inevitably end with you on the move again. 

The other problem i had is with the ending, it presents you with two choices just like the first game, however unlike the first game where it was a ethical choice that actually makes you think and tests your morals, this game presents two options but i doubt anyone would pick one of the options because it would be a awful ending and make the entire game feel pretty pointless.

Ultimately this game wasn't bad and i wouldn't discourage anyone who is playing it but at the same time i would never recommend this to anyone and if you haven't played the first one i would highly recommend picking that up instead.

5.5/10"
1385,"A slow walking simulator with a slow story. Quite often you're given the illusion of making a choice, but this has no influence on how the story progresses because the main character just continues along the same nonsensical pre-determined story path.

I'd recommend just watching a playthrough on Youtube since you'll get almost exactly the same experience as you would if you played this yourself."
1386,"So woke and boring...Every white character is bad and you have more choice to be gay or ""curious"" than being hetero....
Also, the story itself is bad."
1387,What an exciting journey of the two bros!
1388,"Not the best one in the series, but overall it's a good game.
The bond between both David and Sean was tight, I was disappointed it would be the same as Max and Clone, but I liked it.
Only thing I would complain about is David's voice actor, I didn't like it :/"
1389,This was a major borefest and the ending will always be good no matter the choices you make through the game. The pacing is slow and had to force myself to finish. Nothing like the first LIS. Stay away.
1390,"Cried like a baby lol.

The game really gives you an insight on how cruel life can really be out there, but doesn't leave out all the beautiful moments that goes along with them.
I got really attached to these characters and felt like i was there with them."
1391,give chris justice
1392,"More video than game, but it's a great CYOA that's very emotionally gripping, and it's a good time."
1393,"Gosh, there is so much to say about this game. I love it with all my heart, that's for sure ! 
This was the first game that gave me this deep love for video games. I was so attached to these two brothers and the ending really made me cry so much... 
I won't spoil anything because this game is definitely worth trying and discovering by yourself, and the less you know about it the better.
I just have to say that voice actors are insane, and the musics are perfect, and the story... Everything really fits together to allow this game to make you feel any type of emotion, you really live it, the mood, the emotions, sadness, happiness, friendship, love, hope...
One of the best games if not THE best game I ever played in my life, and for sure the one that had the most impact on me. The endings really gives you lessons about life, this is just a masterpiece."
1394,"overall still a good game, but the whole story was not as good as those previous Life is Strange games. In my personal opinion, the first one with Max and Chloe was still the best one so far. I just felt things were moving too slow and plain and sometimes unnecessary in this LIS, and the most annoying thing is, every time Shawn speaks, he sighs, EVERY TIME, its driving me crazy ngl, the emotion was NOT ON POINT."
1395,"so many kinds of natural life in this game
"
1396,"Don't bother.. If you play the first episode and think it will get better later on, don't get fooled, it only goes downhill from there"
1397,"A very good narrative game about very well written characters. The plot is good and keep on getting stronger with each episode, with no ""swing and miss"" moments that tarnished the last couple of episodes of Life is Strange 1. If you're into that kind of games, go for it."
1398,Loooooooved it!!!!!
1399,good game
1400,sO
1401,i cry
1402,.
1403,"This is a great emotional game about family values, loyalty and difficulties. How difficult it is at times, and how painful it is to lose loved ones, how difficult it is to be in charge, and to protect your loved one and prevent him from turning from the path. This game is a wonderful adventure drama about two brothers, wonderful landscapes, beautiful atmosphere, great music, and nice stylized graphics. This game will immerse you completely in an adventure, and will make you think about a lot, may remind yourself. I recommend this game to everyone, and I think each of you will get great pleasure from it, and a huge portion of emotions. I wish you good games, and make the right choice, the same as you would have done if you were in their place.

1404,super libtard game
1405,I love this so much and it is really sad too
1406,Very good story love this game!
1407,love this game tots recogmend
1408,vary fun played it twice and still the best
1409,"Pretty cool game i prefer this one's more mature story over the teenage drama story of the first one, it shows how fast one's life can take completely different turn by just making a simple choice, would totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys interactive adventure games."
1410,"I like this game to improve my bad english when I see you smile. Good game but I can not use my inventory, no keys how to ? 8/10. I rejoice like heavenly forest and river, do not get lost when you play youngster."
1411,"It was a good game, I really like how it wasn't all just like a netflix show or something like a choose your own adventure only. It actually made us, the audience do something and not just sit around. Episode 1 was good, I wish I can get episode 2 - 5 but I guess that is for another time."
1412,Good game
1413,I loved how i was able to make my own choices in the story and the graphics were amazing. the storyline was great because it kept me interested
1414,"you made me cry man. you developers are so good at making us cry. its so realistic, its so emotional and it makes you attached to the characters. it shows you how messed up this world is and opens your eyes to how unfair life is. it shows you to be grateful and speak up for others. its just.. the best. you will cry but it will be worth it."
1415,"Definitely not as good as the first game but its entertaining enough for the most part. Episode 2 however was definitely the worst imo, it was just so boring. Wasnt crazy about the games ending either tbh."
1416,"Amazing game, nice scenery and story."
1417,I loved this game.
1418,"Best ""Life is Strange"". Love it! Amazing story line."
1419,"Serious pacing issues. The final two episodes doesn't hit the ground running as they should, instead they stumble along while filling time with new, redundant side characters and interactions. The final act of any story should be exciting and fast, yet in this game they choose to give you life lessons about equality in America and have you ponder the plight of new characters which clearly don't matter because you know the game is ending in about an hour. Ridiculous."
1420,"I've completed 3 episodes and just started the 4th, and honestly, I can't say it has been worth it. I'm not sure I can be bothered to finish the game. 

I don't like the story, and I also don't like the choices the player is given. It often makes me think ""I don't want to pick any of these"", and then I kind of randomly pick something just to progress. It also really feels like the story pushes you in certain directions, so that even though you get choices, you don't feel in control at all. Things happen anyway even if you pick all the choices towards avoiding them. 

It's a pity, because overall this is still a very high quality game. Dialogue is good, voice acting is good (besides occasionally Daniel, but what can you expect from a kid), graphics are good, controls are smooth, I did not encounter any bug... this game could have been amazing. But the story and choices are the most important features, and when those are underwhelming, there's no saving it."
1421,"There is nothing to say. This game is just... perfect.
10/10"

1431,"this game - it was a whole experience
thanks to Sean and Daniel for it, the best wolf brothers ever

LIS2 <3"
1432,"I played Life is Strange (1) and did not thing anything could live up to it. I was very attached to the original story line. Regardless, this was a great part 2. It is not related to the original Life is Strange but the two stories subtly mingle if you pay attention. They are also individual stories on their own. I loved this part as much as I did the first. I really hope a Life is Strange 3 is made. They did a really great job."
1433,"I do like this game. It's got a heartwarming story, a family dynamic that one can only imagine going through and it just looks and feels pretty great. I'd recommend anyone who enjoys slow paced exploration games to play this. It's a very cinematic oriented game, so don't expect crazy action scenes.

I do have gripes with it like the political pandering of how rural Americans are bad people and immediately racist for really no particular reason other than ""muh country."" Sometimes the voice acting is a little weird since there's a lot of sighing which no normal person does in conversation. The story was sometimes pretty nonsensical. How Daniel, at one point in the game, almost gets Sean killed because... why again? You'll see when you get there. 

All in all it's got ups and downs. I think it's a step down from Life is Strange 1, but still worth playing in the end with reason to play through a second or maybe even a third time."
1434,"This game is an emotional roller-coaster. I didn't really plan on continuing this series after LiS 1 since I'm not into episodic games but this one really proved me it's wrong. Every episode has its own twists and the brothers can't just take a break. The story, ambiance, theme and music are all beautiful that I can't get over with yet. It gives you the glimpse of how disgusting is  racism which also happens in reality and it's just sad and frustrating."
1435,.
1436,"It is so beautiful game with of course good story. I dunno dude, haven't done any review yet but, really, you have to try this game at least 1 free eps."
1437,"excellent story & character development
"
1438,Realistic and great updates from the first series.
1439,"This was my favorite game I've ever played!  i liked 2 so much more than 1 or 3 because you can be just as much an a-hole to these people as they are to you and actually answer in a savage or brutal way that these racists deserved.  I had the time of my life with this and there weren't just meek, boring options.  I wish they'd kept that same energy for part 3.  this one seemed like your choices can branch and just be so varied...why did they make the girls all have such meek endings vs i could be a mexican badass killer in here!  So fun"
1440,Best game i have ever played. i love all the soul in it and how it covers deep topics like police brutality and systemic racism
1441,"i really love the game's aesthetic and the overall calming mood. it will throw you off balance when you make a choice but that's exactly why I keep playing it. Also the characters are lovable and I feel personally attached to this story. I loved the first game and I love this one even more. I truly recommend it if you enjoy games like Heavy Rain, Detroit Become Human, etc, etc."
1442,"This game gives out the vibes of being on a road trip, and I really like how DONTNOD shows the brotherly bond between Sean and Daniel. Not sure why ppl are criticizing the political aspects of it, but if we look at actual history in the timeline. Isn't that what some people, especially the minorities are facing?

Nonetheless, I really enjoyed playing this game, and hope that you would too!"
1443,"Decent, but Tell Me Why was better in my opinion. Some things feel a bit forced. Yet it was a good journey. 

7/10"
1444,"This game is a journey and just like the first instalment, it is a rollercoaster of emotions."
1445,Just love the story and the way it is brought to us through a video game.
1446,"My favourite game of all time ngl. I got very attached to the character as the episodes passed. The amount of possible endings and instances in the game is amazing. Also, the return of some of the characters from the life is strange 1 added a lot of nostalgia."
1447,Another epic story I really love Life is Strange
1448,One of the best game ever. Awesome story. 10/10
1449,i like it
1450,"If you like games that you make choices on what the character says, wears, and how to interact with the world, then you will like this game. The story is engrossing, and will make you say, ""Holy crap!"" from time to time. I'm looking forward to the next chapters, and new stories from Life is Strange."
1451,"cool game
"
1452,"This is the best game i've ever played and no words can describe how much i love everything about it. From the way the gameplay immerses you, the characters and how connected to them you feel. It's so beautiful."
1453,yeah it was fine I guess.
1454,"Just no. They screwed it up with that religious crap in part 4. How pathetic. 

Otherwise the game would be barable enough to play. It’s very linear. So many annoying characters and you can’t do shit. 
Victim simulator. Enjoy getting your ass kicked."
1455,"It was stale at first, because walking around in the nature got repetitve, boring and it was slow paced along with the story, but the two last episodes were much more intriguing and had me more excited to continue. Overall, it's a good story about dealing with abandoned/lost ones and making sacrifices, but I don't think it's as good as the first Life is Strange. When I completed the first one years ago on my PS4, I remember being fascinated by the story. When I finished the second one, I didn't feel the same."
1456,good game
1457,"Amazing story, amazing gameplay."
1458,"Honestly, I didn't want to play this at first but I did not expect it to be THIS GOOD... It's an amazing story and have really cool characters you meet across the way. I suggest this game to literally everyone out there! I'm thinking about buying the other episodes its just so good!!   (I especially suggest it if you have played other Life Is Strange games)"
1459,good
1460,Awesome game many things learn from this game......<3
1461,5/5
1462,8.5/10
1463,"Pros:
The Soundtrack
The visuals

Cons:
The Story
The Characters
The Constant political bullshit
The ""Endings"""
1464,"Not as good at the first one but still a really great game. But it is unfair to compare with the original because everything was 10/10 there! But this is a really good game (but play Captain Spirit before episode two) and I loved the most of it, and specially...  

It isnt so emotional as the first one but still my eyes get wet a lot. The music is far away from the first one but the story and character is all good! And it felt good that I wasnt crying like in the first game. Looking forward to the next one now!

SPOILER ALERT (below)









---------------------[spoiler] when I met David Madsen and found out that both Max and Chloe was alive and well![/spoiler]"
1465,It was really hard to enjoy this game when literally every episode has a character who is extremely racist for no reason. I've come to believe that this game was written by people who've never visited the USA.
1466,Beautiful and emotional!
1467,A worthy successor. May not be as great as Max and Chloe but good in different way. I just love life is strange.
1468,sheeeesh
1469,"This is a great game with a great story. Unconventional, yes. A rebel's story really (especially if you make the anti-establishment choices). The biggest complaint I see people stating about this game is that it is not LiS1... As far as I'm concerned this is a dumb reason. LiS2 is its own story and should be treated as such. Did I enjoy LiS1? YES! Do I like LiS1 more than I do LiS2? Yes. However, I'm not going to rate or gauge LiS2s worth simply in juxtaposition to LiS1. LiS2 is a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys story-based, CYOA games."
1470,"So good, made me wish Mexican people were real"
1471,"Daniel is the most unlikable, selfish, entitled little whiny brat I ever had to ""care"" for. I only finished the game out of spite and not because I was liking it."
1472,good
1473,Tiddies
1474,i thought it was a pretty good game way better than the first in my opinion
1475,Nc Story
1476,col and yes cassidy ;)
1477,"Track stars don't smoke. But really, story will def be sticking with me for a long time, the emotional moments were so well-written."
1478,wolf bros 4ever
1479,fun game! :D
1480,"I don't usually write reviews (don't remember if I ever have here), but this game is definitely worth it for the story. It's an important story that needs to be heard by most people, whatever side of the political spectrum you're on. Even though I was raised by immigrants and believe the treatment of many immigrants is still inhumane, this game did much more than just remind me why I need to take tangible action to help them. It made me reflect on my religious upbringing, my interactions with people from many walks of life, and it made things clearer. I'm reminded of the many ex-cons I've worked alongside with, as a working-class minority - and I realize there's much more to be done to prevent people from being forced down a terrible life path. People need to realize there's power beyond just words. We can take action. We just have to keep looking for it.

As far as the technicalities of the game go, I get the criticisms about how it's not as engaging as the mechanics in LIS 1, but the story made up for that. A lot of the dialogue felt like it dragged on slightly more than necessary, which was why it took me a while to finish the game after putting it down a few times. Despite how the graphics still broke my immersion sometimes, I found myself surprised by how the story still managed to hit me emotionally, since it's very difficult for me to tap into my emotions. Overall I'm satisfied despite those drawbacks."
1481,"I can not play whole game. I do not want to go on at 3. chapter. I loved the first game, but this game is not good. Dialogs and the story are boring. I cant say that the gameplay is boring because it is not exist. There is not any challenge or something like first game.( At first game, we try to find somethings to take photo, at  this game we try to draw something but it can be found easily. ) I do not recommend to buy.

1484,very cool
1485,"I feel empty. Traumatized. I'm completely different now. I played the whole series, now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel completely useless. It was a great time. But this game put it to another level. I never felt anything like this in a game. Thanks for this lifelesson game"
1486,"The game has a wonderful plot, well-written characters. I cannot compare it to the first game in the series. Since all that unites them is the universe. Otherwise, these are two beautiful separate stories."
1487,"Great game, wonderful story!"
1488,yep
1489,Good game!!!!
1490,i don't know i haven't played the game yet
1491,"Very calming, love the feel."
1492,heartbreaking
1493,"If you loved the first game, you will double love this one!"
1494,i liked the stories and game play
1495,"4 hours of gametime, then hit with a pay to play message. At $12 an episode, I don't think so. Have loved this franchise until this bullshit. HAppily would have paid for the full game, but this sneaky dlc shit makes everyone lose respect for a company."
1496,i hope it will be free for all very goodstory line
1497,"goog
"
1498,"I'm gonna recommend it on the basis of how it made me feel, Firstly, I loved the art design, the way Sean looks the world and draws it on paper, Secondly, The Art Style and general graphics, And Thirdly, the bonds between people and the brothers, Fantastic. 
Now, The things I didn't like...
Firstly, The story, It was sub-par and under-whelming a 6/10 story at best, Secondly, (Just my opinion) The music was, ok but not phenomenal, It just didn't stick with me.... It was not memorable at all just something going on in the background... Some tunes were mild head-bobbing but that's it....

Overall It was a pleasant experience but i'm not gonna replay it ever... It's too stuck-up and boring having Daniel around to do stuff was a pain and it tried so hard to give feels of the first game but sadly it does not live up to my expectations... It was an 5/10 Average game at it's best. Wait for a sale to pick it up but do play it once imo."
1499,"Not as good as the original IMO (mainly because the cast of the first game was much better and this game's story is much more mundane) but still a solid fucking game. Music is on point, as usual."
1500,vry good yes thx good
1501,11/10 i love the wolf brothers
1502,!
1503,It's my favorite game outta the 4 life is strange games. I played it on my ps4 and now im here playing it on my laptop.
1504,snapped sis
1505,"It's a thought provoking experience with some tough choices in there but ultimately not as good as the first game, or Before The Storm and the story I thought let it down quite a lot. I thought Daniel was an exceptional brat and it was infuriating that every time the plot progresses it's because he's been a little arsehole to a level of selfishness that I don't believe most kids that age are (as for the 'but he's just a kid' justification, most children genuinely aren't THAT stupid and self absorbed). The possible endings are all pretty miserable. And a lot of the behaviours of the characters I found hard to believe. The game ends and you don't feel like you've really been through something and survived, it just feels like no matter what choice you make, you still lose. It's has a depressing effect on you, compared to the original and BTS games which were tragic but left you with a sense of wow! Instead of oh :( ."
1506,iconic
1507,This seriously has to be one of the greatest games on the planet....
1508,"Overall a good story, there's nothing wrong with it IMO, I just didn't see a lot of greatness in it, yet it's still enjoyable."
1509,"Good game, not as good as the first.

Episodes are a little long and slow in my opinion, needs better pacing.

Still worth a purchase."
1510,Incredible journey. Story flowed big time. Can't wait to get my hands on True Colors and to replay remastered editions of LiS 1  & BtS.
1511,"This season is actually way tougher that the first one, in terms of its story. It's about the strong bond between brothers/sisters this time (this is a kinda next level, as in the first season it was about strong friendships). No matter how annoying your little brother/sister will be, you will still love them and make sacrifices in order to make sure that your little one is safe. If you lose him/her, you get desperate and you try everything you can to get them back. In this game you'll find really heartwarming and heartbreaking moments and you'll have very difficult choices to make as well, more difficult than in the first season, in my opinion. For example, I had to restart a checkpoint because I didn't like my decision, hahaaa XD But overall, it's a story about which will be hard to forget after you finish it.

In terms of gameplay, it's the same thing as in the first season, but with better graphics probably? Idk, I'll let you decide this XD Cuz to be fair, as long as the story is a nice, captivating one, the other things won't matter that much anymore (that's what I personally think of it). Yeah, so, enjoy it :)"
1512,⠀
1513,"This game is epic. For those who prefer play adventure game (maybe more like survival), I really recommend this. Because this game makes me crazy and drown me into the adventure world. Also the bond between the main character and other characters are too special."
1514,Very immersive and fun time passes so much faster this is great.
1515,I DIDN'T CRY.
1516,"Well written story. This game has everything you want in a game/story to play. Made me laugh out loud, excited, mad and even made me shed a tear. Loved everything about this game. This is a must play in my opinion."
1517,Fucking phenomenal
1518,gay :)
1519,yes
1520,"Loved the story to this game, everything about it was so compelling."
1521,"The game is well crafted, has a good soundtrack, and lots of minor interactions to learn more about the brothers.

I really want to not recommend this game because I never actually got hooked by the games story until the last episode... Every single time i started to get immersed into the story, the game would throw in a plot macguffin.

The plot, narrative, and story are fine if your going in with no expectations, however; if you are accustomed to cohesion and consistency, this game may make you feel like your hitting your head against a wall.

Perhaps that's just how i visualize my experience going at this game a second time."
1522,"You're better off watching gameplays and vods of it instead. It's not as good as the first game and the True Colors game. The game mainly focuses on the power and not much on the plot. As much as I love LIS, I would refund this game if I could."
1523,The best game i ever played
1524,"I liked this overall, although I think the first one was more fun. A slow burn family drama road-trip type story with some supernatural elements and political commentary here and there. I'm not from the US so I won't comment on the later part other than that it's sometimes delivered with the subtlety of a brick through a window (makes for some fun, Stephen King type, people going off the deep end type of situations though). 

If the family drama / crazy road-trip part piqued your interest tho, I think you'll probably enjoy this too,. It's pretty much the heart of this story, and there's definitely some cool set pieces to come across too."
1525,One of the best games I've played
1526,Pretty great story game
1527,Its not bad... Its just not very good.
1528,good

1530,Fucking Good Game
1531,"Not good, bad storyline, glitches everywhere, politically motivated and cringy."
1532,TOO MANY FEELS T_T
1533,I like this one better the the first game except for the soundtrack. I feel more connected with Sean and Daniel. They successfully capture the feeling of hopelessness and being taken away from everything you know. The choices are also actually matter this time with the 4 endings they provide you.
1534,"just fun im going on my 3 run thure i cant spell lol
"
1535,great game ._. .-.
1536,Good game! I recommend to anyone who loves interesting games with a hard choice!
1537,good and fun game
1538,"I don't know who said this game wasn't as great as the other two, because there is a possibility of multiple endings and your choices actually DO matter unlike the first game where the ending is inevitable. This game was so emotionally heart-wrenching. I wouldn't recommend playing with other people around because I sobbed like a small child."
1539,"Haven't finished it yet but I'm on episode 4 and this game brings so many bad emotions man, so bad sometimes I want to stop playing and delete the game. You hit my feels bad, you guys

I didn't expect any of this during the first free episode, I felt the urge to buy the rest because characters I've met in it were super wholesome so for some reason I expected the same from the rest of the game. Brody onelove tho"
1540," I enjoyed this one MUCH more then the first game, though maybe because I vibe more with the brothers then Max. It has been most of a day since I finished and I am still heartbroken over the ending(s).  Like the previous game there are no HAPPY endings no matter how hard you try BUT that is sort of the point. If you like a story driven game then I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE."
1541,kk
1542,"This has been my favorite game I've played this year, and I cannot recommend it enough. I had never played a Life is Strange game before, and this game made me interested to play the rest of the series. While I have read that people didn't like the political side of this game, I thought it actually added to the story that was being told. Overall, I definitely would recommend this game to anyone."
1543,meh
1544,"Voice acting is awful, graphics aren't great, not nearly as interesting as the first game."
1545,Pretty Good
1546,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
1547,"I gotta be honest, I didn't think I would like this game. I played it almost immediately after the first Life is Strange, and I think it's hard to live up to the hype of that insanely wonderful roller coaster of emotions. I'm not gonna go out of my way and say it's better than the OG, but it definitely wasn't bad. In a sense, I liked and disliked that you weren't in control all of the time. In that sense, it was very realistic. Making choices to try and do the best for your little brother Daniel whilst not being the one with powers was a unique experience for sure. The character development without the pressure of powers was quite refreshing. I think my one real complaint was that there were times when I didn't know that there would be a quick time event in the sense that I couldn't choose dialogue options in time. However, I also liked that in those missed opportunities they still continued the story. Kind of off-topic, but this soundtrack was incredible as well! I don't think I'd replay it, since I am pleased with where it took me, but it'd be fun to watch someone else make different choices and see where they end it off."
1548,"Incredible Game!
10/10
One of my favourite games ever definitely would play again, Amazing story too!
Best in the Life is strange series to be honest."
1549,"Great game the story is amazing and I had much fun playing it, the game still looks amazing even in 2021."
1550,"This is a very slow and gentle, but unforgiving game.

Played the first part before this one. They are not comparable.
1. The choices you make are very narrow. Often the later outcome is not very logical. Especially in the end.
2. The main characters make choices, when you can't intervene, that are not very smart at best.
3. There are no quick time events or situational solutions like in the first part.
4. The story asks for quick time events, but there are none. You weren't even told, when you had to answer quickly and in other cases you had all time in the world. That feels unpredictable and unfair.

Sound is good, music is awesome, Grafics are good within their style.
Texts are sometimes cringy to the bones."
1551,"Very good, although I couldn't care less about my brother. 
I didn't feel like I had much of choice at all because anything I told my brother to do, he just ignored and put us in a completely different direction."
1552,sean deserves an award for being the best big brother
1553,"this is a great game.. is it perfect no.. but it is good instalment in the series.
there is a lot more variety of locations and characters than in Lis1 which might make it feel a bit condensed for some people, i personally i really enjoyed it.. 

if you enjoyed the first one, then i'd recommend checking this one out too. 👌"
1554,Amazing game. I have played them all many times and in always come back to this one because it is my personal fav
1555,"Such an amazing game!! I would recommend LIS2 to everyone!!
The story and the whole game is just so beautiful! <3"
1556,nice
1557,Incredible story. Intriguing characters. Wonderful soundtrack.
1558,"""remember Daniel...with great power comes great responsibility"""
1559,Offensively bad.
1560,"It's 2021 and I finally played this game.

Dontnod has really improved since the original Life Is Strange in terms of fully developing the choice system. In episode one, I encouraged Daniel's interest in Minecraft so he wouldn't be so scared in the woods, and I had to listen to the kid talk about skeletons and creepers for the rest of the time lol. It's little details like that which really sell that my choices have consequences and also make me love the relationship between the two brothers. Daniel can be a handful (cough cough episode 3) but he's 9 years old and has been uprooted from his life after his dad was killed. I think that people should cut the kid some slack and not say their game experience where you are an older brother trying to keep your kid brother safe is ruined by Daniel. Actual children are their own human beings who are growing up and trying to figure out the world around them, who will obviously end up messing up in the process. Daniel's behaviour during the entire story isn't that obnoxious or unrealistic.

I ended up caring so much about Daniel during the episodes and him growing up to have enough agency to decide to want to stay in the USA at the end of the game while Sean got to live in Mexico like he wanted to shows that my choices in how Sean raised Daniel did really matter.

I liked being able to meet all these people over the course of the game and learn more about them all. Even though everyone did have limited time in the story, I felt like there was a lot of thought given into each character and who they are.

Now for the (even longer) ranty part:

I think one of the criticisms when the game came out in 2018 was that the game was too hamfisted in bringing up race and politics, which is partly why I had the game for a while but didn't play it. However, playing this in 2021 where vaccination and masking have become the most polarized thing on the planet and more incidents in Canada where I live highlighting that the world has almost never treated POC fairly (I'm talking about things like evidence of mass neglect and abuse against Indigenous Canadian children, a man targeting a Muslim family who was just walking on the sidewalk by running them over with his car not far from where I live, and other bull the police do), it's not that unbelievable that there are some jerks like the ones Sean faces out there. The game does have plenty of Caucasian characters who are kind people (like the truck driver who gives you a lift in the middle of the desert), so its intent is not to say ""white people bad"". Even the vigilantes who shoot Daniel are sympathetic in that they do want to protect their country for their kids, but they've been encouraged to focus on their anger and forget that many of the people they're targeting want a chance of a honest life and a better future for their children. (I am reminded of the situation of children being separated from their parents and kept by the state down there as I am writing this, which again, shows that this fictional game isn't too far from the reality we are living in.)

10/10, I think I like this more than the original."
1561,"Likes: Amazing roster of characters, even if they appear for an episode like Brody, Cassidy, Stephen, David, Stanley, Arthur, Hannah. Liked all the drawings Sean did, felt immersive how he captured the world. Money management was a nice addition to the game, too bad it wasn't utilized more (read ""at all"") in later episodes. Awesome voice acting and soundtrack. Episode 3 was the strongest episode in whole franchise up to LiS 2 in every espect (minus Daniel) and my definitive favorite.

Dislikes: Daniel is annoying 80% of the time and always did the opposite of what he has been told. Sean can be a bit whiny from time to time. Heavy on political views from time to time to the point my enjoyment declined. Episode 4 was probably the weakest episode in whole franchise in my opinion.

Bugs: minor bug where your character would move in a certain direction without you pressing anything, usually after a cutscene but it's easily fixable by pressing that direction once. A couple of times my character got stuck but the issue was resolved without restarting.

Overall: So many amazing things in this game that is unfortunately ruined by 1 annoying protagonist that you spend most of your time with coupled with the weakest episode in the franchise. If it weren't for Episode 3 the final score would be lower by 2.

Final verdict: 7/10 - Good game"
1562,There are not many games that would make me cry but this game was sometimes very emotional. A very touching story about two brothers trying to survive in a harsh world.
1563,"I really wanted this game to be good. I loved Life is strange and Life is strange Before the storm. Even pre-ordered this one, But I just couldn't finish it, it's been a year or 2 when I first played it and it was just an all around bad experience. the game feels like a cut scene with some gameplay in it. there are even after so long game breaking bugs for example in episode 5. there is a bug that forces your character to go left all the time without any input from the player, voicelines not working or npc's getting stuck. it feels rough unpolished and not interesting. 
The story is boring. there are some interesting moments but for the most time it feels like filler to stretch the game for example (spoiler) the weed cutting scene, this game does no justice to the topics it wants to address. The only reason I finished this game is because I have a weak spot for Life is Strange and want to get the full experience in Life is strange True colors. am disappointed to say the least. and therefore wouldn't recommend this game."
1564,most heart touching and emotional game I've ever played.
1565,"This game tells a story that is so different from Lis1. I think if people we're more open to something different they will see what a wonderful story and world they crafted in this game.

Yeah, the powers are different, the dynamics are different because Max can go back in time, but Sean has to set a poor or good example for Daniel, good/bad relationship with each other, etc. Also, it's just nice in general to see PoC (especially one who is mixed) in a game. 

Also, I think it makes for some impactful and meaningful endings."
1566,can I put my bawlz in ya jaws
1567,"One of the best butterfly effect games ever made. Would recommend!
If you're not sure if you'll enjoy the game i would suggest trying captain spirit."
1568,Wolf brothers go awooooOOOOOooOooO
1569,so good holy shit ending was amazing play it broskis
1570,"Incredibly powerful storytelling.
Plot sometimes forces you into situations that could have been avoided 
but overall one of the most beautifully crafted worlds and
one of the best choice driven stories I have experienced."
1571,"Not a bad game, but pretty black and white. I've been moral throughout the game, I only took revenge on some people (the old dude beating Sean, he's only 16 year old, plus we needed the tent... and on the rednecks, I mean, come on, they shot a KID!) yet I got the worst ending where [spoiler] Sean dies[/spoiler]. I was good to everyone, forgave my mother, forgave Finn, saved the illegal couple, yet all these choices didn't matter much, ridiculous."
1572,"I've always liked games in this style, where the plot depends on the choice. It is very pleasant to follow the fate of the brothers"
1573,THE STORY AND THE CHOICES WERE GREAT.STRONGLY RECOMENDED
1574,"this is a rlly good game , but i cant afford to buy all of the remaining episodes."
1575,This is not the way people talk and act. Major cringe characters.
1576,"the choices matter so much!!!!!!!!!
its insane"
1577,It is so good already at episode one i wanted to cryyyyyy
1578,"Great addition to the series- choices matter a ton in this one, you truly craft your own story here. It's a beautiful story about a teenager and his younger brother trying to make it out in the world by themselves and get to mexico. The graphics are incredible and the character movements are fluid. Looks great overall. 

Obviously I'd have liked it to be longer, and these games don't typically have immediate replay value, but it's definitely worth the money."
1579,"My personal favorite Life is Strange game, even if it's a controversial opinion. 

Life is Strange 2 is darker than all the other games in the series and the story is mostly told through the relationship of the two brothers Sean and Daniel. The game expresses its choices and ultimate endings through how Sean raises Daniel. 

The game is about the journey and the hard decisions you are forced to make. In that way, it spoke to me more philosophically than anything else. I had to decide who the Wolf Brothers were and what they stood for, which ultimately reflected on who I am myself."
1580, SUCH A GOOD FUCKING GAME STORYLINE IS AMAZING :)
1581,Very good game
1582,very good
1583,no dababy gameplay was ok but no dababy
1584,"The story was very good to experience. Quite different from the first one, but in the same ball park."
1585,"Loved the Morality/Brotherhood system, (have no idea why they didn't use something similar in True Colors) but they could've made it more precise or advanced, I found the first 2 episodes to be good and your choices actually matter unlike the first game or True Colors. That being said episodes 3 and 4 had abysmal writing, Daniel is among one of the worst characters ever but the ending(s) redeem itself although I got the worst ending."
1586,yes awoooooo i can be gay!!!

1595,"My Review On Life Is Strange 2 ( After Ep 2 I Started Playing Cracked Version Because I Wasn't Able To Purchase Rest Of The Parts :( )

Ep 1 Roads
The Beginning Of The Story Of The Game, It's Starting Out Slow But It Picked Up.

The Two Boys, Sean Diaz, Daniel Diaz Super Wolf Powers.

Episode 1 Was Fantastic It Was Done Right.

Episode 2. Rules.

Daniel Diaz He Just Hard Headed And Never Listen To His Big Brother Always Got Into A Fight Make A Big Argument Scene The Boy Need To Learn How To Control His Power.

Episode 3. Wastelands
A Little Short But It Was Good. To Get To Meet Cassidy Freaking Awesome.

Episode 4 Faith

This Episode Was Crazy Daniel Was Like Brainwash Or Something.

Sean Gets To Meet His Mother First Time Since Birth Very Touchy At That Part Of The Episodes.

But We Made Peace With His Mother Reasonable.

It Was A Very Amazing Episode.

Episode 5 Wolves.

It's Crazy In This Episode Going To Mexico Escape From The Law.

And I Choose For The Ending Did Not Surrender.

The Only Negative Thing About This Game Is The Sound Kept Cutting In And Out With The First Plate Through The Second Playthrough It Is Fine. And Sometimes To Scream Freezes With The First Playthrough, But The Second Playthrough Didn't Do That Kind Weird.

Rip
Mushroom Dogs.

It Was Good To See David Again And This Time Would Have An Open Mind.

1596,"Just finished Life Is Strange 2

story is 7 out of 10
graphics are 8 out of 10
 the little brother is very annoying and almost made me quick many times
"
1597,Not all the choices are amazing but Life is Strange 2 is a fun ride.
1598,Oh my where can I start. These games just keep getting better. I loved how the two main protagonists grew together and how the story line was put together. I really enjoy the LIS trilogy and have to give a big well done to the developers and voice actors and just everyone who made the games how they are.
1599,"Heartwarming and sad. I loved this story of the two wolf brothers traveling across America. It lagged a little in the middle episodes, but the pace picked up toward the end. Definitely worth it."
1600,"Unique story & best brother journey <3 I would recommend to anyone this game. It is emotional, evocative, heartwarming, and heartbreaking."
1601,As engaging as the first.
1602,"Serious let down from LIfe Is Strange and Life Is Strange: Before the Storm. I felt more engaged by some of the side characters than the main character. Honestly, save both your money and time. I only finished the game because I have too much of both. The graphics were nice though, including some spectacularly well done lighting in episode 5.
As for the politics/culture, the first two episodes seemed alright as far as providing reasonably balanced and believable caricatures. The last two episodes were atrocious. It's like there wasn't a single person on the development team who had any personal experience or knowledge on what they were writing. It was heavy handed and unrealistic. It made the entire game difficult to enjoy."
1603,10/10 much goodness
1604,Wunderschön
1605,"[b]Sean? Am I... a monster?[/b]

￭ It was an amazing journey with the Diaz Wolf brothers. A very interesting plot and the story of these boys. You immerse in this so deeply that you worry about them, you are sad, you smile, you laugh and you cry. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2612108483]Daniel[/url] definitely won my heart – a sweet and kind boy who was sad [spoiler]after his father's death[/spoiler] and tried to move on, making mistakes, but correcting them thanks to Sean. Daniel fell so deeply into my soul that I even wanted to have a ""ñaño"". Separately, it is worth noting just unrealistically cool soundtracks and cinematic graphics, which further immerse you in this story and make you feel that you are really taking part in it. 

￭ When the 5th part began, I realized that this means the end of the game soon. I delayed this moment as long as possible, but I will not be able to avoid it, despite the fact that I did not want to end this journey so much… After watching all the endings later – I cried for an hour and went sad for another day – the game affected me so much. I was very impressed with the passage of the game and will remember this story and these characters for a long time, and also added a playlist to [url=https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1kcdxiOfHUICGLbEYjT9Dt?si=v_5E4b13TcOBb31F2YXWsg&utm_source=whatsapp&dl_branch=1]spotify[/url] so that I can periodically dive into nostalgia. I definitely recommend the game for the full price, you will not regret it – it's worth it.

P. s. be sure to pass [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/845070/The_Awesome_Adventures_of_Captain_Spirit/]Captain Spirit[/url] on the recommendation of the developers after the first part. A short, but no less interesting story of another boy who is also experiencing the loss of a parent."

1607,Very fun game can't wait to get the other ones!
1608,Awesome
1609,One of the most fantastic storyline and immersion experiences I've had in a long time. Highly recommended!

1611,"Far from being as good as the first one, this one from what I have played honestly disappointed me."
1612,an absolutely beautiful story of two brothers vs the world.
1613,didnt like the love interests that much but game made me cry and i like crying so i recommend. [spoiler] wish lyla were more involved in the game [/spoiler]
1614,i need free theraphist
1615,"The people who hate the story of this game are the typical gamer bro conservatives. The political themes in this game are hardly exaggerated from reality. This is my favorite life is strange game HANDS DOWN ! I love everything about it from the plot, To Daniels power, and all the choices that feel like they impact the game more than any other LIS or Tailtell game could. The only complaint I have about this game is Im sad its over."
1616,I completed this game on console and one of my favorite games of all time character development is the only thing that needs work but 10 out of 10
1617,"Life is Strange 2 was the best until True Colors. With a beautiful story line, stunning scenery and very important social critiques, the game really catches your attention and engages you very efficiently. Beyond making you think, it makes you feel. It makes you feel tension when interacting with people usually against you, among all other feelings the game guarantees. Definitely recommend this game for anyone interested."
1618,"great game, good interactions. I personally still prefer the first game, but this is well worth playing"
1619,"Not happy with the game these kids has the worst Luck in the world IMPOSSIBLE IF U ASK ME and TO MUCH POLITICS - RACE, ISSUES WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT BLAH BLAH BLAH  etc etc Depressing game AND CHOICES SUCKS"

if you play this game you will also be gay

but play it

:)"
1623,"I'm sorry, it's just a bit okay, I couldn't bring myself to really feel anything; It's a good picture but not a good story in my opinion. It doesn't feel nearly as personal or real as the first did.
I couldn't find anything engaging in these characters, nothing to really root for or against, not really, and that's a damn shame since character is something the original game exceled at. That's what got me to love LiS in the first place, but the two brothers I find really bland, but it doesn't get much better with the side characters.
   Ultimately I forgot this game was even a thing after a bit of time, even though I had eagerly awaited every single episode as they came out monthly, it took the release of True Colors for me to remember it even existed.

But, as it is, since there isn't really anything bad to say about this game, reviews are mostly positive. Sadly there's not much to say about it, period. It's just kinda forgettably okay."
1624,I can say it was better than Life is Strange 1 for sure.
1625,it's not as good as the first game.
1626,game is aboslutely perfect for  people
1627,
1628,"Overall a good adventure game with a fairly compelling story, however as a huge fan of the first Life is Strange, this one fell short for me.  

First off, I found the main characters and story difficult to truly care about.  There were a couple of occasions throughout the game where I felt I had to force myself to play onward only because I wanted to see how the ending turns out.  Sean and Daniel are just not on the same level as Max and Chloe from the first game in terms of likability and I found it much more difficult to really feel for them and their journey.  Also on the topic of characters, I found Daniel to be very annoying as he consistently jeopardizes almost every situation throughout the story.  I get that he's supposed to be a kid, but he often just acts completely stupid and reckless for no reason other than to be difficult.  This game also lacks a main player-controlled character with a superpower like Max's rewind ability which I think really limits the gameplay versus the first game.

Secondly, and probably the biggest issue I have with this game, is the constant and downright relentless political and racial narrative that is embedded in the core of the story.  Right off the bat this game dives into topics of excessive force by police, racism, religious fanaticism, and white supremacy.  I'm not denying that these issues exist in America, but this game is completely obsessed with portraying the US as a brutally racist country where most everyone (save for a handful of characters) hates immigrants and anyone who isn't white will get beaten, abused, and even shot at randomly by complete strangers.  Again, not saying these problems don't exist in real life but it really portrays an over-amplified picture that would make someone who isn't from the US think that the country is just a insanely dangerous place.  Add to that the fact that Dontnod is a French developer and that a huge chunk of the devs that worked on this game are French, it just really put me off that I felt like I, as an American, was being lectured on American political and racial issues and constantly being told how much my country sucks by a French entity.  

Overall, this game is worth a playthrough if you're a fan of adventure games and the story is pretty good, but it definitely lacks the true magic of the original Life is Strange."
1629,love
1630,"I wish there was a ""meh"" option for this game. I really enjoyed Life is Strange and Before the Storm, and I've played each a few times, but I can't see myself playing Life is Strange 2 again...at least anytime in the near future. I really wanted to like this game since the others were done pretty well, but I really felt like I had to force myself to play this one. Episodes 1 and 2 really had me interested in finding out what was going to happen next, but after that, I couldn't find anything that could draw me back in genuinely. The story was fine for the most part, and I really enjoyed the small details like Sean's sketchbook, tying in other characters from the previous Life is Strange games, and the overall art style of the game. It really felt like this game was very linear even though there were choices to be made. I will not be taking the time to play it again to find out if that is the case, but based on certain dialog options, I cannot see any real changes in the overall outcome of the story, or any of the smaller choices other than getting grouped in a different percentage based on your choice. The idle time of not interacting at all with the game was a big turn off and I found myself doing other things while I let the game play in the background until it got to a section in which I could move or pick something again. I did notice some odd glitches with the walkie-talkie in certain animations as well (especially within Episode 4), but it didn't hurt the game all, it was just something that I had noticed.I think this game would have been much better off as a graphic novel or something of that nature because I do think there is good content here, it just isn't a game I would recommend outright. If minimal engagement is what you are looking for then this isn't a bad option, but it is quite a disappointment compared to the other two, and it makes me skeptical of the new one."
1631,Still the best in the series!
1632,yes but not as much yes as the first one
1633,Very good game
1634,"I adore this game, the graphics are beautiful and it's so easy to fall in love with and connect to the characters. One of my favourite parts of the game is the fact that you're not the one with the power, Daniel is, and as his big brother he looks up to you and responds to your actions. Sean becomes a brother and a father figure for him after Seattle which means he is also teaching him lessons for life. I'm currently on my third replay of the game and I'll continue to play it until way into the future. :)"
1635,"Really wish there was a 'Meh' option.  IMO it was not as good as the first, but I did finish it and didn't mind the ending. For big parts of this game it felt like I was watching TV or a movie more than making choices and participating like in LiS 1. It felt a little forced and to me it felt like it lacked depth of the characters. I am voting up, as I don't think it is bad enough not to give it a look, but it would not be in my top 10 list of choices matter content."
1636,"Played this at launch but quit after episode 2's nonsensical consequences and even though I kept saying I'd return to finish the game, I could never find the effort. Writing this review now is me finally giving up after 3 years.

To me, the most important parts of the first game (and the franchise) were the world building of a single location and developing meaningful relationships with a recurring cast of interesting side characters. This game removed both of those aspects in favour of a road-trip game where you're constantly changing locations every episode - you only ever get a few hours to know the people and setting before leaving, so if you can't get solely invested in the 2 brothers (the only recurring cast) like I couldn't, the game is boring.

Huge miss imo, and I'm very glad the franchise was handed to Deck Nine who've did a much better job of a sequel with True Colours. They actually understand what fans liked about the original game."
1637,"Ignore my hours, as I have completed the series.

For me this is definitely one of the best out of the LiS series. The first Life Is Strange is great and all, but 2 has far greater character development and it very much does feel like a road trip. Loved it."
1638,"THE CGI is top notch, the game play is easy to get used to and very reminiscent of the first series.  I love the fact that your choices that you make through out the game change the outcome of the game itself and alter your path and the events that occur as you go.  Finished the first episode in less than 3 hours and can't wait to play episode 2-5."
1639,veri gut
1640,"good game
"
1641,Certainly a step up from the first game but it suffers from some of the issues of the first game
1642,this little  kid is annoying as fuck bruv and whats up with these Life is Strange games beign too fuckin  emotional  and shit
1643,"Least favorite in the series because the characters are on the run so they never really connect with any environments or characters fully, which is what DONTNOD is great at. Powers are underplayed unlike other games of LoS. It does still have interesting choices and emotional themes however, so it's something to play between games if you're in a walking simulator game."
1644,This game is very fun.
1645,yes
1646,it's awesome just complete Episode 1 and continue 9.5/10
1647,"I've played life is strange 1 and before the storm but I thought that was it, well until I was just sitting there and got an ad for life is strange 3 and I was wondering, ""does that mean that there are 2 other life is strange games that I have never even heard of?'' and now i'm playing this and I am already falling in love with these characters. so yes, please buy this game"
1648,"The story is great. Takes you in as the other Life Is Strange games.
"
1649,"I liked everything in this game. The plot was good, as were the characters and their background stories. The game is interactive where you decide the course of the game's story. The game is very well done in the sense that every small decision can have a big impact on the course of the game’s story. There are seven different endings in the game (And I ofc got the worst one). I played the game in less than three days and it took about 15 hours. Before that you should play the spin-off / Demo game ""The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit"". It's time is set at one point in this game. You can continue in this game from where Captain Spirit left off. I've also played the part one of this game series. So you should play it before you play this.

I will definitely play this game again. That time I’m going to play this game in a really different and better way.

I give 8,5 points out of 10 for this game. One of the best story games I've ever played."
1650,"LOVE THIS GAME.
Thoroughly enjoyed the story, the characters, THE MUSIC. I urge anyone undecided on buying it to definitely give it a chance, as it'll most likely work its way into your heart. My only gripe with the game is how much it made me an ugly-crying mess, it's just riddled with absolutely beautiful moments. Haven't played any other games in the LIS series, although LIS2 quickly became one of my favourite games ever so I might give the others a chance too.

I recommend you play this game for the journey, or if you're keen on sobbing over fictional characters (or both!)"
1651,"As much as I always like the stories in these titles, this one unfortunately gets a NO from me. Made it until the end of episode 2 and now I'm just done.

My two huge grimes in short:

#1 - pretty buggy for me, personally. Might be a fluke because I have a number of friends who played and didn't have the issue, but I had everything from clipping to getting my character stuck and ultimately the game crashing to desktop.

This is especially fun when paired with the checkpoint autosave and

#2 - the ridiculous unskippable cutscenes. I have no idea why the OPTION to skip through cutscenes is locked to a certain (collectible) mode but it just is (and apparently that's still true even for the newest game of this series). 

So, as if sitting through a 5-minute landscape tour where the Devs fancy their own world design isn't slightly annoying to begin with, you get to do it again if the game crashes in an inconvenient place - as it frequently did for me. Now add to that how this is a decision based game you might want to replay in full a second time-- so that you can then watch that same fancy winter wonderland cutscene AGAIN. For the probably 5th time or so.

Just: no. I'm sorry. Again, characters and story are generally great, but I just hate when a game sets out to waste my time, which is what this feels like, especially when throwing the technical difficulties on top. 

Last game in this series for me as long as that simple player choice solution to most of this unpleasant expirience isn't implemented. Because I could've dealt with the rest. I'm not generally impatient. However, this felt like insult to injury."
1652,"yes
"
1653,"Love the Life is Strange series as a whole, each game has its strengths and themes that it does really well and Life is Strange 2 is no different.

Life is Strange 2 is based around two brothers called Sean and Daniel (Sean is the older one, Daniel is the younger) they are on the run to the border of Mexico, after their dad was killed by a trigger happy police man and then Daniel lost control of his untapped powers, telekenesis which he then used to kill the police man and for obvious reasons they couldn't explain the situation and therefore had to run.

the games main theme is racism in a trump elected America and your main job as the big brother is to be a influence on Daniel through your choices and life lessons you try to teach him (whether you want to be a good or bad influence and what lessons you want to teach him is down to you).

the game does a very good job this time around of summarising your choices because you influence on Daniel will change multiple choices, including different variations to the ending ones. The games around 20 hours long and is a well written experience, it does have a different vibe and feel to Life is Strange 1 though so that's something to bare in mind if your a fan of the original."
1654,"Uma história interessante que prende o jogador nos acontecimentos ocorridos ao decorrer do jogo, ao mesmo tempo triste por conta dos envolvimentos e sentimentos apresentados, dois homens hispânicos presenciam o preconceito racial, e uma amiga que é deixada para trás mas nunca esquece de você, uma história que reflete sobre a realidade e demostra os pensamentos e atitudes que podemos fazer na vida"
1655,:)
1656,"Does not support MacOS 10.14.
Game was released in 2018, and so was MacOS 10.14. They must have supported it at launch, and changed somewhere along the way. No excuse."
1657,Love it
1658,"This game is unlike any other, i do not understand why people hate this game, probably my second favorite game sharing the sport with the first one, and my favorite game being the last of us 1 & 2"
1659,8/10
1660,Pretty cool game. Par for the course of the Life is Strange series and a fitting sequel to the first game.
1661,"Life is Strange 2 is a story and character rich adventure telling the tale of their journey to Puerto Lobos in Mexico following an unfortunate event in their hometown of Seattle that led them to flee for safer lands. 

As a player, you'll find yourself connecting deeply with the main characters Sean and Daniel through their various mishaps and adventures along the way whilst meeting a extensive cast of supporting characters.

While the game has an engaging story, good environments, and great characters, the pacing can sometimes feel off and the story can be predictable in terms of what happens at the end of an episode, being that something happens and Sean and Daniel have to leave the location they're at meaning that characters and locations are ultimately forgotten going forward.

Aside from this, the game is a great play with multiple great endings. A strong final game in DONTNOD's role as Life is Strange creators. Deck Nine have some big shoes to fill but I'm sure they'll manage :)"
1662,fucking awesome
1663,Immersive indeed.
1664,Bad
1665,It's good.
1666,<3
1667,Mind blowing Story. One of best narrative game of all time .Love for the game as well as bothers will never be end.
1668,"Amazing game... made me cry :')

Buy it!"
1669,good game
1670,I love the story
1671,ballz ughh yeas
1672,"Another LiS game, and another tear jerker."
1673,":))
"
1674,"this game is laughably bad compared to life is strange 1 and even before the storm. with the way that it plays where the player can never get attached to any characters in the game since every episode you're introduced to a new cast, it makes it very hard to even get invested in the story.

i played up to episode 5, realized i wasn't having any fun with the way the game functioned, and turned it off. i haven't played it since and i don't have any plans to, because it's just not a good game."
1675,"yes
"
1676,"I really loved the ending to this game! I enjoyed the beginning to this game. The rest of the time? I often had to force myself through it. A strong 2/5 if I had to rate it.
I wanted to love this game but the writing often fell flat; which is especially unforgivable in such a story heavy game. This game had interesting ideas -and the subtlety of a wrecking ball. Worse yet, there's no fun gameplay to distract you. I spent lot of time wishing there was a skip dialogue button. I enjoy the atmosphere of LiS games but they really should be doing better."
1677,Pretty Bussin
1678,Great game
1679,"Might as well be called Life is Trauma. If you're prone to succumbing to strong emotional triggers like me, I'd recommend checking out doesthedogdie.com for this game to hunt for your specific triggers. It's really intense. I'm currently just through Episode 2 (including captain spirit) and while it's definitely an impactful game, I'm not sure if I need this level of emotional distress in my escapism."
1680,GIVE ME MY FUCKING CHOCO-CRISP!
1681,This happend to my buddy frank
1682,truly amazing. had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. its a must pla y int the LIS franchise.
1683,The best story driven game I've ever played.
1684,BEST BROS ♥
1685,"I really enjoyed the first Life is Strange game with Max, and, when I learned this game had a completely different set of characters and story line, I was hesitant to play. I wish I had picked up this game sooner because this story was great! The struggle of Sean trying to save his brother Daniel while also coping with the new, unexplained power amidst real-world threats was executed well. Over the course of the five episodes, you grow attached to the main two characters and want to protect their sibling dynamic. It isn't always easy, and a lot of stuff happened that caught me off guard but I was never completely turned off the game. I wanted to see how their story ended. (I would definitely recommend looking up trigger warnings beforehand since some things might hit too closely to home for some players.) The only negative thing I would have to say is that some dialogue options weren't super clear and some of the background dialogue that Daniel would say would get repetitive and annoying pretty quickly. Minor annoyances, but, overall, a great game."
1686,"I deeply enjoyed Life is Strange, as well as Before the Storm. 
But this... ain't it. Nothing seems to work like it should, from the writing, to the acting, to the gameplay itself. 
You don't get anything remotely interesting to play with (i.e. powers, or a charming cast of side characters). 
The anti-police feelings (while arguably justified) seem like a ham-fisted attempt at being relevant, which comes off as insincere and inauthentic. 
And on a personal note, if you're going to cut the cast down to basically 2 characters, have them be engaging and likeable. The brothers here just annoyed the ever-living piss out of me the whole time."
1687,dont like how they spelt sean. 0/10
1688,The Carpenter's (Car Mechanic's) Son !
1689,"Life is strange was a wonderful game and also before the storm they both made you get attached the the characters, they both made you feel like you were responsible for your choices. But this game wasn't at all what i expected the whole game was me dealing with whatever situation daniel put us in my choices didn't have anything to do with the story and i know the creator are much better then this i'm sorry."
1690,amazing story i  simply have no words<3
1691,"Its meh, nothing special, buy it if its on offer."
1692,"Life is Strange 1 and Before the Storm are among my favorite games of all time. Tell Me Why is nearly as good. But DontNod really dropped the ball with this one. Those other games were deeply emotional and intense and disturbing, but those moments were interspersed with moments of levity, humor, and fun. Those games had side plots. Those games had characters who you built relationships with over the course of the game. They were fun to play in spite of the emotionally grueling subject matter because it wasn't all dark all the time. 

Life is Strange 2 has none of that. It starts with violence and continues with more and more violence, most of it racially motivated. There is no relief. There is no humor. There is no joy. There is no hope. There is no developing friendships with the people you meet. It's all just hoping the people you meet don't try to hurt you. And the little brother who you have to watch over constantly is a completely unlikable character. He's nine years old. What nine year old has any redeeming qualities? He doesn't. He's loud as f*ck. He's obnoxious. He doesn't take anything seriously. He's not careful. Every step of the way you think your loud, annoying little brother is going to get you killed because he doesn't know how to keep his voice down. 

I write this after finishing the first episode. At this point I want to abandon the little brother and continue to Mexico on my own. The game is entirely built around developing a relationship between the two brothers as they struggle together, but it gives me no reason to care for this little brat who is a nuisance every step of the way. 

I really really HATE this game. It is extremely disturbing, depressing, violent, and not remotely fun, entertaining, or engaging. I can't recommend it to anybody. As a work of art it's absolutely brilliant. As a way to make a relatively privileged white guy feel what it's like to be the victim of racially motivated violence, it absolutely succeeds. The visuals are outstanding. The game mechanics are quite good. Inventory and exploration are easy and enjoyable. But the story, the characters, the plot - utterly miserable. This is not a game. This is not entertainment. This is just a whole lot of me getting angry and wanting to blow the f*ck out of cops and rednecks. This game makes me want to buy a gun and follow around Mexican kids killing anybody who harasses them. That's how this game makes me feel. I'm incredibly angry. I can't keep playing this."
1693,"At least the music, as always, is still pretty good.

I wanted to like this one, but I just.. don't. Daniel is pretty annoying a lot of the time and it's kinda boring to be the normal one in a life is strange game. I also found it difficult to connect to most of the characters because you have so little time with them, and I get that maybe that's the point but in the end I just didn't really care about them. Plus the ending I got was so frustrating... Baring in mind I did everything ""good"", Daniel never did anything seen as wrong. Yet I still got kind of a shitty ending."
1694,"Sweet series, story well written and very engaging. Keeps you pushing for more just to see what happens next. Music is awesome too, love the direction this is taking so far."
1695,:)
1696,"Will update this review as I actually work my way through the episodes. 

EPISODE 1: pretty solid. The sociopolitical commentary is obviously extremely present, but you're also not inappropriately smashed over the head with it, despite most of Episode 1's major moments revolving around incidents of aggressive racism. The story itself is decent, although it's much more sad and harrowing than ""strange"" à la Season 1. It really does convey all the heartache, confusion, frustration, and stress of the brothers' situation; you really do feel for them, even when Daniel is being annoying or Sean is being angsty. They both feel a lot like real people, much more so than Max, Rachel, or Chloe ever did (although I did and do still love all of them). I don't know yet if the hook of this game--fleeing from the law, police brutality, and racism, all while trying to survive on the road as two young runaways--is quite as engaging as the various ominous mysteries of the first... but all comparisons aside, I AM still hooked. I want to see the brothers' relationship grow, I want to see Daniel experiment with his powers, I want to see Sean learn to smile again via the kindness of strangers and the joyful innocence of his brother, I want to keep helping them to survive in a world that's pitted against them. I also really love the backpack and sketching mechanics, which are a lot more engaging than Max's photography in Season 1. Sean's journal is a lot better too, since he doesn't just rehash and reword events we've already seen in long text dumps dotted with the occasional fun sketch or photo. 

All in all, so far so good. The narrative isn't quite as captivating as Season 1, but it's just as immersive, if not more so, and that might just be because Season 1 was SO novel and original when it first came out that no follow-up can quite match it. Everything else has been largely improved upon, and your choices seem to matter more than ever now, since you've also got to consider how your actions are going to both directly and indirectly affect your brother's behaviors and perspectives.

EPISODE 2: This episode was just okay. I didn’t mind the downtime, which was a pleasant change of pace from the stress and desperation of Episode 1… but there were one too many non-negotiable narrative choices that ended up feeling like the devs just didn’t really know what they were doing. 

(SPOILER ALERT) Like, why include the dog at all if they were just going to kill it off 20 minutes into the next episode no matter what the PC does? Could they not think of any other way to prompt Daniel into using his powers destructively? Did they realize that Claire and Stephen definitely wouldn’t have let the pup into their home, or that there was no way two young boys struggling to survive on the run would be able to also care for a dog? It just felt really unnecessary and, frankly, lazy. There were dozens of more effective ways to deal with the issue of the dog… one of which was to never include it in the game in the first place, or to make giving it to Brody to take care of an option. 

As for the market scene… it didn’t make sense that there was no option to veto it. Sean absolutely knew better after emphasizing the importance of them laying low so much prior to arriving at Beaver Creek. It just felt like the devs really wanted to shoehorn in more content including Chris, and also wanted a dramatic reason for Sean and Daniel to need to flee their grandparents’ home, and this was the only feasible way that they could think of to do it.  

(END SPOILERS)

I did really like the relationship/morality dynamics in this one, though, even though I’m not satisfied with how things are turning out in my current playthrough. I like that the balances between keeping your relationship with Daniel positive, keeping Daniel safe re: his powers, and teaching Daniel good morals isn’t at all easy to navigate. Trying to keep Daniel happy isn’t always gonna be the right move for your overall relationship OR for Daniel’s long-term wellbeing. It also makes for some really tough, classic LiS choices, where you don’t always know what the right thing to do is, or you THINK that you know what the right thing to do is but then it comes back to bite you an hour or two later. These choices and their consequences definitely feel a lot more complex and organic than they did in LiS Season 1, in which the choices were all too often “piss off Chloe” or “don’t piss off Chloe”, and didn’t really have a lasting outcome on your overall relationship with her beyond a throwaway comment or two."
1697,my feels ;;-;;
1698,"This game is a bit diffrent from the rest of Life is Strange games but it's really good and has a great story.
"
1699,"Episode 3 is really good, didn't like much else about it."
1700,Nice game!
1701,"A different kind of story, but another great installment in a series that will make you think and feel."
1702,I liked all aspects of this game.
1703,"that was an emotional roller coaster, so I'll try and write as clearly as I can but wow. as a big fan of the first Life is Strange, I was nervous that a second title was coming out under the same name. I didn't think it would live up to how attached I was to the first setting and characters, and I thought it was good they were trying to bring up issues of racism and xenophobia in america but I thought they were gonna sweep the whole lgbt thing under the rug; because in most media, that would be considered ""too"" progressive. but not for the Life is Strange devs. this game completely blew my expectations out of the water.

my advice in short; just play this game. let it take you on a journey. take breaks, I know I needed to, but this game was a whole experience which offered so much insight- into family (found and blood,) identity, and so much more, with a lot more nuance than I could possibly fit into a short review.

it reminds you that the world is incredibly small, and that the friends you make in it- especially those who suffer the same bigotry as you do- are a community you have that's looking out for you wherever you go, even if they haven't met you yet. and that you should look out for your community too, your family.
because the events in this game are harrowing, and even without the mystical powers, everything else that's showcased is incredibly real even if its parts of the world the player has never thought about before.
we as people all need to look out for each other, and choose our own path, because the real world is unfair, and full of injustice, only if we let it be.

this game was a wild ride, so grateful again to the LIS team for the most real game I think I've ever played."
1704,"I've only just finished episode 3 and will make myself get through the other 2 but the voice acting and writing of this one really is a let down. I adored LiS1 and BtS, but this is an entirely different and disappointing experience. Like others have said, it feels like a babysitting simulator and is so politically charged that it's a real turn off for me. None of my choices seemed to make a difference, but perhaps that's the point. It's also hard to feel like you're building any real connections with other characters as they're never constant. Throughout my game I've tried to be as nice and supportive of Daniel as I can be but he's still a whiny little brat, so much so that I just don't really care what happens to him. The pros would be the scenery when you're given a chance to enjoy it.

Edit: Finished episode 5, I haven't wanted to uninstall a game so fast before. The ending I got just pissed me off. I would say more but don't want to spoil for those who want to put themselves through it..."
1705,"An adventurous game where you get to meet many different characters (for good and ill) in each chapter and you can appreciate many different beautiful landscapes enhanced by calm often melancholy soundtrack (that becomes rather more tense when the situation requires.)

Overall, for fans of Life is Strange series and story based games, I believe you will very much enjoy this game."
1706,"The beginning of the story is very strong and i think the characters are, as far as i'm playing, interesting and more likable than those in LIS 1. HOWEVER something happened in the beginning of episode 2 that completely destroy  all my will to continue playing.

[spoiler] Okay, the dog died. And it's not just because of that, because the dog also died in Plague Tale and I continued playing. It's just that it feels stupid right after they lost their Dad, they have to lose their dog in that manner too. I understand it's for the character building but it just feels so stupid. Moreover, the dog's death could've been avoided. It felt SO unnecessary. [/spoiler]

Even though I don't recommend this game, it still has its charm. If you're a fan of LIS 1 then you will like this one too. I personally think most of the characters in LIS 1 are annoying, but the brothers in LIS 2 are actually likeable and make you really care for them. I'm sure the full storyline must be good, but sadly I just really can't continue."
1707,"This isn't a game, its leftist propaganda, as usual. But even without that, the story is boring, and voice acting annoying. Won't be buying the other episodes and probably won't buy the third game.

Shame, I really enjoyed the first one."
1708,"I mean it's not good but it is teenage drama good wich basically means it's a game you are just taking the piss out of so don't expect any life changing game here. I would highly recommend alcohol and a group of friends for the best experience 
"
1709,"Life is strange is by far one of my favourite series of video games. LiS 2 is no exception. Incredible, immersive story that genuinely makes you want to keep playing. Almost like when you binge a really good series, youre constantly on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. 

Being a video game of course, you have choices. The choices that are presented to you in this game genuinely feel like they matter. Unlike other choices-matter games, theres never really a clear ""correct"" or ""good"" choice, and it can be quite ambiguous and head-scratching trying to pick which one you want to go with. 

The graphics are just like the other games, with a good mix between cartoony and realism. Goes great with the mood and tone the game tries to follow
And lastly, the soundtrack doesnt dissapoint in the slightest. 
Overall, a 10/10"
1710,"very good game, i very much recommend
"
1711,wish i had a sibling
1712,Boring
1713,"First, for all who played Life is Strange 1 I would recommend this story game as it is partially connected with Life is Strange 1. For all the others, play LiS1 first then LiS2.

Pros:
- Awesome Graphics
- Long Story with many different character groups and stereotyps
- characters act understandably
- The multiple sceneries are beautiful
- The interaction with the scenery was diverse
- About after playing for 6h the story becomes more thrilling
- Especially the last hours are very emotional

Cons:
- sometimes the answer time is limited, which is not displayed and can leave you with your character not saying anything in a important discussion
- The story beginning is far from LiS1, which I disliked, because I prefer to first learn about my enviroment and not leave it immediately after an incident
- The situation the protagonist is in, is hard to comprehend at the beginning of playing LiS2, thus it became for me boring
- There is a lack of action especially in the first 6h of playing, of course there are some incidents but most of the time I didn't feel the story like in LiS1
- I mentioned that the story becomes more thrilling after 6h but the climax has been disappointing and I was not as thrilled as in LiS1 with Mark Jefferson

To conclude,
I think the creators Dontnod Entertainment and Feral Interactive should have chosen a more understandable scenario, because this story game is very special which makes it as good as it is bad. But still a recommandable story game.
"
1714,Daniel be anoying as fuck that mf ruined every second of the game including the ending
1715,"First one is stellar and exiting, this one grabs those heartstrings if you got siblings. It's a beautiful chaos that keeps you playing"
1716,"It's not as bad as the first life is strange but it's still incredibly cringy and not subtle with it's message.  I'm fine with a game about racism but in this game it's just so black and white and unrealistic.  Not every police officer would treat max and Shawn like shit, yes they are suspects in a murder case but they're still children.  I think it's very disrespectful to generalise them all like this.  Also while i like the characters a lot more then the first game, the story can drag and there's a episode that just goes nowhere.  I also find the gameplay to be kinda boring a lot of walking, talking etc, you don't get to use Daniel's power's which was one the best parts of the first life is strange.  Another thing I know this is only the second game in the series but this game studio isn't young and the game looks really bad, like I'm not expecting amazing visuals here but it's like ps1-ps2 levels of quality.  For such a long period between episodes and games I expect more and i don't think that's unreasonable.  Overall I think this game is ok but the message on racism needed a lot more work, as did a lot of the characters; it's not horrible but i really don't understand where all the high ratings are coming from at best it's mediorce story about racism, loss and running away."
1717,"Life is strange.
It's strange, but still life.
It's cool without a satisfying ending，for it's reality."
1718,Não gostei
1719,"One of my favourite games by far! The graphics are beautiful and the story line is superb, over all an amazing game!"
1720,"good
"
1721,man if i could have went to the party i would have smashed the girl ffs
1722,Amazing story. Amazing characters. Amazing game. never cried this hard before 20/10 would cry again.
1723,"Not as good as the first one. As a Hispanic person who himself has experienced racism I feel like all the additions of the current political climate it was trying to portraying did not feel genuine. the first game after every episode I was actually excited to play the next episode. this game was a slog. Honestly it gets kind of preachy and coming from the background they are trying to preach from I can honestly say it just annoyed me.  

-good things
ending I got was ok 
it has some interesting moments first couple episodes.
finding letters and just discovering lore to learn about other characters is cool.
overall game 5/10"
1724,best life is strange imo
1725,Awesome game but not for people who wants everything to be perfect:):)Its very touching and emotional.Highly recommend👍.
1726,ACAB
1727,"I can't believe I didn't review this. The writing isn't as good as the first, which is kind of expected, because nothing can live up to the first, but the characters are somehow even more believable and relatable. Gameplay is less unique, with the player character having absolutely no powers, but that really helps the story in my opinion by making the player character more relatable to powerless situations, while also using the gameplay mechanics to deconstruct the player's morality and empathy. Also makes a great statement on racism within the United States, as many of the issues presented are a reality to Hispanic and Latin-Americans."
1728,"8/10 Life is Strange 2 is a really good game! Great character development and interactions. I loved exploring new scenes and scenarios across Oregon in each EP. The choice for two romances was great. Lost points for the story not being quite my taste, mainly on EP 2. Daniel was a little irritable to me. The game won't give me the All Roads Travelled achievement, even tho I've unlocked all the other achievements. Those are the only reasons I'm giving it an 8/10 and not a 10/10."
1729,"This... had exactly the opposite of what made LiS1 good. Every single episode had a new location and characters, no one came back in future episodes. It made all the characters feel two dimensional and like environment props.

The story had such little direction. ""We need to go on the run"" - meanwhile there's no proof that they're guilty of anything and would at most be questioned as witnesses. The whole race thing felt really forced. It seemed every episode had some caricature ""redneck American"" that was beating Sean up and he just takes it.

Speaking of taking it, most decisions didn't even seem to make an impact on the story. Your playable character didn't have the powers, it was an annoying kid brother who you had to try and control with warped marionette strings. Big decision coming up? Sorry, you made some arbitrary decision hours ago that will make Daniel do something you don't want him to do.

It all felt like a trainwreck story that progressed at a snail's pace. Each episode you'd get the tiniest sandbox to explore, but it'd lock you out of areas and you'd miss collectables if you didn't fully explore that area at the exact right time, too bad. The main beats of the story seemed to happen only at the end of an episode and IN BETWEEN episodes where there was always some kind of time skip. It was incredibly frustrating doing some of the ""main objectives"" as it was either a repetitive chore, quick time events (I thought devs learned these were horrible back on the PS2) or literally ""wait for x person and do nothing"".

There were some easter eggs about LiS1/Arcadia Bay which I enjoyed - but its a bit sad that this was more interesting than the actual story for this game.

Would not recommend, skip this and hopefully True Colours (which just came out!) is a major improvement."
1730,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that the first Life is Strange is my favorite game of all time. That isn't super important to this review, I just feel like it's worth mentioning for context. Life is Strange 2 is a good game. I enjoyed my time playing this game, and I played it all the way through. However, it is nothing like Life is Strange. It shares the choices matter aspect and the fact that somebody has a power, and that's about it. The first game had characters that were consistent throughout, an extremely interesting mystery, and a general feeling of saving your home. This game has characters quickly entering and exiting the story, no mystery/investigation plot, and the entire game you are trying to get to somewhere else. I'm not saying any of these are bad things, but I feel like this game shouldn't be approached as a Life is Strange game. Enter this game with the mindset of it being a new game, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for something like the first Life is Strange, play the new Life is Strange: True Colors. I still recommend this game, as it is a good game, just don't expect anything like your experiences with Max."
1731,"its fun
"
1732,"Not quite as satisfying as LiS and LiS: Before The Storm, but still a genuinely good game with very real feeling characters, relationships, environments, and conflicts. These games are beautiful, everyone and everything, every place has so much personality from the moment you encounter them. And on top of that the soundtracks slap on every game. I've discovered plenty of music I wouldn't have listened to otherwise because of these games. I absolutely can't wait for the LiS and BtS remasters with group play, so we can do more than pass the controller around when my friends and I get together. I really need to start reading the comics, too. The returning characters and references in each game make this universe feel so big and so small at the same time. I hope they keep making these games for years to come, with the same heart they've put into every installment so far. My one gripe with this installment is the ending. [spoiler] Showing the boys grow up and how their life turns out kind of takes away the open ended spirit of the first Life is Strange game. When I finished the first Life is Strange, I felt there was a world of possibilities out there waiting for Max (and Chloe, since I chose that ending). Seeing pretty much how the rest of their life goes after they cross the border through cutscenes was kind of... lame. [/spoiler] Regardless of the ending, I'd still say this game was more about the journey than the destination anyway, and is worth playing if you've enjoyed the previous installments."
1733,really nice story and lots of different outcomes depending on the choices
1734,I loved this game. I felt connected to the main characters and as the game went on found myself taking longer to make my decisions! A couple bugs but nothing bad at all and you get a lot of value for this game!
1735,"Sean .. a good husbando with a great music taste. Strong man, Love it."
1736,"Emily Rogers revealed that DONTNOD Entertainment was kicked out by it's publisher and Deck Nine would handle all games related to life is strange. So I think, basically Life is Strange 2 is the end of this series. 

My brother in law traveled to Tibet in 2008, and he was killed in a terrorist attack, and this terrorist organization we call them Tibetan Separatists. He was a brother to me and everything I played in this game reminds me of him. 

Yesterday I watched Life is Strange: True Colors' live game stream, and I saw the Tibetan Separatists' flag, to be honest it is so disgusting to think because the game series I loved is turning into a propagandist, will we see Hongkong Separatists' flag in next Life is Strange?

I know Deck Nine has nothing to do with this game that's why I gave this game thumbs up. DONTNOD will no longer be part of Life is Strange series made me realize it's time to face the final curtain of Life is Strange."
1737,my therapist will hear about this
1738,I love it. The story is awesome and heartbreaking. Can't wait to play the newly released one!

People hate on this game for dumb asf reasons."
1741,"Love this game! Really feel the travel vibe :D
Interesting story and discussions too!"
1742,"I'm soo glad I played this game, even though i ended up crying like a little baby. 
But I missed Lyla in this game.. At first I thought she would be a big part of the whole story but unfortunately that wasn't the case. 
I also think that the game doesn't really have a happy ending for Sean and Daniel.
Either they are separated from each other, one dies, or they become criminals. 
But overall I enjoyed the game a lot. You can really tell how much they love each other and how far they would go for each other. Thumbs up!

And before I forget: RIP Mushroom </3"

1745,"[h1][b]Life is Strange 2[/b][/h1]
[i]Life is Strange 2[/i] is an episodic, story driven, supernatural-ish game in which your decisions will change the outcome of the story between the two brothers as well as their friends they made on the way.

[b]Story[/b]

The main protagonist of [i]Life is Strange 2[/i] is Sean Diaz who tries to get to Mexico with his little brother Daniel Diaz after a tragic event at their home, in which Sean discovered that his little brother has some sort of supernatural abillity. Wanted by the police, the two brothers try their best to strengthen their bond on the way to their father’s hometown Puerto Lobos.

[b]Personal Note[/b]

This is honestly a though one to review. [i]Life is Strange 2[/i] is a good game, full of good graphics, good music, interesting characters, a bond between brothers that is constantly being tested, a lot of choices that influence the actual endings quite a bit and a few different environments with a handful of plots. Well, that sounds pretty promising right?

I think that [i]LiS 2[/i] was a step in the right direction while being way to ambitious and full of things people didn’t like. Let’s start, shall we?

[i]LiS 2[/i] offers at least 5 major different environments in which the player faces different challenges and emotional punches. The issue is that the Life is Strange franchise isn’t really made for this many different places in a short time and it shows: Everything looks and plays good but feels off at the same time. It just might be because the original Life is Strange and Before the Storm didn’t have such a variety of locations and characters that the player is able to interact and bond with.

The many characters the player encounters are mostly very well written and interesting but there is not enough time to actually create some sort of a bond with them which makes the player not care as much when certain things happen.

The brotherhood between Sean and Daniel works pretty well but more often than not it is very frustrating that you can’t really make Daniel listen to whatever the player tells him.

All three issues that I slightly described make sense story wise. The two main characters are constantly on the move and there is never enough time to discover everything or make friends with everyone, but I feel like it unfortunately hurts the game more than it helps. I think, all those things are amazing to some extend – seeing all those awesome locations and the plots with the well written characters in it was something I really liked about the game but I can see how some, if not most, people disliked exactly those things.

The other issue this game has, is the clear political messages throughout the game itself. The whole thing about being two immigrants whilst being born in the US really was slammed into the players face multiple times in the story. There is also a time in which religion is being focused quite a lot. Sean being likely bi-sexual, or straight or gay (depending on the players choices), isn’t focused as much, just like the previous Life is Strange games had their fair share of LGBTQ+ moments as well.

Something that [i]Life is Strange 2[/i] does better than the previous games is the way everything is being handled: It feels more mature and at times even more brutal and unforgiving. Whilst the endings of the original and the prequel pack a punch, [i]LiS 2[/i] has multiple of such moments throughout the game.

[b]Rating[/b]
[list][b]Pros[/b]
[*] Good story
[*] Great graphics and visuals  
[*] Good soundtrack that fits the vibe
[*] Good voice acting
[*] Interesting characters
[*] A wide variety of places
[*] A unique take on the supernatural aspect of the franchise
[*] Choices matter more than expected
[*] Endings more flushed out than previous LiS titles
[*] Original LiS choice matters
[/list]
[list][b]Cons[/b]
[*] Political messages feel too forced
[*] Too ambitious
[/list]
[b]Conclusion[/b] 

Is [i]Life is Strange 2[/i] worth your time? If you liked the original games and if you are up for a different direction with a bigger scale, I would recommend this game.

There are some issues that I’ve slightly covered in this review that some people might not like or even hate. The political messages in this game were a bit too much unfortunately – I personally have no problem with pushing political or social agendas in games as long as it doesn’t hurt the game, in this case, it kind of ruined the experience for many and also made mine a bit less enjoyable. 

[i]LiS 2[/i] has a whole different vibe than the original games. It is too ambitious although most of the things work out in the end – at least to some extent. This game has truly it’s good and amazing moments that Life is Strange is known for – if you’re looking to experience them, get the game.

[b]8.7 / 10[/b]

1746,"Much like the previous entries in the series, I loved Life is Strange 2. While I don't feel like it quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, this is a well written and thoughtful story that packs the emotional punch I've come to expect from these games. Shout out Brody, what a guy."
1747,"tbh this game is awesome, love everything about it"
1748,"Amazing Game, really enjoyed following the journey and story of 2 Brothers."
1749,The story line and the decisions are very interesting and complex. I would recommend this game to everyone I like it a lot.
1750,"Simplesmente os episódios 1 e 2 são maravilhosos, mas apartir daí, a qualidade diminiu drasticamente, com os finais lamentáveis. É uma pena, pois o primeiro jogo foi incrível, um dos melhores jogos que já joguei."
1751,".

1752,cried
1753,"Nah, this game is not at all one of the best choice and see consequences game, this is one of the worst games i've actually played. :/ Not at all enjoyable"
1754,"It is an unrealistic to expect all LiS games to be as good as the first. That was a masterpiece, this is ""just"" a great game.

"
1755,Kenapa tk boleh main episod 2 .sudh beli tpi tk boleh
1756,"I really enjoyed Life is Strange 1 and Before the Storm, but in my opinion Life is Strange 2 falls short from both of these games. I found it a chore to play through this game and couldn't force myself to finish episode 5. I can understand how a lot of people like this game, but it's almost a 180 to the first game.
5/10"
1757,oh my god the game is so good
1758,"Being an FPS player , I didn't think this type of game would be interesting but I guess i was wrong. Excellent story , realistic characters , tough decisions at certain points and many outcomes."
1759,"
i find this game touching tbh a dad passes away in the story of chapter one"
1760,"This game is not bad, but it fails to deliver in areas that DONTNOD has shown they can deliver on, making me give it a thumbs down.

Overall the game's main issue is that it is a story based game where choices certainly matter, but it feels like the player has no agency in these choices. Most of the time choices made by the player either fail to have an impact, or result in a payoff hours later into the game with little indication of the choices that got you there. It makes the cardinal sin of a Choices Mater episodic game which is to make the main gameplay element, choices, be unintuitive or naratively confusing. Subsequently, the defining difference from the first game, you are not the one with powers, the NPC is, feels restrictive and frustrating, rather than the narrative device its obviously intended to be.

The story is probably a 6/10 overall, as the main dynamic of the two brothers breaks down as a plot device the longer the story continues, where the player starts to resent the NPC brother rather than feel protective of him, which is supposed to be the leading element of the story, empathy. Episode 3 however I will name as a great exception and that episode by itself is about an 8/10.

Worth a buy at a discount on sale, but full price its disappointing. Other games, like the first Life Is Strange, show that DONTNOD can write compelling stories, but they slightly under-performed here."
1761,"i love this game, especially the characters <3"
1762,Should absolutely play.
1763,"I do like the game and story line and type of game play but
I strongly dislike the swearing, its completely unnecessary and damages the depth of the characters. Why all the swearing?
Sometimes the choices given doesn't quite make sense and seem quite random and I and struggle to try and determine what the intended purpose of the choice is. Despite having chosen every time not to steal, I am forced by the story line to steal the yo yo which was very off putting. Despite having chosen not to smoke in EP1,  I spontaniously become a smoker at the cabin later. 
I cant get my 49"" Samsung screen to go full screen, despite trying all the settings."
1764,"Coming from the first life is strange this game was hard to get through I had to restart my playthrough because i stopped playing for so long i forgot everything that happend. With the time rewind mechanic removed and replaced with a bratty child with superpowers the gameplay was pretty much non existant and turned into a talking simulator. This would have been fine until you realise that the only characters you spend more than an hour with is are the diaz brothers, with one of them feeling boring as hell and the other being a child that just feels like a drag that's literally only there as a mary sue plot device.

All of the other characters to me feel they don't get enough time to really stand out or are able to really attach to, I wouldve really loved to spend more time with pot gang or even the grandparents but because the narative is the brothers escaping the law to go to mexico the story always move on before you get a chance to care about anyone.

This game was a drag to push through compared to the amazing experince i had with the first game and after getting all the achievements and reading through the diary I don't see myself EVER playing this game again and I honestly do not recommend it if you are coming into this expecting a similer experince to the frist game. the only way i even manged to push through was picking all the ""Bad"" endings and having daniel murder everything he could. 

Oh and one other thing having David as a cameo really made this game feel worse because all it did was make me want to know more about what happened to max and gang instead of the new story that was being told in this game"
1765,"This game is kind of exhausting to play. Every episode, it just feels like you're constantly being beaten down by the world. Which, I get that that's kind of the point. But it's not very fun. It's been five months since I bought the game and I still haven't finished it."
1766,"Highly recommend! The game has a great heart-touching story and many interesting characters with whom you feel connected. The game feels different from the first one, but if you like LiS1 then you'll like this one as well."
1767,"A true portrayal of the way life is.

Update: What if this game is full of stereotyped jokes that make fun of SJWs? Then I suppose those who think this game is a ""progressive agenda"" shoved down their throats will make the comment above instead.

By labeling it ""political,"" you are making it political."
1768,Ending sucked
1769,"dontnod, stop making a grown man cry in the middle of the night
love this game so much. liked it even better than first part due to the ""road-movie like"" story.




[spoiler]  p.s.- i've completed in on the other account, but gotta give review everywhere, it deserves everything
p.s.s - i gave huge review for LiS:BTS, but this one gets a little one cause noone reads it anyways [/spoiler]"
1770,"great story, sad though"
1771,i like da game
1772,"this story is so sentimental to me and it really touched me, more than the original. i am so heartbroken and my life is ruined again."
1773,"I loved LiS 1 and LiS: BTS. I played the first episode and got all of the achievements for it. I'm not all that impressed. It just dragged on and on. I'm VERY hesitant to try to get through the rest of the season as I keep hearing that it stays like this and gets even worse in the end. I watched the first 15 minutes of Life is Strange: True Colors. True Colors already looks a thousand times better in its visuals, story, narrative, characters, flow, music, and just about everything else. I think I can just skip this one and enjoy LiS: True Colors when it drops."
1774,"Wow! Really like this one,the story is good,and gets better!"
1775,"to be honest this game just drags on at some points a little bit too much and the dialogue can feel unnatural and a little strange, I would recommend the first two games but this game is kind of a chore, I havent completed the game but have put in a fair effort."
1776,"7,8/10
pretty gud but all that political shit got me fucked up n also not as great as the first one
enjoyable doe, ending had me dropping 1 or 2 tears ngl"
1777,Life Is Strange is my guilty pleasure. I really liked this story an how it shows how much of a moron American patriots are.
1778,"since the first episode is free you get a sample of the game and it will make you want to buy the rest of them,,, this game is heart felt and very interesting to play because of the player based answers"
1779,Honestly having a great time with this game. Kinda liking it more than the first game which I thought was the best. But I prefer this game out of all the life is strange series. It has a unique story to it that everyone can relate to. it's been the best!
1780,"The visuals in this game are fantastic. It's fun to make Daniel an evil monster and it's also fun to make him follow moral rules. I can't say I prefer it over the first game, but this game is still good."
1781,-
1782,"LiS2 has all the gorgeous visuals and emotional atmosphere as in LiS1. The two main leads are also likeable maybe not as much as Max in LiS1, but still likeable. The main issue I have with LiS2 is that the player agency has been reduced greatly compared to LiS1. I only played Episode 1 and half of Episode 2 but it seems like I'm watching a graphic novel with very limited input from time to time. I like demos between chapters and scenes in adventure games but the number and length of such ""demo"" scenes (scenes where you have no input) are simply too much for my taste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mild spoilers for LiS1 and LiS2 below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I believe Max's powers of rewinding time was excellent from a ""game"" point-of-view and was unique. As a player you can try taking different options and rewind time to experience the immediate results of all of these different options, leading to higher player agency. You only had to think about the long-term results. Daniel's powers in LiS2 does not allow any unique mechanics, it is your run-of-the-mill superhero power. It is used mainly as a Mcguffin not linked with the gameplay mechanics. Therefore, the trial and error gameplay aspects of LiS1 is totally absent here. Moreover, you only indirectly affect Daniel since you play as Sean which further reduces the player agency. The game decides Daniel will use his powers in whenever the storyteller wants him to use it and as the player, we can only slightly affect the use of such powers indirectly."
1783,10/10 No doubt one of the best story lines ever put together in the series. A lot of thought has gone into grabbing your emotions while playing this and keeping you wanting to know what happens next while attaching you to the characters and not wanting the story to end. Just finished it and already want to start again lol
1784,"I just played the first season. Story is great. Visual are great, but could be better. There were places where no choice was given. The choice system doesn't really make that big of an impact. It's an illusion of choice. Overall, this was fun to watch. More like a movie."
1785,Great game
1786,"After finishing both LiS 1 and 2, LiS 2 is definitely better than LiS 1. In comparison it is excellently written with a rich world you can interact with. Searching for collectibles and places to draw also pushes you more into the exploration of your surroundings. Would recommend!"
1787,"""Would highly recommend this game,One of the best story mode games out there."""

Game description key-points: masterpiece of an interactive Story with focus on emotions and hard decisions

Overview:
Is a MUST PLAY for any gamer!

High Quality visuals on Unreal 4 engine, could be a proper Film, but has so many point of interest to click and find details and descriptions with sweet and flavor to the gameplay!
plenty of choices with decisions that influence on content to progress through the story.

when finishing game player can see 2 endings out of 7+"
1790,"It’s an incredibly good game. Great story and great characters, you can really put yourself into the characters and feel with them."
1791,"-no lesbian romance
-only 20 mins of lyla
-both endings kinda suck
-missing explanations between episodes
-karen is a t_h_o_t
-sean losing every fight (that's not even possible irl)
-not all americans are blood starved rednecks
-stop trying to give political messages in a video game, people play games for entertainment.
-you have to literally make a dedicated play to enter cassidy's tent
-a lot of dialog sound/glitches and meshes staying on air, NPC's T posing, install size is a joke. optimize your shlt

10/10 wasted potential, play before the storm or first one instead."
1792,"At the end of episode 4 I was so infuriated with the writing that before going to sleep I literally thought of a wall of text, but let me begin with the pros, because the game does have some

Pros:
- Graphics. The game is really beautiful, and locations (with exception of the fourth episode) are stunning to look at
- First two episodes. I really liked them, despite how the game followed up on Chris character
- Chris, itself, is a lovely character with a tragic background, which, sadly, is not explored to full extent
- Links to the first game and Arcadia Bay are amazing, meaningful and very powerful

Cons:
- First of all, the overall premise of the game and how the characters develop is extremely lazy. I know that many people did not like the ending of the first game, because it seemed like your choices were thrown away, but I tend to disagree. [spoiler]If you played the first game, you know that the tornado was present, in the first place, because Max saved Chloe and therefore proved Chaos Theory to be true. Therefore, there could be no other ways to end the game, because either Max decided to have the consequences of her actions occur, or not.[/spoiler] The ending was logical, and all the choices which you made, though they did not have the consequences in the end, were still important because your character grew. The final decision was to be taken as an adult, not as a teenager.

LiS2 throws it all out of the window, because the characters do not develop as they should. Developers said in multiple interviews that the main playable character in LiS2 does not have the superpower because the game was supposed to be played from the PoV of the brother, who was actually teaching his sibling to control the power he possesses. And while in theory it sound cool, it falls flat due to the fact that Daniel, as a character, makes the same mistakes and stupid decisions regardless of what you tell him. [spoiler]He will still go to Chris and reveal his powers, still will go to the Christmas market, still will proceed with the heist, and will still end up in the cult. [/spoiler] You can be the best brother in the world, but ultimately, it does not matter.

And yes, I am aware that the current game has different system for how the ending is calculated, and decisions throughout the whole playthrough actually affect the ending, but since you still have 5 illogical episodes to go through - the ending of LiS1 seems to be way better

- The second problem with the game, the big problem, is how it deals with social issues. If you played LiS1, you remember that developers managed to speak about many social problems in a meaningful and powerful way. Here, however, all the social problems are shoved down your throat no matter how you decide to deal with them, and in the end, you cannot resolve them. 

The main topic of the game is racism towards Latin America immigrants, and that, on paper, sounds like a good topic to explore. Developers, this time, though, decided to choose an easy way out, and filled the game with antagonists which make no sense, and are here just to create problems for the main characters.

You have:
[spoiler]1. A white cop who shoots the dad of the main characters for no reason
2. Family of white people, who after seeing a teenager begging for food say that ""You should get a job"" and ""At least here we hoped to get away from this"". HE IS A KID. What job can he get?
3. Owner of a gas station who lives nearby, in a house with the big fence and ""No trespassing"" signs all over it
4. The owner also beats you up no matter what, even if you did not steal anything and actually paid for what you got from the gas station (talk, also, about the importance of the choices you make, yeah, right)
5. After you run away, you can also read in the newspaper that the same owner later said that he actually tried to help, like a good American citizen
6. You have an average resident of a small town harassing travelling teenagers because they have a dog without a leash, with comments like ""This is a quiet little town, and you punks are always causing trouble""
7. You have a white racist humiliating you and harassing you for no reason, just because, seemingly, you fell asleep on his property, in the middle of a fucking desert

and so on
[/spoiler]

This does not work, because it is so black and white that an adult person simply cannot take it seriously. At first, though, I though that maybe developers will move on, or somehow the topic will be explored further, but in the end I was convinced that it was done simply to cash in on the hot topic.

And this conclusion was made based on how they represented gay people there. Just oh my fucking god, I am not a part of a minority, but I am infuriated with how little effort was made to masquerade this cash grab. First encounter happens when [spoiler]Finn suddenly tells you that he likes you and wants to kiss you.[/spoiler] Out of nowhere, with no history behind, no motivation, nothing - just like that. At this point, this character is so annoying and creates so many problems for the main characters that any sane person would, instead, like an option to punch him in the face. The second encounter with a gay person happens in a more meaningful, but still a cheap way, when the character [spoiler]decides to tell that he was sent for the conversion therapy in the MIDDLE OF THE CULT LEADER'S OFFICE, at the moment at which you have just a few minutes before bad guys find you and hurt you, a lot.[/spoiler] Could there be any other, maybe better, time to tell this?

The representation of the minorities here reminded me of early 2000s movies, in which black characters where introduced just for the sake of being killed after five minutes of screen time. Guys, it was 2018. You could do better, with just a little more effort.

- The other infuriating problem was how they approached The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit in the second episode. Even though this short free game, in and out of itself, is amazing, the choices made there have no meaning in the main game. The only result I had was Chris' dad saying ""Thank you for cleaning the snow off the porch"". Wow. Also, one of the collectibles in the main game depends on whether you are able to guess which Chris' toys are the good and bad guys, and unless you played The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit - there is just no way to know this.

- In general, the pacing itself was not very captivating and uneven. First two episodes are full of encounters, but they lead nowhere. Third episode takes place in a few small locations, and the fourth is, mostly, just a big cutscene.

- I also don't get what was the point of decisions like [spoiler]""ambush the guard"" in the hospital[/spoiler] if, ultimately, you still escape and nothing happens. However, the most stupid outcome was the ending of the third episode, in which [spoiler]Daniel got shot[/spoiler] and then this had NO IMPACT on ANYTHING. Just WOW.

In general, when I look at this game, I have no idea how it could be fucked up so badly. Detroit: Become Human was released several years prior, and despite its own flaws, it showed a great example of story branching. It's not impossible to do. But DONTNOD chose an easy way, poured all the trending problems of USA into one game to make it sell in North America and, in the end, as we can see, it did sell well

If you don't believe me, think about this. Their next game, Tell Me Why, which is focused on the transgender character, was not released in several countries, such as Ukraine or Russia, and is unavailable for purchase there, since, ""For example, Russia's ""gay propaganda law"" prevents the publication of any content or speech that presents homosexuality as a societal norm"". Well, Ukraine does not have such as laws, and the game is still not there. If you don't have balls to talk about social issues, tolerance and acceptance - then just don't fucking do it. Don't pretend like you care if you don't."
1793,"I really do love Life is strange, the concept of the game, soundtracks, story and characters. Two brothers on their adventure were also easy to love. For me this game just had it all, again."
1794,not bad if we ignore cringe conversations
1795,The first Episode was fine but not as good as the first game. Play it and decide for yourself if you like to buy the rest.
1796,Not as enjoyable as the first one. It started of strong. the first  2 episodes were fun after that it went downhill. To me it felt like a babysitting simulator. Because you are on the run there is no way to get a connection with any characters because you see them for one episode and boom they are gone. This made it really difficult for me to care about any of the characters. The little brother is super annoying.. Choices don't seem to matter. Towards the end finishing this game felt like a chore. The endings are weak.
1797,"I felt such a strong emotional attachment to these characters (sean and daniel) it's ridiculous. Such a sweet but heartbreaking game. It was a little annoying with daniel acting like a brat most of the time, but half the point of the game is he's still a kid that needs to be taken care of. It was still such a lovely game in the end. I had the WORST ending (out of all 7) but whatevs. I wish they had included at least 1 *truly* happy ending but at the same time, with what they had been a part of throughout the game, the endings made sense. I just wish they made in illogical ending that was them completely happy, going back to being who they are, and being with family. Still would 10/10 recommend playing, if your heart can take it."
1798,"so fricking cool 10 outta 5 

I like the 1st one more but that's probably because it's gay :) (sorta)

"
1799,"A continuation of a very well written story. Really good. If you loved the first one you'll love this one too. 
"
1800,"Not as good as the first game but still enjoyable, it feels like its less game and more movie in this game.

Buy on sale"
1801,"--[English is not my first language]--

Life is Strange 2 is a story-driven/episodic game, the story is about two brothers (Sean and Daniel) and their journey on the run after a tragic incident.

The gameplay is very good. The story can differ depending on choices you've made throughout the game, there are 7 different endings to experience. When you finish the game you can replay the game to check out each one of them (or just look up a video on Youtube :] ). The choices you make also effect character development. 

I personally had fun playing the game, but once I finished it, I didn't want to restart to see the other possible endings, even now, long after release I still can't find myself to replay it even though I really liked the story. The first game and Before the Storm are games that I do go back to. Overall, everyone's gameplay/experience is different.

Should you buy this game?
Yes, If you played the first game and Before the Storm you might as well give Life is Strange 2 a chance.

Haven't played the first game/Before the Storm yet? 
I recommend playing the first game and Before the Storm as well, just like Life is Strange 2 they are great story-driven games. Another recommendation is The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, it's free and connected with Life is Strange 2."
1802,RS
1803,A worthy successor
1804,This was much better than the original. And the original was an awesome game.
1805,esta perron el jueguito
1806,one of my favourite games out of the life is strange series so well donr and made me cry lol
1807,"ciekawa gierka, duzo wyborow no fajna no"
1808,"If you have played 'Life is Strange'... well... this is Life is Strange 2. So basically the same gameplay, graphics and of course heavy story. I felt like the end of this one was a let down story wise. Seems some elements of the story were just minimized and not wrapped up. Seems the story was more about preaching 'woke' values (of which this game is pretty saturated). The preaching can get annoying, more so than Life is Strange, but i just ignored it as best i could and moved on. I did feel if you dint make the 'right' woke moral decision you got punished. 
Overall I liked it, would play it again, would recommend it (dont pay to much attention to the preaching or negative stereotypes). I felt LiS1 was better than this one in some ways."
1809,"if you love the original ""Life Is Strange"" your gonna wanna play this too. It does mention Arcadia Bay at one point depending on which choice you chose. The game is just so good and theres nothing bad about it in my opinion. I've played all LIS games and this one is my favorite only cause I can relate to it more because I am Mexican lol. It's such a calming game for me and a comfort game especially with the music choices they put into it. So if you're wanting to play this game I recommend it and NO you don't need to play the LIS games ""in-order"" they all have different meaning and choices. :)"
1810,"this is my absolute favorite game, it feels absolutely home-y and shows the bond between family in such a comforting way.  i recommend this game to everyone!"
1811,sadge
1812,A lot better story than the first game. The game its very exiting and sometimes can be sad but i think that is totaly worth it.
1813,"I'd say that the first one was better, but this one is also great!"
1814,"This is currently my favorite game from the life is strange universe because i love how your choices shape your ending and your little brother. I've played the full game on my Xbox and loved it so i played the first episode on here to remember the game and i'm happy a did so, The game has brought back happy memories and waiting when the next episode would come out and what would happen to Sean and Daniel. If you read this comment i hope it made you wanna try the first episode because it is free and really good."
1815,babysit the brat simulator
1816,"The story line is actually sad, I do not regret wasting 35 hours of my life on this game"
1817,"Amazing game, really worth it. Really engaging as story wise, but not as good as lis original"
1818,Finnished this game it was fun I recomend it
1819,"Not as good as liS 1 & LiS BtS , but still worth buying if you get it on a sale .

I hope developers will left some Easter eggs about LiS 2 in the upcoming game LiS True Colors"
1820,The way one's choices affect the outcomes at the very last scene of the game are incredible.
1821,"The game looks fun so far. I just finished episode 1. It looks great, just like a: Life is Strange game. I like that it's a bit different in some aspects. I hope to meet more people in the next episodes. Would be nice to have some interactions with them. I can't wait for the remastered versions of the previous 2 games. I would like to replay them cuz they are tottally awesome. 
Life is strange is the best thing that came out of Square Enix for sure. :)"
1822,"Life Is Strange 2 is a very interesting game I must say. I actually like it and the new cast of this game are really cool too. The game has a really good story line and flow throughout the entirety. And yes just like the other Life Is Strange video games, this game is really really sad. The main duo Sean and Daniel (you play as Sean) have to go on a long journey to escape the trouble incident that happened right at their home. 

All I have to say about this game is it's really good and I love it. Do I love it more than Life Is Strange 1.... no. Life Is Strange 1 is always be my most favorite out of all of them so far. But I still highly recommend getting and playing this game tho. It would be way better if you buy this game when it goes on sale."
1823,.
1824,"I can only recommend this game with some BIG caveats; on a scale it would probably be a 6/10 for me personally. It's a touching story and it has some compelling characters but I would only suggest you get it if you don't mind the cons I'm going to list. Also, wait for a sale.

PROS:
- Gorgeous art style, the game has held up well because of it. The characters look great and so do the animations. Also, between the art and the lighting, certain scenes are just gorgeous.
- Great voice acting for the most part.
- The dialogue doesn't reach the (sometimes entertaining) levels of cringe from the first game (""shaka brah"").
- Your choices affect the story much more than in the first game, and your behavior towards Daniel throughout the story WILL influence the ending.
- If you're looking for an intense, emotional story... this is it. Despite the cons, I found myself tearing up a few times and the story gripped me enough to push me to finish the game even when it slowed down a bit too much.
- The game tackles some important (yes, ""political"") themes, which is great to see but also leads into the cons...

CONS:
- While I completely agree with the messages the game is conveying, I can't help but feel like the approach is a bit ham-fisted, especially when its audience doesn't really need any convincing that racism is bad. (MINOR SPOILERS) In almost every chapter, you encounter some variation of a raging, stereotypical MAGA racist that is meant to make you rage. It would've been nice to see more nuanced negative characters that don't just outright go around yelling that [i] dey terk er jerbs [/i]. It's all just too on the nose. Furthermore, I feel like some of these encounters are just there to enrage you (and boy did they piss me off) and have no bearing on the plot whatsoever. There should be some character development, or at least some acknowledgement or callback to the event after it actually happens.
- I had a pretty good relationship with Daniel overall, but I feel like that didn't affect the major story beats that much? Sometimes he acted out seemingly out of nowhere but I guess that was their way of moving the plot along. At one point, (minor spoiler) he was pissed at me for not spending enough time with him even though up to that point I'd prioritized him constantly. I don't get why there would even be a choice there when it doesn't really change what happens. It's a weird mix in which your choices matter but the game also forces you into making really stupid ones.
- Some of the scenes just drag on. I felt like I just sat there FOREVER while the characters walked up, walked away, stood up, sat down, sighed, scratched themselves, and all kinds of random animations in between actual dialogue. A lot of small scenes and lines felt very unnecessary. I do appreciate the occasional cute, serene moment that the series is known for, but I found myself losing my patience quite a bit. In one scene (minor spoiler) you're literally walking on the side of the road and stopping for a bit to draw. That takes about... 9 minutes?!?

Anyway, if what I just ranted about doesn't really matter to you, then the game is definitely worth checking out. The cons I mentioned can be quite subjective and I know a lot of people love this game to bits so that's why I wouldn't say I straight up don't recommend it.

"
1825,"Good game, though choices."
1826,Good game with great story. Highly recommend 9/10
1827,Amazing :)
1828,"Disappointing. The in-your-face political propaganda is unbearable. If you're trying to make your game political above all else, at least make sure that the agendas you support don't come off as forced. LiS 1 somehow managed to discuss sociopolitical issues without turning the entire game into a massive propaganda piece that panders to a specific group of people while alienating the rest of the audience."
1829,great game :)
1830,"This series is SO GOOD. The soundtrack honestly ties everything together. The Life Is Strange and The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit series are my favorite games of all time. I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you're emotional, it's made me cry several times an episode. The story is really interesting and unique. I love how the story has little moments where the brothers are at peace and having a great time. I also love how real the game is, and how true it is to real issues in America. It's an inspiring and addictive game. I'm looking forward to seeing more from the brothers and Chris. <33
"
1831,This is just awesome!
1832,"Story sucked, Daniel sucked, everybody sucked. 
What an ""awesome"" feature ""wait"" , or ""look"" at shit just to progress. Dont buy."
1833,realy good the story gonna make you cry some parts are a little boring but other than that it's good 8/10
1834,A boring clustersuck with tired political messages. The dynamic between the main characters is very uninteresting and thus you can't get immersed into the story. Even the level settings are boring. Couldn't get myself to get past one third of this game. Quite a disappointment after the first one.
1835,Enjoyed this game while I was playing it.
1836,"this game took me almost a year to finish because it was so stressful, but i am so glad i finally got around to finishing it. i got way more attached to daniel and sean than i did chloe and max, and i love that they touched on some really uncomfortable topics in this game, especially racism. i was almost in tears at a lot of points. the story here is so emotional since you are not only responsible for a teen/young adult, but a young child as well. i love that there were so many endings options instead of only two like in the first life is strange. as a bi person myself, i also am so happy they chose to have the main character in this able to romance a guy or a girl (i went for finn <3). it was also super cool to see the short david cameo! i really liked how they also incorporated your ending from the first life is strange. i wish i could properly put into words how amazing this game is. if you liked the first life is strange, you will definitely love life is strange 2."
1837,best
1838,"I played ‚Life is Strange 2‘ a year ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I’ve never had such an intense experience with a game. Ever!

I’m an over 50 years old guy and I couldn’t stop crying when I finished the last episode. The emotions hurled me out of my regular life for a complete week and even now, after so many months, I still can’t listen to the soundtrack or some of the trailers without heavy sobbing.

I like emotional and story driven games and I’ve played many, but non of them had such an impact on me, not even LiS1.

I tried to play the game as realistically as possible, which means I never went back once I made a decision. I regretted some of them, but that made it even better, because that’s how it is in real life and it makes it easier to identify with the main character Sean.
There were a few moments where I missed alternative ways to deal with a situation, where I thought that a character acted illogical or where I felt that something was forced on me, but those were just a handful of negligible moments and forgivable.

The game really shines when it comes to pacing, which had always been DONTNOD’s strong suit. I was constantly strung up and afraid of making mistakes that’ll hurt Daniel and/or Sean (remember: no reload for me). But quite often, LiS2 lets the player breath, enjoy the moments of calm and silence. I treasure those moments and I’m glad the devs know where to put them in order to enrich the story.

---

When the weather is right and I’m in the mood, I snatch my sketchbook, listen to the soundtrack from LiS2 (cry a little) and go for a walk. Sometimes I find something interesting enough to draw or scribble, sometimes not. It doesn’t matter, because every time I remember how I traveled together with Sean and Daniel. It was a year ago and it was “just a game”, but it was also a one-of-a-kind experience and the memories still accompany me.

No other game has ever managed this."
1839,"love the LIS series, cried at the end. :0"
1840,"what kind of fucked up story is this, by the end i was so angry i couldn't finish it. you went too far with this one. the choices are stupid, i wouldnt have gotten in that much crap if i actually had a choice. i make a choice and it turns out 50,000 times worse than i thought the sentence meant. i go through wall, bro jumps ot car????? screw you. i want to hurt someone or punch the wall a few thousand times, play the other life is strange games. dont even bother with this one. not worth the STRESS. WASTE OF TIME."
1841,Worth playing.... Situations like these happen FAR MORE than any news will tell you. I'm no stranger to how fast a shitstorm can hit. Great V.As and I thought Seth Rogen did Brody's voice but I guess I was wrong. Sounded ALOT like him though.
1842,epic
1843,"Its a good game i really liked it 
I liked the story-The gameplay
And how yo can change everything with just a choice
I really recommended to play when you alone or in your house"
1844,"imo, I enjoyed LiS 2 more than the first game (which was still great though). The characters and the story were incredibly dynamic and I loved that there were 4 different endings. The decisions really felt to make a difference in the game play. 
tl;dr, it doesn't matter how you play this game, it'll wreck you regardless.

Daniel was sometimes a little shit though."
1845,fajne
1846,"Good game,good story!
I played just the episode 1 and it was just right!"
1847,Recommended.
1848,"It's a lot heavier from the getgo than the original game, but I think even without the main character having powers, the mechanics remain interesting and the story is still compelling"
1849,[H1]Fᴏʀ 10 ʏᴇᴀʀ ᴏʟᴅ ɢɪʀʟs.
1850,"AMAZING!  The reviews when the game was initially released held me back...I waited for a big sale and got it.  Never played it for a year or so but when I did...WOW.  Just as great as the first game.  Many heart felt moments and the ending...get your tissues out  :)  Watching the trailer as I type this and it makes me feel emotional.  

Games that evoke an emotional response like this series will give you life long memories you can look back upon in 20 years with great nostalgia.  Very excited for the next game in the series but I'll wait for it to be released for a year before picking it up, lol."
1851,I love this game so much.
1852,"wolf brothers
depression"
1853,one of the best games ive ever played!!
1854,Great game. Loved the music and the scenery. The story started a bit slow but in the end it was very much worth it. I couldn't stop playing once I reached episode 4.
1855,"A fundation of good stories are relativly consistant characters, in this case specifically: Sean's rational
It feels like the plot was built not from the ground up, but the top first, which might be the cause of the problem.
Sean is written to be decently smart, but man this kid is a reckless dumbass when it comes to major decision (like running away).

Making this some dumb runaway plot for MORE than the first episode was a bad decision, even worse is that the reason that Sean decides to leave is completly irrational and reckless, and goes against what he wants for his brother. After Ep.1 you will wish more and more after every hour you continue to play, that this dumb Wolfkid wakes up and finally thinks everything through or gets cought by the cops and brought back to his home town. Because the relationships that were introduced there were so much fucking better than the dumbshit they wrote up afterwards.

I had to force myself through it. I found myself playing only due to hope.
Hope that the story would magically change to what I envisioned could/should have been... This hope didn't die until the last cutscene and a picture of 2025-Daniel was shown, were then it was clear to me that this story is bad and that I wouldn't get what I hoping... I cried because of the life that Sean missed in his hometown, which he would have never missed if he were written as a relatively consitant human, the Sean that is shown 95% of the time, would have turned around at the beginning of Ep.2 latest Ep.4.

If you make the dumbass a dumbass for a major life chaning decision, then let him be a dumbass for the rest of the game.

God, I really wanted this to be a well written story. I can't believe you've done this."
1856,"They should call this Life is Depressing because ALL OF THE ENDINGS WERE DEPRESSING. I feel so unsatisfied by every ending and sad for Shaun and Daniel. Anyway, the Life Is Strange series is a good franchise and it has a way of giving you the feels."
1857,I did not like this as much as LIS 1 and LIS BFR but hey its still a great game with an excellent story
1858,I feel as if people underestimate this game and still do to the first game. Personally I find both LIS 1 and 2 to be equally superior to each other because their stories are very similar in very different ways. All I can say about Life Is Strange 2 is that it has an amazing story. It made me think about if me and my little brother were in the same situation as Sean and Daniel and what I would do to protect my little brother in this situation. VERY RECOMMENDED.
1859,I played this before and after starting again this game is definitely better than the original for me. I highly recommend it and I hope Sean and Daniel get more love with more content for them in the future like a sequel. Loved the Diaz brothers dynamic and the roadtrip journey.
1860,"Boring and slooooowwww. If I wanted to watch a movie I would still have turned this one off because it draaaaagggss 

They lost the magic of 1."
1861,great game
1862,"Like the previous games, Life is Strange 2 is a story-driven game where you experience the journey of two brothers throughout the roads of USA. The game has a really touching and emotional story (cant't say much because it would spoil the game). But I believe it is a game worth buying, if you played any of the games of the Life is Strange series and liked it you're probably gonna love this one like I did.

I would also recommend playing The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit which is a free game connected to Life is Strange 2.

8.0/10"
1863, Amazing game
1864,"good story
"
1865,great story. not as good as life is strange 1
1866,i wanna hug sean
1867,"I didn't really have an idea of what I'd be getting into with this game, but I really enjoyed watching jennxpenn play the first life is strange. I recently got a really good gaming setup and was buying my first games, when I decided to add life is strange 2 to the cart. Very glad I did. I went the more ""criminal"" route I guess you could say, and I was beyond satisfied with the ending. I grew really fond of Sean and Daniel, and even their mother toward the end. Can't wait for the third to release next month! Will definitely be playing :)"
1868,"its awsom. really good, amizing

"
1869,"life is strange games have a capability of hitting you right in the feels, in a way that nothing else can. the first game meant more to me than i can ever say and after hearing mixed things about this one i havent played it until now (for fear that it would ruin the franchise for me, i think), but i can happily say i'm just love with this game as i was with the first one. don't play it if you don't wanna cry, but it's so worth it. everyone has something to learn from this game, i think"
1870,"Played the game until the end.
This game met all the expectations and more of what I expected it to.

Graphics: 9.5/10
Story: 9/10
Gameplay: 8/10

I don't want to be extremely biased, but I did really enjoy the game. So, I will say the story was heartbreaking. It made you feel bad for the characters a lot, especially for Sean. You get to actually feel like the story is real. The attention to small details, immaculate. Pay attention to the opening scene, because every time I see it, I notice something new. 

The ending, however, was a little bit sad in my opinion. Heartbreaking ending. I literally cried. I woke up missing Sean & Daniel.

I also critique the story for being a bit too unrealistic. The idea that so many people Sean & Daniel run into just trust them after news breaks out across the entire Westside of the USA, seems unreal. How can everybody trust them? Why is it so few civilians don't recognize the brothers, and even fewer even recognize the kids, even after they give their actual name out. The only people to attempt to call the police benefit from it. I strongly don't find this idea to be realistic.

HOWEVER, realism aside, I found the entirety of the story to be very fascinating, intriguing, and great. I love how the story connects Life Is Strange & Adventures of Captain Spirit. I highly suggest if you feel the least bit interested in crying, laughing, smiling, all within one gameplay, download this game. You won't regret it."
1871,"its very diffrent from the 1st game but it doesnt mean it is bad on the contrary its great, worth playing, great characters and story as always"
1872,"Bond, that all brothers and sisters should have. Emotional journey, that takes you through many concepts of life. Incredible game."
1873,"Life is Strange 2 wasn't as good as the first one in my opinion, but it was still an interesting experience and me and my girlfriend mostly enjoyed the ride.

We did however, feel like the length of each episode was much too long. We remember finishing each episode in the first game in around 1 and a half to 2 hours, but the first 2 episodes in this one took us almost 5 hours each, and the rest about 3.5 hours.

It just felt way too long to play each episode in a single sitting, which we prefer to do in these episodic-type games, as they're usually not very long due to being several episodes. We don't think these types of games should be over 3 hours long per episode, since they're a lot like watching a TV show or movie, and flow much better in finishing within a single sitting, since stopping in the middle just never seems quite right in these games.

The story was definitely a little too on the nose and preachy at times, especially since no matter what you do, the game clearly has a fixed narrative revolving around being two young boys of a minority descant being treated poorly by racists and bigots. But it felt like you could never truly tell the younger brother off for doing some of the stupid, dangerous and selfish things he always does, no matter how much you choose the options to try and teach him better.

It almost felt like they didn't want to make them look bad no matter how many bad stuff they did, to keep pressing the blatant political narrative. Which I don't have an issue with, I just wasn't happy with the lack of being able to truly tell your younger brother off, instead of constantly being forced to be so apologetic to, despite him clearly being in the wrong most of the time.

It was a hell of a ride though, and me and my girlfriend enjoyed it. We just hope they improve in future games, because they definitely took a few steps backwards from the original in this one, in regards to the storytelling and choices."
1874,"Only played the first episode so far and I can immediately say that it is at lea
st twice as good as the 1st."
1875,great story really worth it
1876,"It was a really bold move to make one of your main characters a child, and unfortunately it didn't pay off.
"
1877,Its a movie with quicktime events. Its crap. I really enjoyed the first one. This one is just so bad. Really unfortunate.
1878,"Not as good as the original.

Beware: Unfortunately play time is not counted individually for each of the episodes, which means that total playtime gets too high for a refund already after the second episode."
1879,Best story game I ever played in my life. I will definetly play it 3 times.
1880,An interesting story with cool character interactions.
1881,"honestly this game is time consuming, in a good way"
1882,"It's so sad and yet - beautiful. The views are amazing, the story heartbreaking."
1883,i love this game so much
1884,Amazing game
1885,lotta cut scenes otherwise good and fun game
1886,I enjoyed
1887,10/10 would protect brother from the Dark Side again
1888,"This is my all time favorite game and has been for a while at this point, there's such pretty animation and characters are never short of excitement upon analyzing them. The endings are entirely amazing as well every one of them can be deciphered differently for why they are good or bad or how they affected some of the characters (mostly Daniel and Sean but theres a few others sometimes) overall its just so refreshing to play and I'd seriously recommend it to anyone who likes a good cry and values the idea of decision making and impacts."
1889,"Once again...an amazing game that follows after the first life is strange. By far a great game series to get into, this one followed after the first contained some really cool easter eggs from the first which....is always really cool!

I like the idea that the game has like 6 or 7 alternate endings for the final episode, I was lucky to get the best one I would like to think...maybe it was the second or third best tho, but all in all it was DEEP. A lot of points were made clear in the game about how other races specifically of the Hispanic, Latino, Mexican, and Portirican culture and ethnicity are treated in America regardless of being a citizen or immigrated to the U.S. which was really sad and upsetting to experience, but it's real-world stuff that still happens and goes on.

I will say the character development that happens is different for everyone based on what choices you made and what you talked about. Like genuinely everyone’s gameplay is completely different which is really cool.
I will say, this one was a lot longer to play through than the first game, as there was A LOT more character movement and exploring to do. But I don’t see that as a negative. Both games are similar in their own ways but they are also very much different which is nice. Expect to pack more hours in the second game than the first one!
The first game is definitely incorporated into this one, so I highly recommend playing through it for the full experience, and even the FREE episode in between Life Is Strange 1 & 2 called ‘The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit’.

I had preordered the newer game to be released sometime later this year, and I am excited to get to play that when it does eventually come out.
Really though, this game series is very good to get into and play. Kinda like Skyrim, you literally don’t understand what an amazing game you are missing out on until you play it!"
1890,"The beauty of this game is incredible, i first started with The Walking Dead a few years ago, and i thought nothing could beat the Games, how wrong i was. when i first heard of the LiS games i thought ""meh doesn't sound like it could nearly beat any TWD game"" but now that i played it, this game made me cry, laugh and both at the same time, the whole time you feel so helpless and it feels like you are on a journey, and you have a meaning in life, and it felt like i played the game for months but i didn't even reach the 5 hour mark yet, the theme being on the run feels so great and emotonial. the whole time it feels like you follow Sean and Daniel in real time, i never played a game this beautiful, the gameplay is not the greatest but lets be honest  who would play a game like that for the gameplay? definitly one of the best ""Multiple-Choice"" Games out there, this game got too much hate in my opinion."
1891,"Life is Strange 2 is a lot more serious than the first iteration in the series and deals with quite a few heavy topics such as racism, alcoholism and homophobia. I think that the story (the main part of the game) is really good, and the choices seem to impact the overall experience and especially the ending a lot more. If you enjoyed Life is Strange, i'm sure this game will be just as enjoyable, if not, better."
1892,Just watched a 16.7 hour movie - not happy with the ending :(
1893,Life is Strange franchise gives you an another life experience. this franchise has the best Choice matter games.
1894,There is not happy ending for Sean
1895,100%
1896,"Awesome game, interesting story, well, of course, I don't want to spend money on 2 series, but I recommend to everyone, you won't regret it, :D"
1897,"I liked the story over all, but can Sean cries even more???"
1898,"this game showed me how sean facing his life and its not easy, life wont be easy btw </3

well... i dunno but, the all the ending made me sad...

kinda not fair for sean and daniel..

i wanna a happy ending for them >:(

they deserved it >:("
1899,"Half of the game is just ""Waaah waah big bad white/straight people"""
1900,"Was it as good as Life is Strange? No.
But if you look at the game on its own? It's fucking amazing.

Politically, emotionally, visually, and from a technical standpoint, this game nails every aspect. It really shows life from the perspective of outcasts in America, a land that is supposed to be the land of dreams, when really it is not the case for so many people.

It really teaches us that life is not fair, which reminds me so much of the first game even if both stories are completely unrelated to each other. Square Enix has done a brilliant job in portraying the lives of immigrants in America, and while I did not cry at the ending (like I did in the first game), it still hurts to be able to freely make any decision in this game.

8/10"
1901,great season two!!!
1902,"yes
"
1903,i loveeeed this game so much! highly recommend ;)
1904,"UHmmm yes, this is a good game bought it with 60% off woooo"
1905,"Heartfelt game with a heavy emphasis on the theme of forgiveness. The story and characters were easy for me to become invested in. 

Overall I enjoyed it, though some seemingly innocuous choices can build up to have overly-harsh consequences, and the last couple episodes have some bugs with characters talking over each other and interrupting themselves."
1906,"Pour l'instant, je n'ai vu que le premier épisode. Comme Life is Strange, il y a une ambiance très prenante, une très bonne qualité d'écriture, les personnages sont très touchants, très attachants et minutieusement animés à tel point que je dois me forcer pour me rappeler s'il s'agissait d'un film ou d'une animation ; les visuels sont très beaux. C'est pourtant un environnement complètement différent, mais tout aussi intéressant."
1907,"The writing is a little cringe yes. But it's a great story honestly, I love the brothers and I really feel like Daniel's older brother and trying to do the best for him on this epic journey. 

Bought all the episodes and really care about the characters I meet.

A little glitchy here and there, mouth movements don't match up but honestly I don't really care about that, it's the story I'm here for.

Never played the first one but I was really drawn into this one. <3

If you play the first episode and wanna keep playing do so, the story is really good honestly."
1908,"Even thou both games have the same style and gameplay loop, It doesnt feel like Life is Strange 1, due to it having such a different kind of story. Its not necessarily a bad thing, since the story is interesting and kind of unpredictable (how exactly their journey is told and what happens). 
However, the game is designed in a way that you dont always feel like you are in charge or have an influence on the story. This is true to some extent because some things happen even if you decide against them,  but trust me, in the end it feels like your decisions overall mattered. 

To me it doesnt come close to part one, nevertheless if you are able to deal with a young (annoying) side character there is quite a lot to find and feel in this game."
1909,Very boring. No cool gimmick like the first where you could reverse time.
1910,good game
1911,That is perfect story about mystic and family love. I would recommend this one for everyone)
1912,"One of the best game I've ever played! For someone that has played the entire LIS series, I personally think that LIS2 is so much better than LIS1 and LIS before the storm. The brotherly love between Sean and Daniel can really be felt throughout the entire game. Not to mention the amazing story line and soundtrack. You can really see how much the wolf brothers mature as you play the game. At the start, Sean was just a typical teenager that doesn't like Daniel going around touching his things and Daniel who was just a kid that wants to play with his brother. After the incident, Sean, as the big brother did everything he could to protect his little brother. ""𝘪 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘦𝘯𝘢𝘯𝘰""(ᵕ̣̣̣̣̣̣﹏ᵕ̣̣̣̣̣̣).  There are quite a few instances that made me teared up especially at the ending. Out of the 7 endings, I got the 𝙧𝙚𝙙𝙚𝙢𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 ending. Personally, I think its the best ending even though Sean went to jail because at the end, Sean got released and reunited with Sean, Lyla and Karen. Sean and Daniel even went camping in the woods and spent the night at the place they spent their first night after escaping back in episode 1.

9/10! Highly recommended!!


"
1913,✰✰✰✰✰
1914,This is a masterwork of great story telling. Highly recommend. Packed with emotion.
1915,"Cool graphics, intense story line, whats not to like?"
1916,Amazing!
1917,i really love life is strange
1918,"Im on episode 3 and im struggling... This game is soooooooooooooooooo boring... Im trying man, im trying but compared to the first game this is such a POS. VA is crap, story is crap and the pacing is beyond shit. Avoid this if you can."
1919,Amazing game
1920,Masterpiece
1921,"what a beautiful game, this game made me cry more than once following these brothers' journey watching all of the different endings and heartbreaking scenes and choices. especially after sean getting released from prison, that one made me cry the most. would definietly reccomend for a story game, was, in my opinion better than the first. i loved seeing ""step-douche"" ."
1922,"Amazing story, beautiful art style, and incredible characters."
1923,what a journey
1924,"Sometimes boring, but it strikingly manages to make us experience the weight of our actions in the very end; and then we can but say: [i]""Oh shit, what have I done?""[/i] Pretty intense."
1925,"Loved this game so much!!!!
It's Perfect."
1926,"Good game but, honestly, wait for a sale.. or don't bother at all if you want a game with the same magic as the first one.

 While I personally agreed with pretty much every agenda this game pushes onto you, it's not right to push anything on anyone - especially in a video game. It is a pretty dated game and I think that is what defines what is truly good or not. If something can withstand time itself, then it is deserving of praise.

Unfortunately, even though both the first and second games were cringe, this one was on a whole 'nother level. I thought the ending was bittersweet.. it took me some thought but ultimately I had to give this game a bad review. A lot of the heart of the story was very lacking, hit too close to home, and pushed several agendas and ideas - again, not bad ideas, but pushing of any kind in my opinion is pretty shameful and petty. Drama is f%$king lame, so I'm going to leave the review here with these final words.

TL;DR - Maybe watch a playthrough of it if you want to see how things go. Either choice you make isn't really gonna make a huge difference in the end result (afaik this game only has two endings and the one I got was pretty generic/easy to see coming - basically how the entire pace for the game goes.)"

LOOK FEMINAZI, IT'S A JUICY BUTT. 
THE BUTT THAT YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
5..4...3...2...1... RAGE NOW!"
1928,"A pretty great story on par with the first game. Interesting choices and consequences, and pretty neat to see Daniel react to your decisions differently throughout the game. Ending had me tearing up a little. Only negatives I can think of were some characters acting irrationally to an unbelievable level (which happened a lot in the first game as well), and some political messages being handled with no subtlety or nuance."
1929,Amazing interactive game.
1930,"The game is so amazing like seriously, the music, the storyline, the details, the characters, i literally just started episode 1 and i am immediately so in love with everything its really and truly amazing <33333"
1931,"I play until episode 2 and I can tell...
If you really like Life is Strange 1, then this is not for you.

Life is Strange 2 is not your super power, teen's emotional game that you had experienced and related to.
It is basically a bad written political agenda story combine with babysitter emulator.

Additionally, if you really like a pet having around as your partner in crime and attached emotion to them, then this is not for you. 
Pet in this game is a emotion manipulator sacrifice-able animal that progress the story with zero-character development.

Tbh, Chris has better character than Daniel based on the Captain Spirit .
Daniel is just a spoiled child that the adult need to spank his butt even after all the events happen.
""Why my super power always leads to trouble"" - Daniel
No shit. Daniel, you are the troublemaker. 
Who the fxxk  wrote this character. 

I hope Life is Strange 3 not end up like this kind of bs storytelling."
1932,Arguably the worst game i ever played.
1933,"not as good as the first life is strange, but definitely still worth playing, I recommend it!"
1934,An amazing game with genuinely lovable main characters <333
1935,"Well, feels like it become bit boring in the mid game. But overall still a game worth trying."
1936,"it makes me cry again , but ... the decisions ways was too bad guys :) maybe i didn't want to run at first , or surrender before go to the big wall .    I JUST WANNA SAY I DIDN'T MADE MY OWN STORY . The decisions wasn't making the story and it wasn't that important for the way that story going throw . I LOVE THE GAME , NO DOUBT <3"
1937,"The overall story line is fantastic. I have not finished the game just yet, but so far I am very happy."
1938,really really good
1939,love it
1940,"very good game, I cried at many instances."
1941,"First off, don't go in expecting Max and Chloe Part 2.  Of course this game focuses on different characters--though there are echoes of the original LiS--but the overall mood, themes, and feel of the gameplay (rewinding time was a surprisingly impactful gimmick) are dramatically different.  Not a whole lot of chill hangout vibes here; the whole experience is much more tense and dark.

That said, it's still a LiS game, so if you're all about rich characterization and complex relationship dynamics, you'll dig this.  Instead of reconnecting with a former BFF, here you're taking care of a younger brother (with powers).  It is, essentially, a parenting simulator, and as such you'll constantly feel like you're screwing up and second-guessing yourself.  Yes, there are times when Daniel will piss you off, but that's kind of the point.  If you hate it, though, I encourage you to pop this one in the ol' game cellar and revisit it in 15 years."
1942,amazing
1943,i like this very much and am going to play it multiple times

1947,Damn this game's good
1948,sean and finn are hot also daniel have big boom power :0
1949,life is depression.
1950,"It's good that they gave the first episode of Life if strange 1 and 2 for free as I was able to tell if I wanted to continue or not

The story is pretty interesting :)
I thought that Life is strange 2 was a continuation of Life is strange 1 but it wasn't which isn't anything bad."
1951,"such a fun game to play. 
need more sean and daniel content :("
1952,"idk, i find it really hard to get any emotional relationship with characters and cant force myself to get more engaged into the story as it sometimes feels nearly irritating, i feel like my choices dont have any real impact on the game after all and like others pointed out having some child constantly following u and forcing u to babysit them is just annoying and unfun especially when they wont even learn anything as ur choices dont have any real impact so whats the point? in general story feels like fakely expanded. Life is strange 1 was alot better than Lis 2, i wouldnt recommend buying this game unless its on sale"
1953,it has a great story
1954,One of my favourite games and will be forever.
1955,good game
1956,Amazing.
1957,This is a very good game
1958,This game is a fucking masterpiece. Maybe even better than the first game and it's prequel.
1959,"WARNING: REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!!

**Note on Spoilers: I have to talk about spoilers because the reasons why this game has issues to me, are impossible to explain accurately without spoilers. 

Life is Strange 2 had a LOT to live up to for me. The first game and it's spin off-sequel/prequel were emotional powerhouses with very relatable stories. Yes, Before the Storm wasn't as good as LiS1 but I felt like that was more to do with it's main gameplay dynamic being gone (Max' time powers), however, the characters more than made up for it. Great characters, great and relatable personalities - LiS2 however, trades that all for a more racially spearheaded base plotline, which is fine. I have found some moments of the game somewhat relatable. 

Why am I not recommending the game? Well, personally - I just didn't really like the story all that much. I gave it a 7/ 10 for personal enjoyment because I did think the set pieces were great and well designed, the art style and animation looks great at 1440p / 120fps and personally, I adored Sean and Daniel as the main characters, even though they felt like a dramatic step back from Max and Chloe. 

Here's where we get into SPOILERS though - Since the actual Boys on the Run plot started, I felt like a LOT of the story was unnecessary and the game as a whole, went a bit too out of it's way to be cruel in a way that looked cartoonish. Let me explain - On the very first episode, I understood why the cop panicked, I felt like an actual cop (even as much as I dislike them) would have actually checked the kid's clothes and would have noticed that the blood was fake, the escalation of the situation was very unrealistic - likewise, I never felt like the situation got THAT bad to the point that the cop actually had to shoot the kids' Dad. Maybe it was the voice acting? But the camera cutting wildly didn't accurately represent the situation escalating out of control, I understood why the kids panicked and ran, and that was even touched up on in later episodes, which I was okay with.

It doesn't really explain why the rest of it felt so iffy. It's like, something HAD to happen in every episode that felt like a cartoon show. In Ep 2, we have an extremely racist Gas Station owner that somehow recognizes the kids pretty effortlessly. In Ep 3, there was REALLY no way to stop the heist from happening? You'd think even the silliest character would think that was an overwhelmingly poor idea, even if they HAD pulled the Heist off, what was going to stop the dude from just shooting up the camp or figure out who pulled it off? In episode 4, we have a hilarious religious cult that felt pretty hilariously out of place, yes these places DO exist, but how did Daniel just stay there for 2 months and not think something was messed up? Likewise, for being someone unfindable, I found it funny how a random character managed to send a letter to their Mom and it was never really addressed how he even found her - even EARLIER too, what are the chances that you pull over in the middle of the night to take a nap before driving on and you just happened to stumble on the property of some raging racists? Likewise in Ep 5, that ENTIRE section at the station felt so forced, almost as if hey, this episode is ending too fast and it's been mostly wholesome, how do we spice it up? Introduce even more raging racist hillbillies. 

Thing is, the game play itself has no real dynamic that puts it on the same level as the first LiS game. First of all, you play as Sean and it's Daniel who has the powers. Secondly, Telekinesis isn't a power that introduces as strong a dynamic as what Max had, given how, you're encouraged to NOT use his powers for 70% of the game, then towards the last 2 episodes, it's become commonplace for the kid to use them anyway, even on very basic day to day chores like picking up groceries and opening doors. This ended up playing more like a Telltale game without a really big hook outside the main characters. The constant heavy time skipping between episodes also didn't really help it's case. 

I felt compelled to write my review on this game because of how much I loved Max, Chloe and the rest of the cast in the first LiS game and it's sequel/prequel. I'm sorry Dontnod, I really do think everything AROUND the story, the technical aspects, the art, and more importantly - tackling the very important topic that is racism, was incredible, and got the 7/ 10 from me just out of that alone - however, the story itself didn't really hook me and I spent a lot of my time questioning why things were happening and how uncomfortable the game made me feel just because of how cruel the game was towards Sean more so than Daniel and this is reflected even in the ""Good"" Endings."
1960,Boring
1961,"Only played episode one so far,  but it's no disappointment at all.
Not a game for people who loved fast-paced action though"
1962,good game i love this game i like this game i hug this game i sleep with this game Love Life is Strange
1963,"Hands down one of my favourite games ever.

LIS2 has such a good plot unlike the first game and the prequel personally.

Characters in LIS2 are probably some of my faves for example - Finn and Cassidy.

This game has a lot of replayablity considering theres 7 endings unlike LIS that only had 2 (Save Chloe / Sacrifice Arcadia Bay) and if you have played LIS - Your choices are also Affected in a away with some easter eggs when you go with brody.

The soundtrack is honestly really good too - featuring artists like The Streets, Gorillaz & Justice. 
This game actually introduced me to The Streets and now i love them.

I would highly reccomend playing the first game then The Awesome Adventures Of Captain Spirit first as Captain Spirit is the ""Demo"" of LIS2 even though you are playing a character you meet in chapter 3 - Yet it also shows you what their background is like. 


If you ever get a chance to play LIS2 i would highly reccomend it! :)

"
1964,"Well... it's bad, like weak story, weak characters, weak gameplay bad. 
First of all, I did play only 1 third of the game but believe me when I say that every time, I see my play time on this game I wonder if steam crashed and forgot to count 50 more hours. 
First story and characters, I won't spoil anything but let's just say that you will need to strap your suspension of disbelief to a f-ing falcon 9 rocket for them to make sense.  I know they’re young but when I was as young as them, I would also call most of their choices stupid, unconscious, and well... very stupid, and I I'm not that far from their age anyway. Which is even more infuriating with the game severe lack of nuance and subtility the game will always force you to choose between 2 extreme of the same solution something like ""explode in rage"" and ""be extremely ungrateful and disrespectful"" which will for all intent and purposes will have the same result. And when you couple that with the fact that the game make act the characters stupidly and think you're too drunk to notice it becomes just borderline insulting.   
The gameplay is weak, but in another game like this I wouldn't even mention it because it should be carried by its writing...
I don't know what happened to the smartly written characters and charm of arcadia bay, If you wanted to get this one, just continue walking..."
1965,"This game like others LIS games is focused on the story and choices, in this one the story is about two brothers and the power of brotherhood. All choices have consequences like in the other games. Along the way you will meet Captain Spirit (there is also a free game of the Captain Spirit that is more like a free DLC than a game).
The graphics are not high end, but in this type of games the graphics are secundary. It takes around 15 to 16 hours to beat the game. If you liked the other LIS games buy this one too. 7,5/8."
1966,"The story started off a bit slow, and really cut me off on episode 2, and the pace is a bit inconsistent for me. Overall episode 4 is my favorite and that is when the game made me care abt the character. 7/10"
1967,"Amazing game! Loved it, even more than the first one (even though I seem to be alone with that view).
The story was very emotional with many choices that had a big impact on how the story unfolds. I was very impressed."

[b]Now, I suck at writing these so I'll do my best.
I voluntarily waited these three years until I finally decided to play this title mainly because I wasn't interested. Until I told myself ""you've already played the first one and 'Before the Storm', get this one as well, play it and get it over with"". And I have to say I would've regretted it if in another universe I decided to never play this game at all. 

The story of this game became the top of my favorites of the franchise (though I do consider it the best of all three) and like any other decision-based game that involves actual consequences (but particularly this game), it puts you through a huge heavy roller coaster of emotions. 
And why do I think this title will always be better than the first one (yup, won't even bother to mention 'Before the Storm' again)? You get to spend all five episodes teaching your brother (Daniel) about the world and how to deal with his powers. These decisions build up to whether he will agree with whatever decision you make in the end. Whereas in the first title, all the choices we make feel like they don't matter in the end. What always matters is the final choice: save Chloe or Arcadia Bay, regardless of which path we take in the entire game plus, this game is a great example of how well storytelling and empathy for others can be taught through video games.

To wrap it up, this title delivered an experience like no other. I advise you give it a try (big in this case) as you're probably not gonna regret it.[/b]"
1974,"It is a beautiful game and one's choices are meaningful. It has a lot of depth to it as well. 
Long story short. If you are into decision based games and then this is for you."
1975,Starts off slow but as soon as the story picked up I was hooked.
1976,It's just all so rushed. No bonding time with the characters. I fear that DONTNOD will never manage to make a game as good as Life is Strange 1 again.
1977,[b]very gud 10/1 0 wood recoment[/b]
1978,"Damn it Dontnod entertainment. Do you derive pleasure from making grown men cry? Aren't you ashamed for yourself for making amazing games that touch people (appropriately)?

You, the reader. Stop wasting time reading reviews and go buy the game already. Sell a kidney if you need to upgrade your machine. It is worth it."
1979,Best story
1980,One of the most beautiful games I have ever played.
1981,"dis game is REALLY fun! if your into superpowers, and story based games, this is for u! excited for life is strange: true colors! :D
"
1982,"No, just no. Like I don't have a specific problem with the Life is Strange series, whereas it's one of my favorites but this one really takes the cake when you think about how boring the game can be. Most people usually complain about how annoying Daniel is but he might be the only character who has a strong character throughout the game as you can see him grow up. But the journey they are on is literally tedious, like I don't see the point of the story either. Maybe it doesn't have to have one but god, I finished the game to see if I am wrong about certain parts but nope."

1984,Very good game just make sure to kill the bitch in the church for best ending
1985,"How many times will a random white duo serve as a plot device?
It wouldn't have been so bad if you had more of the redeeming moments in this.
Too bad they ruined it entirely with [spoiler]episode 3 turning your brother into a possessed demon child.[/spoiler] After that point you're halfway hanging on for the next white person to step on your livelihood."
1986,:)
1987,"If you like a good, emotional story, buy this game. I briefly debated on whether or not to give it a good or bad review, but with all taken into account I really do love this game. Coming from a family that has an almost identical structure and heritage to the Diaz brothers, I had an immediate sentimental connection to the main characters. That being said, it really pains me to write that this game falls a little short IMO, mainly because of how politically charged it is. When I play a video game, I want almost a complete escape from the chaos and bullshit that us Americans have to deal with no matter where I stand on a societal issue. For me to pick up a new episodic game from a critically acclaimed series, just to find that it's yet another modern piece of art with an incredible vibe that is almost completely ruined by the developers' motivation to send another politically and socially charged statement, is so utterly disappointing. At first, the social cognizance was not really present but as the story goes on you end up realizing what this game is really trying to convey. It's a shame in my book, I would really rather see messages like this somewhere else, even a movie, but for people to say that the developers are ""brave"" for creating the sequel to another incredible game with undertones that millions upon millions of people are already sending with games is simply wrong. I'd give it an 8/10, because it plays beautifully and really hooks you into continuing, but for all the reasons mentioned previously it loses some credit from me.

By the way, I played only the first episode on steam which is why I have only 7 hours. I played  all of the other episodes outside of steam."
1988,"Life is strange 2 is better than the first in my opinion. It highlights many social issues in society and actually taught me a lot of life lessons such as how much privilege I really have. What I like most is that I feel like the choices matter much more, given that you can not reverse time like Max. There are five different alternative endings instead of two. I didn't like my ending at first because I realized I valued brotherhood more than the rules of society so I played it twice. I'll never forget the feeling of playing for the first time. I'm glad I bought it."
1989,"i wish you were able to rate games beyond ""Recommend"" and ""Don't Recommend"" on steam, as i feel like there's more to that simple dichotomy. with that being said, i give this game a light recommendation, not a heavy one. allow me to explain why.

life is strange 2 is the third installment in the life is strange franchise. however, except for its name and some references, it has absolutely no connection to the prior games, as it takes on its own story, with its own characters and settings. nothing wrong with that, but just something to keep in mind going into it.

in this review, i'm going to focus on the story, as that's the biggest selling point of this game. to be completely honest, most of the story felt pretty dull. instead of feeling like one continuous sequence of events, the story feels like a series of disconnected events, with the only connection between events being the presence of the main characters. it feels as if the writers didn't really attempt to bind everything together, instead opting for more of a slice-of-life-esque style of writing (as in you're meant to view the incidents of the protagonists individually, as opposed to viewing them wholly). i'm not suggesting that the slice-of-life format is inferior and boring, but rather that i believe it does not work with a game like life is strange. the purpose of life is strange is to give the player an emotional experience, and in my opinion, slice-of-life formats are not suited for that; they are more geared towards lighthearted entertainment.

additionally, most characters feel extremely one-dimensional and disposable. as said previously, most events happen with little connection to each other, being forgotten after its conclusion. well, this is pretty much the exact same for almost every character; it feels like they're created to serve some purpose, either to instigate conflict, cause inconvenience, or aid the protagonists, and then are disposed of, never being mentioned again later in the story. of course, not every character is forgotten, as there's a few that are somewhat important all throughout, but most of them are forgotten. this is even apparent with characters who have been greatly developed and seem to become integral to the story. (minor spoilers ahead, reveal at your own risk) [spoiler]in the middle of the game (chapter 3), the main characters run into a large group of people whom they consider family. after the conclusion of the chapter though, all of them (except a few characters) are completely forgotten and simply never mentioned. the developers took the time to develop these characters and show the bond they had with the protagonists, but despite that, the story simply moves on from them, basically forgetting their existence.[/spoiler] i just wish there was more consistency with characters, instead of a bunch of forgettable characters whose purpose is to be or create some plot device; i wish there was more quality over quantity is basically what i'm saying.

incidentally, the superpower the protagonists have feel more like a means to bring convenience than it is an integral part of the story, unlike the first Life is Strange where Max's time travel was very much central to the story, and Before the Storm's argument mechanic, which reflected Chloe's rebellious personality. the superpower here doesn't seem to mean anything aside from ""it exists and gets used sometimes"". thought i'd mention this because it's similar to my previous point about characters.

and lastly, it doesn't really feel like you have much control in the game. the whole premise of the life is strange franchise is that [i]you[/i] get to decide your story; you are the driving force for all that happens. but in this game, most of the choices you're given feel illusory at best, as in, regardless of what you choose, you'll get similar outcomes. not every choice is like this, but most of the choices i made felt very insignificant, since the story seemed to disregard my input. instead of playing my story, it felt like i was playing the writer's story, which defeats the whole premise of the life is strange franchise.

however, despite all my criticisms, there is some praise i must give: the ending. the ending to this game was honestly one of the best conclusions i have ever seen, and i thought it was masterfully done. all the events leading to the final decision make me feel tense and very invested into the story, unlike the prior chapters where i felt like i was just playing without any real attachment. there are 4 endings you can get, and i loved how each ending ties into how you acted throughout the game. i know i mentioned earlier that most of the decisions you made felt frivolous at best, but there are some decisions that do have some impact, particularly towards character growth. most of these decisions are subtle, ones without prompt and instead requiring you to take some action, engage in some event, or choose some line of dialogue. unlike most of the decisions where you base it on how you anticipate consequences, you largely base these decisions on your own personal moral philosophies, and it's likely that you won't be aware what impact these subtleties have, at least immediately. i feel as if the writers gave great emphasis to subtle behavior instead of outright decision-making, since that subtle behavior [i]will[/i] influence the ending. i would explain why and how, but doing so requires me to spoil the endings, so for that reason i won't.

ultimately, i think this game is above average. i explained my criticisms with the story, particularly the storytelling, character usage, and player control. these on their own would've led me to give this game a negative recommendation, but i loved and enjoyed the ending so much that it was able to convince me to give this a light recommendation. there are some other points i didn't mention, largely because it would make this review too lengthy, but my opinion nonetheless remains the same.

6.5/10"
1990,l
1991,it is good
1992,"good. buy it
"
1993,interesting..
1994,This game has a great story. If you want to protect your family and put it into a game this game is for you.
1995,"Not as good as the first game in my opinion, yet I relate to this one more. The struggles of being a sibling to someone much younger than yourself is portrayed brilliantly here, I really felt for Sean. and while I'm not that happy about the ending i got, it still felt pretty satisfying. That probably doesn't make much sense, but that's just because this game makes me feel pretty darn conflicted.
I love the gameplay style and story progression, and yet there are some head-scratching turns in the story and characters I wish we saw more that are more or less discarded after their relevant chapter. The graphics are sub-par but they have a stylized charm to them. The music is pretty good here, but definitely not as iconic as the original's. There's a lot about this game to love, and also a lot to hate, but it's definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of story-based games."
1996,"ok
"
1997,"Lets start from this standpoint. Your choices don't matter. They don't impact the little details of the game in any way except for the ending and after getting 2 endings. I have to say. The game is completely underwhelming. While the story had a good plot and character background, I just felt like I never grew emotional connection to the characters and that nothing I actually did in the game truly mattered. More like a B rated movie that I was just able to watch.

Buy it on sale. It isn't worth it at full price. And If you really can't spare the money for this game. Buy Red dead 2. 100% guarantee that game is wayyyy more worth it then this shit."
1998,good
1999,"Life is Strange 2: Wow! Wow! Wow!
This game was better then all of my expectations, it had me crying, laughing, in total shock, and so much more! 

The story telling in this game is hard hitting, and far above that of other story based games in the genre like life is strange games before it, and other Tell-Tale series.
Lots of great throw backs to other life is strange games that came before it. If you enjoy life is strange, or tell-tales (choose your own story adventure games) this is a MUST!

I do not give out 10/10 reviews because i don't believe games are perfect, and always have room for improvements, but this game went above and beyond all my expectations, so:

2008,"[b][h1]Ow-Ow-Ow-OOOOO![/h1][/b]
They need to rename this game to ""[i][b]Life is [u]Sad[/u][/b][/i]"" [b]ʘ︵ʘ[/b]

A huge step up from the first game, in [b]storytelling[/b] [i]and[/i] [b]cinematography[/b]. [b]\( ﾟヮﾟ)/[/b]
LiS 2 is [i]soooooo[/i] much better than the first installment. It brings political themes to the table, and I felt a bond between the two brothers in comparison to Chloe and Max. I very much love how the big brother-little brother relationship works; it feels real and each interaction has charm! I think they nailed the character development here. The dialogue this time around is a lot better written than the first one as well. Kids say weird sh*t all the time and this was a lot closer to the way teenagers (or just any human being really) actually talk in my opinion. 

The game doesn't stand out graphically, or really, mechanically at all, [b][i]but[/i][/b] the story is [b]gripping[/b] and [b]beautifully crafted[/b]. The voice acting is just [u]fine[/u] (I'll admit, it wasn't the best). The morality system was a pretty good idea and I felt my choices did matter this time around since I was always [i]really really[/i] careful when saying something because I knew it had influence on my little brother, Daniel. I really liked Sean too and felt involved in his struggles as well as the other characters I met along the way. I do, however, think I should have gotten to know the other characters myself and not through a timeskip/recap in my journal though. [b]¯\(◉◡◔)/¯[/b] Sure this game has its moments where it makes you clench your butt and cringe, but I feel like that adds to the experience, cause you're actually playing as, you know, [b][i]kids[/i][/b].

Random but the game really tried making a redemption arc for the mom but she's just an a$$hole no matter how you look at it and that's all I'm going to say on that subject.. [i]lol[/i] [b]ᴖ̮ ̮ᴖ[/b]

This game also has 7 different endings and I think I got the best ending out of all of them in my first playthrough which is the ""[b]Parting Ways[/b]"" one. It's a bittersweet ending but I prefer it out of the rest since it doesn't make my heart hurt as much. [b]❣◕ ‿ ◕❣[/b]

[b]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]

As for the people saying they're pushing a political agenda, dismissing it on the basis of it ""[i]making white people seem evil[/i]!!!""  Yeaahh... No. It's more of an agenda on how everyone deserves basic [i][b]empathy[/b][/i] and [b][i]dignity[/i][/b]. [i]Ooo[/i], [b]scary[/b]. 

[u][b]BUT[/b][/u] I will say, I don't like how the developers approached it. If you create a piece of entertainment that focuses on social issues, I sort of expect you are doing it with the idea of changing minds and the developers clearly weren't interested in addressing an issue or giving perspective. They just continued ranting to the players about the beliefs they already hold and feeling good doing so. 

Most games before LiS 2 showed us racism in fantasy or sci-fi settings through metaphor and the reason this game hits differently is simply because of its grounding in our own reality. If you put overtly racist violence in a contemporary setting, people will crawl out from under the stones to yell about how the depiction is over-dramatic or dishonest or, perhaps, racist in itself. Like NO. It isn’t [u]enough[/u] to touch on the subject, [b][i]these things matter[/i][/b], and we have to [b][i]PUSH[/i][/b] and media is one of our few options to push broadly. There's far more people who aren't racist in the game than who are by the way. Sean and Daniel are on the road for almost a year and encounter, what, 3-5 racists? That being said, racism is a thing that happens. It can happen to someone in any type of frequency because, tragically, racists exist and this game lays it on [b]THICK[/b].

Also, what about Agent Flores?? She initially threw me off guard, because I had thought as a fellow Latinx to them, she would be more sympathetic to Sean’s situation, but that’s something a lot of people might not immediately notice because it’s so easy to overlook. I think that being integrated into ""white culture"" affects the very psychology of minorities. People will turn against their own ethnic background and the struggles of their fellow poc for the sake of attaining similar success as white people, making them perhaps unknowingly complicit in the system as well. I just thought that was interesting. [b]ಠಿ_ಠ[/b]

AND their very own grandmother was pretty racist too?? Almost every interaction she had with Sean was a micro aggression. But both their grandparents still loved them, nonetheless. It just shows that racism is not always necessarily monstrous, it's just [i]complicity[/i] in an [b]oppressive[/b] system. I feel like this game has given me a better understanding of how deeply racism is embedded in society since I’ll never be able to truly understand the racism poc face on a daily basis.

I just think it hits too close to home for a lot of people and made them uncomfortable, which is what [i]good[/i] art does! [i]And[/i] why there are so many complaints concerning it. [i]Sooo[/i] this game deserves to be appreciated despite its ""[i]agenda[/i]"". 

Anyway, the game has a gorgeous soundtrack too. [b](◍•ᴗ•◍)[/b]

not the story, not the gameplay.
they went for something different from the first game and it just didn't work

2015,yes
2016,a masterpiece
2017,"3/5
good"
2018,This game was one of the best story games I played and it def deserves a thumbs up its my favorite so far in the series and im excited for True Colors to come out
2019,"Being a big fan of the first and before the storm I cant help feeling disappointed with this. It started good but started to fall short by the 3rd or 4th episode. The ending that I got was so so so disappointing, and left me feeling horrible. 

I didn't feel as connected with Sean and Daniel. Daniel got quite annoying very quickly and his power felt like to much. Sean was pretty good he felt solid but fell short at some places too. All the characters we where introduced to in the episodes felt like they left to soon, I felt connected to many of them but they were gone by the end of the episodes and we never got to see them again. Its an overall alright game but not a good fit for the series.

One thing that thoroughly enjoyed through the game was the music, It had the same feeling from the past games and added to the experience of this one. 

If you are a big fan on the Life Is Strange series I would recommend you play this game but if you are not I dont think I would recommend it."
2020,yes
2021,"I have fallen in love with all life is strange games, life is strange 2 can relate to reality a lot and really sends a powerful impact of a message to everyone. I'd recommend this game for its emotional story and bonding ties between the two brothers Sean and Daniel. 10/10"
2022,very good u should try :D
2023,"Play for and epic crying session, EBIC GAME."
2024,"Another adventure in the Life is Strange world. The art, the quality of the sounds & musics are awesome as expected from this franchise. But I think, this game is a little bit behind of the first game because of the story & paranormal activity. But, it's a great journey nevertheless. Every title in that franchise is highly recommend."
2025,this game is a 10/10 i love the part when the dad died
2026,"Building on the Success of the first Life is Strange this next edition in the series is incredible, while I will save the spoilers for the game it's self; I can safely say that DOTNOD manages in Life is Strange 2 keep all the amazing and groundbreaking game mechanics, while fixing the limited list of issues the first game had. Whilst graphically the two games are similar, they are certainly improved in this instalment. The sound and motion design in LIS2 are miles ahead of LIS1, and it truely makes the difference. The story as always is well thought out and rounded with each passing episode. It is both emotionally involved and immersive which is really something you want from a game of this style and calibre. The dialog and story options for the player are far more dynamic and expansive compared to those of the first Life is strange. The use of different special abilities and the choice of separating the player from these abilities, further distances this game from the first, keeping the story fresh and engaging. It's awards are certainly well deserved and and earned by the incredible programming, design and writing teams at DOTNOD studios. I can't recommend the Life is Strange series enough and if you've played the first, I can safely assure this game does not feel like a cold drawn out carbon copy of the game, and is absolutely worth playing.

Get it for yourself. You'll love it."
2027,epic
2028,"Its life is strange but not life is strange, to life is strange 1 i gave my max perfect score 10/10, to life is strange 2 im gonna give a 7/10 the game is beatifull but, music is wierdly chosen, it dosent match some of the situations and some other times is just not good, on the end credit it was finaly good but the game ended, facial expressions are poor, and i thought the kid from captain spirit actualy could fly, and this game ruined it but showing me (nahhh he dosent fly he was just saved)... But even after all that i still recommend the game its a nice story, lovable characters and a nice adventure."
2029,this is giving me anxiety but its totally worth it 9/10
2030,"Again, LIS move me again in Choices Matter type of game, it show us how unfair life can be when racism still exist. I'll look foward for the next LIS."
2031,"apart from babysitting, definitely worth playing."
2032,"Yes, I can recommend it... if you like games where you don't have much to do... I played both Life is Strange games, and I feel like this one had too many cut-scenes and not enough of me doing things by myself.

Yes, you get to decide on things that change the environment and what happens to the protagonists... and yes, it is nicely made with an interesting story. But in the first instalment, I felt I had more to do, more interactions with my surroundings. In this one, sometimes it went from cut-scene to cut-scene with me just picking one of two options in the middle of the dialogue. The first couple episodes were better in that regards, but it seemed to get more cut-scene oriented as it went on.

I do want to play again and do things differently to see what impact the decisions actually have, so there's that. ^^; I'm just glad I got the episodes on sale. I don't see myself paying full price for the amount of gaming involved. Especially since you have to pay for each episode separately... ^^;"
2033,Great Game!
2034,"NOTE: I stopped playing in the middle of episode 4. It's just painful to play.

Simply put, If you don't like nurturing stubborn kid, then just don't play this. Unlike Max which is powerful, your character is so weak, the game design is just that. You're weak, your stubborn little brother is powerful, force you to make peace all the time with people (including A'holes), and if you make decisions to fight you'll lose anyway. And sorry Sean, no time for revenge. Just eat that beat down all the time from A'holes lol."

2038,Like it
2039,"After 3 years, I finally got the chance to finish this game. 

I like how DONTNOD touched upon the issues that we face today, especially the issues that minorities are facing. DONTNOD is not scared of the backlash they may face from players who disagree with the political side of this game and for that, I applaud them. I mean.. Didn't y'all play LiS?

[i]No me importa. Este es un buen juego. Lo recomiendo.[/i]

Anyways... I am excited for the next LiS game coming out in a a few months. Much love to the devs. ♡"

2045,"Absolutely astounding. I love all the characters and really tugged on my heartstrings. Although, the endings aren't quite what I was hoping for. Some of them are just awful and others just leave me feeling unsatisfied. However, still a great game."
2046,"After having seen several let's plays in the past, I finally got around to playing this myself and man, a lot of it still hit hard. I'm kinda glad I didn't play this with the long time in between chapter releases, which would have been my only complain.
I love it."
2047,wow.
2048,"I have never had so much troubles trying to get interested into a game's story as I did with this game, like for real. The amount of times I had to force myself to keep playing just in a hope that the game would become interesting is hilarious. I played the first chapter maybe 5 times because I always ended up getting too bored to carry on, just to restart it after a few months and do it again, until I found the strength to finish the first chapter and the game as a whole.

Honestly I loved both life is strange and life is strange: Before the storm, I think the first game is a masterpiece with before the storm coming very close to it. I had some very high expectations for this game which got shattered within a hour of gameplay.

Ignoring the start of the game, in which the dad get shot, without the officer even asking a question, just straight up shot down like a dog in the street (muh politics).
The game really feels like such a chore compared to the first game and it makes no sense in terms of how the story is told.
Episodes feels like they are completely disconnected as the two brothers jumps from place to place, random characters are thrown in just to be tossed aside before they can say or do something meaningful, making it impossible to ever grow a like or dislike for any of them, which is something that the first game had no problems with.

The game really suffer from the lack of any meaningful mechanics that can make a game like Life is strange actually more than just a talking simulator. In the first game you had the ability to rewind time which allowed for more options while talking and fun or specific interactions with the characters.
This game just lack any extra mechanic, making it just a talking simulator which tries its best to teach you about racism while failing miserably as EVERY SINGLE PERSON the two brothers talk with apparently is some white suprematist, leaving you to guess if everyone's a racist in Murica or if the game just decided that the best way to teach people about racism was to make every single person in the game a racist.

It doesn't help the fact that the two main characters are pretty boring overall and the dialogues are just...Awful:
Daniel is a little whiny cunt who never shut the fuck up, which I'll admit, it make sense considering he's 9 years old but goddammit I hated him so much through the whole game as he never shut the fuck up.
Sean on the other hand is not as bad but his voice actor...Goodness gracious his voice actor is just something else. I have never heard someone being so emotionless while speaking, it just made me lose the little interest I had left for the game."

2051,"Really fun game to play with a good story, amazing quality gameplay"
2052,"This is Life is Strange, I expected there to be some trouble for our protagonists. But damn, there really was no way to have a happy-ish ending no matter what choice I made. Despite this, I think that the game touched on some timely issues in an understandable way (though it’s debatable if a writing team of white Frenchmen were the right ones to be telling it). After the first game was about platonic/romantic love, it felt nice for familial love to take the spotlight in this game.

My biggest gripe is that Episode 3 felt like a filler episode simply to set up the circumstances of Episode 4. Besides meeting the character that helps to set up what happens in Episode 4, it just sort of exists for a romance option (if you choose to have one) to happen that doesn’t really affect much else in the story."
2053,top on me XD
2054,I absolutely love this series

2059,Funky powers go brrrrr <3
2060,The game was good. great atmosphere. Super story. The selection in the last 3 episodes meant nothing. You couldn't get close to the characters because you were with them for a short time. Each episode threw you into a running story. Only what matter is how your decision affects your smaller brother. The game deserves 7.5/10

2068,10/10 would cry again
2069,"I absolutely adore this game, it definitely made me cry like a baby at some point. Besides a lot of the political talk and little audio mistakes, its an amazing game and its pretty easy to overlook the parts that need work. This game had me so intrigued in the story of Sean and Daniel, this is by far my favorite LIS game. I'd 100% play it again! <3"
2070,Loved it. I would play it again. I am really looking forward to the next installment in the Life is Strange series!
2071,"i love it
"
2072,"One of my top favourite games of all time. Sure some of the themes are a little heavy handed, but the atmosphere, music, visuals, and vibes are phenomenal. 

The story is more disjointed than LiS 1 and the character turnover rate leaves you feeling a little less attached to people, but like... ugh. I keep coming back to this."
2073,"An absolute rollercoaster of true emotions and heavy political implications that are often used as scapegoats to cause drama in each dry and rebellious society the Diazes live with. A less-interesting and linear OG-game-formula: big brother simulator. (6/10)

[i] Note: Played once on PC. This is a choice-based adventure game that informs you of all possible choices/outcomes at the end of each chapter (five total), & how you compared to all other players in your choices. About 90% of the time, I aligned with the majority of player choices. [/i]"
2074,"im losing my fucking mind playing this game. i dont get how this game could possibly be that much different from LiS1 and LiS before the storm. im not being racist or sexist because the game made the main protagonist mexicans and males but like are you fucking kidding me daniel. literally the fucking kid is pissing me the fuck off so much that i cant even begin to explain. the one thing we established in the first 3 episodes is to keep the power a secret and this motherfker shows some church his power and now the christians are crazy over him. this kid goes ""i kNoW, sEaN. sToP buGGing mE"" everytime i lecture him about not showing his powers and this mothefucker goes IM THE DETROIT SENT BY CYBERLIFE in episode 4 im done fuck this game get me out"
2075,"It was a decent story game, but it was held back by shoehorning in politics."

2077,sean diaz  please be my malewife
2078,"Well, here is an attempt at a review. Spoilers for both LiS1 and LiS2.

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I try to play choice based story games to reassure myself that no matter which option I pick, the world isn't going to end (at least in real life) and my worries can't get the better of me. That part of choice based games was kinda lost to me in LiS1, as with a time travelling ability, not many choices felt permanent, compared to LiS2, where you have to think more.

This does get a lot of comparisons to LiS1 and personally I had a much stronger connection with this game. For multiple reasons I think. The whole plot is built on injustice, with telekinesis thrown into the mix. And I personally like how they committed with what many would call being 'woke'. The standouts were how they showed racism and homosexuality. I think if a game represents society in any way, it is important to decide how to represent and ideally educate about different parts of it. I can't personally speak about racism, but how it was shown I do think was very real and extremely relevant. As for homosexuality, I can actually say a lot about it, considering I am gay myself. I jumped at the chance to romance Finn, and although there is a slight disparity between romancing Cassidy in comparison, I guess 'be gay and do crime' was an inspiration to writing the Sean/Finn romance. I do appreciate, that even if the player doesn't romance Finn (I do think Cassidy is slightly more mentally stable), it's not the only chance for gay people to be represented, which I was pleasantly surprised by. Penny talks about a former male lover, Jacob talks about conversion therapy and there is a brief conversation with Daniel relating to Arthur and Stanley kissing. And although I can enjoy media without seeing myself represented, I find myself feeling a lot more appreciative and preferring it when the effort is put in. 

A quick note on the art, which I love. I've always been a fan of the artstyle of LiS. My favourite part has always been how in game images are painted. And I found using Sean's sketchbook as another means of storytelling was fantastic. I'm an artist, and I can tell they developed his sketchbook as an artist would, sketchy and with notes everywhere, and it was a detail that I found unique and loved. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realise you could add detail to his sketching though, I know for next time I guess.

The only other thing I wan't to mention was the endings. So I appreciate that there are more than two endings, and it makes sense that they are determined by Daniel's morality, because he is the main element that determines plot. I do think how Daniels morality was determined could have been done better, because it's kinda confusing, and although I tried to pick high moral options, it also needs to be balanced with their brotherhood. So overall I think how the choices through from episode 1-3 can have a major effect on Daniel's morality is something I prefer as a whole, but it makes it more difficult to get the other endings. 

Anyways, I hope whoever read this found it at least somewhat helpful."
2079,"this game.... what can i say... i can only say it has changed me it has put a mark on my soul and i am so grateful for it being made i am grateful for playing this honestly i wish i could live with sean and daniel a bit longer i loved every part of this game there has yet to be a story to make me cry, laugh, smile and angry this much and the anger even is a positive thing i honestly can never let go of this game for it has captured my soul i love it i love it so much i want to scream that i love it from the rooftops. please please do yourself a favor and play this game its story and atmosphere is captivating and amazing to say the least. thank you team DONTNOD and everyone else for working on this masterpiece we are blood brothers we are superwolfs we are diaz and this game is a 20/10"
2080,"the story in this game is so powerful. massive improvements from the dialogue in the first game too. 
PROS:
- Incredible story
- Rich dialogue 
- Lovable characters
- Replayable due to multiple endings
- The choices in this game are very hard at times. Both a pro and a con.
CONS:
- You don't have the power, but your brother does
- At times, some of the choices seem like they'd be nice, but you actually say something rude. For example,
in one scene, you can tell your brother to keep trying, or focus. I assumed telling him focus would reassure him and tell him to focus, but my character started yelling and telling him that for the 'millionth time' he should focus. 
- the choices in this game are very hard.
- No manual save. However, I believe this is a storytelling technique so your actions are irreversible, unlike the first game where the time powers were an externalization of Max's inability to make decisions.

Overall, I highly enjoyed and recommend this game to anyone who likes this type of style of game. If you liked the first game, def give this one a play. It's much more political, but its very rich. I preferred the first game more in full honesty but this is literally incredible and is worth playing!"
2081,As good or better than the first one but different.
2082,"Life is Strange 2 takes everything that was good about the first game and goes backwards. As a recap, the first game was praised for having a lively setting with charming NPCs that the main character could optionally interact with, as well as a unique mechanic (time rewind) that created gameplay depth and prevented it from being entirely a talking simulator. Although the original game had a weak climax and lost sight of its world-building by episode 4, it was still a good game, and many people were excited by the thought of a sequel.

I hope you didn't like any of those features from the previous game, because they're all gone here. In this game, you play as brothers on the run from the shadowy, mustache-twirling po-po who apparently have it out for all Hispanic people in the Pacific Northwest (one of the most liberal areas of the US). There's never a setting in place for more than an episode, and so the game basically feels like The Walking Dead. This would work somewhat if the two brothers were interesting and dynamic, but they're not. The VA who plays Daniel isn't bad but holy smokes, the VA who plays Sean sounds like one of those awful ""voice actors"" they picked up in Before the Storm when they couldn't hire any of the original actors due to the VA strike. There are times when a text-to-voice program would be more emotive. He is SO bad and I can't believe no one else is really talking about this. The cringey ""teen talk translator"" dialogue is somehow three times worse when Sean is speaking.

So already our protagonists are pretty boring, which doesn't bode well. Next up is Daniel's power, which is telekinesis. Sounds cool in theory, but this is extremely lazily executed. You never get to play as Daniel, so your only ""choices"" with his power are whether you use it for good purposes or not. His power is used in cutscenes only. Honestly a terrible decision which was clearly done just to prevent having to animate objects that Daniel might have been able to interact with if you had free control of him. So lazy.

The biggest issue of this game is that the brothers spend the game wandering from place to place looking for white people to take mercy on them, but always run into some over-the-top racist people. Yes, racism is sadly alive and well in American society, but the amount of racism Sean faces in...SEATTLE, of all places? Completely unbelievable. This game's political undertones are about as subtle as Christina Aguilera singing nursery rhymes. My head was bleeding by the end of the game from being beaten with ""Trump bad"", ""old white people racist"", ""cops evil"" rhetoric. Maybe a French video game company shouldn't be making sweeping statements about life in America.

As for the ending(s), I think there are 5 or so, but they're barely any different from each other. Once again your choices have little to no impact on the end. I played through the game once, and I haven't touched it since. Contrarily, I've played LiS1 three times now. I ended up watching the other endings on YouTube. They suck too.

The only really nice part of this game is the visuals in the first two episodes. The wilderness is really well done, even if it's linear. Everything else is a big step down from the previous game. Next time, they should focus on actual gameplay instead of political statements. Still looking forward to True Colors."
2083,"tl;dr: Kinda weak story, characters and choices. Overall weak 6/10, if LiS taken as a 10.

Felt like most people involved were really milking the cow on this one, and I kinda regret buying it now after completing the whole game, but first episode left on an interesting enough note that it made me want to see the story through (plus im a completionist (semi achievement semi whr)).

Weak narrative (LiS did not feel like such forced, ""pushed down your throat Portait of America"" narrative to me like LiS 2). Some of it was decent, some of it was out of place and too blunt or cringy to be taken with any thought or seriously ([spoiler] you were presented with a window oppurtunity to comment on gay couple to your little brother if its normal or not in your opinion :) makes me wonder if the idea of making player choose acronyms at some point in the game was ever brought to the table or considered (perhaps it wasn't such a big thing back when game was in development)[/spoiler]). Some good and ok voice acting; and some funny (like [spoiler] Karen's face during the final goodbye hug although maybe the video settings were low on my side i dunno [/spoiler]) and some are cool visual design (with use of powers, scetches and locations). 

Awfully slow pacing. Arguably every LiS game now can be brought down to few basic elements, but I never cared to do so when I was playing LiS or BtS, but this one made me realize how shallow it really was: it starts with exposure scene that gives you in on a current situation, basic presentation on what is what, then bunch of elements and objects to see around and inspect and hear two liners from main character like ""damn, it was so cool..."" or ""oh, how i miss..."" and such, which then proceeds with some walking and talking around definied area and one dimensional characters none of which have any depth to them behind the facade that the story made them represent. Cycle repeats with some twists [spoiler] like racist shopkeeper or racist rednecks (not sure if those ""patriots"" near the boarder can be labeled like that but damn that was sad piece) or religious zealots or your good mate careless hippie that is causing you troubles or forcing you to react in some way and some decent people that help you out eventually in small or big way along your journey[/spoiler].

But honestly, if first game made me forget about being myself for a while, or lose myself in someone else's life for a change and see how it would go if you were reborn into a different time and a different body but with relatively same moral compass, this one felt like dragging through brief history of recent American problems that are only touched on a surface level, and not cause characters were unrelatable (probably one of the reason why I finished the game was that they actually were ok), but because you're left with whole bunch of nothingness at the end, you gained zero and you feel like you havent experienced anything. It's funny how [spoiler] introducing interesting and caring for you characters like Lyla at the start can still pull a cord and made you cheer for them to end up together (kinda like it does in old shows like Friends with Ross and Rachel), and be seen only to be added more further in the game as a friend or ""potential/ behind the scenes partner"" due to pressure from the players (from what I've read)[/spoiler]. 

Even as relatively old person you could lose yourself in golder age of being a teenager without care or load of adult life responsobilities while playing the first game ([spoiler] this cord is kinda pulled in this game with your mother chatacter, but you're left with either being cool with it or being judgemental and hurt haha, tough choice[/spoiler]), but in this one - nah. nope. can't do that chief. gotta see through that black and white narrative first and imagine your own happy end and your own happy [spoiler] brother's reunite talk (which as i think of it, was so well done in first game in series as it wasn't so black & white, there wasn't a good or bad choice between 2 endings at hand; it was your choice basically as you saw fit for that world, even though were both sucky options, when in this one - they just share their trait of all being kinda sucky and that's about it :S two peaceful endings, two disturbing and hurtful endings, oh well)[/spoiler]. 

Maybe they did stay true to the core of the first game and didn't want to dissapoint the fans in a big way, so i guess that's why this one is received as a decent addition to the franchise but again, can't say it's not the weakest one yet.

p.s. only recommended if you've enjoyed previous LiS games and/or if it's on sale :3"
2084,sad good game
2085,"Great game, great casting, great everything."
2086,"I'm kinda confused about this game actually. The whole situation could've been avoided if they called the cops, and they'd have gone free because the lack of proof and both of them are minors, so the story of this game doesn't make much sense and it also bothered me a little lol The scenarios change a lot and you don't really get to know the characters like in LIS1. I was so disappointed Captain Spirit only showed for like 25 min :( But overall I enjoyed playing because i like to explore things and I wanted to know what would happen next, also I spent money with it :p My final score for LIS2 is 7,5/10"
2087,Life is Strange again
2088,"First of all, i only play this game when i'm baked as hell. Yes, i finished the game by 30+ hours, which is a long time for a game like this. Actually, i finished the game with 20+ hrs, while the remaining 10+ is me admiring the view and the environment (LiS 2 + grass = heaven), especially in episode 3 & 5. Storyline-wise, even tho the first installment is better, it's still pretty decent. The interface & interactions between the Diaz brothers is surprisingly fun and well-optimized compared to first game. The biggest eminence from this game, IMO is the setting and environment. You got this beautiful stoned-creek in Arizona canyon, while feeling the summer breeze from many big trees in Oregon forest. It's just one of the most breathtaking experiences to have, especially when you stoned lol.

RECOMMENDED AF"
2089,"YO THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN, i wish that i was the one with the super power but its fine! I finnished 4 episodes in like 1 and a half, I also wish there was more episodes!!!!!"
2090,Never thought I'd be so invested in one of these story type games. I usually like open world survival and sci-fi games. But the story drew me in and I played it through in 2 days. This is definitely a buy if you can snag it on sale.  A few days later and I still think about the choices I made while playing although I'm happy with my ending.
2091,"The game promotes excessive amounts of irrational political propaganda on the player. 

Anti-Trump rhetoric, racist white people who hate Hispanics, and cops are bad. 

The story makes no sense. 

2/10

2092,i learn how to sing ABC in Spanish
2093,YES.
2094,"If you played the first Life is Strange, you will most likely enjoy this game as well. 
Is it better than the first one? I don't think it is, I personally liked the first one better.
Is it a great story? It definitely is.
My rating is about 7/10.
You should give it a try."
2095,"i enjoyed this game a lot, just wish that lyla got more screen time. i loved her role and wish the developers expanded on it more."

2100,SUPER GOOD
2101,Good story
2102,"My mother is immigrant, plus I have 2 siblings and this game really isn't relatable in the slighest. I have played through many telltale games, and I adored the original Life is Strange, But this, this game feels like such a chore compared to the first game and it makes no sense. I didn't even spend a dollar on this game and I still don't recommend it unless you can also get it for free, let me explain why (without giving out any major spoilers past the first 20 minutes of the game). 

STORY LINE MAKES NO SENSE:

The game's story line makes no f***ing sense, it just steers you in a stupid way of thinking, when the incident with the cop happens why is Sean so hellbent on leaving his town? He didn't do anything, and running away just makes him LOOK guilty, this is one of the most illogical choices the character could've made and I had no say in it. I was also bringing my brother along with me which I would never do. I anticipated this game was going to be awesome from the first 20 minutes of getting ready for the party but instead it just went down a boring and chore-like experience. Furthermore Sean and Daniel are meant to be the 'good guys' but they just aren't. I couldn't help but think about all the crimes they committed along the way, but when they recap the story at the beginning of each episode, they phrase in a way that just makes them look like innocent wolves. 

CHOICES ARE LIMITED:

Why am I forced to throw away my phone? And what is with all the Politics in this game? I can't even chose what my opinion is on the matter because both options side with a narrative. If I could decide how I felt then I wouldn't actually mind the politics. There's a scene where Sean is talking with his grandparents and I literally cannot respect them! I have to be rude which I just didn't think was fair at all! Plus why do I have to go against what my grandmother said for the story line to progress? It's just silly. 

CHARACTERS ARE BORING

so many characters I meet are either boring or don't hang around long enough during the entire game. the only exception is the girl Lyla who has a good personality. Plus some of them are just so unlikable like Finn and Cassidy. They are just really REALLY rude to everyone they meet. Plus their life goals just aren't appealing to me. I don't see why I'd want to hang around them. 

GAMEPLAY IS AT BEST MEDIOCRE:

I'm surprised the devs didn't give us the power, they made us the big brother who has to control a 9/10 year old for most of the game, it made the gameplay just so boring and half of it is just slow boring conversations with your brother or someone else, there is no atmosphere of a party like in life is strange 1, no atmosphere of choices that have actual meaning. And some of it is doing the washing, finding sauce pans, making dinner and I have to do that in real life enough lol. 

OVERALL: 

Storyline makes no sense and isn't interesting, the gameplay feels like a chore and conversations are boring, the characters are unlikable, the choices don't really matter and some are completely forced, especially the politics - I can't even chose my own opinion. AND I PAYED $0 FOR THIS GAME AND I STILL DON'T RECOMMEND IT UNLESS YOU CAN GET IT FOR THIS PRICE. 

"
2103,"this game hurts me, but it was a great journey, love it."
2104,"Finished the game without any trouble, flawless storytelling. But if i had to complain about something it's probably the voice acting. The Delivery of the voice actors made the conversations a bit dull sometimes. But most of the times you won't even notice it. The adventures of these two brothers surely made me empathize towards them and the characters around them. Would totally recommend if you love a story heavy game."
2105,"One of the best games I've ever played. I really love the story, and how you can investigate a lot of things.. I can feel the sense of freedom. I also love the 3D graphics. The details of how the houses are designed etc. What a masterpiece. I hope there will be more upcoming games like this. This is a ten out of ten :)"
2106,noice noice noice
2107,This game was a beautiful experience to play through with it's enlightened storytelling. I would HIGHLY recommend this game if you love good stories.
2108,very cool gayme 9/10
2109,This game has a great story line.
2110,"This game is a masterpiece, the best story based game I have ever played 10/10."
2111,"[h1] Shit Story Line [/h1]
Everything was fine until Ep3. [spoiler] Daniel is a pain the ass. I don't like how shit still happens no matter what you do, and how limited are your choices. Cassidy will get injured no matter what. I would let Finn die anyways, as I've noticed how of a bad influence he is, but Daniel just doesn't listen at all and continues to do the shit he feels like doing.[/spoiler]
If you want a good ""make your own adventure"" ""choice-matter"" type of game, then play The Walking Dead Season 1. It's true it will always have the same ending where [spoiler] Lee dies [/spoiler], but at least your choices will have a strong impact during gameplay."
2112,"Un excelente juego en el cual cada capitulo toma diversos temas que complementan bien a la historia, creo que como un Life Is Strange cumplio con lo esperado pero sin sobresalir excesivamente, Es un excelente juego para rejugarlo y completarlo con diferentes historias/finales"
2113,"Y politics in muh vidya gayme? I can't believe DONTNOD would do this, i'm literally crying and shaking rn."
2114,"I liked Life is Strange 2, but is nowhere near the impactful game or awesome story of the previous LiS titles. 

First of all, I have to compliment Dontnod to go into a very different direction with this one. And while I am not against developers putting political views in their games, there is way too much negative stuff that happens to these characters for no apparent reason. I think it is just much harder to relate to Sean & Daniel than it is to relate to Max & Chloe. 

One of the key factors to this (minor spoiler warning I guess) is that this is a long roadtrip. This also means that characters are being introduced and then dumped by the story. There are some very interesting people the main characters meet but as soon as you think something exciting is about to happen, Sean & Daniel just leave. I don't know why they would have a introductory chapter based around Captain Spirit if he only appears in one episode and is almost never mentioned again afterwards. 

The absolute highlight of this series is Episode 3, where you actually get a lot of the character dynamic you want in a Life is Strange game. Unfortunately, it kind of dumps characters again after that which is a big shame. It is Dontnods attempt to have a plot on a grander scale I guess, but it kind of falls flat. 

That being said, it is still a cool story about morale and what to do when it sometimes seems the entire world is against you succeeding. I'd give it a careful recommend. Just don't expect a Life is Strange 1 style story!"
2115,"welcome to emotion roller coaster 🌚
LiS series always so on point when trying to make me cry, and although the gameplay system is same (walking + looking at items + making choices), LiS 2 manage to provide a different feel because in LiS 1 u make choices for urself while in LiS 2 u r raising a kid so the choices u make will affect u and how ur brother will react in different situations. This is definitely new for me. Damn raising kid is hard 😂😂😂
As always, LiS 2 OST is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
2116,i have cried several times while playing this game.
2117,"I've played episode 1 for free and the game storyline, the gimmicks, suspends, and how every choices can lead to another story makes me decided to purchased for all the rest of the episodes (2-5). A very addictive game! The graphics make you feel like you're in the game. Everytime when i've done playing for the day, i felt like i've been to another world/reality. Love this and very recommended!"

2119,they killed Mushroom. 0/10 bad devs
2120,"very story rich and satisfying i am only 4 episodes in but still amazed nontheless. my pc is prebuilt for about 500 GBP and can just abt handle this, so its good for people with pcs that might not have the best specs. 100% reccomend to anyone who enjoys the old life is strange games and other games alike!

2121,"Amazing game, wanted more Chloe and Max content, instead got an amazing new story to follow. Already keen for the new game."

2123,why must this game hurt me this way
2124,"Rather than watering it down, Life is Strange 2 opens its players eyes to the struggles of living as a minority. No holds barred. It also explores sexuality in a non-forced way. I LOVE YOU, DONTNOD."
2125,"Life is Strange 1 is definitely better.
I personally didn't like the endings of LiS 2, but the story got me hooked.
It's worth a try, but don't expect LiS 1 plot-quality."
2126,"It's a really good game, very immersive, like watching a movie with your own choices. You can actually feel the connection between yourself and main character. The decisions in this game are not always black and white, i guess it really depends on which perspective that how you see things. Anyway, i just wanna say this game definitely worth playing."
2127,"Still prefer Life is Strange 1, but the storyline of Life is Strange 2 is very touching. Glad I had chosen the Redemption ending."
2128,"Whole game was like a public service ad, they discourse every problematic issue that you can think in one minute. My brother Daniel (Thor is lucky he has Loki) seized EVERY opportunity to frick me over. Bye bye time spent being irritated and bye bye being forced to care for this little fertiliser."
2129,best 13 hours ever spent on a game. its unique and most of your choices carry over to future episodes. neat experience and worth the price ill be buying the next one for sure.
2130,Pretty boring :P
2131,"A path where you must find your own way out, depending on the actions and seeing what changes influence the story you are putting together too much."
2132,Wonderful story with meaningful choices. Would recommend.
2133,"No spoilers.  For folks wanting an exact Life is Strange sequel, this game is different.  It's more of just a story you journey along with and make some moral choices.  In that sense it is less interactive than the first game.  And the use of the ""magic power"" only comes into significance at certain key points.  Still lots of interacting with objects to hear the characters' comments so you can learn about their personality.

I found the game extremely moving and emotionally tragic.  The bond between the two brothers is really touching.  The trials and tribulations they face are upsetting (even though their negative experiences are sometimes over the top, logically speaking).  Overall I enjoyed the game, hamfistedly repetitious politics aside, because of these two sweet and earnest kids trying to make a go of it in the harsh world together.  And of the older sibling trying his best to teach and protect his little brother.  Their dialogue and emotive voice acting really affected me.

Fair warning, if you are easily upset by seeing a 9 and 16 year old in emotional distress and subjected to cruelty and violence then this might not be the game for you.  It may linger with you and make you sad, as it did me.  Bitter sweet journey."
2134,Way to much pandering and virtue signaling.
2135,amazing game i want another story off of this one

2152,"It's a great game, but I don't understand why it's so hard to adjust for ultrawide."
2153,"The studio behind Life Is Strange has never been very good at dialogue, despite making games that center around conversation and dialogue. For the first game, that didn’t kill the experience. LIS 1 had set pieces, characters, and scenes that quickly became iconic, while LIS 2 has absolutely none of that. Time travel makes a far more impactful narrative device than a 9 year old being able to cause explosions; and with the scope of the story covering the entirety of the west coast instead of just one town in Oregon, the story absolutely fails at making the audience care about anything that’s happening. With just one episode being all the time given to connect to a certain location and it’s characters, the already weak writing and dialogue quickly becomes far more of an issue. 

DONTNOD, the studio that created LIS, is based out of France. I wonder if that’s why the dialogue seems so flat and out of touch, because it’s been translated. Speaking of out of touch, the political commentary in this game is really rough around the edges. Exploring the experiences of Hispanic characters during the Trump era is a very interesting idea, but they never explore it beyond throwing some caracatures into the story. You’ll have characters basically yell “build the wall”, without any of the depth that could be explored regarding racism and the political state of this country. The closest they got to a functional moment of political commentary was the fact the police assume the worst in the main characters, other than that there’s very little of substance or meaning happening. 

Now that the character you play isn’t the one with special abilities, the way you interact with these abilities is solely through dialogue, which again, is the weakest link of this series. It’s a shame they botched this game so badly, because the first game had a lot going for it even with DONTNOD’s dialogue writing issues."
2154,"Underrated game. Highly recommend :)

2157,"i hate and love everything in this. but, finn my beloved!!!"
2158,my poor heart <3
2159,Very immersive and emotional game play and story
2160,"Wow, this game was amazing, I loved the first, and really liked before the storm, but neither of them come close to this. I recommend playing LiS1, and then before the storm before playing this, and I also definently recommend getting those games, the entire series is pretty cheap on sale.

This games story is so good, the choices matter, adding replayability, gameplay is good, the art style is amazing. The biggest flaw with this game is that sometimes the animations/voice acting can be pretty bad, but 90% of the time its either okay or good. This game also solves LiS1's biggest problem, which was that game's ending.

Please play this game, the story is so good. It has been criticized by some for being political, but its really a story that you couldnt avoid some politics telling, and they can be a bit heavy handed with some politics, and you can tell the way the developers feel about them, but stuff like that doesnt bother me, but it can be a bit distracting. The game lets you choose what sean thinks and what he tells daniel to think, so dont worry about it.

This game's world and characters feel real, everybody feels real, and you truly will love and hate so many characters. The choices are super difficult to make, and Im now going to youtube to watch all of the different choices play out. Above all else this game will make you feel, anger, hate, love, sadness, happiness, everything, it makes you feel it so much, it really impacted me, and I think it will for a while.

I recommend this 10/10, also, make sure you play the awesome adventures of captain spirit after episode 1, its free, around an hour, and is basically LiS2 Episode 1.5

If you arent sure, you should get episode 1 for free, im sure itll sell you"

2162,"Overall 9/10 , it had great story and character devolpment also great&awesome soundtracks! MUST PLAY!"
2163,"Really not as good as the first game. The little brother is incredibly annoying and the main character is unlikable. After I visited the gas station and paid for all of the stuff I purchased, he still acted guilty when questioned about whether or not he stole anything. The game gives you a false ""choice"" between discuss, flee, or attack. Choosing the ""discuss"" option ends in a fight anyways, which makes no sense. The main character should have just entered the station and shown proof that he paid for everything. The game pushes a political agenda but isn't well-written or nuanced at all."
2164,an amazing game
2165,<3
2166,It is mind numbingly boring
2167,BOGUS!!! PAY FOR EACH EPISODE??? NO WAY!!!
2168,i loved it even though daniel is annoying as hell
2169,makes me question my own morality.
2170,"cool game i play game and i like game and i like game because it is good game 

heartfelt  video game i like game guys really good game Hank would've liked game and junior junior doesnt like me though good game"
2171,"Cried my eyeballs out.

Would do it again 10/10"
2172,"After Life Is Strange and Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, the third game in the franchise, Life Is Strange 2 had a lot to live up to. With two major but unique titles already in the franchise, the direction the next game would take was in question as the series already explored the city of Arcadia Bay with the first two titles.

Life Is Strange 2 separates itself quickly, introducing players to two new main characters, Sean and Daniel Diaz.  The Diaz brothers have a nice life in Seattle which is upended by an event where their father and a police officer are killed and they choose to flee to the Mexican town of Puerto Lobos 

Life Is Strange 2 also takes a different approach to its story.  Where Life Is Strange and Before the Storm both took a look at the life of Max Caulfield following her through a normal progression of her day, Life Is Strange 2 becomes more episodic, not just from the content delivery but from the format of the story. 

Events happen to the Diaz brother, but rather than have a predictable progression from the story, the story becomes vague about “What happens next”.  The brothers leave Seattle, and then hike on a trail, then go to a gas station, then move on to a motel.  None of these scenes feel connected to the rest, but there’s limited progression between them.   You might see the guy who picks them up after the gas station drop them off at the motel, but I constantly felt a question of “Why?”  Why not stay with the helpful friend where it’s safe, instead of risk another scene.

The simple answer is it’s because that’s how the story is written, it’s a series of vignettes where the writer can moralize or discuss different issues but it’s done in such a way that it’s blatantly obvious that Life Is Strange 2 is more interesting in its story pieces, then the full narrative of the entire story.  While this improves by the third episode, the first two episodes and the connection between the episodes feel more disjointed than that should be. 

The characters were the strongest part of the first two games, but here, while the Diaz Brothers remain the focus of the story, there’s a single additional character in the entire story that remains a focus for more than a full episode.  And while that character is important to the story, it seems that Life Is Strange 2 generates characters only to toss them away at the first chance they get.  

There are interesting characters, I kept hoping that some of my favorite characters would return, even to have a major and impactful final episode, and while there are some characters who might appear for a second in the final cutscene, everything feels like they are single-serving experiences just created to be disposable.

The only characters in Life Is Strange 2 that feel like they get a proper amount of development are the group the brothers meet in the third episode.  This is a collective that the main characters join and spend time with, and that’s where Life Is Strange 2’s story is the strongest when it takes the time to explore and make the characters feel like the other characters are important to the story, but sure enough by the end of the episode, all the development in those characters are quickly shoved aside to move on to the story element, and the players are left feeling lost again.   

It’s not being lost because of a lack of direction but an inability to hold on to anything of value in the story.  A story that seems too eager to explore its themes that ignores that the player wants to have something more than a fleeting experience with every character in the game.  Players will constantly be trying to make lasting relationships with almost anyone, even choosing options in the hope those characters might reappear and yet Life Is Strange 2 constantly acts like it doesn’t want to invest any additional time into any character.  It has more important story elements to rush to.

The real problem is the story that Life Is Strange 2 tells struggles due to the lost consistency in characters. Life Is Strange 2 wants players to feel how Sean and Daniel Diaz feel, as two children of immigrants, who are on the run from the police. That run from the police feels like a forced reason, it could work.  The problem is everything that happens from that point makes the player feel the writer’s hand. 

A major plot point in Life Is Strange 2 is a desire to talk about racism.  But Life Is Strange 2 can’t make a compelling or interesting antagonist for even a short vignette.  Rather than spend any time exploring racism, or racist people, characters hate Sean and Daniel because those characters are racist.  That’s the entire arc of the villains in each of these pieces,   They are single-note and uninteresting characters, not because of their racism, but rather the lack of anything else about them.  

Racism is a problem, but it’s more powerful when someone can realize anyone could be racist, or that racists may be able to hide their racism.   Instead, the multiple times that Life Is Strange 2 confronts Racism, they choose the most in-your-face examples of it with one-dimensional characters who only exist to be “Racists” so they could play out their moral stories and show people what it’s like.

But what’s worse is Life Is Strange 2 feels like it has nothing to say about Racism.  It tries to show it’s bad in a blatantly obvious way, showing the player that “racism exists.”  But it feels unable or unwilling to go any farther than that, yet it returns to that theme at least three times throughout the story and does about the same story with each instance.

The time this game came out also has an issue.  This could be a cautionary tale in 2014 or 2015.  Maybe it could have been a relevant tale in 2016 with the election or a worrisome look at the potential future in 2017.  But Life Is Strange 2 came out in 2018 through 2019, taking a full year to release, and yet it feels like it has nothing to add to the conversation.  

Looking back at it, it feels “quaint” from the 2021 perspective, however even at the time, there were much more important and relevant examples of racism, and no one needed reminding that racism was real.  Rather if someone needed that reminder, they likely wouldn’t play this game, or likely would ignore the repeated message of the game. 

And how I wish that was the core problem of the game, a repetitive message that has already been told, but sadly that’s just one of the flaws, yet the most obvious and easiest to talk about. 

Life Is Strange as a series has had two amazing experiences that evolved what stories in games could be, but it feels like Life Is Strange 2 has taken a massive step back.  The boys are given a dog, but then that dog is slaughtered in a way that feels the cruelly manipulative way that feels beneath the level of storytelling that should be exhibited.

Life Is Strange 2 also wants players to feel like they are imperiled and their decision matters, but so many decisions are just thrown around as if they don’t matter.  Money is an especially major part of the story that is brought up in almost every episode, and yet the “money” the brothers have never is consistent.  There are points where they have over a thousand dollars and points where they have almost nothing, and it’s more about what the story wants to do with the money, than anything.

2178,"Very Nice Game, highly recommend"
2179,Very good story !
2180,A very good story
2181,"Good Game, really enjoying it so far."
2182,good
2183,"Meh, goes down hill after first ep and just keeps going down. also the endings are terrible just god awful"
2184,"good game i like it 
"
2185,"very awsome game! 
people sould play this 
"
2186,"It's amazing how they can still create such a beautiful story. You will never expect with all the ending(s). It is all built by your choices and has an impact on your brother. I really love this game, their amazing and sad journey, and the beautiful soundtrack as always. And honestly, this is the best Life is Strange game for me :("
2187,yes
2188,Ultra woke propaganda game. The game is extremely racist against Caucasians. Don't buy it and don't play it.
2189,1 of the best single player games i have played
2190,Great game from Dontnod Entertainment
2191,1 was better.
2192,"Honestly, the whole Life Is Strange series is my most favorite games of all time. First, with so so much character development between Sean and Daniel. It grows on me when I played this game. From beginning to end. I know I thought I hated Daniel at first. But I realized, he's only 9 years old. He doesn't know much about himself, the world, or even his power. This game did make me get up from my chair and say ""oh no. i am not ready to make a choice. i might make the wrong decision."" I would get up and pause the game, not being ready to see what happens next, depending on what choice you make. Choice making games like this is the best. This makes me wanna play more of them. Sean and Daniel have such a strong bond. Even though they fight, I could say that they both probably have the strongest brother sibling bond that I have ever seen in a video game. This makes me want to replay Life is Strange and Life is Strange Before the Storm since it's been 6 years since I've played them. Now if you like games where you could pick between two choices and two choices only, that could make a huge impact on the story itself, then the Life is Strange series is for you. I was surprised, scared, happy, sad, and shocked with everything that happened in this game. I am happy that I am able to enjoy this game, and the series itself. (By the way, my most favorite character has to be Cassidy)."
2193,love it
2194,Life really is strange
2195,"this fucking game 
what the fuck bro 😭😭"
2196,Just no comments!
2197,Life Is Woke 2
2198,Just stick to the first one.
2199,I loved the storyline in the game and the characters.  I would definitly recommend it to other people.
2200,this is poggers
2201,its a very good story with events that lets you choose the characters like idk its hard to explain you just make choices that can come out good or bad on you and your brother
2202,wow...
2203,"Absolutely 10/10 game, with everything the two go through makes you feel like you're in Sean's shoes. Every time a choice appears you really gotta think about what might happen. Crazy outcome, crazy game. Once again 20/10 would recommend."
2204,An amazing story full of emotion and adventure but i will never forgive them for the puma.
2205,good story
2206,"The basic plot of this story is a tragedy. Which is not entertainment at all. Of how cruel we are. Regardless of fantastic driven subject, each stage of this story is real life. Drama implies the conflict of character and society, and typically this conflict is about protagonist's objectives that he/she can not achieve due to some limitations, rules, relationships, traditions or so. This drama is slightly different being driven by outstanding events of major force, narrowing the path of young man's destiny without the real alternatives to choose.
"
2207,"The Game has stunning Graphics. Story doesn't feel as good as the previous one. Endings are somewhat okay, and it only felt good after watching all the endings.
Last of all, Daniel is hella irritating and a prick."
2208,Hell yes!
2209,"Além de ser um jogo muito emocionante e bonito, ele é também um tipo de conteúdo necessário atualmente, diversos ensinamentos a respeito de ética, moral, decisões e valores... Algo que, infelizmente, anda muito em falta em nossa sociedade."
2210,"when i playing it ,it give some sort of connection between people which i really need now,because i live around some cool-blood people which doesn't care about people's life at all, i wish i could have this sense of belonging with people, the game developers done a great job of satisfying my dream in this virtual reality."
2211,"Life is Strange 2 is a cute game with few qualities, that falls so far from the expectation set by Life is Strange 1 that at times you are going to hate it or being puzzled by it or laugh at its failures. It has some good points but lacks in so many other areas, that it is almost a disappointment. I will point out the main flaws and weaknesses of the game, mostly in comparison to what the first game accomplished. 

1) The game is a choice-matters linear story driven game BUT it lacks the gameplay to support it. Life is Strange 1 had this ""turn back time"" gameplay that complimented the choices: You could see the outcomes of both choices and choose later (while it was used to solve some clever puzzles like the principal's door). This small mechanic took the game to the next level. LIfe is strange 2 has no such mechanic. It is just ""choose now-see later what happens"" which in comparison to the first game is flat and uninteresting. 

2) The butchering of the story: Why did the story of Life is Strange 1 resonate so much? Because it used the same characters and the same setting for ALL FIVE episodes. From beginning to end, Life is Strange 1 is set in Arcadia Bay with characters that appear and reappear along the narrative. The characters have time and space to breathe and to develop, to make a mark in the story. Not just Max and Chloe (the protagonists) but everyone from Kate Marsh and David Step-douche to Nathan Prescott and Victoria Go-f-your-selfie.
That does not happen with Life is Strange 2: Every episode is a new setting, new characters and before you can like them or see them develop, OOPS another episode, another set of characters. It would have been SO MUCH BETTER if Cassidy was until the end with them and Karen make her appearance earlier. 

3) The characters: Some say that Sean and Daniel are unlikable characters, not like Max and Chloe. That is partly true. The problem is not that you will hate them BUT their actions (and I mean not your choice) are inconsistent. E.g 1: Daniel never takes responsibility for his actions. He is the one that compromises their safety in Ep.02, he is the one who messes up in Ep.03 and he is the one who is manipulated in Ep.04. But he always points the finger on you no matter what you do. In one instance he is willing to rob and kill and an hour later he turns into ""I must do the right thing"". Karen is the same, Finn is the same, Jake is the same. Their actions don't match up with who they are. 

4) Forced story: I'm not talking about the political agenda, which I found more than fine. I'm talking about the forced drama that the game is trying to achieve: Sure lock a room and then get mad because they got curious. Throw a likeable rascal in order to have Sean to feel threatened because Daniel found another big brother. Make the love interest a threat to Daniel. Make the religious lunatic so good at manipulating but also loose her wits in the end. 

5) The lack of gameplay: You implement a telekinesis power in your story but you make the player unable to use it for himself. What kind of ""F-U Player"" what that? 

Bottom line: It is still good. It has some good moments, some nice easter eggs (love the David cameo) but it is so disappointing in so many ways that I can't love it. It lacks the depth of Life is Strange 1 and the charm of games like ""Tell Me Why"" or ""Life is Strange Before the Storm"". In the end just a mediocre story of 16 hours (or more if you want to explore different options). 

"
2212,"Life is Strange 2 is like a luxirous train that's on fire, the story itself and the brothers have a motivation that makes sense, but their personalities are bland and there aren't any consistent supporting characters to speak off, all the supporting characters come and go, this makes sense from a perspective based on realism but not from a storytelling perspective, all the side characters aren't worth memorising."
2213,"I actually liked this more than Life is Strange 1 and love how the endings actually depend on how you play and treat Daniel, opposed to LiS1 where you get through the whole game and basically pick 1 out of 2 endings in the last chapter.
Keen for LiS True Colors after playing this because it may have the potential to have even more endings.
I will say Daniel is an absolute piece of shit though but I really enjoyed playing as Sean. It was interesting to play a character with no powers."
2214,An awesome sequel and an amazing addition to the franchise
2215,"First of all, this game broke my heart. 

Second of all, Finn *-*"
2216,"Nope.
It's dry, cringe and nonesense."
2217,"This Game Is Not Free You Want To Purchase Their Episodes...
And This Game Is Not Fun.... But Episode One Story Was Amazing..."
2218,"Great game overall, but if I had a brother like this, I would've slice him into pieces, I swear to god."
2219,"this game gave me crippling depression 

9.5/10"
2220,"I would recommend, until I got to the part with the puma or cougar or whatever was it, honestly dont care.. about the franchise anymore. I absolutely dont understand why would you do this. It could have been good. Distasteful af. Update: Got to fourth episode. It was struggle, it is incredibly boring and distasteful. The whole game. I want to finish it, but it just feels like waste of time. It is like watching a really bad movie, but you paid for it, so it feels bad to leave the cinema. If you want to buy it because you liked the previous stuff, dont, its completely different thing."
2221,"Still hella shit, but at least you can force children to steal food"
2222,"I've played every Dontnod game (almost) in order. While they are always the types of games I look forward to, earlier games never fully capitilised. Even the praised Life Is Strange, while worthwhile was a bit of a disappointment for me. While it had good moments and good characters it felt too cliché at times and seemed to try and cater to a bigger audience by going a bit too over-the-top at time. It did find a big audience though and Dontnod has used that succes and financial independence to tell the stories they want to tell.
Each consecutive game dontnod develops is better than the last and slowly they turned into my now favorite developer that I would now blindly trust.
Life is Strange 2 is the result of a developer that is very much independent but is more confident then ever and dares to explore themes that are controversial without a judging any of the moral choices the player makes. No choice is fully right or wrong and that's often seperates the best games from the rest in this genre. There's a scene by the end of the game where you sit in your car and have to make an important decision. It's smart the developers give the player all the time in the world to make that decisions because I literally sat in my chair staring at the screen for 20 minutes and changed my mind multiple times before finally making a decision and still I question it. That's the type of experience Life is Strange 2 was for me."
2223,"Its a great story but I feel like there should be a game mode with more choices, and more endings or an update or something. And like each episode feels like you cannot avoid the cops wish you could be rewarded for being more cautious or for not stealing from the store, as the episodes feel like you do not have that much control like its fate. There should be a way to stay longer by not going to the Christmas market for example, or disguises like Daniel with the face mask and Sean maybe dressed as Santa or an Elf or something or just with a scarf and hood, and like there should be a way to message Lyla from the computer using an anonymous network, for example Linux Tails which is used by activists which could be provided by Brody since he's an activist anyway on Seans flash drive. This game is good but could be way better with updates."
2224,nice art and story
2225,the ending got me actually crying af lol
2226,"If you ever cried, if you were ever lied, if you were ever betrayed, if life was unfair, if you suffered for the so-called love, if you struggled and never succeeded, if you ever lost your courage, if you ever felt untouched, and if you think life is a carousel in which you don't pay for a trip then I can say life is really strange!

Life goes hand in hand with Life Is Strange!

Brillant Game Experience!!!"
2227,Great heart-wrenching story with likeable characters. Made me very emotional
2228,already played the full game on a different platform but this game is actually pretty good. life is strange 1 is way way way better though.
2229,"I really enjoyed the game overall. The visuals were very appealing and Sean as the main character very likable.

Two negative points:
- Daniel was very very annoying in episode 4 and 3 and I really started to hate him, but it got much better towards the end.
-Also disappointing was the totally incidental romance with Finn or Cassidy. I would have liked more depth or more romance here.

I look forward to the next Life is strange game. Thank you so much.
"
2230,Very Good
2231,"It's a very relevant and complex story, with realistic choices and characters. I really loved it! I'm not from the US so this felt like a trip. The visuals are beautiful, especially the scenic frames. The soundtrack is perfect and the voice actors did very well. The references from Life Is Strange 1 were fun. I'm a fan of this series, the developer and publisher. I really enjoyed this game!

There were some glitches in graphics and movement but I didn't really mind. I may have noticed them only because I played Tell Me Why before this one, which had far better definition and refined movement so I trust that the developers continue to improve."
2232,the GRAPHICS are top notch!!
2233,oops
2234,"I don't think I've ever played such a frustrating game like this one before. Felt genuine rage at a couple of scenes. Sean walks through hell for his brother and Daniel doesn't seem to have any character development. Why would you give me choices if he'd still react like an ungrateful brat regardless of what I'd choose? If the intention was for me to care for this kid, someone really messed up lmao. Anyway, I'll just join everyone and pretend this lazy writing never happened."
2235,yES
2236,"Good story not like first chapter of LIS, graphics are so improved compared to LIS 1, real reason I'm voting negative is there's some political ends that made me lose my interest in this chapter"
2237,"[h1] Summary [/h1]
(No spoilers) I don't typically leave reviews, but this is a game I cannot stop thinking about; as in writing this review is my way of processing how personally impactful this story was. In short, it's not a perfect game and it's not a perfect story for everyone, but it tries and in my opinion, it came close. I believe the steam reviews should be higher than reported, even with steam's irrelevant reporting detection. Not all, but a lot of reviews are either talking about the way this game was sold or how the game's facial animations aren't perfect or the like. While these are important considerations to purchasing a game, I submit to you that they don't matter because you buy this game for the absolutely exceptional story, like you would a book or movie; take that as you will. The fantastic soundtrack, the beautiful art direction, the top-notch cinematography, and the excellent voice acting push only serve to enhance the delivery of the heart-gripping, suspense-inducing, emotional story of Sean and Daniel.

[h1] The Story - The Characters [/h1]
The game is the story and the story is the game. As I said above, the story is exceptional, but the way each episode is structured as their own arc is a matter of contention, so I will cover it first for context. I won't go too into how this story places its story, but unlike its predecessor, the only characters that are consistently around you are the two brothers: Sean (the player) and his younger brother Daniel. That is not to say that surrounding characters are not well-written or interesting (they absolutely are), but rather that each episode follows a distinct 'arc' and there is no guarantee a character you develop a relationship with will be prominently present in the following episode. What this means is that your investment the story hinges heavily on the relationship between Sean and Daniel. A prominent side character in one episode may be relegated to a letter and a couple lines of internal monologue in the next. This is not true for all the side characters, but [b] it places the burden of the story's emotional crux on Sean and Daniel's relationship [/b]. This is not an inherently bad thing, but you'll find that those who struggled to emotionally connect with the two brothers' story will fail to emotionally connect with the game. 

[h1] The Story - The Brothers [/h1]
I, among most others it seems, found this story's heart to be in the relationship between Sean and Daniel and the player and Sean. While I have not experienced the loss, tragedy, and difficulty that Sean and Daniel face, I found that I saw my 16 year old self in Sean's identities (first generation citizen, older brother, desire for freedom). Though my family life is nothing like Sean's, I have found myself in a guardian-like role to my much younger brother when he was Daniel's age. The events of the game are drama and my brother never had supernatural abilities, but I did find that the brothers' dynamic and behaviors felt very authentic. Some reviewers have expressed their dislike of how irritating, disobedient, or immature Daniel is and how it was too annoying for them, and that is a risk this game runs. 9 year olds are annoying and so is Daniel, but at the same time, he is a child forced to grow up fast to survive and requires Sean's (and by proxy, your) guidance to grow. At the same time, Sean is a 16 year old with no idea how to be a father figure who is trying to do everything he can to protect Daniel and he sometimes make choices that seem wrong to you (or you will be asked to make choices where both options seem bad). These children are in exceptionally stressful circumstances, and they handle it just as any kid would at their age.

The most beautiful part of this story to me is watching Sean and Daniel grow and change as both individuals and brothers. You watch as Sean and Daniel learn more about each other and grow based on the choices you make. You get to see the way Daniel will struggle with his purpose and independence and how far Sean will go to protect Daniel (and vice-versa). But beyond that you'll begin to love the strong bond between Sean and Daniel that you get to witness in the little moments between them or the sketches Sean makes in his notebook, becoming invested in the characters. You'll find yourself sad at the moments when they talk of their father. You'll find your heart race as the brothers run from danger. You'll find yourself smiling at the moments when the brothers are truly happy. All of this to say, the bond between Sean and Daniel is not for everyone, but if it is for you, you'll love it.

[h1] Choices [/h1]
If you've played the original Life Is Strange, a tell-tale game, or another choice-based story game (i.e. Detroit: Become Human) you'll know that these aren't really games, but rather interactive stories where you make major (or minor) plot decisions and influence the trajectory of the story. A lot of people are criticizing how this game feels like some choices are arbitrary and don't matter or their influence on the ending is trivialized due to the game shoehorning you in to one of X many endings. Despite my love for this game and its story, I agree with this point somewhat. A lot of the choices you make are adding into what amount to hidden meters that track the characters' personality and the ending is influenced nearly solely by one of these meters. I argue that Life is Strange 1 fell into the same trap in many ways, with the ending being largely disconnected from the choices you made during the game. However, like Life is Strange 1, the magic of this story is not in how it ends, but the moments shared between the brothers and the world around them along the way is some of the most nuanced and beautiful storytelling I've seen in a while.

[h1] ""Difficult"" Themes [/h1]
However, some reviewers are complaining about the ""heavy-handedness"" of the difficult and politicized themes presented in this story. Racism, police brutality, xenophobia, organized religion, parental neglect and abuse, and homophobia are all among the themes explored in the 5 episodes of LiS 2 to varying degrees. I may have 'skin in the game', so to speak, when it comes to some of these topics, but [b] I never felt that this story focused so hard on these themes that is negatively affected the story nor were these themes trivialized to the point of meaninglessness [/b]. Much of the relevant criticism centers around the game, quote ""shoving these down your throat"" and I wholeheartedly disagree. While the challenges and danger the brothers face regarding racism, police brutality, and xenophobia may not be as dramatic as is the story for everyone in real life who has to deal with these issues, it is undeniable that the non-supernatural elements of the story have taken (and still do take) place in America. This is a story about two exceptional brothers in exceptional situations that are forced to navigate the inherently ""political"" nature of those circumstances. While there is significant coding and subtext to these circumstances, as there is in practically any story, much of the analysis of these topics are viewed through the lens of the character you play, a teenager who's father was murdered and who now keep what's left of his family together and safe. [b] To reiterate, the story is not preachy, full of constant victimization, or dominated by these ""political"" themes. Some people are just quick to pick out these topics as personal attacks. With the exception of the sparse but direct commentary on these circumstances from central characters, you will find nearly as much politicization in this story as you wish to get out of it.  [/b]

[h1] Everything Else [/h1]
This is basically an essay at this point so I'll just talk about everything else for the sake of completeness. The soundtrack/sound design is phenomenal. The environments are beautiful. The moments are wonderful. Please play this game."
2238,nice
2239,"Life Is strange 2 is a fantastic game. The game allows you to travel along with two brothers through a rough journey, forcing you to make hard decisions for the best outcome. The story really make you get attached to the characters and the people around them. This is probably one of my favorite games I've played thus far."
2240,good game
2241,Enjoyable tale.
2242,"What a boring game!!!
You mostly spent your time watching cutscene, sometime you got to walk around some kind of corridor and choosing something to say that ultimately doesn't really matter"
2243,woof
2244,"life is strange 2 is just as good if not better than the original. so many more choices, so much matters. i am emotionally ruined."
2245,"Life is Strange 2 is a great sequel to an already great game, and I must say, I was surprised at how they managed to make yet another story with such an emotional impact. Rather than being a direct sequel to the first game, following the same protagonists and such, this sequel takes place some years after the events that transpired at Arcadia Bay, and it follows two brothers, Sean and Daniel Diaz. The children of a Mexican immigrant to the United States, they had a fairly normal life until their dad gets shot by a police officer in a confusing event. This same event triggers Daniel's telekinetic powers, and now fearing the police, the brothers decide to flee to Mexico, the homeland of their father, while Daniel also needs to learn how to control his power.

Just like its predecessor, the story is divided into five episodes. Each episode sees the brothers in a new location, and has a sort of ""minor"" arc that is part of the overarching arc of the game. Within each episode, there'll be new characters to meet, some difficult choices to make, and chances for the brothers to get closer or further apart. You control Sean, the older brother, throughout the game, but your choices and actions still influence how Daniel acts, as he looks up to his big brother. It's up to you to teach Daniel what kind of person he should be, and this can have serious consequences by the end of the game.

The soundtrack is excellent, I'd say, and just like in the original Life is Strange, it consists of a mix of licensed tracks and original tunes. Visually, the game looks excellent; while it keeps a consistent tone with the previous game, the graphics have received a noticeable upgrade, not to mention that character animations look much more fluid. The environments you explore are all very beautiful as well, and since the game takes you through a good chunk of the USA, you get to see many different places. There's also less limitations than in the previous game in terms of exploration, with fewer loading screens between areas.

All things considered, I must say I really liked Life is Strange 2; as much as the first game, and so I can easily recommend it. Here's looking forward to True Colors!"
2246,"Overall, it was a great experience. Different from the first game, or Before the Storm, which I usually appreciate from sequels. The visuals and animation improved, that's notable. The soundtrack remains as great as the other Life is Strange games. Although I didn't get attached to the characters as I got to the first games (except Cassidy, Brody, [spoiler]and David! I got happy that he made an appearance![/spoiler]), I found the story quite interesting, and a bit sad when it comes to some matters that might touch the reality cases, especially something such as racism in USA."
2247,I didn't know how attached to i'd get to this game it's world story and characters! I love the first life is strange but this story grips me so much more it's about family and brotherhood trusting the kindness of strangers and that the world isn't just a bleak nightmare most of us see it as. That being said lessons are also learned from those actions trust can sometimes be bent and broken. You see the progression of not only the main characters but all characters in the world. Something about this story really hits home with me and keeps dragging me back or i'll think about a moment from this game. Playing through a second time due to the hype of the new game coming out reminded me why i love this game so much. Life is strange as a whole will always have a place in my heart regardless if i don't agree with some of the story choices it's still a wonderful game with a wonderfully beautiful dark world!
2248,Another master piece from Dontnod.  Worth every penny.
2249,"*Did you choose to sacrifice Arcadia Bay?*

PTSD kicks in..."
2250,"Awesome game, deep story, makes you really connect to the characters."

2253,"Boring. I couldn't get into the story unlike the first LIS which was far better game.

If you like that kind of games you will find LIS 2 an ok position to play but don't expect anything special.

Story is meh - characters you meet change every episode - you can't attach to any of them. Only characters are main character and his little brother who is really annoying sometimes.

Also wherever you go there is almost no good ending to your actions - something always goes wrong.

Overall pretty mediocre game, buy it only if you like that kind of games. If you expect this to be LIS proper sequel - don't bother - it's not.

[b]5/10[/b]"
2254,Very great game
2255,I finished this game two months ago and haven't stopped thinking about it on and off since. Just incredible all around; beautiful visuals and the story and characters are really engaging. Plus the first episode is free so you can always give it a try! :')
2256,"This game is all about story, not gameplay. Yes my time on this game is low because I can't bring myself to finish PLAYING it but I WATCHED all the stories, possible romances, branches, endings, etc. It is AWESOME.
Here is the thing. If you want to have a wonderful, deep, emotional story, and gameplay is not a big concern, this is for you. I still recommend this game because it is a narrative centered game and it severs the purpose well. It has a way better story than LiS1 and before the storm.
But with YouTube and all that I found myself having a hard time actually playing it. The gameplay could be too slow at times and watching the videos is easier and faster, and you can find all possible choices online. I don't have much time for games now and watching videos really doesn't make the story less awesome so why not?
I guess if you play the full game it is going to be way better. Just be prepared sometimes it could be dragging and kind of boring when there is not a major plot going on."
2257,One of the most beautiful games I played in my life <3
2258,Game is really fun and pretty emotional for me and probably to some streamers I betcha. I prefer any one to buy this game. Super entertaining!
2259,"The buildup towards the last episode was a good one, the endings are emotional trainwrecks. 
Daniel is most annoying the first 2-3 episodes, it got better after that. 
Great voice actors and the visuals are stunning, the story is great!

As for LiS 1+BoS and Tell Me Why, this could have the undertitle: Prepare to Cry, a lot.
"
2260,"Life is Strange 2 I would say takes the franchise in an interesting direction following 2 brothers who have a serious accident causing them to have to flee to Mexico for sanctuary. The game is one big road trip dealing with all kinds of real world problems, racists, survival, etc. It’s a cool concept and is very similar to TellTale’s TWD games where you have to try and raise and be a moral compass for your younger brother and teach him right from wrong as you progress through the game and will ultimately shape who he is and impact your ending. 

+Episodic and you can buy the episodes individually so you aren’t forced to buy the entire game at once like the previous
+First episode is free
+Steam Cloud
+Cool decision making game where you can pick from multiple choices in dialogue and have major decisions you have to decide every episode that changes your game as well as the new aspect of raising and being a moral compass of your younger brother and teaching him right from wrong will also heavily influence the outcome of situations in your game and gives off very similar vibes to TellTale’s TWD Seasons 1 & 4
+Collectibles and a mode to get collectibles with ease instead of having to replay through the entire game again
+Lots of notes with background of the characters and locations
+Several sort of free roam moments where you can walk around and talk and interact with the world which at times can affect how events play out later
+Can see your choices at the end of every episode with the percentage of majority of players along with being able to see the percentage based on your friends list. Additionally this game goes more into detail with pretty much every decision you made instead of TellTale whom would only focus on major decisions as well as how your brother is changing on your decisions with him and who he is turning into
+Nice art style also I would say that the graphics have definitely upgraded significantly from the previous game. Several cinematic moments overlooking certain locations just look so awesome.
+Very cinematic 
+Option to disable copyright music
+All the collectibles you find throughout the game you can put onto your backpack and wear and show off
+Several cameos and references from characters and locations from the first game
+Lots of more exploration and minor decisions 
+Lots of connections to real world issues, politics, actual media, etc. aka Daniel keeps talking about Minecraft lol
+Multiple endings

-I would say that the animations of the characters' movements have definitely improved a lot compared to the first two games where they were super robotic and slow and looked really bad. The only thing I feel like was still bad in this game was the lip syncing which is just so off several times that the characters mouths don’t even open or barely move like they’re a ventriloquist. 

I really loved the first game so much and felt that the before the storm pre sequel was a cool continuation and explanation on certain aspects of the similar story. I don’t have any problems with a set of new characters in a new location however, I just didn’t like the story as much as the first game. 2 brothers having to struggle to survive and make their way across the country was an interesting plot but I just didn’t like it as much as the sort of rewind, time travel, detective, like story of the first game that was set in the same location with the same characters. This game is on the road and every episode is a new location with new characters. I just didn’t really like the plot so much and or how every episode was somewhere new with new people. I think that the concept of trying to raise your younger brother and teach him right from wrong is awesome especially with how he has the powers now making things more serious but, I just think that the concept of them running from the police to Mexico idk I just didn’t like as much as the premise of the first game which just seemed more cool i guess??? Not saying I disliked this game, I just didn’t really like the direction it took."
2261,"WOW, what an incredible story, absolutely captivating. After suffering a great loss, two brothers are forced to run away and head to the only place they might feel safe, their father's ancestral home in Mexico. Along the way they suffer trauma, heartache, reunions, companionship, happiness, sadness and most of all, they develop an incredible bond that is tested to its limits, but ultimately strengthened by the realisation that they have to rely absolutely on each other. This is essentially a story about family bonds and how far you will go to protect those you love, and I was absolutely blown away by it. The relationship that develops between the two boys, I'm not ashamed to admit, brought a tear to my eye on a couple of occasions.  The scenery is amazing, really capturing the great expanses and variety of the US landscapes they travel through on their road-trip through Trump's America - it doesn't shy away from the racism and bigotry that they encounter along the way - which is likely what people are referring to when they mention its political tones, but this is handled well. Probably the best story line I've ever encountered in a game ... breathtaking  !!!!"
2262,A moving and in equal measures heartwarming and heartbreaking story.
2263,Really nice visuals and a really touching story! Would definitely recommend to friends who like story rich tell tale games!
2264,"First ep is free and a must play, great story"
2265,good
2266,"choices don't matter too much, first episode leads you in with a nice long episode getting you invested with the story and the characters and the other episodes are short, boring, and a big let down from the first series as each episode following the first puts you in a small sand box as the whole episode."
2267,"- This game offends the player over and over. When you have control over characters you do everything to save them but when the cutscene starts they screw everything up, complicate things and destroy your struggles to straighten everything out. (Similar to late seasons of The Walking Dead). It doesn't give any possibility to make things right. it only escalates problems with every scene.
- I don't like how this game portrays and shoves down my throat a stereotypical immigrant image: can't follow simple orders: ""be quiet"", ""don't move"", ""on the ground"" only making things worse. Running away for no reason when not guilty of anything and many other illogical decisions. Thanks for letting me understand why people don't like immigrants.
- Paused and ALT+TABbed game uses ridiculous level of CPU and GPU making me shut it down when switching to something else, but at the same time it plays unskippable cutscenes when started again.
- Overall very nice graphics and pleasant visual style but the plot is rubbish, doesn't make sense and is not as god as LiS1"
2268,"includes politics, meh"
2269,"Wow.. just wow. 
I don't know how it took me this long to play this game but I'm glad I finally did.
This was a heartbreakingly beautiful and bittersweet experience that I will cherish forever.
Thank you DONTNOD."
2270,fucks you right in the ass!!
2271,"life is strange always have crazy stories! i love how the story goes from life is strange 1
and i always excited on every new released Life is strange
if you love game when player get to pick the choices of the ending, you must play every Life is Strange !"
2272,"No Spoilers, I loved the overall message of this game and would recommend it to people who want to give it a try. However, the first game is a bit easier to get into, and the pacing is a bit easier than this game. 

My one big criticism is a ""This [b]didn't[/b] happen, and I wish it did"" large spoiler, so view that at your own risk.
[spoiler]The ending I found a little shallow and disappointing, to the point that it was the worst part of the game for me. I really thought all the people I'd met along the way would maybe show up, but no.[/spoiler]

Regardless, I'd still give it an 8/10. Play it!"
2273,
2274,good game good story
2275,it's good
2276,"Simply one of the best games I ever played in my life! If you are a fan of the LiS games, buy this one without any thoughts, you will not be disappointed. Definitively recommended!"
2277,"The entire game is basically artwork. So many amazing views, places for sight seeing. In terms of game play, making the right decisions is super important and [i]Actually[/i] impacts the game. I haven't fully finished the game yet, but I'm just getting to EP4 and it's a thrill!"
2278,"I played this game cause of the first game. And it's fine by me. The graphic is clearly better. The gameplay too.

Spoiler Alert!
.
.
.
There is just one plot hole for me, that is Daniel's Power. Too OverPowered. Yet, Becomes a waste in every ending that you got. Right, when i think of it, the first game did the same thing too. Nvm then."
2279,It might not have (a) great ending(s) but it's a great journey nevertheless.
2280,"Like all the Life is Strange games this one was deeply emotional and at times very tough to go through. Language and content is heavy. It's an important story though. Understanding prejudice and literally walking a mile in someone else's shoes. Worth a play through. Also the visuals, while still in the somewhat simple painter style of the series, is far more refined and polished than the earlier games."
2281,"Politics is a part of real life why not put it in a game? Just because it has a open minded view to things like the LGBTQ+ community and is mostly left leaning gamer bros don't wanna ear it, well then don't play the game. But your ignorance is stopping you from enjoying a great well made beautiful game."
2282,"This game requires a player who understands interactive stories.  This is not for those who seek action based game play.  This is for those who seek action based choices which immerse you into the great experience that is the Life is Strange world.  Only advice I have playing Dontnod games is, keep an open mind to the views they place in their stories, it's just a story.  Buy it and enjoy!"
2283,The first episode of Life is Strange 2 is very long drawn and takes up a lot of time. After that the game is a worthy follower of Life is Strange. Just don't expect any happy ending.
2284,"Absolutely beautiful, captures the hardships of racism, bigotry, hatred, and loss extremely well. The relationships created throughout the game were heartwarming and memorable. 10/10"
2285,The story is awesome. The music is great. Experienced few glitches but overall such a soothing game to play quietly.
2286,this is fun. DAD DIES
2287,play
2288,very immersive gameplay!
2289,Fuckin amazing but it now.
2290,The parts where it doesn't have shitty politics are good. here's a tip for game makers DON'T PUT POLITICS IN YOUR GAMES
2291,So so amazing. I have no words.
2292,This game is really good and I fell in love with it
2293,"it just amazing, the story themovement everything is good. the storyline makes you happy makes u cry and it has more consequences thats more important thing. you can learn from this game true life lessons of yourselves. 
i will definitily suggest everyone to play this game."
2294,c
2295,Great game!! no cons
2296,"I cannot recommend this enough. I've only finished episode 2 at the time of this review. And it has a gripping story that, to me, is all too relate-able and has done nothing but keep me on the edge of my seat. The game will also recommend you to play the side game 'The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit' and I would too. It aids to the story elements and even is found in the main game. 

Oh -- And don't forget your tissues. You're going to need them for this game. A lot of them."
2297,cool
2298,"My heart hurts after playing this. It was totally worth it though. Don't think, just buy it and play it."
2299,"It's great but all this would've been prevented from the start; typical UE 4 graphics, interesting plot, fitting but with copyright music. To what it feels like playing, it feels like on the run from everything, from the cops, from strangers, from loved ones, from mostly anything. Life is Strange 2 is completely different from the first installment as this one is directed to a new character's power of telekinesis, or just moving anything around at hand and free will, not just that but it also tests the players of how our choices impacts throughout the game. It impacts through the brotherhood and morality between Sean and Daniel, brotherhood, gives Sean the opportunity to keep themselves both together as brothers, morality, gives Daniel, the younger brother, for doing what's right or wrong and Sean giving him the benefit of the doubt for the choices he has to make.

For the episodes and for a spoiler-proof review, I'll just oversimplify of what I can review on.

Episode 1 was very troubling and the accidental cause of a new adventure to start anew. 8/10
Episode 2 was wholesome and entertaining; Daniel having a new friend and Sean trying to keep things low-key. 9/10
Episode 3 was quite questionable and the option left to do is survive and make money criminally. 9/10
Episode 4 was depressing and dramatic; Sean having a traumatic incident and the [i]revenge[/i] was too much. 7/10
Episode 5 had many endings depending on the impact of the story and the last choice to make. 8/10

Overall, I'd give it a 7.8/10"
2300,"THE CINEMATIC SCENE, THE MUSIC, THE CHARACTER'S BOND. EVERYTHING 10/10."
2301,"After finishing the game I cried for a week. When I thought I was ready to move on, hey looks like I'm crying again!
This might be biased because I'm kinda extra emotional to brotherhood stories though.

The choices you pick IMO gives more impact than the first game, and you get more high consequences choices as well compared to the first game.

Great game, this changes something in me."
2302,"So far, the Diaz brothers continue the lore of Life is Strange with a modern American Odyssey. With both moments that move your soul and give you an adrenaline rush, the story of the wolf brothers is another exciting adventure. OOOOOWWWOOOOOO!

Update: 
(Spoilers Ahead)
The words you see above were written by me after completing the first episode. Now that I have completed the game, I have a few things to add. I'll start by saying that after playing the first episode, I would've given this game almost 5 stars out of 5. Now, I'd give it 2 stars out of 5. Why? Because after the first episode, this game went from a modern American Odyssey about brotherhood and adversity to just blatant liberal propaganda. I hate to admit it, but I was really let down by this game. 

I was hoping this game would focus on Sean and Daniel's brotherhood but the game diverts from this path more than frequently to try and push a political agenda that isn't subliminal at all. This really annoyed me because....

1. I don't play games to learn about politics. I play them to have fun, experience something and learn something powerful on a deeper level. Something as shallow as politics is really just a setup for a shallow story. In recent years, video games have proven to be excellent story-telling devices. Utilizing it as a device for propaganda only contributes to so many controversies that I play games to ignore.

2. As an American, I can't help but feel like this game is a punch in the face to anyone who isn't American, which is really ironic when you see what this game is really about. Lots of things in this game can't be properly understood unless you live/grew up in the USA. That didn't really matter in the first game, the USA was just the setting, not part of a sub-plot or (poor) subliminal message about the game. 

3. After playing the first game, my take-away was that LiS is about humanity and covers themes such as relationships, conscience, mental illness and living with the decisions you make. These are deep topics that any human being can learn, understand and should even know. The first game brilliantly tackled several of them. LiS 2 settled for something less, something that's very ""on the surface"". The themes of humanity I hoped for were instead filled with themes of social construct, conventional lifestyle, Liberalism, LGBTQ+, patriarchy, critical-race theory, religion, immigration, racism and utilizing social rebel tropes to prove their points. All while trying to say that brotherhood, racism and survival were still the core lessons. 

I have no issues with any of these, but the game keeps abandoning its ""core"" lessons to try and tackle every single one of these themes. In Ep. 3, Daniel's resentment of Sean is a blatantly obvious excuse for their themes of brotherhood to take a backseat so the game can explore everything except that. Did Jacob have to be gay as well as a Cult Defector? I feel like that was just one of many examples of the game trying to make a point. Karen was another example. Not only did she abandon her very stereo-typically ""old gen white, privileged and Christian parents"" but she gave up her life as a mother because she didn't feel ""free which is what America is all about"". Well No Shit Sherlock! Getting married and having kids means sacrificing those things and you do it out of love. It doesn't matter what the game says or portrays, Karen leaving her family was a selfish decision and no love was present when it was made. When Sean asked Karen in Ep. 5 if she regretted abandoning them, I could've forgiven her if she simply said ""yes."" But no, rather than adding some nuance and character depth, she had to pull some hippie nonsense and say ""I promised to live without regrets"". 

4. I loved Sean as a character, but I feel he was done dirty by his story. I would be friends with him if he were real. He draws, listens to music, plays video games and he has an amount of depth that I can appreciate. But it becomes apparent after the prologue that he was written to be nothing more than a Hispanic damsel in distress. He's written to be a weak victim, a victim of racism, of a ""broken"" system, of racist people. Honestly, half of this game just forces you to watch Sean get his ass kicked because he's half Hispanic. There's even an ending where he's killed by the police on the 4th of July. Seriously? This is clearly just there to drive it's ideas forward using your emotions which can only go so far. Sean's character arc is only more painful to watch because its clear that all the bad things that happen to him are because of the writing, not the plot. Sean's a great character and he had a lot of potential, but they threw it all away because he's Hispanic and they have to prove a point. If you ask me, that's just racist on its own and proves absolutely nothing.

In conclusion, I'd give this game 2 stars out of 5 or 3 stars out 10. I sincerely have no issues with several topics in this game, but the execution of them was just poorly done and didn't really get through to me. At the end of the day, there's still some intense, moving and heartfelt scenes and the voice acting is brilliant. This is just my opinion and I simply don't like politics in video games. I vote for whatever/whoever aligns with my conscience, regardless of party affiliation. With this mindset, I was bound to not like this game because it clearly pushes a politcal agenda. 

Now, if you are involved in politics and are part of the Liberal movement, than by all means, play this game. You'll most likely love it and it will probably be your most favorite game in the world. I'll recommend LiS 2 simply because I'm more than confident that there's people out there who will love this game and I won't let my opinion deter them from experiencing something they'll find amazing."
2303,"Really loving the game, the playstyle, everything, everything matters, choices and decisions, most bugs are fixed, and i love that your minds just dont cut off when you exit the picture or something youre focused on. Def recommended, awesome game, everything is awesome!"
2304,"Another great storytelling game in the series!
Update after finishing the game: It's really worth it to play it through to the end, even if it has some problems in chapter 3 and 4. Looking forward to the next game in the series!"
2305,"i genuinly hate this game, episode 1 was so good, i had so much hope but then it just fell flat on this face, i did not care for the characters, the powers were hardly in the game at all, its like they wanted to make a teen drama but needed to smush powers into it just for that side of the fandom to enjoy. episode 1 was good, 2 was boring, 3 was eh, 4 was eh, the first half of 5 was really boring and then 2nd half was eh, i also got a bad ending which made me hate the game even more, (spoilers including the ending:) [spoiler]I hated it even more that you cant just go back to that scene and pick the other ending, and i find it really stupid that to get the good ending that i wanted, you have to be an a**hole and be a terrible person. and istg daniel really got on my nerves that entire game like i wanted im to die, especially with my ending where i surrendered but then he gets angry and takes the wheel, he is just a little shit and i hate him[/spoiler] so yeah the first game was a lot better

2306,YES

2308,Horrible
2309,I think this game/series is really good and definitely would be fun for new players or someone looking for a new game to play the thing that I've noticed a lot is that the story is great and very interesting almost like a thriller and made me wanna keep playing more the graphics are also perfect i like the designs for the characters as well I will definitely play more.
2310,it soo good :)
2311,"No one creates beautiful, cozy towns/houses/rooms/conversations you just want to luxuriate, relax and contemplate in better than DontNod. 

I'm loving LiS2 and its pacing. So good for the soul.

Edit: Just finished. REALLY enjoyed it. So much stronger than Life Is Strange 1 for me. And a really satisfying ending that respected my choices. A+!!!!!!"
2312,good ggame
2313,a big downgrade from the first 2 games.
2314,i love this series.
2315,Good gaming stories aren't dead yet ;)
2316,"Aweful woke garbage. I am hispanic and this game was disturbing, extremely racist in a casual way just because it was against whites. Every villain is white in this game, and the only ""good"" white is a WHITE LIBERAL who becomes the savior of the -oh poor defenseless Latinos-. SO CONDESCENDING! 

Latinos get along with whites real well, and for the most part we have no beef with them and I object being portrayed this way. As the eternal victims of ""white devils"". 

I will not be buying this series any longer. This was a woke fantasy for white liberals. Nothing else."
2317,"this game got me so emotional at some times and overall was the best storytelling for me.

if i were you i would get it if you are a story person."
2318,"Goodness, this is such a great game!"
2319,Very nice game
2320,I'm sad.
2321,very good
2322,"Wonderful ""interactive movie""!"
2323,"nice game

2324,"I haven't played through the original LiS, but after seeing gameplay of it, knew I'd really enjoy playing through the series myself. The story line in episode 1 was shocking & gripping & sad. The story manages to tie in the small concerns of daily life into these bigger underlying tragedies so well; the small references to LiS 1 and the Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit are so fun and make the game feel even more realistic. 

I was interested to see the main changes here in LiS 2 in having a companion with you as well (Sean's little brother Daniel) - it feels v 'of the time' in game dev trends but really works in terms of changing things up with how the choices you make impact the game. Your decisions directly impact your brother as well as you; it feels more direct than the 'knock on' effects of your choices on others in LiS 1, because you are directly tasked with taking care of Daniel here.

The graphics and visuals of this game are phenomenal. Beautiful soundtrack, too. 
Overall - this is exactly the kind of game I love."
2325,"This game is more dynamic than LIS 1 you can actually choose to play an evil or good play through and avoid a bunch of stuff. I found it to be as good as the original and I feel like this is a good representation of the franchise. Many say this game feels disconnected but I think that was the point as two brothers struggle to make it on their own and you meet people who change your life for the better or worst because the journey is the story its not about staying in one spot for so long like in LIS 1 I think its a different interpretation of this franchise I liked it alot.   

What I liked:
1. great choice trees with dynamic choice because Daniel can refuse to do alot thus prompting you to work hard to keep the story in your favour. 
2. romance options 
3. game is largely dependent on you're ability to notice stuff that will have massive impacts on your gameplay later 
4. episodes 3, 4 and 5 were amazing 

What I didn't like 
1. controls are very different and difficult to use at times I found myself clicking the wrong option sometimes because they are so sensitive 
2. hard to find collectables in this game 
3. Daniel is annoying as fuck at some points and sometimes even changed the story to his way because he refused to do things I wanted as the actual player, I guess its a double edge blade because it keeps it dynamic but the story was not how I would have liked it would to turn out 
4. Episodes 1 and 2  are very dry for the most part and There was not alot of drama until episodes 3, 4 and 5. I feel like episodes 1 and 2 were only there to set up weather Daniel would listen you in later episodes"
2326,"I am an immigrant to the US, a native Spanish speaker, and my politics are left of center. I was also an older brother without a father, and I am now a parent. And yet, I had a far easier time having an emotional connection to the characters of LiS 1, and its first sequel, than this game.

The first episode was fine. Not great, but at least fine: But the fact that the game is designed to let most characters behind from episode to episode makes the game have no sense of place: It's a long array of introductions and goodbyes that didn't resonate with me in the slightest. And the two brothers, the only characters that stay, make no sense anyway. Daniel is a poor caricature of a child, while the choices that I was given as his older brother never made any sense to me: The game is full of binary decisions where I don't see why in the world I'd choose either.

Therefore, the game can quickly turn into a pointless slog, where it's not just that choices don't matter, but that they appear arbitrary. How would character I don't care about react to this other character I don't care about's actions? Oh no, this other character that you don't care about is angry at Shawn but by the end of the episode, they'll be forgotten, so who cares?

So yes, the game left me nodding off. I've played dozens of old school adventure games, and many a modern visual novel: For me, this is one of the worst."
2327,"EN: The definition I would give to Life is Strange 2 is ""Life Lesson"". The game portrays many topics discussed in the world, shows us the pain of losing things around us, and also teaches us the value of the friendships and family that we have around us, it's hard to say if it's as good as the first game from franchise, but it sure is a game as perfect as, fantastic art direction, and extremely well-crafted story, congratulations to all responsible team, a work of art. If you happen to have the opportunity to play, don't hesitate to buy it, but I warn you that if you get emotional easily, beware, Sean Diaz and Daniel Diaz captivate us from start to finish, so hit the road!

FR: La définition que je donnerais à Life is Strange 2 est « Leçon de vie ». Le jeu dépeint de nombreux sujets discutés dans le monde, nous montre la douleur de perdre des choses autour de nous, et nous enseigne également la valeur des amitiés et de la famille que nous avons autour de nous, il est difficile de dire si c'est aussi bon que le premier jeu de franchise, mais c'est certainement un jeu aussi parfait que, une direction artistique fantastique et une histoire extrêmement bien conçue, félicitations à toute l'équipe responsable, une œuvre d'art. Si vous avez l'occasion d'y jouer, n'hésitez pas à l'acheter, mais je vous préviens que si vous vous sentez facilement émotif, méfiez-vous, Sean Diaz et Daniel Diaz nous captivent du début à la fin, alors prenez la route !"
2328,"10/10 - this game is amazing, in my TOP 10 games guaranteed.

1. the connection and dialogue between the brothers is very natural and realistic, gives you a babysitter role which many dont like but which fits very good as he is ""your"" little brother.

2. soundtrack and visuals are amazing

3. ending is affected after all your choices and what path your game goes is fully depending on your decitions"
2329,Good Storyline
2330,"A game with tons of potential, but one that ultimately left me dissapointed.
Two brothers running away from the cops, trying to reach Mexico.
It starts off great. You're confronted with all these tiny moral dillemas.
Should you spend the little money you still have on a candy bar your little brother likes?
Or should you spend it on cheap (but boring) food that will last you a while longer?
Or should you just steal the stuff, considering you don't have that much money left and it doesn't seem like you're in a position to earn any.
I was completely immersed in the game and carefully considered my options...
... only to find out it doesn't really matter. The game skips forward in time way too often and each time you have a completely different amount of money in your wallet - usually more.

In the meanwhile you're training Daniel, your younger brother, to use his powers.
This seems cool at first, but over time Daniel turns into a brat with a tendency to get himself into trouble, even if you're playing the good guy and picked all the right choices.
Basically this game is you trying to babysit Daniel and trying to figure out all the right moves so you're still on the good side of this little psychopath of a brother that you're trying to manage.
At one point you even lose your eye because of him, which we're supposed to be fine with.
He turns to be much tougher that you and you can't do much about it, because you have zero powers. Yes, you got that right. The character you play is only capable of talking and choosing. Nothing else.

The game has this sort of minigame, with your character drawing landscapes and people. I hoped this was sort of foreshadowing that Sean would find out he had powers too. I found myself wondering if it might be telepathy, to go back to the places he drew. Nope. You're just Sean, the babysitter, trying to figure out the perfect answer to everything and not trying to piss off your psychopath brother who will throw tree trunks in your way or rip your eye out if you make him mad.

Oh and let me just talk about the ending for a bit... (Spoilers are up next)
[spoiler] At the end of the game, your little brother still doesn't give a ""hoot"" about you. After all the trouble you've went to, getting to Mexico, he tries to manipulate you into pulling over and handing yourself over to the cops... which turns into Sean getting all of the jailtime, Daniel getting zero of the jailtime. And that is supposed to be the ""good"" ending. I chose to get my ass to Mexico and this little psychopath jumps out of the car, choosing to stay in the US of A, after you've went through all this effort trying to get there.  [/spoiler]"
2331,"Overall a great game, but not as good as LIS 1. 
*Chapter 4 makes me really hate Daniel, Devs you don't have to create a such abrupt dramatic scene such as "" Daniel doesn't wanna leave the church"". It's just too cringe and illogical, I understand Daniel is 9 yo but even 9 yo should not be this kind of stupid.*
Love my game ending tho. 8/10"
2332,This game is just straight up perfect.
2333,"THIS GAME MADE ME BREAK DOWN WAY TO MUCH LIKE THIS SHIT MESSES U UP MENTALLY LIKE ITS A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP YOU ALWAYS COME BACK FOR MORE. ALSO SEAN IS FINE AF 

but if im being for real this is such a good game and the small details and the way you feel so immerersed in the game makes a huge diffrence I would seriously sell my soul to play this for the first time again.


I FINISHED THIS GAME OMFG THIS GAME MADE ME BAWL MY EYES I FELT TO ATTACHED TO THESE CHARACTERS IT WAS UNREAL I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PLAY THIS AGAIN THE PURE BOND THAT SEAN AND DANIAL IS TRUELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD STRIVE FOR IN LIFE. OVERALL THIS IS THE BEST GAME IV EVER PLAYED"

2338,"Okay...My Only Problems

1-Really? Ya HAVE To Kill ALL Of Arcadia? What About Kate Marsh?! I Get The Fact WHY Max And Chloe Ain't Involved...But What About THE OTHER Characters?! Well, At least True Colors Is Gonna Tell Us WHO Survived.

2-Why Wasn't This Called Life Is Strange Brotherhood? I Feel Like That's What This Game Is About! Brotherhood! Why Couldn't This Be Called Life Is Strange Brotherhood? That Would've Left A MUCH Better Impact Than What We Got! They Could've ATLEAST Changed The Title. Like I Said Before, I Get It. New Story. No Max And Chloe. (Mentioned, But No Cameo, But Still) But Still! They Could've Given This Game A New Title! Not Life Is Strange 2! I Get It, You Guy's Wanna Tell A Brand New Story. But Honeslty...It Should've Been Called Life Is Strange Brotherhood. Just Sayin.(Whoever Sees This Review, Feel Free To Rant At Me.)

Eitherway Though, This Game Gets A 8/10"
2339,"life is strange 2 is essentially a deranged road trip with two brothers. the plot and characters are admirable, it really hooks the audience in with how relatable the characters are. it even has scenes relating to the first game with max and chloe. 
i would absolutely recommend to those who are interested in adventure and story-based games. there are multiple endings which proves that your choices do make a decision, right from the start as well. sure, there are glitches, but i would do anything to play this game again for the first time."
2340,"i have played the game like 5 times all the way through and i'm still not bored of it yet. thats good game design if you ask me. plus, the main protag is..... a lil.... you know.... SO BUY THE GAME!1!!!1!!!"
2341,sad
2342,"I feel empty. Traumatized. I'm completely different now. I played the whole series, now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel completely useless. It was a great time. But this game put it to another level. I never felt anything like this in a game. Thanks for this lifelesson game"
2343,"Life is strange
The system's bullshit
I sobbed like a little bitch"
2344,Man that ending broke my heart
2345,"Wow, Just wow. 
If you like a very interactive game which is emotionally attaching look no further! this is by far one of the best interactive games i have ever played. 
Be warned it can become addictive, but its worth it!"
2346,i can't stop crying
2347,"I know some people would say they don't like the story because of the racism, but I really think it's a mind opener for the real stuff going on in the world. The gameplay is something I really like a lot more than LIS 1. I like the scroll when you are on the mouse other than seeing my mouse sometimes in the game, so thats good. Not to mention, I kind of like the choices i have in the game. Even though some of the choices in LIS2 may have less than LIS1, its simple and striaght to the point lol"
2348,While the gameplay doesn't keep up with the original one it makes it up with the story where the choises appear to have a much higher impact for the end.
2349,even better than the first one. highly recommended
2350,"Really good storytelling game, maybe even better than life is strange 1."
2351,yup
2352,IT'S A FUN GAME TO PLAY AND YES
2353,nice
2354,absolutely amazing. i cannot express my love for the game series.
2355,"good story, it definitely knows how to get you emotional. but strangely, being the better person ended me up in an ending i definitely did not want. i replayed some parts for lower morality, but did not reach the end because it felt too long to replay. still a good experience, recommended!"
2356,"Very good game. Really liked the idea, the story, the characters. Decided to play it since the 3rd one is coming out and i never started on the second game and it was just amazing. Worth every cent spent."
2357,such a good story
2358,amazing.  inspiring.  beautiful.  motivational.
2359,pay for only 1 episode. wow what a great deal
2360,"How the same people who made the terrific Life Is Strange made this garbage is beyond me.    This is just liberal talking points wrapped up in a game.   We hate cops, we hate white people, we want weed, we hate rules blah blah blah."
2361,"kinda cringe, but generally decent"
2362,Overall little expensive but worth.
2363,"way better graphics and lip syncing than the first game but unlike lis1 each chapter kind of has its own story and plot which im not a huge fan of. overall its a pretty great game and generally lives up to its prequel, would recommend."
2364,"my opinion reviwe

Story: 8/10
Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics: (2021) 8/10
Price: I bought it for 13€ so 10/10
all in one: 8/10

it's good for 15 hours of fun"

2366,Eww they put Nitai Gaash in this game.
2367,I wasn't convinced by the games' trailer at first but am now glad I gave it a try. Might even prefer this game over Lis1 & Before The Storm. Very enjoyable game with a good storyline and the soundtrack great as always in the LIS-games back. 10/10 can recommend!
2368,"not as good as the first life is strange, but still a pretty great story driven game.
i just hate the dialogues tho.. just like before the storm, the dialogues are too slow.. why they talk so slow ?! too much time just to finish one scene."
2369,"I believe the first season of [i]Life Is Strange[/i] has one of the best stories in video games, and I wasn't sure how a second season could top that. Well, after finishing all five episodes I can safely say that it couldn't – but even so, this was a great game that I had tons of fun playing with.

Trust me, the journey of the Diaz brothers is one you absolutely have to take if you like narrative-heavy, choice-driven adventures. It's emotional, heartbreaking, powerful and full of important themes. The supernatural element might not be as exciting as Max's time travel abilities, but in exchange we get many different locations all around the US, while the protagonists meet all kinds of colorful, interesting characters who all have their own stories, their own joys and tragedies to tell. It's a familiar formula on a much grander scale.

Don't expect anything revolutionary or unique from the gameplay or graphics, but if you're here for the story, then you won't be disappointed. As far as I'm concerned, I would have preferred a direct sequel to Max's adventure, but I guess that's finished, and we already got a prequel for it, and all in all I enjoyed this brand new chapter in the [i]Life Is Strange[/i] universe."
2370,kid = kid
2371,"I loved it but come on, why does it have to hurt me so bad"
2372,Great story
2373,"Amazing game feels like u playing and watching the series on Netflix, greate music director and a lot more.... they know what they're doing"
2374,"[i]Life is Strange 2[/i] wasn't necessarily a bad game, however it wasn't a very good one either.

The game makes many different choices than the original [i]Life is Strange[/i]. Instead of focusing on the same cast of characters, you follow your two core protagonists as they travel the United States, being introduced to a new cast of side characters every episode. Instead of the player-protagonist having the super power, it is the deuteragonist, your brother, who has the power. And instead of your decisions as the player-protagonist having the determinant effects on the majority of events, you share determination with your brother, who has his own say on what happens.

Although some will point to these factors as why this game wasn't quite compelling as the first, it's not the full story. These differences make for a very compelling narrative. The first episode was truly excellent in setting up the main conflict of the story. Like the first game, [i]Life is Strange 2[/i] explores hot-button social issues in a very real convincing manner, and the prospect of having to help your brother grow up and navigate those issues for himself was captivating.

The main trouble with these changes is that it makes the game float or sink depending on how compelling you find the relationship with the deuteragonist Daniel. Where the first [i]Life is Strange[/i] had the rewind mechanic, you have daniel. Where the first [i]Life is Strange[/i] had likeable side characters you could build relationships with, you have Daniel. Where the first [i]Life is Strange[/i] had an overarching mystery for you to solve, you have Daniel.

However your relationship with Daniel is represented by a 2D (really 1D, as the second scale is ignored for the final decision) morality mechanic. Almost every decision you make in the game influences these two hidden variables ('morality' and 'brotherhood') that then influence Daniel's decisions. This mechanic represents you influencing daniel and teaching him right from wrong. 

However, the simplicity of the mechanic is its downfall. The game, like all [i]Life is Strange[/i] titles, exposes you to a nuanced and diverse array of people and situations, giving you the opportunity to make decisions that'll influence Daniel. However, all these decisions are mapped against the simplistic, 2D morality mechanic.

The end result is that Daniel's decisions, although technically influenced by you, seem entirely random unless you just so happen to follow the exact morality scale prescribed by the game. This becomes especially apparent during the final game decision, where the game puts yourself and Daniel in a position that resolves the conflict from the first episode. However, all your decisions in episodes 2-4 were very contextually different, making Daniel's decision to agree or disagree with your decision feel hollow.

Some may defend this with the fact that Daniel is a young child, and therefore him making decisions that are irrational or one-dimensional is just realism. But regardless of whether it makes sense or not, this mechanic just makes Daniel unrelatable and frustrating. And because the game is centered around your relationship with him, the game falls apart around him."
2375,"this story is amazing, waaaay better than 1. Sean, Ive never felt so bad for a character ."
2376,"This is by far a superb game, no doubt about it. I would recommend this any day of the week to anyone looking to get into story line games. The entire series for that matter. Knowing where True Colors is based is getting me excited knowing that we might be able to see Cassidy some more, but that is just theory as idk what they have planned, but one can hope! My ONLY issue with LIF2 is there are a lot of political themes thrown in the game and not subtly either, while some I get, others are, to me a hardcore throw at the rural and right leaning Americans and I can't help but feel it targets that side a little to much and paints them all as racist bigots, which is entirely not true. Speak from experience. However this being said, it doesn't take away from the game enough to make me not recommend it or to stop playing it. 10/10"
2377,one of the best games in the world with a great story and full of amazing soundtracks :D

2394,"i already played this game on xbox so i can give my opinion on the game
you know why you play a video game to do stuff you cant do in real life i love life is strange 1 so much because you actually get powers and can use your powers to solve puzzles but with life is strange 2 there's nothing special about it you don't get to solve puzzles and it feels like you're watching a movie except for the first episode were you get 1 choice and 1 puzzle and it feels really boring without the occasional puzzle or occasional choice plus the relationships and characters feel really forced and there's no chemistry at all between them they just feel like robots i like the graphics but you could say the same about life is strange 1"
2395,"love this game, best one i'we played so far"
2396,Amazing storyline. The choices you have to make are horrible enough to piss you off but to also keep you wanting more.
2397,"(Game Content Warning: Police Violence, blood, drugs)

Another deep and interesting game from dontnod that is in the same world as the first LiS game. We also get to see what became of Arcadia Bay later down the line too. We follow the story of Sean and Daniel Diaz, who, through events outside of their control, are on the run from the law and Daniel gains powers that they also must deal with as they continue to travel across the country.

The commentary is something that, with recent events, hits pretty hard in regards to what started them off on their journey across the country, but there are also many fun and colourful characters to meet along the way to help them in their travels, but sadly, having no money becomes a massive hindrence too.

If you want to view my streams, here's a link to the first one if you're curious for the story and if it's something you want more of: https://youtu.be/RCW9swjUe24"

2399,"Sometimes doing the right thing leads to negative consequences, and doing the wrong things leads you to salvation. Life Is Twisted, Life Is Pain, Life Is Torture.

This series should be named Life is Unfair instead...

I love this game, but it's so sad :("
2400,fuck daniel and stupid magic
2401,"I really tried to like this game, but no. Every aspect of this game feels too forced. The drama was way over the top, my eyes got sore because I rolled them too much. I kept playin only to see how will the characters do, and I did regret everytime I finished an episode. And don't get me started on ""We tried to draw attention on political issues."" I'm already living in a 3rd world country and injustice is all I see all day every day. I'm already a sjw not by choice. This is not making political issues visible, this is sequencing tragic events with some sprinkles of evil white men on top."

2407,"This game was such an emotional roller coaster and never got boring, can't wait for the third game/ I personally enjoyed this more than the first as well! and that's saying something because I adore the first game. I have played through all endings and personally, my favourite ending is the parting ways ending with Finn as Daniel gets to live a normal-ish life and he never really wanted to live in Mexico anyways and he's raised in a better household whereas Sean can live in Mexico in peace from the U.S law system and ends up together with Finn which, in my opinion, is just absolutely adorable. Overall amazing game with moving scenes, some are hard to watch but it helps get the story and morals across. 10/10"
2408,"After having played the first one & it's prequel, having fallen in love with both, I was super excited about this one. But it is a huge disappointment.  

It's sooo slow. Whereas with the first one we begin with the interesting bit, here the powers only manifest twice in the first episode. And you're not even involved at all! 

For the full first episode you have to sit through Daniel whining to Sean & Sean whining to you. Speaking of Daniel, he actually is an irritating kid. Sean on the other hand - why am I playing Sean? Who thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about Batman's cousin? 

The first game was, ""this girl can control time, let's find out who she is as a person."" 
This game is ""there's this angsty teen who has a genuinely irritating kid brother, let's see if they can find a way to get along - oh also, almost forgot, the kid has telekinesis."" 

Here's how little I connected with these characters, their mom is ""not in the picture"". Seriously, I played for three hours & I don't even know whether the mom is alive - let alone what happened to her. And I don't even care. Why should I? You couldn't be bothered to tell me after I played for three hours, why should I invest myself?

I'm done here. I wouldn't bother if I were you. Hopefully the new one will be better."
2409,"I thought this would be a high school drama plot, but boy how wrong was I.

I haven't been so emotionally attached to any video games for a long time. Under the disguise of a travel adventure, the game sinks deep into the discussion of nomad lifestyle. Really makes me think about the true form of freedom and the false sense of social security. The story itself is amazing too. It's like the game just went straight downhill to some serious dark shjt, but then someone come to shed a little light into this immense sadness. You see the ugliest part of humanity where people are selfish, racist, judgmental, and aggressive. But there are also brightest part of humanity where people are kind, enlightening, helpful, and inspiring. Just like real life, you see the characters get hurt a lot on the road, but they also receive a lot of help from all different kinds of strangers. There are just so many moments that hit me so hard in this game, couldn't even cry cuz my tear went dry.

10/10 one of the best narratives ever made."
2410,"This story was okay, but even near as good a the first ""game"" i would rather have this ""game"" came out as a movie than as a ""game"", because it really isent a game. Yes, you have a few choices, but you dont really have any choices in the big end, and in the end you really find out how little your choice meant for the game. There is pretty much only 2 endings and will remain like that.

If you make a ""game"" that base on your choices, then make it with  more than 2 endings, make it with MANY, not a few, make it a RPG where you decide EVERYTHING, not what the DEVS want you to do. Let me walk around as it pleases me, let my intervein with anything and everyone i want. I really dont want a story where i basicly have NO way to make it ""my"" story. This is the devs story and therefore, this should not have been released as a game but an animated movie.

The ""game"" isent worth its full price, not even close, because all you can choose is wither you like ice cream or not. Its just as unimportant.

And by the way, dont ever let IGN tell you its a great game or not. They are pay off to say so. They have NO dignity in there review, only eyes for the money. Which makes them utterly USELESS.

As said, the first ""Life is strange"" was way better than this socalled ""game"". Your choosing doesnt affect the ""game"" much and really is pretty unimportant whatever your choose. 

This game is released on ""That will do, people are dumb and accept this halv finished material."" I really hope they does the next ""game"" way better than they did with this one, And let us have 100s of ending depending on choices, than just two the DEVS wants us to have. Get some honor back in developing games. Thankfully, we arent all fanbois who just accepts whatever you release..

Story: 4 / 10 - Its dosnt deserve more when your choices dosnt matter.
Immersion: 5/10
Graphics: 3/10
Acting/voices: 6/10
Gameplay: 2/10 - its not a game, but a story that should have been an animated movie. Nothing to do at all.

IGN as a reviewer:  -1000000 /10 - This site is utter GARBAGE!

Dont buy it for its full price, be prepared to not being allowed to do whatever you want, and be sure, that whatever you choose, have little to NO influence on the story at all, just very basic."
2411,"la verdad que no me gusta votar a los juegos con un si o no. Steam, pone un boton de masomenos la concha de tu madre"
2412,I didn't know what to expect going into it not having the girls in this game but I was truly blown away. Finding their easter eggs and all the amazing choices you get to make as you just try to help these boys survive is everything I could have wanted.
2413,"Great story and special songs i love it.
has easy game play and you can do anythings with your chooses.
and you want play again and again and again...
-I fall in love with Lyla Park <3 -"
2414,good story but not the ending its just lame
2415,"I have loved every minute I played all of the Life Is Strange games! I have been a hardcore gamer for 20 years and no games compare to this saga! These games should me movies! The story lines are intense and epic, worth everything! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE TO DROP!!!"
2416,"I feel like LiS2 gets so much shit because it doesn't have Chloe and Max. People were expecting a sequel in the sense of a continuation of the story from the first game and when that didn't happen they were mad. LiS2 is actually a honing of all the best storytelling elements of the original game and it's telling us a whole new story. While I love the original, I think LiS2 might be the better game: story-wise, mechanics-wise, and everything else. This is a great franchise and I look forward to True Colors. 

I think it was smart not to do a sequel centered on Chloe and Max. I think we would have been disappointed and frustrated when it couldn't live up to what existed in our imaginations. Sean and Daniel are an incredible brother duo with compelling writing that really sells us on their complicated relationship. The story stands on its own and doesn't need any help from the story of Max, Chloe, or Arcadia Bay."
2417,This is the most I ever felt while playing a game - and I played a shit ton of games.
2418,"This is an amazing game overall, i don't really like the fact that you have to but the episodes i would rather pay for the game upfront but overall it is great (:"
2419,💞
2420,"The best game I've ever played.

P.S. I couldn't help but have a crush on Finn. Such a cinnamon roll. ^.^"
2421,"Life is strange series always show a really good story. Play with emotions, love it.
Can't wait for the next series."
2422,game
2423,"One of, if not the best decision making games I have ever played! Storyline was excellent and I can totally relate to Sean as I'm an elder brother myself and has a younger brother. I feel like raising my own brother when playing the game. Daniel's morality and your relationship with Daniel play a huge role in which endings u get. (I'm not gonna spoil it for you!) So treat Daniel like how you would treat your own brother. This is much more than just a game. It feels more like a real life situation and the decision making part sure was tough. Remember every decision you make has consequences. The game also sends a strong message by highlighting the racial issues in America without going over the top."
2424,FUCK AMERICAN COPS
2425,Im still only on the first chapter of this game. but i can say that the content is amazing. i love the Life Is strange series and i have no regrets getting this game. the story line is great and it doesnt disappoint.
2426,when the
2427,good gooder
2428,"cool
"
2429,"Disliked the game at first as I really just wanted more of the first game and this one is different, but I loved it by the end.   I think the episodes are little less even in quality than the first game, but the game as a whole is incredibly strong.  There are significant graphics and control improvements, and (on my computer at least)  much greater stability.  My game didn't crash once (I probably had ~20 crashes with LiS1).  Another praise is the quality of the different endings compared the first game.  In LiS1, the final choice overwrites any other decision made earlier which greatly cheapens the experience.  LiS2 has a solid collection of moral and relationship choices that are all added up to give you one of four major endings with minor details within each that can change based on your choices. My opinion is that this sequel is an improvement over the first game in every area except the setting.   The story is almost completely detached from the first game, but there a few moments and characters that acknowledge the continuity of the LiS universe. Episode-wise, I would rank them E3 > E2 > E5 > E1 > E4.  If you loved the first game, you will LOVE this one as long as you can accept not having Max and Chloe around."
2430,I haven't finished the game yet but it's really good so far!
2431,"Nothing of value here. If you enjoyed the first one, play that again. But you didn't, this is not going to change your mind.

The story is an utterly confused mess that needs to resort to very basic tear jerking.

All in all this feels like nobody could be bothered to care about the writing, or that they valued a sense of ""mystery"" over any coherency.

Too bad, the first one was quite nice and this feels like caching in on that reputation :("
2432,good game
2433,"Set in a bigger canvas than the first LiS, this game does not disappoint either."
2434,"I highly recommend everyone who love storytelling games. Although Life is Strange 1 gave more cliffhangers in it's story but I can say that I also loved the story of this game equally. This game's story feels more mature and there is sense of exploration in it. And Mind me when the game tells you that your choices will have consequences .. It will have consequences. I loved every part of it. The characters are more developed. The world is bigger around you it's not like story that revolves around teenagers and their high school.If you are looking for an emotional rollercoaster ride. This is the one.
Fun Fact - I have played only three episodes yet and I am so hooked with the story."
2435,👍
2436,"First 3 episodes were really good, but 4th and 5th got a bit too political for my taste. 
Nevertheless, I still think this is a good game with interesting story. 
Not sure how much my choices truly mattered, but I had fun. 

Overall decent game - not as good as Life is Strange 1 or Before the storm, but still good."
2437,"I went in with low expectations, disappointed that it didn't include Max and Chloe and expecting not to like it as much because of that. Boy, was I wrong. I LOVED this game. I told myself I wouldn't look up the answers and that lasted about 5 minutes, haha. I got heavily invested in Sean and Daniel very early on. I didn't get my favorite ending, but I am fairly satisfied with the ending I got. It was a beautiful story and I could definitely see myself playing through it again."
2438,Definitely must play game.
2439,Started out as fun. Didn't knew depression also watched me play this game.
2440,GREAT GAME
2441,"The power of brothers.
"
2442,I love this game so much <3
2443,"Did I bawl my eyes out while playing this game? Yes, yes I did."
2444,"[h1] Game is great and all, but I just can't recommend it. [/h1]

I cannot imagine a world where my brother just blatantly ignores, disobeys and distrusts me this much. The story feels almost like it is written by a person who does not have any siblings...

In such a horrible situation, no matter the god damn age, my brother would listen to me. He would've trusted me and my decisions. He would not act as a spoiled brat. And considering how much Sean cares about Daniel, the events happened to him are just makes no sense.

Don't get me wrong. I am actually really sad that the events occurred and I loved the game. The way Daniel is built just doesn't feel natural and realistic to me.

[spoiler] 
I mean check out the endings. Yeah, the diversity is superb but none of them feels right. Redemption feels okay but then you see a Sean that is broken inside after the time spent in jail. And their bond is just doesn't satisfy.

On the other hand, if you both go to Puerto Lobos, then there is a scene where Sean is satisfied but you feel like going there was unfair to Daniel, because he obviously does not ""love"" Puerto Lobos. At least the developers could make him more happy with this ending, Idk, maybe Karen or their loved ones could visit them in Mexico.

I won't even discuss other two, because I cannot imagine an ending where these brothers are seperated. 

I don't know man, I just finished the game and I feel like I have been exposed to another ""Game of Thrones Finale"".
 [/spoiler]

If I were the writer of the story, I would emphasise more on the bonds that brothers could have. It almost always feels like its one sided."
2445,"==========================
A Multiple Choice Escort Mission
==========================

Diving into LiS2, and having been a surprised fan of the first, I cannot help but feel they dropped the ball on the narrative with LiS2. The characters are much shallower - every conversation is largely predicable based on the tropes and cliché of the genre which somewhat makes the multiple choice aspect redundant - you can see the path ahead before taking it's offered.

In hindsight, I wish that Square Enix and DotNod had waited longer to produce a second game - take some time and find a narrative with as much twisting and depth as the first. Instead they seem to have just jumped on the 2016 US election fallout bandwagon and made a critique of US Policing and Immigration (which we all know has some abhorrent problems)

But because of this focus, the narrative does nothing *new*
It's got no soul; and any emotive effect is done through cycling the same narrative tropes we see in so many other games and films

Mechanics wise, the game is frustrating - expect to spend the first three episodes, almost in their entirety, being forced to run around after your irritating younger brother with such speed you are often not left with enough time to explore and find all the easter eggs, items and PoI. It feels like a frustrating throw back to an earlier age of gaming where you are pushed down a linear tube of a story by an NPC that's screaming at you or otherwise running off and doing things you don't want them to

Episode 4 was the first in which I felt I had some degree of freedom within the remit of the otherwise restricted locations

Episode 5 and you're back to the escort mission again - though by this point, it does seem that the devs have realised the errors of the first three so you do have more time to explore and interact with things

I ended the game on the ""best"" ending - which was suitably predictable, watched the animation, and went back to get the ""bad"" ending - I can't say either one really had an impact - you knew it was coming and because of the lack of depth to the characters I really didn't have any empathy. At least in the first LiS, even if you were able to predict the end, there was enough character depth to make you feel *something* about the end you chose. LiS2 did not have that for me

======================
So why the positive review?
======================

For all my issues with LiS2; both in narrative and mechanics, i do have to credit it with consuming more than 20 hours of my time. If it's objective was to entertain - it did that - and I'm sure that many others will be entertained for the time they spend playing too.

I'm very much of the view that if you can get 20 hours of entertainment out of something and not come away hating yourself for the experience, it was probably worth doing. LiS2 succeeded in entertaining - that's all can be really said about it. I just personally found it too easy to predict the outcome of decisions and storylines and had no real connection to the characters

Hopefully the recently announced Third Game will offer something different and more likeable characters"
2446,No regrets.
2447,Heart Beating
2448,Perfect game with moral design. So cool that we can effect character and would not be easy to anticipate what is next. Highly recommended.
2449,Not as good as the first one but still pretty good.
2450,"Good game. lack of gameplay compared to the previous game of LIS series, however."
2451,"Way more intense than the previous cringe fest that was the first. the story of the wolf brothers touches on themes of Loss and social issues including racism and displacement, not to mention the main theme of family ties and relationships. Game-play is much more deeper in context to characters feelings and decisions and the use of the journal/sketchbook feature is very nice, plus the games colors and rendering is smooth and beautiful  8.5/10 for me."
2452,"[h1] Two criticisms people commonly have [/h1]
""The game is too political/ideological"" - This is very much an ""eye-of-the-beholder"" issue. If you yourself are inclined to look at/for politics and ideology, you will of course hyper-focus on it in this game. But the game is about so much more. Having occasional political overtones doesn't take away from anything, just lets lazy people throw in two words in an attempt pf critique.

""The game has less choice than the original"" - Genuinely nonsensical statement. You have the same amount of choice you had in Life is Strange 1. In fact, (minor non-specific spoilers for both games) [spoiler] Life is Strange 2 has more endings than Life is Strange. [/spoiler]

[h1] What I think [/h1]
I've played through this game from start to finish twice. (Playtime doesn't reflect this.) I might also be the perfect person for this game. I'm a little older than Sean and have had a shallow relationship with my brother. I felt the need to replay it immediately after I finished it, and I never have such urges before.

Life is Strange 2 is like a writing exercise to make it as different as possible from the original. I think it's largely successful and interesting because it's so distinct from the suburban anxiety/mystery of the previous game. [b] I firmly believe Life is Strange 2 is the better game, [/b] but I'm emotionally biased by the subject matter of brotherhood.

All in all, this game is worth it at full asking price, or at least it was for me. Close to a perfect game.

"
2453,"Life is Strange 2 succeeds in being unique because of its adherence to the slower aspects of living and surviving. It brings out beauty through calmness and contemplation. Despite its serious subject matter and lack of subtlety when it comes to its racist, xenophobic and religiously fanatic antagonists, Life is Strange 2 is an uplifting experience about family, loyalty, love and belonging. So if you prefer to put the controller down during story scenes, or you find yourself sifting through Sean’s completed sketches multiple times, that’s okay. You are meant to enjoy the quiet moments, the butter between the bread. And when you get to the end, well, let’s just say we hope you have been a good brother to Daniel. He will remember everything."
2454,"the bundle pack is def worth it, i loved the first one and i love this one, they did amazing with the graphics and the story"
2455,"At the time of this review, I only played the first episode and I absolutely love the character development and bonds you form with everyone. The brotherly bond the game explores is a slower burn compared to the rekindling of a reconnection among old friends or the spark of a romance seen in previous seasons. Instead, Life is Strange 2's heart lies in the growing understanding between these two boys of what they mean to each other, out on the road. It is a closeness learnt over long days trekking through the forest and longer nights spent shivering together by a campfire. It is the continued hardships faced along their journey, the bigotry they endure due to racial profiling, the new friends which help them further towards their goal. [spoiler]It is Daniel's special powers as a metaphor for a volatile child dealing with loss.[/spoiler] And, most of all, it is the ways you as the teenage Sean respond to all of these things - which in turn moulds how the younger Daniel reacts too. All in all this first episode left me emotionally drained and gave a strong feeling of sorrow and dread. I can sympathize with Sean and Daniel and the hardships they encounter and overcome. Definitely a game worth playing if you are in to graphic adventure games. [spoiler] As Brody says ""You may not see it but... What you and your brother have is the most important thing. He needs you. And you need him."" [/spoiler]"
2456,GREAT!
2457,"I love this game and I hate this game. It is an emotional roller coaster. It's a dark, sad, and beautiful story. The game certainly has its flaws, but overall, one of the best I've played. As an older brother myself, I really related to Sean, the main character. There are very few stories that have pulled me in like this and made me feel a part of it. This is one. Don't pass this game up."
2458,"I loved Life is strange 1, but here the story makes no sense to me, stupid decisions of main protagonist are being excused with even stupider and unrealistic circumstances. That and the fact that there is only an illusion of a choice that shapes the story, didn't allowed me to enjoy this game."
2459,Good story

2468,"not as good as the walking dead

but it fills the hole in my heart well enough"
2469,"Depending on how you approach this game you will either love it or hate it. I personally loved it but as an older brother myself I came at this with the goal of teaching my little brother to be a good person as my primary focus and being a good brother to him as secondary. When I reached the end of the first Life is Strange game the choice I made really taught me something about myself. I now look for a similar experience when I play other Dontnod produced games. (I have also played ""Before the Storm"" and ""Tell Me Why"" and I personally think Before the Storm was the weakest of the series)

As others have said the pacing of Life is Strange 2 is slow so I highly recommend playing this only 1 episode at a time so you aren't overwhelmed. There is a lot of stuff to interact with and much of it has no consequence on the game so I wouldn't get too caught up in trying to find everything. This is like a very long interactive movie, taking me nearly 15 hours by the time I was done. You will often feel like the outcome is fixed and in a lot of ways it is. 

I think the primary point of this game is to tell a story and to make you think about how you live your own life and maybe question some of your beliefs. What you bring to it will determine what you get back from it. It isn't for everybody but if this sounds like your cup of tea, give it a go."
2470,"Tedious, heavy-handed, and rather childish in terms of the insights it puts forth. I'd put this game on par with some of Telltale's worst works, with considerably better artwork and music selection. Even so, the dialogue, narrative, and even the choice-making lack the creativeness and impact of those found in LiS1 and LiS:BTS. Voice actors are given very weird direction and it's immersion breaking at times. The 'villains' are one-dimensional, very cartoon-like and buffoonish. Many choices do not matter, although there are a few different endings. Overall, a regretful purchase."
2471,Wait for Karen
2472,"Boy, is this game a slog. I just wrapped part 3, and I'll probably grind my way through the rest, but it's not nearly (not even a little bit) as fun as Life is Strange 1. The problem is that the story is far too linear. For a game about ""player choice,"" the choices you make only make minor changes to the story. You still end up in the same place, more or less, whatever choices you make. Also, the narrative pacing is too slow. I found myself playing games on my phone while playing this game, because it would take AGES for the characters to finish talking. The amount of actual gameplay is minimal. Sometimes you can walk around and look at stuff. If you're lucky, you can pick stuff up to accomplish some boring task (deliver water tanks!) so the game can provide the illusion that you're ""playing."" Really, this is an interactive movie. My biggest problem, however, was with the writing. Daniel is F***ing annoying. He was the most bratty, obnoxious character. I literally wanted him to die so I wouldn't have to ""play big brother"" to him any more. Pretty much EVERY EPISODE is you worrying about and arguing with Daniel. It's. So. Boring. Like, who cares, Daniel? Jump off a cliff. Seriously. As a final nail in the coffin, the thing that made LIS 1 so cool was having a superpower--being able to rewind time. This time, you have no superpower, nada. 100% of the time, your only recourse is to get Daniel to help you do something. It's like being Robin in Batman and Robin. Nobody wants to be Robin. All this being said, I do appreciate the representation--the diversity of characters, and the ability to make non-heterosexual romantic choices. However, I am still struggling to get through this game in 2021, and I bought it in 2019 when it came out--not a good sign."
2473,trash
2474,"Life is good. 

You tell this tale of two brothers learning to bond. They grow, as they make their way along the west coast, heading south. There are many details to discover, there is good music in the beginning. Some characters are loveable, memorable, even relatable. You are still not afraid of taking your time to let the players take in the moments in the game, to reflect on what is happening. 

Life is strange… 

...because you give me dialogue options that time-out way too quick and rob me of ways to attempt to have an impact on the story. 
By the end of the game I am almost afraid to approach any new character, thinking it is again just some bad cliche I need to be confronted with. 
I would have liked to bond with the father and the friends of Sean a little more.. some things just take their time. 

Life is, uh... bad.

The question of what games can teach you and what they should not attempt to teach you. 
Life is a journey, a game is too. But here you are, teaching us a story about two boys, born American, with Mexican heritage. And no matter what they do, no matter how good or bad they act, the system is rigged against them. The wall, that is supposed to keep others out, is keeping us trapped in this nightmare of a story that was never supposed to have a happy-ending.
Clearly, all cops are bad and if they get a chance to fire their guns, they will. 
Super powers are definitely needed when you want to tell a meaningful story, otherwise you would just end up without any plot-device at all. Right? Mhm. 
^ This one really puzzles me the most as “Before the Storm” should have really showed that super powers are not always necessary to have in a game. Especially in this one, they never felt rewarding, they never felt good, only another instance of: well, now things are going to shit, yet again.
Did you know that Racism is bad? No? Well, rest assured, this game will tell you all about it! 

Ultimately, I would love to be able to recommend this game. The lack of good music, the promised ‘meaningful choices’ in this game are not meaningful at all. 

Dontnod attempts to play with serious societal issues, but ends up confirming the worst cliches instead of trying to dismantle them. Your stories can be more than a checklist of issues related to social justice. Be brave, tell a story worth telling, let the player decide which path to take once in a while. 
I will continue to look at the Life is Strange series, but the only thing I have learned from playing this one, is to keep my expectations at a minimum. 

I would rate this game 5/10, for it’s solid technical improvements, good voice-acting and decent music. However the impact of the forced political views and the lack of actual impact on the story stand in the way of this one. 
"
2475,"LIS 1 is one of my top 3 games of all time. This game just falls flat in comparison. Characters have no nuance, they are either a horrible racist talking about putting up a wall or they are a good person. The whole game almost felt like satire because of how laughable some of the characters are. Ironically, instead of rising above the use of stereotypes, the game uses the decade old religious 'cult' trope. Looking forward to the remaster of LIS 1. It's a much much better game."
2476,very good yes yes
2477,dontnod peaked with sean eduardo Diaz
2478,yupp i like this game !
2479,very chill adventure game. The music makes me escape from reality and become absorbed in the story. One of the few games that keep my full focus of attention.
2480,"Really sad to see how bad this game was, especially compared to LiS and LiS: BtS. Gameplay was pretty boring, none of the choices you make matter. Story was also subpar, going overly political. Huge disappointment."
2481,"this is some heavy content in one game...
it started out pretty slow in the first 2 episodes (except for some scenes, but you'll understand what im talking about) but in episode 3 i really started to like the game. i do think some scenes still take way too long, but thats just my opinion.
i do wanna add a big trigger warning; if you are easily triggered by racism, violence and death, do not play this game. like i said earlier, it is a pretty heavy story."
2482,"I have completed the whole game, definetly my favourite story game. When i herad the theme music today which is some months ago from when i completed the ending and i basically started kinda crying, i got some many memories and scenes from the game. If you see this comment then definetly buy this game, you wont regret it!"
2483,so good. the graphics are nice. the story makes you emotional and i'd only get it if you aren't triggered by racism as the main characters go through a lot of it. very eye opening and beautiful
2484,AWFUL.   .   The little brat(Daniel) can't keep  out trouble.   His disobedience is the reason for the sad events that take place during the game.   The only way to save the game is to have Daniel eaten my a mountain lion.  Unfortunately there is no option for this.  You have no control over Daniel which screws up all your good intentions and plans.  Really there is no point to playing  the game because of Daniel.
2485,"I love that gameeeeeeeeee ♥️

But the forced political agenda crap is beyond annoying. If you can look past those moments, which isn't too hard. You have an amazing story and experience that you should not miss if you are a fan of the Life is Strange universe!"

2491,"this game covers lots of sensitive topics such as racism, parental loss, cults, and religious trauma.

however i loved every second i played. the art is breathtaking, the story is diverse, and overall this game was a hit! i played it late, but even without the current events inspiring the plot, it's still very relatable to reality and the times we live in.

there were some parts where i didn't know what to do or how to get to the next area/mission, but overall i'd rate this 4/5!"
2492,yes
2493,"I LOVE this game it's my absolute favorite game in the whole world. The quality of the gameplay, the developed plot, the character development, the way it's so personal to the way that you think and act, I love it all."
2494,Amazing story line thus far
2495,"Theres some political commentary here and I just played the demo. But for what I played man does it pull off that slice of life feeling so well!

It takes me back to where its set in, Early October 2016. I was working hard in 9th grade and loved to hang out with friends. It was a magical time and it feels perfectly captured in this game. Weather is still warm and the sun is still out but leaves are turning golden. The environments are fully detailed and it really feels like they sampled and went to a middle class families home with an older brother in high school, a little brother in middle school, and a dad who works on cars in the garage.

The political commentary has to do with the election and how Donald Trump was the candidate who was advocating for fascism and being openly racist towards Latino immigrant Americans. Daniel and his older brother are Latino Americans and get racially profiled at various areas and have to survive together. They kind of lost me at the supernatural parts, but from what I played there was barely any of that, so its a very good game!"
2496,"It is worthy for the story, they do a great job showing Tommy Angelo's famous statement, ""family is your greatest weakness, but is also your greatest strength"". Beautiful story, just started episode 4, expecting things to keep looking up for LIfe is Strange 2!!!"

Like a real Life is Strange, every ending leads you to spend hours and hours thinking about the other paths you could have chosen (since none of them will totally satisfy you haha), besides the criticism and deep reflections about our contemporary society that the game brings up, like issues of xenophobia, racism, homophobia and the fear of the unkown/different.
The soundtrack touches the soul deep inside, as well as the plot itself is strongly emotional, and considering your choices reflects your own personality and directly influence Daniel and his character building, it's impossible not to feel like you're inside the game
I need to say that, also as a big brother, I saw myself in Sean, and that made me think about how my own words and attitudes mold not only my little brothers and our relationship, but also the people around me
I really found myself in that awesome game!"
2504,Life is still Tumblr
2505,"personally i think  the game as a whole is an  amazing one, i've played it so many times before and i just had to play it again. 
watching both of the boys grow up and adapt to their new lives traveling the country and hiding away from the police had its own challenges so having their grandparents help out and except them to live with them for a while shows that love must be real and that you really don't have to grow up speaking with all of your family members to still rely  on them for help  when you need it the most"
2506,"I'm... torn...
I wanted to like this game. I really did, but I just couldn't.
For the first episode, I just could not wrap my head around why Sean was so focused on leaving. They did not do a great job at explaining the why in that. And I kept saying 'bro just go back' probably HUNDREDS of times throughout the series. They are both underage, and they would almost certainly not be treated as adults in court. Maybe a little juvy at the far worst, even with all the injustice and racism that is present. 

There were way too many new characters introduced that came and went. There just was not enough time for character development. Everyone just seemed like minor characters. There was also no character to the environment, unlike Arcadia bay in LiS 1, whether you loved it or hated it.
My favourite character in this game was probably Sean's dad, but... yeah... As for Sean himself, I thought that he was just a regular anxty teenager. But after ep3, I started to hate him as a person for [spoiler] Breaking out of the hospital, and STEALING A FUCKING CAR, LIKE WHAT?? [/spoiler]. Like ffs Sean!
To me I just could not find myself to like Sean that much. I do give them props for trying to address the problem with racism, but it seemed.. forced.

This game has some good moments, but I just can't say I recommend this to anyone.
I purchased this game before playing episode 1 and I was hoping it would get better in ep2, then 3... but it didn't. 

[h1]What I liked [/h1]
I looked into all of the endings after playing through it and they were heart breaking and well done.
I liked the brotherly figure dynamic and the imagery with the wolves. (though the story telling part was told OVER and OVER which was driving me nuts!)

With all the shortcomings that this game had, I'm still looking forward to playing LiS: True Colors.
I'm definitely gonna try out ep1 first, and likely have a great time playing it."
2507,"I had a somewhat conflicted experience with LiS 2 because of my love for the original and its prequel. They are both superior games compared to the second installment, but that does not discredit how great of a game LiS 2 is. 

New elements and mechanics are introduced, and they work well with an emotional, enthralling story that keeps you playing throughout the game. 

As said previously, LiS 2's predecessors are superior games, but the ""your choice matters"" element is taken to another level. It was at a level that any other game similar to the LiS franchise should strive and attempt to surpass. 

A great story, and a great game, enough said."
2508,"[h1]Only played First Episode[/h1]
There really isn't much to do yourself in this game. You're a witness to a story, and the game keeps you invested by giving you choices here and there and at major crossroads to make it feel like you're in control of the story. Therefore, the only real way to judge this game would be the quality of the story, and even though I've only played the first episode, it's clear to me how beautiful and fulfilling the story of this game is. I don't even have a little brother but playing this game made me realize that if I did, there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. When I play the remaining episodes, I'm sure that I'll only continue to be impressed and drawn into the story, and drawn into the role of the big brother. I especially like the choice rankings at the end of each episode that let you compare your choices to others. [spoiler] I'm glad to see 91% of people are or would be good big brothers and promised not to lie to Daniel again [/spoiler] I would recommend this game, however, only to people who have a little patience as the story does feel a little slow at times."
2509,"Move on, there's nothing to see. A very flabby sequel, with a namby-pamby message. Only some parts of the game are interesting."
2510,BEST GAME EVER
2511,"I love how your actions in this game are mirrored in behavior and moral thinking of your brother. It always made me think about how my decisions would effect Daniel first and without these thoughts i definetly would have decided differently on several occasions. 
Also the game like its precursors is art. It's got a beautiful and unique artstyle and the music is relaxing, sometimes even a bit melancholic. Also you can scetch some sceneries like you could take fotos in the first game.
[spoiler]Although in my opinion there is no true happy ending (or at least i havent found one) [/spoiler]It's an amazing game."
2512,"A heartwrenching story that involves action and the supernatural. You'll quickly get attached to Sean and Daniel and wish to see them succeed in their endeavors, the question is which path will you lead them to ?

I personally very much preffered this game to the 1 where I couldn't relate to the main characters."
2513,nice game
2514,such a great game
2515,"I know it's a little bit late now but whenever I talk about bad games Life is Strange 2 comes in mind. I loved the previous ones and that's why I bought it in the first plays. You maybe think I am crazy but I stopped the game when the dog dies. Don't put the dog in the first place if you gonna kill it without being a result of your decisions (actions). It just goes to pee and just die, Because probably those kids can have good things happen to them in any given time. I really couldn't play any more, the story was all over the place, I think the teenager vibe from the first two was much better than a brat kid with super powers. I look forward for the new one. I really hope it's better."
2516,"I am traumatized



10/10 would be a bad big brother again"
2517,Very immersive
2518,А что тут рассказывать - игра шедевр.
2519,guud
2520,"I wish I could say otherwise but I didn't quite enjoy this game. I couldn't connect neither with the plot nor with the ""superpower"" and all in all I found the story simply too sad. In my opinion a good story has a good balance of ups and downs and causes different kinds of emotions and that from my perspective isn't the case with this game."

2522,"SEAN AND DANIEL MY BELOVEDS <333 this game made me cry so many times, so different from the first one, but just as beautiful and emotional if not more."
2523,Life Is Strange is for sure one of my all time favorite story driven games where your choices matter. I can play these games over and over again and I's still love the experience. Highly Recommend!! :)
2524,This game is fantastic. It's like you're writing the movie with your decisions. Such a great story. I just finished episode 1 for free but I'm definitely buying the rest of the episodes. Freeaking awesome job.
2525,haha funny sad game 😭
2526,So emotionally invested in this game and these fictional boys its insane!! I'm about to start my 2nd replay since the first time I played it a year ago and I can't wait to do this journey again. Counting down the months until Life is Strange 3!
2527,"Really good story, made me cry a few times. More of an interactive movie rather than a game."
2528,It's an amazing game.
2529,"A Brilliant story. It doesn't paint a very beautiful picture of USA, but a rather important one. This is a journey a lot of people should take."
2530,It's a great story! You will enjoy the soundtrack. I am very sorry for Mushroom. Life is cruel. The story continues from episode 4.
2531,"This is the best game I have ever played had my emotions going crazy all the way through such a great story and tough decisions to make every step of the way, hope a life is strange 3 happens and shows Daniel and Sean together again."
2532,"The journey of Sean and Daniel is a story of highs and lows. It shows what people of color in America go through. It shows the trials and tribulations of two brothers on their quest for peace and how having a different skin color, a different background, a different heritage makes everything harder for them. It ultimately shows a strong bond of brothers and the power of overcoming anything and everything in their way. This is by far the best story in the series yet. I highly recommend picking this up and playing. You will be pulled straight in and wanting more and more."
2533,uwuowo
2534,"Okay, so let me get this out of the way first: It's a good game. I enjoyed my time playing it. 

That being said, it is, in my opinion, nowhere near as good as the first Life is Strange, for a couple of reasons.

One, the characters. I didn't develop the same attachment and emotions to them as I did to Max, Chloe and everyone around them, big or small. It's not that they were bad, just not as good and fleshed out. Partly because of reason number two:

The way the narrative is set up. In the first game, everything happens in this small, remote town/campus where everyone knows each other and everyone is connected to each other. You meet the same people over and over and you get to know them, to form your own opinions of them of time. Since LiS2 is basically a roadtrip, locations and people change often, without wanting to spoil too much. Some of the most interesting people (at least in my opinion) you barely get to talk to.

Three (this still ties into 1 and 2, but is maybe the biggest of all my reasons), the titular ""Strange"" of this game. It's... boring. In the first game, you got an ability which is perfect for this type of game, as you could check out different alternatives of your choices, at least in the short term, to better gauge or theorize their future impacts, while once again helping you to gain additional insight into all the people involved in the story, getting to know them even better yet. At the same time, the power tied neatly into the overarching story in a fashion that can only be described as epic, and it had a drawback. There were consequences to it and it couldn't magically solve everything. In this one, most of the time the power felt kind of... tacked on. Interesting, but not really consequential. Like a very similar version of the story could have happened without any special powers whatsoever.

Four, the soundtrack. It was good. Butthe first game was brimming with memorable licensed tunes playing at very special points in the story that I can still visualize whenever I hear a certain song. Those still exist in this game, but they felt far in between good, but ultimately forgettable original scores. It felt strange to get a licensed song for each of the 5 credit rolls, but almost none for any of the many great moments, sespecially  during the later episodes.

Now, I realize all this might sound like I'm trashing the game, which again, I am not, I overall enjoyed my time with the Diaz Brothers. But if you're looking for the same emotionally heartwrenching experience and characters that will feel like friends that you miss, even weeks after finishing the game, this isn't it. Or at least it wasn't for me. 

Getting a look at the lighthouse was nice though, and it's good to know David is doing alright."
2535,I really enjoyed it . good story and better graphic than the last one.
2536,fun
2537,"I was really surprised by this game. I didn't think I'd ever compare it to the first Life Is Strange, but the first episode is actually great. I like the story a lot and the variety of actions available.(In the original Life Is Strange there were fewer options for the player)"
2538,I thought this game was better then the first one
2539,God game
2540,"I really love the game even its very sad/ dramatic.
 the characters make an huge character development wich make it much more interesting. I´m a huge fan of the Atmosphere wich the Game gives us also the Soundtracks hit the Feelings at the right point, you can really put yourself into sean. His story is so sad he deserved the world. I´m so happy that i played this game. -"
2541,"Finally played this game even though I had my eyes on it since release and I do have to say it's a good game.
If you're expecting something similar to the first game, I don't think you'll find it here, but this is worth playing anyway imo.

One thing that I wished I knew before playing this was how heavy the story was. I love stories like that, I just wasn't prepared for this one. It hits very hard and it's a total emotional roller-coaster all the way through. All the themes are very raw and real, and they stirred a lot of emotions for me. My favorite part was definitely the characters. 
My least favorite part is definitely how there isn't what I would define as a true happy ending. It's realistic not to have one, but I say we get that enough in real life, at least in a video game I'd love to see some dreams coming true.




"
2542,Stop making me cry goddammit!
2543,It's really fun and great story line.
2544,boring
2545,"Feeling sad throughout the game knowing something bad is going to happen at any moment yet you somehow want to drag yourself through this dramatic heartbreaking story like you had with Life is Strange 1 is exactly what I signed up for.

✓ Flavoured characters
✓ Misery
✓ Moments of relief
✓ Fun little side-game you can play for free to understand one of the characters in episode 2 better
✓ Dem feels

✓/✕ Yet again not a ""true"" happy ending available (classic Life is Strange at this point)

✕ Choices that seemed logical for a ""good"" ending would sometimes end up in an undesired consequence.  Making me feel the urge to look up all the time what was going to happen with what choice, as I couldn't really trust my own logic to get a desired outcome. Life is Strange 1 held that balance better, choices still mattered but you felt like you could also do most choices by yourself to get a desired outcome."
2546,good game
2547,"It's not terrible, but it's not great either (as opposed to Life is Strange 1 which I still consider the greatest game I've ever played). I really feel like all of the episodes have different writers because they are barely connected. You meet the most amazing characters ever and then they aren't there in the next episode and they might as well not have existed at all. 

Also, the little brother is very annoying. When even the voice actor (of the same age) says he shouldn't be so childish, you know there's something wrong."
2548,"I just couldn't bring myself to finish this game. It's boring. The storytelling is boring.

But it started great. When you're introduced to the character you're playing, it feels much more mature than the first game. The dialogues are better, more realistic. When you speak with the very first character you meet (a girl named Lyla) I genuinely believed that this is how teenagers talk. The first hour was great and I enjoyed it. But then the tragic incident comes and you run away from home with your brother. It's the point where the game is supposed to start. A start that is advertised to be an amazing journey.

Well, it's not, the storytelling is boring and your main character is boring. There is also not much game-play wise. No puzzles, no mini games, the super power is your brother's not yours, so you can't use it. It's just a sequence of boring actions, like go there, look at that object, draw a scene, look at another object, go somewhere else etc.

On the other hand I didn't mind the political aspect of the story, that was one of the few anchors that could make the story better. But the storytelling is just bad. Yeah, I said that already, whatever...

I stopped playing somewhere at the end of the second episode. Maybe it gets better, maybe not, I'm not gonna find it. Shame."
2549,Awesome game
2550,"This is more an interactive story than a game. It's a good story with emotional ties to current social events. You're able to get multiple perspectives to situations as they unfold. Throughout the story you are confronted with situations and are given two responses for making a decision. More than once I thought I knew the outcome to the response I chose, only to have the story evolve in a way I didn't foresee. You're left wondering the outcome of the other choice, but auto saves and checkpoints keep you from quick reloads and replays. You will need to play the whole chapter again to see a different story line unfold. Very enjoyable, short play through. Recommended."
2551,"A great game to be honest. After playing through LIS1, I liked how different it was. The thing about these games that I like is it is predictable in some moments, and unpredictable in others; it has the perfect balance. I still liked LIS1 better, but the ending I got (the game has multiple endings) made me and my friend very content. Overall 9/10."
2552,si
2553,This game is fucking amazing and i would recommend it to anyone. can wait to see if they release a 3rd game if its as good as this.
2554,"Although it lacked the mystery feeling and the cool power game mechanics the first game had. I think this one is a much better game. Both in characters, graphics and my choices finally actually felt like they mattered.
Amo este juego"
2555,"This game is weird. Not in the good sense of it, like LIS1 was, this game is simply like someone wrote a politically correct statement then decided to blend it with a storyline that makes little sense from the narrative point of view and decided to pass this game as art from the 2018s where everyone thought a dystopia was gonna happen.

It's just extremely awkward all over the place, failing to do what LIS1 and Before the Storm did brilliantly which was set up the scene with NPCs and time passing by deciding that the main plot was just you and your douchebag 9 year old brother going up against a really bad case of writer wants you dead.

Tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. It's... not how actually writing a compelling storyline works. It really isn't. Whoever wrote LIS2 has to go through a bunch of the greatest emotionally draining experiences available out there which there are a lot of and learn to properly pace the story and learn that not every damn episode has to be a cliffhanger with death around the corner.

Having every episode just be a repeat bottle episode of the 1st one where the 1st part is just quiet then everything hits the fan for a quick boost to attention at the end of the episode and a cliffhanger episode is *not* a viable strategy to keep positive attention on your game.

Mystery, plot twists, interesting recurring characters, character growth, those are all better ways to tell a story rather than a permanent rotating cast of the same, albeit different, kinds of characters before shit hits the fan and you gotta face a dilemma.

I really get the idea of what they're going for with this game, I really do. It's just horribly executed and extremely on the nose that it just feels like a bad, really bad, fanfiction. It even feels like one of those where you just steal the name of off a franchise and do your own shit just because the name is cool.

That is LIS2.

It's a horrible dissapointment, especially after how LIS BTS knocked it out of the park. I hope whoever wrote this does not even get a line of script for the new LIS coming out."
2556,"Great game!  It's hard to follow up the original, but this story is a great peek into the same universe as Life is Strange."
2557,"Everything about this game is incredible! So much better than the first one. 

I will add there are a few slow parts for people who have trouble keeping attention. Somewhere in the middle I found myself struggling to focus, but don't let that turn you off.  I promise its worth it!!!"
2558,is cool
2559,"Played the entire game in two days. It was a roller coaster, to say the least. Trying to put all my feelings about this game into words would take far more energy than I can muster up right now. What I will say though, is that it's an emotional experience worth every penny I spent. It's not perfect by any means, not even close, and there are some parts so frustrating that you'll want to rip your hair out: but that just makes the great moments all the more impactful. 

One thing this game has going for it is that I've never experienced anything like it. I've played many Visual Novels and narrative games, but this one hit different—I was so hooked I couldn't put it down until the end."
2560,"This game is more towards on the serious issue compared to Life Is Strange 1. Among them are racial injustice, community diversity and family survival. At the end, I am happy with my choices and endings that I got. However, this game lacks of good soundtrack and plot twist. This game implements new cool mechanism such as drawing and interaction between brothers. 

Overall, this game is recommended!"
2561,GOOD
2562,so good
2563,"Its a nice game, but tragedy afeter tragedy doesnt make a good story telling. Also you cannot solve every problem in the world with a game, would be better to have a good story telling and make people think rather than telling them how to feel"
2564,nice
2565,JUST AWESOME
2566,"i`m enjoy this game
"
2567,"It's slow. It's boring. It's forced. It tries to make the player feel sad for no fucking reason other than to make them feel sad... but luckily the story and characters are so uninteresting and boring that you'll just don't care. A bloody disgrace of a ""story-driven"" video game."

2569,"I haven't played terrifically much of this game so far, only the first episode, so take this with a grain of salt. I was initially intrigued by the music choice for the opening of the game and somewhat off-put by the voice acting to begin with. Like there was just a little bit too much room between lines? I'm not entirely certain, and it's a nitpick that I got used to it as time wore on anyhow. Now, there are other minor things I could get into, the game is inherently political, but the politics shown are rather black-or-white. While I tend to agree with most of its points, the stereotypical depiction of red neck = racist and bad wasn't really appreciated. This game is heavy-handed, much like its predecessor, but it's not as inherently cringey. The kids sound like kids, the adults sound like adults, and things come across as fairly realistic (at least while you're in the moment, which I'd argue is the important part.) As someone without siblings and a general dislike of small children, the game got me surprisingly on-board with the whole Older Brother shtick. When it comes down it, the game exceeds at making little moments feel like big ones, having emotional punches, and making you wish you actually could turn back time in this installment. Alas, you have to live with the guilt and your shitty life decisions like everyone else. 
Or maybe I'm the overly sappy type who gets invested into things too easily. Either way, I'd say to give the game a try. The first episode, at very least, since it's currently free. (I don't know if it will stay that way, but I wouldn't have picked up the game in the first place if it hadn't had the time to sink its hooks into me after the last Life is Strange, so it would probably be smart of them to keep the status quo.)
TLDR; Miserable teenager and his little gremlin brother steal the heart of local zillenial bastard while being backed by overly-sentimental indie rock."

2572,"Great game, not as good as the first and BTS but I would still recommend"
2573,"If you're craving anything even remotely similar to the storytelling in Life is Strange 1 or Before the Storm, you should may as well look elsewhere. If you don't like social themes in you games -- regardless of subtlety or lack thereof -- you're probably wasting your time, too. 

Minor plot spoilers for Life is Strange 1 and 2.



On a technical level, LiS 2 far surpasses LiS 1 and even BTS. Environments feel much less static. Dialogue is more fluid. You'll find yourself wandering around, only to discover little quips and comments from Sean, Daniel, or the other characters minutes later. The animations are spectacular. Lip-syncing is no longer puppet-quality, although that issue was mostly resolved in BTS. You've got your standard Dontnod/Deck Nine beautiful environmental shots. While on the topic of visuals, LiS 2 is undoubtedly the most visually diverse Life of Strange game to date. You get to see sleepy small towns blanketed in snow, redwood forests in California, scorched deserts. You even get a small taste of that original LIfe is Strange vibe (you know what I mean if you play it) in Episode 1 that sort of lulls you into a false sense of security. You think for a second that this game will be kind of like the other Life is Strange games. Boy, are you going to be in for a shock.

I guess that poorly segues into my next topic. The change. This is the big thing that turns most people away from this game. I've heard a litany of reasons for why people think this game is a poor successor to the series. I can completely see someone not caring for the constantly changing characters and settings. As crazy as it sounds though, that's part of the reason why I love the game so much. You get to see so many different sides of the ""homeless drifter"" experience. Stealing food from gas stations, squatting in abandoned cabins, staying with estranged relatives, finding your own family in the form of other drifters, doing illegal work to make cash. Not to romanticize orphaned children and dead fathers, but there's beauty in how such different as hell episodes can connect together so easily. It really does feel like an adventure, full of new and different experiences. 

Now probably the second biggest reason is the very blatant, very unsubtle commentary on racism and to a lesser extent religion. One could argue that Life is Strange 1 had some limited feminist themes that most people who didn't care about could just brush to the side while still enjoying the story. Life is Strange 2 is a different beast. It almost doesn't let you ignore it. Sean and Daniel are Mexican-American. There are MANY different points in the game where they are harassed, beaten, captured, or otherwise mistreated for reasons that amount to little more than racism. At the expense of sounding a little patronizing, it's an uncomfortable fucking topic that the common person wouldn't want to touch with a ten-foot pole. And I can't really blame them. Is it over-the-top? You betcha. Could it happen? Hell, Probably. There's always a shred of truth in these stories, no matter how caricatured they may be. And don't get me wrong--these scenes aren't the only part of the game. The game isn't just some 12-hour long piece on American racism. Please don't get that idea. There's just more of it than I'd like. I'm personally not a fan of such aggressive social themes being shoved down my throat either. As crazy as it sounds, these scenes were made more engaging for me for one reason...

Sean. I'm not kidding when I say that Sean Diaz is grounds for my favorite adventure game protagonist of all time. Gonzalo Martin did a fantastic job voicing him. He goes from calm, to heartbroken, to happy, to angry so naturally. He doesn't sound too old or too young. My only gripe is that he speaks a little too hesitantly? Lots of...things like this....................especially if.....you're observing an item.........in the game. You think the voice clip is over..........but it just keeps going....you'll see what I mean......if you play the game.....

Literally perfect casting other than that, though. Like Max, Sean's choices are mostly up to you, but his general personality stays the same. Unlike Max, though, Sean doesn't have the power to bend time to his will and rewrite history. In fact, he doesn't have any powers at all. He gets through life just as anyone else would -- without do-overs. His adventure takes place over the course of nearly a year. There's a theme of adventure that lingers throughout the story. Themes of moving on and finding a new home. In every episode Sean changes. He starts out a perfectly imperfect teenage boy who's biggest problem is finding a way to ask his crush out. From the tragedy at the start of the game to the last stand near the end, you're with him every step of the way. I found myself hoping at every point that he would get some kind of break. A respite from the chaos. He does, but it never lasts too long. Despite it all though, he never gives up on his brother. Sean, especially if you play him in a moral way, is a near perfect example of a true hero. He overcomes any odds that stand in his way, despite the pain. No superpowers required. Just good old-fashioned determination.

Well... sort of.

Enter Daniel. Without spoiling too much, Daniel does have a power. What makes Sean's younger brother so interesting is that you don't actually control him. Daniel is his own person. All you can do is guide him. The first and second episodes are especially formative to his character. The game keeps track of the things you do with Daniel in the first half of the game, and his personality begins to form in the second half. Little things like teaching him how to skip stones to more major choices like encouraging him to use his powers or not all influence him to a degree. Anyone who says this game doesn't have meaningful choices has either only played through the game once or hasn't even completed it a first time. I will say that how much or little Daniel likes you is typically shown subtly through dialogue while his morality level is a lot more obvious. Daniel is a walking, talking consequence in the shape of a kid. Whether you like his character sort of varies, as that  can depend on how close you are with him. There are points in the game where Daniel can outright disobey you if he doesn't respect and love you as a brother. It can't be argued however, that Daniel is a genius way of adding long-lasting ramifications to the choices you make in a game that has a constantly shifting cast of characters. You've got this little kid absorbing everything you do and tell him. Have fun.

To wrap this up, all I can really say is Life is Strange 2, like the first one, is one of those love-it-or-hate-it games. Ironic, right? But it's that way for completely different reasons. I probably should have led with this, but I feel like if you DIDN'T like Life is Strange 1 and/or Before the Storm, you should still try this game out simply because it's that damn different. While the game's themes of police brutality, racism, and brotherhood aren't as palatable as the themes of its predecessors, I personally find it an even better game than the first (fight me). And to those who prefer the older games...look on the bright side. True Colors is coming out in September. Seems like Deck Nine wants to go back to what made LiS 1 so beloved. You guys will be able to revel in a new, hipster small town with a murder mystery. Just a few more months.

Seriously though. I doubt if they'll ever try to make a game even remotely similar to LiS 2 ever again. It was way too divisive for a series that's already kind of hated on. But hey. I had a damn good time playing through it. If you haven't played it, I hope you give it a shot.







P.S. Take a drink every time Sean says ""dude.""
P.P.S Why does this kid get punched so much in this game, dude?
P.P.P.S Maybe because he's a furry?

예약구매한 게 매우 후회되는 게임
재미도 의미도 교훈도 없고 버그는 몰입 안 될 정도로 많고 이럴거면 영화를 만드는 게 나았음. B급 감성이라는 소리라도 듣게

+애정하는 시리즈라서 그래도 좋게 봐주려고 했는데 주기적으로 생각남. 이렇게 못 만들 수도 있다는 사실에 화나서. 지금도 혈압오름. 저혈압인데 건강해질 것 같은 기분

+리뷰 작성하고 자꾸 할 말 떠올라서 미치겠음. 이게 바로 사랑인지?
1편의 '감성(비주얼, 음악)'을 제외한 모든 요소(구성, 스토리, 복선, 게임성 등등)에서 실패함. 스토리? 재미? 아무 상관 없다 난 >GAMSUNG<만 있으면 된다. 하는 사람이면 추천드림

스토리는 위기-해소-위기-해소-위기-해소의 반복. 해당 사건들 사이의 연결점도 공통된 주제도 없음. 특별히 카타르시스를 느낄 수 있는 지점도 없고... 비극도 어느 정도 상황이 나아질 것 같다는 희망이 있는 상태에서 추락해야 와닿지 처음부터 시궁창인 애들이 더 시궁창 되는데... 뭐 어쩌라고 되는 것...

재미나 게임성 측면에서 보자면 일단 게임 상 동선(조사/대화를 위해 주인공이 이동해야 하는 거리 내지 면적)이 불필요하게 길고 번거로움. 연출 상 특정 지점만 지루함을 일부러 유도하기 위해 그러는 거면 모를까 그냥 설계가 너무 허접함. 예컨대 진행을 위해 방 반대편에 있는 물건을 집어야 하는데 그 물건을 집고 나면 다시 또 반대편으로 가야 하는 걸 반복한다든지... 이러다 보면 지칠 수밖에 없음

또 1편 맥스의 사진 찍는 기믹 대신 그림을 그리는데, 이를 위해서 마우스/컨트롤러 조이스틱을 여러방향으로 미친듯이 휘저어야 한참에 걸려서 그림 한 장 그려짐. 컨트롤이 너무 조악하고 이때 대사 버그라도 나면 등장인물이 똑같은 말을 그림 다 그릴 동안(전혀 짧은 시간도 아님) 또하고 또하고 또하고 또하고 또하고... 그 외에도 조명 일부가 적용이 안 된다거나 동생이 길막해서 오브젝트 사이에 껴서 못 나온다거나(그 장면 처음부터 해야함) 담배연기가 물총새마냥 일직선으로 나간다거나 팔이 나무를 뚫는다거나 대사 순서가 뒤섞이는 등의 오만 가지 버그가 몰입을 방해함. 이건 절대 완성된 게임이 아님...

게다가 주인공이 아니라 주인공 동생이 초능력을 쓰고, 대화나 본인의 행동을 통해서 그걸 조정하는 것도 문제임. 신선한 시도이긴 하나 내가 어떻게 영향을 미쳤는지, 어느 정도까지 애가 영향을 받았는지 알 길이 없어서(1편은 이 선택지는 앞으로 영향을 미칠 것입니다... < 정도의 알림이라도 띄워줬음) 결과적으론 오히려 재미를 저해하는 요소로만 작용함. 특히 마지막에는 *엔딩 스포* [spoiler] 이 영향력 시스템 때문에 엔딩이 갈리니 더더욱 답답할 수밖에 없음. 게다가 초능력이 있는 데도 주변에 들킬까봐 최대한 안 쓰고 숨겨야 한다는 점이 참... [/spoiler]

게임은 실시간으로 입력이 없으면 금방 지루해지는 매체이기 때문에 효과음이라든지 사소한 디테일까지도 중독성있게, 보상받는 기분을 들게끔 디자인해야 함. 라이스 시리즈는  워킹 시뮬레이터인 시점에서 이러한 재미를 처음부터 반감하고 들어가는데(걷는 동선이 길 수록 플레이어는 지침), 1편은 초능력 기믹으로 이걸 상쇄할 수 있었음. 근데 라이스2는? 그런 거 없고 선택지도 한 번 고르면 땡이고... 라이스1의 장점을 전부 반대로 한 느낌임. 마치 1편이 무슨 흑역사라도 되는 것마냥..."
2576,This game really touched me. It's better than a session of therapy! I could evaluate my own decisions toward life by putting myself in Sean's shoes. No decision is easy even what you do with your best intentions might end up in pure chaos. This is the lesson I've learned.

2580,"Life is Strange 2 is one of the best in the Collection...
A story of two brothers who are wandering around USA
to reach the Mexico after their father gets killed in an accident.

This story has so much to tell and is full of emotions, you can
explore so much and interact with so many things around,
and actualy talk to almost anyone you meet...

The series are really going the good way and i hope next one 
will be as interesting as this one was.

If you have the previous games, i strongly recommend this one
because if you liked the others, you will like this one more...

2582,"I don't typically leave in-depth reviews. I'm shit at expressing my thoughts. I'll keep it short.

I see a lot of people saying this is a step down from the first. And they certainly have the right to that opinion. And while I agree that the first is a masterpiece, I think this game stands it's ground just as well as the first. It truly gives you a sense of responsibility as Sean. And it's messy in the best way. You will fuck up and make a wrong choice, but for me that was part of the message. Sean isn't perfect, and neither are you. All the while you're trying your best to guide Daniel, who admittedly can be a ""little shit"". But he's not perfect either. I really don't know what I'm trying to say with this review. Just go play the game and take your own meaning from it. It's masterfully crafted. Even the two little wolves in the save icon made me smile."

2590,"STEAM DOES NOT ACCURATELY TRACK HOURS WHEN PLAYING OFFLINE.
Another instalment of the emotional episodic way above the top choice simulator.
Life Is Strange 2 answers the question of; ""how would a Superman game be like if we had superheroes in real life?"" but it does not end there as instead of playing as the overpowered alien you instead play as his lawyer or butler or something. Like the games before it in this universe, this one is even more ambitious in terms of building relationships, choices, and the world itself. The world in this game is bigger than the other games, you enjoy some comfort and teenage stuff in the beginning and it all goes bad soon then you find out how hard life can be on the streets. Alone one can make certain choices but when coupled with a child you have to protect both physically and emotionally, you soon realize that some choices in life are not as easy as some people are given harder cards and thrown in the deep end. The game focuses on racism, society, crime, drugs, homelessness, survival and relationships. Like I said in the previous review space, LiS2 is even way more ambitious than the previous ones that the episodes themselves are even longer. Many complain that the choice system does not work for this one as Daniel would not listen to Sean sometimes and they feel it is a cheap way to drive the plot forward, personally, I think it is how life and its' relationships can become especially when the other party's demands/feelings are not catered to in a specific situation. After the ""accidental death"" of their father, the boys run away from the law knowing that after what happened they will be the ones taking the blame for the deaths they won't be able to explain. So Sean and Daniel decide to keep moving while thinking of solutions of where they could find safety to process everything. Daniel starts asking questions and suspects that Sean might be hiding some information from him about what has happened to their father, where is their mother and if he really has a plan. Life Is Strange 2 is another great emotional rollercoaster from the developers that has great hard-hitting writing that is inspired by real life situations people face on the daily.

2591,"I played this game from start to finish (25 hours woo!). The whole thing felt pretty unsatisfying and a slog compared to the first one and Before the Storm, both of which I do recommend. However, I came out of this utterly frustrated. This game isn't ""fun"". It's non-stop pain and suffering and felt like nothing you really did mattered in the end. The game *looks* good though, and there are some nice moments, but overall I think this game genuinely sucked. I'm hoping ""True Colours"" when it comes out isn't quite as frustrating to play."
2592,Very atmospheric game
2593,emotional roller coaster mainly filled with sadness
2594,"buy it, NOW!!
"
2595,":BUY ON DEEP SALE:
Not as good as the First Season. But it has its moments. 

Plot misses a lot of opportunities and the writing is clunky too often to ignore. But there are some good moments and the visuals are beautiful. Trigger warning for cringe overuse of religious/racist stereotypes, blasting any subtlety into space. Feels like it was made by a different team. However it still has those tweedy life moments where the camera wonders and the music's just right, the rest just doesn't hold to this standard. It's like a 6/10."
2596,Sean is a 10/10
2597,"Bittersweet, just like the first. Leaves you exhaling and staring out the window for the next hour, but it's a treat, and it's a solid story that really needs to be told. I didn't connect with these characters quite on the level I did with Chloe and Max and Rachel, but that's me personally. It's definitely solid, makes you cry, and really feel like I went on a journey, for sure.

Cheers, y'all."

2602,Love games like this but omg it was better then I expected
2603,"i love the game, the story is very captive!"
2604,Play it dont ask me
2605,"I'm divided on Life is Strange 2. It suffers from the inherent problem that any road trip story will - it doesn't really stop to build on its cast of side characters very often, which is the very thing that the first game excelled in doing. Chapter 3 is the closest we get to that, but after that you never see most of the characters again. Instead, the game focuses on your relationship with your brother, Daniel. Rather than having your decisions directly impact the course of the story like in LiS, here your actions influence Daniel as a person, which can get frustrating at times, because he's a nine year old boy and spending the whole game trying to be a good influence on him can make the experience feel rather tame.

In general I think DONTNOD tried to step up the realism of the story, with maybe the exception of Episode 4. It tackles racism and morality in a lot of ways that many developers wouldn't, and I think it works in its favour. I don't have the authority to say whether or not it's a well handled aspect to the game, but I've seen people both praise it highly and criticise it deeply.

At times I felt that Sean was a bland and unlikable protagonist, but I managed to get a bit teary at the end, so I guess they did something right. My main gripe with this game is purely personal - it just doesn't feel video-gamey enough. That being said, however, I did like it enough to play for over 20 hours, so there's that. If you like the first episode, you'll like most of the game."
2606,"one of the most amazing games ive ever played. the graphics, physics, interactions, character modeling, scripting, everything is so well done. the story is incredibly immersive and full of realistic emotion and interactions. couldnt recommend this more!"
2607,funny brothers with funny lives break my heart and ruin my day with really big decisions but i still love them
2608,love this game as a latina  it hit home
2609,"I saw the game on the vastness of YouTube from one of the letsplayers, got interested, and decided to play it myself. To be honest, I drowned in this game. Science fiction, detective, friendship... So many things and everything is so well connected!
Now popular games in the genre of ""Interactive cinema"", where the story develops from the actions of the player. Often, in such games, the time to choose is limited and you can not cancel the choice, which heats up interest in your story, and sometimes frustrates from the reluctance to go through everything up to that cherished moment. Dontnod Entertainment decided to remove these restrictions. Time is not running out, and thanks to the ability of Max, you can view all the selections and choose the most suitable one for yourself. Thanks to this, you immerse yourself in the game even more, relaxing and not worrying once again that you did not have time to read."

2618,"I was very excited to play Life is Strange 2, first one was awesome so I had high expectations and they were fullfied. 
Its different compare to first one but in good things. Its also awesome but in different way, story is different , characters are different , interesting plots, even some small connections to first one. 
I appreciate that after you are done with game, it left you with emotion to want much more and you gonna miss your antagonists, because it mean it did job, right. 

I loved all episodes, some more, some less. But lets make it clear:

Pros:
[*]Characters feel that they have their own story, life and interactions between them is very good and well made
[*] Scenery this time was much bigger and richer compare to LiS and I apprecite it, you got to see a lot of different places, which is nice change compare to LiS.
[*]Not same plot as LiS, similar but yet completely different 
[*]Story is very deep with you think about it.
[*]Main antagonists are very well made
[*]Very emotional driven, which is what you want from such game!
[*]Connection with F2P Captain Spirit game was very suprising and I liked it!

Cons:
[*]Not a real con but I could imagine more connections to LiS
[*]I can imagine story of Daniel and Sean could be continued, so again not really con as I think game was decently long enough for such game. 
[*]I feel that some characters could get bigger space.

I would give Life is Strange 2  9,5/10 !
Awesome game for everyone who like good and emotional story with interesting characters and plot."
2619,"As a big brother, this game had me hooked.  For sure play it if you're an older brother.  It'll bring out the big wolf in you."
2620,"Life is Strange 2 is a beautiful, technically sophisticated evolution of the LiS/LiS:Before The Storm formula. But I didn't like the Diaz brothers, the story of ""Trump's America"" as some reviewers put it feels like forcibly going through a checklist of all the major problems keeping American society from getting along and having to move on from every character you meet makes interactions either feel hollow or frustrating because you wish you had more time to explore that episode.

My choice of thumbs down is almost entirely based off a subjective response to me asking myself ""Did I have a good time?"" at the end of the game. There are great things here and every technical aspect of the game is top notch but 4/5 of the time I felt like I have to make myself get through it rather than looking forward to it so that's that. People with different sensibilities might have a wildly different experience and this review probably says more about me than the game.

Now more in depth... (Might contain minor thematic spoilers the further down you read)

[h1]Visuals, the world[/h1]
It's beautiful like I said, The art style feels similar to the previous games but more refined, more detailed. The drawings are cool, the locations you visit range from nice to highly memorable and striking. The atmosphere creation is pure magic proving that Dontnod's first breakthrough wasn't a one hit wonder in terms of creating amazing game worlds.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
If I liked the story I would probably say the soundtrack is outstanding and touching. As it is, despite everything there are still at least a couple of songs/instrumental pieces I'll definitely be returning to on a regular basis.

[h1]Narrative gameplay[/h1]
LiS1 has time control which was a revolutionary experience for a narrative game, LiS:Before the Storm had.. arguing? And stuff? Which wasn't as good but it was alright. LiS 2 has nothing. It just has choices. There's a superpower in the game but it isn't yours so there's almost no gameplay associated with it except for maybe at the very end and it's made all the more frustrating because it's wielded by your annoying little brother who always makes a mess of things. You, the player, are just along for the ride and this doesn't feel good and is not interesting.

[h1]The characters, the stories[/h1]
This is the problematic one for me. Throughout the game I went from wanting to give it a thumbs down, to thumbs up and back down again. Without spoiling it, chapter 3 was fantastic, it felt almost like the previous game's high I was chasing here but I just didn't have a good time with any of the other chapters and one encounter can't carry the entire game. 

Before getting into the other things, a lot of the choices you can make in the game feel fake. Sure the big ""choice split screens"" are fine but every time you're presented with a ""Yes let's do it"" or ""No, this is a bad idea"" choosing the latter will only make your character say ""We really shouldn't do this..... but ok let's go"". It's literally just like that and it's frustrating every time. If there's no choice to be made, don't give me a choice option that looks like I can say ""no"" when the only options are ""yes"" and ""no but yes"".

All the characters are good on their own - they are a great version of their concept. Same deal with their environments but the only thing you can really bond with in the game is your little brother since you're always on the run. For me this is an issue because I hate his (Daniel's guts), he's a little annoying brat and literally to blame for every bad thing that happens in the game including the premise. The characters you control yourself, the big brother Sean, is at his best, bland.

I genuinely liked plenty of the characters you meet, especially the farm gang. Cassidy and Finn are easily the two most likeable and interesting characters in the game. Let me just get this out of the system - the game would have been so much better if it had been just about the runaways. But every chapter you have to meet a new set of characters that you never see again and you're stuck with your brother and whatever mess Daniel caused.

All the stories are centered around one or another of America's social issues. I get it, it's important. I also agree with the message contained in pretty much all of these ""lessons"" but it's just so fatiguing seeing this stuff constantly in the news, in the wild and on every social media. I don't need it in my videogames as well, it isn't fun, it's not bittersweet, it's just exhausting and depressing especially when the narrative bounces you from one big social problem to another offering no solace at the end of any of them.

Life is Strange 1 and Before the Storm are my favourite games of all time (no exaggeration). And as such I can't help but compare the sequel set in the same game world to those games. In a way I guess LiS 2 is a victim of its predecessors success? Those games managed to tackle important issues and dramatic situations with real consequences and still feel sincere and nostalgic and comforting all the way through in the face of it all. Maybe it was because I found Max relatable and because Chloe was cool but having no ""superpower"" in your control robs the game of what made the series blow up. Having a single setting also goes a long way.

[h1]Looking ahead[/h1]
Despite all this I guess the entry, from a lore perspective, fits in well with the rest of the LiS world. I don't regret playing it but I didn't have a lot of fun. With all the technical advances and kept tone, I'm still very hype for LiS True Colours though. The trailer already looked more promising than LiS2's ever did to me."
2621,"Boring story, it's like watching a movie and sometimes you get to interact. 
Sean is annoying as hell and makes decisions out of the players control that make NO SENSE. 
Voice acting is pretty terrible, but mostly for Sean.
Woke story, annoying story. Sean is annoying. 
I give it a 3/10"
2622,this is literally the saddest game i have ever played in my life
2623,"I really loved this game. I have a few minor issues but I honestly could call them nitpicks if it really came down to it. while the first game has great characters and an interesting premise, story wise, the second shines much brighter, and the relationship between Sean and Daniel is one of the best sibling relationships I've ever seen. on top of that, the animation and writing has significantly improved. this opinion my change as I have yet to play True colours but for now I can definitely call this my favourite LIS game. ♥"
2624,It's thrilling and you really start feeling you that you live in the world of the story. And get really emotional
2625,nice story huh. lghdtv go brrr...
2626,"this game is beautiful, heart-wrenching, and totally perfect. one of my favorite games."
2627,it is a very heart warming game.
2628,great game
2629,Muito muito muito bom
2630,Fantastic Story!
2631,"Honestly, almost everything about this game is better than the first one.  Story, relationships, characters actually looking at each other when they speak, the dialogue fitting together instead of being able to tell that the phrases were all recorded separately b/c intonation and emphasis is all weird... the only things I liked better in the first game were the music, framing, and lighting.

Definitely pushed out the original Life is Strange as my top favorite game."
2632,"I forgot that this game existed for quite a while, before eventually installing it, seeking an in-depth story. What I DEFINITELY forgot, was that the game is listed as ""Free"" but that technically is only the first chapter of the game. I have nothing against big name Triple A companies getting the payment they deserve, but at 8 dollars per chapter, THREE YEARS after the game came out, I will now be resorting to youtube to find out where the story goes. Or maybe it'll be on sale some day. Either way, 32$ three years after the fact, is far too steep of a cost. I remember getting the original game for significantly cheaper much closer to release."
2633,gut
2634,I like it
2635,"Amazing game, I don't have words to describe how good it is! It's amazing as Life is Strange 1!"
2636,iconic
2637,"Great game, great story, great visuals.  major upgrade from first installment in the franchise.  Loving where this is going and already super stoked for Life is Strange 3 True Colors!"
2638,Everything about any life is strange game is just *chefs kiss*
2639,"Highly Recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Story rich Choices matter games. The Journey that Sean and Daniel go on through the 5 episodes will really grip you and make you feel all kinds of emotions. 

If i had to rate each episode:

Episode 1 - 8/10 - Great introduction to the characters but did feel a bit slow at times.
Episode 2 - 7.5/10  - Very slow episode, But does pick up in the last third where your choices really affect the characters
Episode 3 - 9.5/10 - Side characters are fantastic, Lots of tense moments, Great choice Options & Fantastic soundtrack.
Episode 4 - 8/10 - Very Intense throughout. Great choices, a couple of parts did drag out too long.
Episode 5 - 9/10 - Shocking & great moments all throughout. Some slow moments at the camp, but overall very good

Gotta give it a 8.5/10 overall. Would of give it a 9/10 if the pacing was a little better at some parts."
2640,"I really liked the first Life is Strange. It was charming, compelling and well-structured, but the world of boarding schools and small towns was far enough away from the facts of my own youth that I could appreciate the story at a certain distance. 

Life is Strange 2, on the other hand, hit me like an emotional freight train. It remains the only video game to ever make me cry and I think pretty much every chapter managed it at some point. Partly, this is due to more personal experiences of my own around poverty and so on, but it is also that the makers of the game more confidently hit their stride in this instalment. 

The central relationship between the two brothers is beautiful and heart-breaking, as is seeing them both grow as individuals. The specifics of the younger brother's super power and how it is discovered raises the stakes in a way that invests you in their relationship and, as a result, pushes you into the role of a significantly older sibling. Each chapter is structured for maximum emotional impact in a way that might feel manipulative if you hadn't readily signed up for the experience and by the end I was little in awe at the writers' abilities to move my emotions.

I will make the small critical note that sometimes the protagonist acts in a way that feels a little unpredictably to the side of the option you pick but never to the extent that their character comes to feel inconsistent. It is, of course, also not a game for those who want their video game narratives to be light and breezy. It is a dark narrative that deals with a lot of unpleasant traumatic experiences and even the light and happy moments of the game offer little relief, often feeling very plausibly, and tragically, fragile. 

But, if you can deal with the narrative's emotional weight, it is quite simply a beautifully constructed narrative of coming of age in a hostile environment."
2641,Aww Sean
2642,the first one was better
2643,it hurts so much....FUCK
2644,holy. sh... so so good. broke my heart & made me cry like a BABY. los hermanos lobos for life
2645,yo
2646,it is very good.
2647,"The second version is weaker than the first one and Before the storm in many factors, story never makes me satisfied. But the game is still respectable for me and it's worth playing once."
2648,"Having played the masterpieces Life is Strange and Before The Storm, I bought this game with high expectations for a continuity in the amazing Life is Strange series. Unfortunately this was not the case with this game. The character depth and the storyline is hardly half as attractive as that of the first games. Not at a single point of it I felt lost in the world of this game. After a point I felt more bored than captivated."
2649,"Engaging, heart wreching, stunningly beautiful, and masterfully put together scenery and story line as usual. Quite simply brilliant . . .   Dont cheat yourself out of this marble of a game wich i put of playing for way to long due to other pressing things."
2650,น้องไม่ใช่เด็กเปรต 5555 เราแค่ต้องพยายามเข้าใจน้องเฉยๆ เนื้อเรื่องเดายากมาก ทวิสไปทวิสมา มีอะไรให้เซอร์ไพรส์ตลอด ถือว่าควรค่าแก่การเสียเวลาเล่น แต่รู้สึกเนื้อเรื่องจะสั้น/จบง่ายกว่าภาคแรกไปนิดหน่อย
2651,"I love the first Life is Strange, which may have been one reason why I didn't play the second game for so long. I didn't want to be disappointed. I wasn't, even though Life is Strange 2 doesn't hold nearly the same standing with me as the first. 

The qualities of the series have basically remained the same. An emotional story, multi-layered main characters and an atmospheric presentation. Still, I wasn't even half as emotionally invested in the story as I was in the first installment or Before the Storm. One of the reasons will surely be that the life shown in the first part has far more to do with my own than the story of two Latino brothers on the run. The game does a good job of conveying the problems that can arise specifically for this population group. Still, one of my criticisms is that it's obvious the story is trying to take a strong stance in an ongoing social debate.  Conveying certain moral views is not a bad thing per se, it's just that the approach is not very subtle at times. The authors leave no doubt about their political views, which is damaging to the story in some parts, as it ends in a clichéd scenes and a negative portrayal of some characters which is close to a caricature. Even as someone who in principle shares these political views and also clearly approves of the basic message of the story, I would have often wished for a less political/one-sided presentation here. 

The story is nevertheless quite captivating, even if the ending is not entirely logical in my eyes. If you were a fan of the first part, you won't be disappointed, even if it depends on your personal background and sympathies whether the game comes close to the predecessor."
2652,yes i am only on the first episode and i want to protect daniel with my life. innocent angel :/
2653,"Jogo incrivel. Diferente dos outros jogos da franquia, esse possui um sistema de escolhas muito melhor que os outros, trazendo uma ""relação"" com um personagem por exemplo, que pode provocar um evento inesperado. A história também é muito boa e intrigante. Não apenas o caminho dos irmãos me deixou ""maravilhado"" como também retrata alguns tópicos um pouco mais complicados, como racismo, religião..."
2654,Just as good as the first one if not better. The story drags you in a roller coaster of emotions from the begining to the end. 10/10 would cry again
2655,"LiS2 is a nice addition for genre fans. The invisible karma system and moral mechanics between player and brother work well for the most part and hold up to the end. It features some moments that stick with you after the game has ended. Compared with its predecessor, however, those moments are somewhat rare imho and the storytelling feels thin over longer stretches. The game deserves special kudos for choosing a “road movie” story: each chapter features new settings (think development cost) and the designers deserve a big shout out, especially for Chapter 4."
2656,Amazing!
2657,"This is by far my favorite story game ever, I loved the bond between Sean and Daniel, Daniel made me suffer several times and I actually felt like he was my little brother, I cared for him deeply and Sean, well I kinda understand how difficult it can be to have to grow up in a moment because you need to protect someone you love, someone you need to actually teach otherwise things will get out of control and they often do no matter what you choose. Thank you for this game, it earned a place in my heart and several tears, please play it, I never leave reviews but this game deserves it"
2658,"This game is long for these type of games. Which is a good thing. Great cast, voice acting, and story. Every decision matters. Looking forward to the next one."
2659,solid
2660,i don't give an actual DAMN what you think about this series. you need to play this right now
2661,Its a good game (spoiler warning: The dad dies and I almost cried)
2662,"Really loved the game! 
Epic story between brothers running away from the police to find peace.
Honestly Life is Strange 1 and Before the Storm a bit more but this is also a very good one!"
2663,"This was a beautiful game, and it really did an amazing job shining light on racism in America. The only thing negative I would have to say about this game is that Daniel is literally the reason why I don't wanna have kids of my own."
2664,"Really wished to see more Arcadia Bay references...

Was really interesting the way I could interact with the story and people around me while still having a solid story.
I just wish there was more put into the Puerto Lobos, even though it was quite clear for it to be just the final destination in the game.
+Nice soundtrack.
+Good stable FPS (200-700)

I do wish though that this had some fucked up shit in the BG like LIS2 had. (but maybe it wouldve been too obvious then)"
2665,"It's like a combination of La Raza and Boy's Life Magazine ❗  Were it done from the popular character Lyla Park's point of view, I think it would have been able to reach a much larger audience. YES the social/political issues it brings up need to be addressed and, after an administration exceptionally hostile to America's Latinx community this is quite appropriate but, having witnessed and experienced these issues in real life I found the game rather traumatizing. This came out well before the white police killings of George Floyd and 13 year old Adam Toledo and, we have a case of life imitating art that's hardly coincidental. LIS 2 could provide insight to those unfamiliar with the effect systemic racism has on Latinx families and, find understanding with those who are forced to live it. 😢"
2666,It is an amazing story about brotherhood and loss. I highly recommend you play this master piece. I was only not fully satisfaied with the ending because there were some stories that were not resolved.
2667,Great great game! Almost made me cry when Brody had to leave in the episode 1. Gonna keep playing the next.
2668,Best Life is Strange so far.
2669,its cool
2670,"pretty good if u like uh games :D
"
2671,"5 hours in, still trying to understand how did the younger brother achieved his power. Overall in terms of gameplay design and graphics, game looks great and feels good to play."
2672,"this one hurt, I cried like a baby. 10/10 would cry to again"
2673,10/10
2674,"This is the third Life is Strange game I've played, and I love every single one of them. Definitely worth the playthrough, would also recommend doing the other 2 first before this one (while it wont affect the overall story, your choices from the previous games actually do crossover into this game). Can't wait for the next one to come out this year!"
2675,"I decided to pick up this game since I loved the first Life is Strange.  I just got finished the final episode and can honestly say I was blown away by the story lines.  I will admit that the first episode was kinda weak, but Im glad I decided to keep going.  This game had me crying, feeling shocked and also excited throughout it's entirety.  Only thing that I wish was that you could reverse what you decide in real time, like the first game did.  Also, ""Spoiler Alert"" [spoiler] if you reach the 4th episode there is a nostalgic surprise for you if you played the first Life is Strange. [/spoiler]  I don't want to give too much away.  All in all, it's worth playing if you enjoy choosing your own destiny on how the story should go.  Also the graphics/visuals are stunning."
2676,Fascinating characters and captivating storyline
2677,"DAMN! I love this game. A continuation of the the thematic style of storytelling that began with the first Life Is Strange, with some clever tie-ins to the first game, however the plot and characterisation has got it's own unique style. As someone who grew up in a lower-working-class household, the world itself seemed very believable and the characters felt nuanced and multifaceted. I appreciated the fact that just like in real life, you can be anticipating something strongly only to have plans completely alter or fall through entirely. There's a lot of optional lore if you poke around at things - even in the scenery there are a surprising amount of details you can totally miss if you don't take your time with some of the scenes. Also it really nails mood-tone - I really felt a lot of empathy for the characters. If you're a fan of the first Life is Strange or games as a medium for storytelling, you can't go wrong here. Also, give the free tie-in prologue, The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, a go as well, it's a worthy, if bite-sized, piece of the whole."
2678,"I keep wanting to think this game has a good story and will draw me in, then they through in another politically biased statement or race driven propaganda. I'm going to try and play through episode 2, but so far episode 1 has fallen flat.

I'll write a more in depth review on the weaker mechanics and premise when/if I get through the second episode. If I don't update this in a month, assume it was that bad."
2679,yes
2680,cool
2681,cool story bob
2682,"[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]
I’ve seen a ton of mixed comments over the years about the story of this game, so I went in expecting to be pretty let down, but honestly, I wasn’t at all. Sure, there are only a handful of recurring characters since Sean and Daniel are always on the road and traveling, so there’s not as many people to get to know and care about like in the first Life is Strange, but I think this was a cool storytelling experiment. I definitely didn’t love it as much as the first Life is Strange or Before the Storm, but I’m glad this exists.

There’s definitely some valid complaints about the writing though, and some aren’t unique to Life is Strange 2. It can sometimes be super obvious that  middle-aged people are writing some of this cringey Gen Z dialogue. Also, almost every time Sean inspected an object and expressed a thought about it, he’d start off with “shit” or “fuck.” Don’t get me wrong, I love me some goddamn motherfucking shitting ass cursing, but it felt really forced in an attempt to be edgy. 

I thought the overall story was pretty well told though, even if some parts require suspension of disbelief. Daniel could be a pretty stupid kid, but he’s like 9 years old. So, not atypically stupid. I’ve also seen comments that the choices didn’t really matter, but I can’t really agree with that. There’s not a large recurring cast of characters, but the choices you make with those characters do have noticeable differences. There are several endings to this game, and they’re wildly different. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It’s a modern take on a Point-and-Click, so the gameplay is pretty minimal. However, in the early chapters of this game, a big deal is made about managing the small amount of money that Sean’s carrying with him. You’re given the choice to buy or steal food and equipment, and Sean makes several comments about how little money they have left for more food. But after the first chapter, it just doesn’t matter anymore. The money stays in your inventory, but it’s never touched on again. I thought the story would put Sean in some tricky situations if I allowed him to run out of money and he needed to provide for himself and Daniel, but it never did. I think this is a missed opportunity to tie story choices and gameplay together in some simple and interesting ways. 

[h1]Politics[/h1]
I’ve also seen many comments over the years of people wanting developers to “keep politics out my games.” And that’s just the dumbest fucking thing I’ve ever heard. To quote Brody from this game, “Everything is political.” 

People may like to think politics is this cordoned off “sport” that matters once every 4 years and only lives in Washington, D.C., but it’s not. Flint, Michigan still doesn’t have clean water. As of this writing, over 500K people have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. Government, politics, and elections have real, tangible consequences on our daily lives. 

That’s one of the core messages of this game. Yeah, it does demonize Trump and it does demonize racist and xenophobic people. As it should. I won’t apologize, nor should anyone else apologize, for forcing racist and xenophobic people to confront their own hateful ideologies and rhetoric. 

Maybe you’re not one of those people and you just feel that the social commentary in the game was too “in your face.” I can understand how’d you’d form that opinion, but I’d only ask that you consider how “in your face” the demonization of minority groups has been in the U.S. in recent memory. 

[h1]Technical[/h1]
I have very few technical complaints, but the one that I’ll always be vocal about, whether it’s to praise or criticise a developer is [b]ultrawide support[/b]. There’s no native ultrawide support in this game, but [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Life_Is_Strange_2]thanks to PCGW, that can be fixed in 30 seconds with minimal issues[/url]. The artwork and cutscenes work perfectly in ultrawide. There’s a couple pre-rendered 16:9 cutscenes and a few in-engine scenes where the characters spawn outside the 16:9 view port, but within the 21:9 view port, which is a tad bit distracting. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Life is Strange 2 is a great game. It’s not quite as good as the original or prequel, but Sean and Daniel’s story is undoubtedly worth experiencing, and the social commentary on America’s deep-rooted issues with racism and xenophobia are a message worth hearing for everyone, even if it’s just to virtually walk a mile in another person’s shoes."
2683,"Life is Strange 2 is an interesting game. If there was a maybe option for ""Do you recommend this game?"" I would select it. I don't think this game is for everyone and I did have some issues with the game. That being said I did enjoy the game overall and wanted to see it to the end.

[hr][/hr] 
Below is a more detailed breakout of the good and the bad of Life is Strange 2.

[hr][/hr] 
[b]The good:[/b] [list]
  [*] I really enjoyed the music within the game. The main tracks were very pleasent and calming.
  [*] The story premise was interesting and something I haven't seen explored much previously.
  [*] The voice acting was fairly well done. 
  [*] The choices felt like they were important. In a game like this it is important to have these occassionally. I did not look into it to see if the other outcomes were drastically different but the results of my choices seemed to play out properly. [/list]
[b]The bad:[/b][list]
  [*] There was some pacing issues and time that felt drawn out for the sake of each episode being a certain length. This made it feel like slog to get through at times and made the experience less enjoyable.
  [*] The story felt a little disjointed at times with major shifts in direction that were unexpected. This is mostly an issue because paired with the drawn out pace it was tough to get into a few of the episodes. There were multiple times I put the game down for an extended length because of this.
  [*] I wasn't a huge fan of the ending although it did feel like a true conclusion. [/list]"
2684,"This game is so beautiful, but can get a little boring. Perfect game to play before bed as you don't have to worry about getting too excited and not being able to sleep after. The plot's simple but heartwarming and I found myself getting really invested in the tale of the Wolf Brothers. I just wish that every episode wouldn't follow the exact same formula where you get a slow start with lots of exploring, then build to somewhat of a climax, which gets resolved really quickly and often not logically. Would be awesome if they made the last episode to be the climax of the entire series instead. Overall, I thought the good endings were satisfying and I did have a good time playing this game."
2685,"If you like the first one, you'll like this one too"
2686,"my wife and me playing this together
she said she liked it and to write it a good review
so here i am please rate it for meeee??
or she will be angry at me again please friends"
2687,"Played it while my BF watched, beautiful game, beautiful and sentimental gameplay. Life is strange 1 was amazing. Can't wait to play more of this."

2689,"This game is amazing from the story to the options you pick, its filled with so many emotions which i can't even describe till you play it yourself.  Amazing 10/10 would recommend."
2690,"I enjoyed it much more than the first one- even though i typically warm to female protagonists much better, Sean felt like a very real and relatable guy and the love between the brothers felt very real. The dialogue is vastly improved this time over, the characters actually talk like real people which was my main criticism of LIS 1, although the story was good, the dialogue was jilted, cringy, and HELLA too much. This time around it felt very real, the story was nicely paced, Daniel and Sean were portrayed accurately as a younger and older brother. I think the people putting this game down are just major fans of Chloe and Max and just want them. The improvements made by the developers this time round didnt leave any room for clunky interactions with the controls, or awkward or unrealistic dialogue. I really enjoyed it and really cared about Sean throughout and at times made me emotional.
ps. hats off to the devs for actually showing female nipples in plain, natural, sight, and without oversexualization. I enjoy a game that is not AFRAID to breach such serious topics such as acceptance of lgbtq, police brutality, poc and the struggles Sean faces as one, yet do it in such a light and natural way, not shoving anything in your face, yet brushing these topics just enough, and i like the continuation of this on from LIS1. It is what makes the series special."

2692,"This is nothing like the first game. This is just mediocre and the plot is awful. Every single episode follows the same script and ends always with you running away every single time. This is the last time I will ever buy a game in this franchise. Just play the first game if you want a great experience, this one in the end is just a cash grab."
2693,y e s
2694,i like i go in forest and i build campfire epic
2695,"Life is Strange 2 enhances the narration by introducing a more sophisticated mechanism for choices and consequences - instead of one character, now the player's choices will affect both Sean and Daniel. Not to mention the choices are trickier than the first season. The story is well-written with no plot holes, plus some of the choices in the game did affect the way the story goes in a great degree. Along with breathtaking landscapes and carefully composed soundtrack by returning composer Jonathan Morali (to suit each scene in the game), Life is Strange 2 is qualified as the successor of previous games in my opinion."
2696,"Not a bad game, tho I really don't know how you guys managed to cast someone so bad for Sean's voice acting while Lyla's voice actor is like 10/10. He seriously lacks emotion. Even the little kid, Daniel has a better voice actor. Even his angry voice feels extremely fake.
He's either very untalented or he was forced to partake lol

Not a bad story, can be fun from time to time, I'd still wait for a sale tho.
Wish we had more interaction with Lyla, her voice actress did a great job imho

My rating for the game is 6/10 overall"
2697,gay
2698,i said yes
2699,"It was one of my favourite games of all time. The storyline is amazing!!! I was a bit worried in the beginning because I didn't feel very much emotion but it got more and more emotional. I cried for days after I finished it. Would recommend this game to everyone! You should know though that there are A LOT of cutscenes and stuff like that so if you're more into physical gameplay then maybe this isn't he best game for you to play, but I still recommend you give it a chance."
2700,"Overrated, full of useless choices and moralistic as hell. My ex-wife in a nutshell."
2701,ok
2702,"this game, right here is a fking masterpiece . This game has two moods :- peaceful and sad . Overall a really very good experience"
2703,"Listen, this game, I swear I'm sobbing. I don't cry often but the combination of the story, the visuals, the soundtrack and the incredible voice acting is just so touching. I think the first game is better action-wise, but this one definitely is better story wise. Another BIG improvement is the amount of endings and how you influence it. LiS1 only had 2 endings, this one has like 7 depending on what you do throughout the five episodes. The connection and relationship you get with Sean and Daniel definitely got to me more than Max and Chloe's - which also got to me, btw.

The only people that probably don't like this game are the ones who are still in denial of police brutality and don't like being confronted with the reality that queer people of color face."
2704,"Дисклеймер: мне не хватило терпения пройти эту нудятиную до конца, поэтому мой обзор не может считаться полным. be warned.
Я с удовольствием прошел первую часть. Не смотря на скудные текстуры и анимацию, игра обладала необычным сюжетом, эмпатичными персонажами и довольно обширным миром, который можно было исследовать. Узнавая новые подробности о том что происходит.
Затем был небольшой сиквел, слабоватый, но всеравно принесший удовольствие от игры.
И вот долгожданная Вторая часть! Выглядит шикарно, в этот раз видно что бюджет пущен на визуальные красоты, да еще и какие! Почему же я не рекоммендую игру? 
Потому что это не игра, а синематика. Вам по просту не дают поиграть. Ритм таков: 30 секунд геймплея - 15 минут катсцена. 
Возможно, у нее и была бы своя ниша, если бы сценарий захватывал, а персонажи вызывали эмоции (кроме раздражеия). Но увы.
И да: вам НЕ ДАЮТ возможности пропускать катсцены. Наверное, когда-нибудь я наберусь сил и просмотрю ее до конца."
2705,Such a great story comming from such a great franchise
2706,"played for 10 hours str8 and only got up to go to the bathroom, cried so hard after finishing it. phenomenal game."
2707,wow
2708,Best story ever ^~^
2709,Great game
2710,good
2711,"Nice game, adventure, nature and family bonds. I spent a good time playing it.
An only minus I can think about is that this game is worse than previous LiS parts"
2712,"Overall, this game is more or less OK, but still feels a huge step below Life is Strange 1. The story is not very focused and has no clear stakes, so failed to really catch my attention. The powers are not very integrated into the gameplay, making the game blander than the first opus. 

The worst part is the slow pace of the game coupled with the low interactivity. Dialogs are somewhat... artificial? stilted? with weird pauses when people talk with another. At some points I just had to do something else in the meantime (like reading a book) as focusing on the game only became tedious.

There are still some very good aspects (the music is terrific, some scenes can even be impressive, and many of the characters are quite good, unfortunately not the two main ones...), but I am not going to recommend a game I had to let ""play"" in the background."
2713,".
"
2714,yes/maybe
2715,"I thought life is strange didn't need a sequel, let alone two, but after trying to suffer through the first episode I'm very sure it didn't need sequels."
2716,i like it
2717,where was the banana mode?? i dont care about these little kids and their little baby sob stories! i want banana! i am furious and angry!
2718,It`s such an interesting and exciting game with great stories...i really love it!
2719,The Story... . it's something else you gotta play it.
2720,"i caught my grandkid playing this
guess what he ain't playing now!
ha ha!"
2721,Absolutely immersive and comforting at the same time. Is a feeling of close family that u only get when u play this work of art
2722,"Absolutely brilliant. Every episode is worth playing.
The previous Life Is Strange games had quite a bit of filller, but this game feels like it knew exactly what it was doing with the story the whole time.
The final decision felt like one of the hardest choices to make yet, and the ending capped the story off really well, besides a few minor plotholes"
2723,Very cool i like this game!
2724,"A great game, probably one of the greatest of it's type! It advances the gameplay mechanics of the first game, and it has way improved graphics engine as well. I was very happy with the way the story unfolds and the desicions I had to make.

Overall a great game."

2730,"wish more people would create things like this game to increase awareness against discrimination. also, easter eggs."
2731,gg
2732,"Not a bad game overall. It started off really well at first, and I became very attached to the characters. But then, Daniel does sooooooo much stupid shit and he doesn't listen to you, and he doesn't learn from his mistakes either. He pretty much fucks over your whole life (in this game ofc)"
2733,"While I didn't get the better variation of it, I got the Redemption ending, and that's all that matters. I also cried the hardest I have in, now that I actually think about it, close to a decade."
2734,"Unfortunately, Life is Strange 2 is an interactive story I did not enjoy.

Unlike other games of the genre the dialog options feel very half assed and that they're there to remind you that you're playing a game. Most of the time you don't even choose the dialog your character, Sean, is saying.

I personally didn't feel any attachment to the characters, not even the main two Sean and Daniel. I found Daniel to be a little annoying and irritating. This made making choices in the game not matter and I didn't find myself caring about the consequences of doing irrational things.

If you're interested in experiencing an engaging, emotional story that creates memorable characters then you would be better going elsewhere."
2735,"Quality as expected from the series. As before, the internal monologue can be awkward, and some of the scripting is weird, but overall the stories are intense, creative, and enjoyable. I cannot wait for 3! Very excited."
2736,!!!HANDS DOWN BEST GAME EVER!!!
2737,fire
2738,Very good
2739,game about strong sexual love between two brothers
2740,very good
2741,"character and story are not as interesting as the first one, and i think that the early episodes have pace problems but still pretty good"
2742,Totally worth it
2743,"By far the worst entry in the series. 
This is a story of two unlikeable leads making idiotic, moronic, unthinkably poor choices in a plot driven by a series of highly improbable events, and with a side of ham-fisted social commentary.  
"
2744,"As a sequel to the masterful 1st game, Life is Strange 2 did a good job following it up. It kept most of the elements about the first game that are good like the acoustic guitar and the amazing scenery. When you first play it, you will know that you are still playing a Life is Strange game. However, one thing to note is that the story does take a little while to ramp up. The story of the first game is engaging right from the back, where as for this game it took maybe until the 3rd episode. The first two episodes are a bit too slow, but some people like it because it allows you to enjoy the journey of the Diaz brothers more. After the story ramps up it becomes really engaging. The relationships between the characters is one that can make you weep. Overall, amazing sequel. 8.8/10"
2745,"one of the most incredible and heartwarming storylines i have ever played. it demonstrates real life problems and you really get so attached to the characters. my favorite game ever i absolutely love it. PLAY IT!!!! i would still write this review, even if i wasn't only doing it for the steam badge lol"
2746,"I recommend this game.

* This review will be updated further on *"
2747,its okay
2748,"In the first 3 episodes, I find this game so boring and doesn't make sense. I always find their motivation to run away weak and not reasonable enough. But I keep on playing until episodes 4-5 when the game becomes good. At this point, I wouldn't say the whole game is good, but I would say episodes 4-5 make up for it, enough for me to like this game. I like how they talk about sexuality, racism, and family. However, this is not as good compared to LIS1 & LIS: BTS. So I don't recommend buying at full price.
Overall it's a  7/10 ★★★★★★★☆☆☆"
2749,"incredible game, tops the first 2 games by far. completely worth the money."
2750,"absaloutly mindblowing storyline , the life is strange game series as a whole is breathtaking. i rekon i cry at least 5 times each episode because im simply just that attached to the characters and all the emotions that are involved<3"
2751,"haven't finished the whole game yet, but most of the consequences are unpredictable which makes the story a whole lot better. im definitely recommending this game (as well as the first LiS games) to my friends even tho its quite old. aside from the life lessons the first two games had taught me, this series makes me think about my choices irl lmao i love you square enix <3333 (y)"
2752,its got a real burning man vibe at times. i love it
2753,lindo s2
2754,Made me cry so...
2755,"This game was Ok, you cant compare it to Life is strange 1. Life is strange 1 was way way way more better. I mean this game isn't bad at all, but I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I did when I played as young Max. Life is strange 1 had a completely different emotional meaning. Life is strange 2 is a game where ""nothing much happens"". Simply, young Max's life in college was much better. That's why I have to give this game a negative rating."
2756,"Great ""interactive movie"" game. Felt like the choices had more impact than the first game, loved the ""Captain Spirit"" freebie too."
2757,this game is just a yes for me
2758,"Abuse Simulator 2018: ""Here's something nice. Now I'ma take it away and it's all your fault."""
2759,"I'm not saying this game is bad or anything , but compared to the first game , the first one had way much better story than this one, to be honest i was kinda bored when i play this game, the story feels like, you know simply boring, there was no suspense toward the end of the last episode, just like the first one did, but despite all that , i still love the art style, the soothing music , it's relaxing."
2760,"Don't... just don't play it. Whoever was that wrote the story for this should be put in jail.

LiS1 was a game I would love to forget and play again.

This, however, I would only forget."
2761,"Awesome story, awesome gameplay, nothing much to say besides that it's a must play kind of game :D"

2763,"If you are a fan of story-based adventures with characters you can become invested in, then the Life is Strange games are for you.

To put it simply, I loved this game.  It is a beautiful love story about family and an emotional tale of choices, protecting those we love, and forgiveness/redemption. 

DONTNOD has done another amazing job of telling a story, building unique and wonderful characters, and effectively implementing 'choices matter' as you play.  Behind the scenes, you are building a character that leans towards 'morality' or 'family at all costs.'  This, coupled with the relationships you build along the way, drives you towards different endings.

As with the original Life is Strange, the art. voice acting and music are exceptional.  The game introduces new mechanics for Sean to sketch and for Daniel to use his telekinesis powers (at Sean's request).  Other than that, the game uses standard keys (WASD to move and E to interact) and I found it easiest to play with a keyboard and mouse.

For achievement hunters, a chapter select menu is available to either (1) allow you to circle back for missed achievements without disrupting your main game or (2) to restart your main game mid-chapter to change decisions that you've made. The game is automatically saved regularly so you can quit at almost any time without losing much progress.

Life is Strange 2 is a stand alone game. However, those who have played the original Life is Strange and the free Captain Spirit will be delighted by the tie-ins.  I highly recommend this game!"
2764,A real journey.
2765,"hi this is my first review and this says a lot. this game hits all aspects of society and how it is now and how worse it got when trump got elected. it covers topics like LGBT, brotherhood, police brutality, abuse, and other topics. this game has a 100% replay value since you can influence Daniel and sean. this game has bought me to tears for the past three days and i have no regrets. im so happy a game like this shined on those topics today and let others know that you're not alone or things that people sweep under the rug. buy this game, you wont regret it."
2766,spent 10 minutes trying to find the right wrench and 20 minutes trying to find a towel. shit game
2767,amazingly interesting plot
2768,O Primeiro episódio é definitivamente muito bom! Acabei de comprar o segundo e pretendo terminá-lo hoje! Vamos ver o desenrolar o primeiro foi muito divertido de jogar!
2769,"The only good thing about this game was that there were several big rocks shaped like penises and that's about it. Stinky hippies, religious cult,writing shits the bed after first chapter, and hot shower scene 10/10. Collectibles were epic. Max shows up and fucking dies and so does Sean."
2770,"The most beautiful game. 10/10.

Bug 1: Stuck at the hospital. Cannot exit the sketchbook, hit right mouse button before focus
Bug 2: Man in the desert, it's very hard to pick a choice by moving the mouse"
2771,"Based on the Achievement Stats, this game is criminally underrated. For an episodic adventure, it does keep you on your toes. The story is really good, and very well acted and performed.  The music timed out very well, and sometimes the game lets the natural sounds take over. Much better than the first game in my book.

Highly recommended!"
2772,"Meh, I don't bother ..."
2773,"I like life is strange series as a story and execution, but the liberal propaganda is a bit all over everything. And i hate politics. Don't get me wrong I kinda dislike right wingers as well, but havent met their propaganda bullstuff in videogames"
2774,.
2775,"Amazing storyline with beautiful graphics, covers topics of social injustice, and highlights the importance of family. This game is a treasure!"
2776,overall just an awesome game
2777,"idk how i feel about this. I mean its good so far, it just seems kinda rushed"
2778,family
2779,My Pen now.
2780,weed.
2781,first is ussualy the worst but not here still like first buy or else.
2782,"An interesting entry in the series, though I personally didn't find it really *compelling* until like chapter 4. Not that coming back to play was a chore, but I didn't have that desire for five more minutes at 3 am until fairly late in the game. As always, Dontnod doesn't shy away from hard topic, in this case racism. It's easy enough to look at this and go ""hurr durr, this is all liberal propaganda and they hate conservatives"" (and man, some of the people in the reviews go on that *hard*) but the point is that these people *do* exist. In the area of the country these characters are trying to survive in, there *is* hardcore racism around to get in their way, just as there are friendly folks to aid in their journey. The kids have to make some d@mn hard choices to make their way south, and it only gets harder with each chapter. The story of overcoming obstacles, no matter their form, is a character arc of the ages, and the boys are no longer boys, grown up much too fast, by the time you reach your final decision. LiS 2 is an excellent study in adversity and resilience, and while it's not my favorite installment, I can appreciate it for what it is."
2783,"This game changed my life. Made me appreciate my family so much more. I am also way more mindful of how my behavior and decisions affect my young nieces and nephews since I don't have any younger siblings. I appreciate my life more as well. Grateful to not have to go through any hardships as Sean and Daniel did at such a young age. Of course, it's just a video game, but these are real life situations that can happen and has happened. Rip my heart out why don't you, Square Enix! LOL Cried every single time (I watched streamers play and cried. Tried playing myself, and I cried again)."
2784,"I hate saying this but...The first life is strange was better : The ""superpower"" was perfectly making sense in an adventure game, you could make a bad decision and go back in time or do a good decision and just test others options and just keep on playing the way you wanted and when the game is over you will still know you can do a different ending. In this game you'll need to carry on the bad choices you made or try to load a to the last checkpoint and that is really frustrating sometimes. I like the fact that you can have different endings but I don't want to restart a game from the beginning if I just want to know what happens If I punch a guy... Cool game but I don't think that most of the players will have the patience to enjoy all of the scenarios possible."
2785,"To the writers: It's getting a bit ""same old"" you know. There are life changing traumas that do not require a parent to die. Life Is Strange/Captain Spirit/Life Is Strange 2, same thing and it's getting predictable. I loved the first game in the series, enjoyed Captain Spirit a lot but by LIS2 a couple of episodes in I had had enough of Daniel's bitching and just couldn't be bothered to invest any more effort in caring for the brat....with the inevitable outcome of ep3. Not even sure I can be bothered to buy the last two episodes.
Overall, really disappointed.
Update: I bought the last two episodes and though episode 5 picks up a bit I stand by the review for the first four parts. I could still not muster any emotional involvement with Daniel. The best thing about ep4 is that Daniel features very little though he manages to be as irritating as ever. Episode 5 has a nice storyline of Sean reconnecting with Karen but this is the only redeeming feature of the entire game. Not surprised they lost the franchise to Deck Nine."
2786,"A beautiful game, with a beautiful story. It's games like these, that make me upset when people say ""it's just a game."" because, it's not. It's immersive story-line and characters reel you in, making you attached within the first few minutes of the game, but of course it's a LIS game, so expect heartbreak. The backstory of the side characters, the easter eggs of the first game, the creativity, the diversity, the inclusion, everything is so captivating. I can't leave this review without mentioning, the absolute beautifully, amazingly picked soundtrack. 

If you're looking to feel something, it's this game."
2787,"Life is Strange (LiS) 2, is very similar to the previous installments: LiS and LiS:BtS (Life is Strange: Before the Storm).
And all of them are quite similar to Telltale's adventure games (e.g. Walking Dead, Batman, Wolf Among Us, Borderlands, etc.).
But LiS 2 takes more of a narrative approach, and while in Telltale's games you need to perform specific actions in order not to die (or win), in LiS 2 you only choose between available paths, with no negative repercussions to any of your choices (except in different endings you may get).
And it's not such a bad thing.
It makes the game a really atmospheric and relaxed experience. This game is the opposite of stressful.

Now looking on various LiS that came out so far, I personally believe LiS:BtS was the best one, followed by LiS and LiS 2 coming in last place.
While many other people would place LiS before LiS:BtS in the list, I think it's pretty clear LiS 2 is not as good.
But in it's defense I can say, that the first 2 games were real masterpieces, so it's not easy to live up to their standards.
While LiS:BtS IMO had the best narrative and dialogs.
LiS had the best gameplay mechanic of time manipulation.
LiS:BtS did not have this mechanic, so it's gameplay wasn't as good (even though I personally believe it's narrative and plot makes it a better game).
Same is the case with LiS 2.
LiS 2 features the telekinesis superpower, but it doesn't become a gameplay mechanic (you tell/ask the characters to perform it, and they decide what to do with your request). You don't control it directly (like in LiS) and it doesn't have the same game impact as time-travel had in LiS.
So game-wise, LiS was a much better game.
And story-wise, LiS:BtS had a much better story.

So does the fact that LiS 2 cannot compete with LiS in regards to game mechanics, or LiS:BtS story-wise, it's still a solid game in it's own right.
There is a strong story about the relationship between 2 brothers.
There are some political/social themes, for people who like that.
And there are some tie-ins to the original LiS (although they're quite small, and pretty far between them).

In general the game feels pretty relaxed, especially compared to Telltale games for example.
You rarely have any time-sensitive choices.
Some tasks require patience (like drawing, or collectibles-hunting).
And sometimes, you can just relax, sit back, and enjoy the beautiful views and music (similar to the ""cinematic view"" mechanic of RDR 2 for example).
For me personally, it was a great go-to game to when I wanted to relax in front of the TV, and enjoy nice views, nice music and a nice story.

Now this game is episodic, so I will try to offer my opinion on each of the episodes:
Episode 1 - I obviously one of the best episodes in the game.
This was the proof-of-concept that would decide if the entire game (the other episodes) were worth making, so obviously a lot of time and effort were put into it.
We are given the main premise of the game from 2 different point of view. Get introduced to the brothers, their family, friends, and relationships between all the formentioned.
You're also given the first taste of the political/social commentary of the game, as the brothers being of the latin minority face some challenges related to racism and prejudice.
Beyond the story, we also get to enjoy quite a few different locations, and have some minor tie-ins to the original LiS."
2788,Awesome Love It one of the best game's ever the ending nearly made me shed a tear Awesome if ur a fan of twd get this and if u like lis 1 Then you will like this even more! Great Game!.
2789,"A Journey Of Two Brothers After The Incident In Seattle ,This Journey Will Describe The Bonding Of Brothers ,Need Of Friends And Family ,A Journey Full Of Tragedy But End Of The Day The Two Brothers Are Together And Thats The Spirit Of Surviving :) A Good Game To Play ,Worth Of Money ,Personally I Love This Game❤️."
2790,daniel annoying.i was hoping he would die but then i found out HE has the powers and then i realized hes not gonna die so i unistalled
2791,Nice story game great graphic and not much trouble to run
2792,"Game tries too hard to be dramatic while sacrificing a lot of believability. Nothing like the first one.
Also, somebody kill Daniel pls."
2793,"So, fresh start for new Life is Strange game.
I've got serious suspicions about this game because of it is not releated to 1st game.
And I was thinking this new one is not good as 1st game.
But I was wrong...
This game tells you a new story with wider gameplay.
It is long to beat (around 15-17 hours), viusally looks great, musics sad and most important story is addictive.
I liked the new gameplay mechanics, especially in first episode you have to even save money to survive.
First two episodes far great, quick hint before playing 2nd episode please complete F2P Captain Spirit game also you can see a warning before starting episode 2 for this.
Third episode was mediocre for me, fourth one got unnecessary moments, but with the end of episode 5 game f*cks your brain and its limits.
Overally game got great quality in my opinion. Every episode in the title like a new game. First two episodes very loyal to main plot and they got around 7-8 hours. They pushed the limits for episodes 3 & 4 obviously. Final episode starts slowly but paces up to the end.
But I have to admit at the end of every episode your heartbeat goes crazy.
That's why we have to celebrate the developers.
In these days it is hard to find great games with atractive story.

P.S: You can see little surprises from 1st game..."
2794,Absolutely horrible game. Waste of time not even near as good as the first one.
2795,"Such a good story to begin!
Broot is such a cute guy)"
2796,"It's different way of playing a computer game, it's like watching a movie, it's very subtle, decisions can make a big difference, it forces you to think how to react properly and to make an example to the little brother of yours, it has a great touch to it , but where you decide how the story will develope on the go. I only wish there would be no super natural forces involved, because it would be a great and even more reallistic story without them."
2797,"This game is a true whirlwind....or hurricane of emotions. At first I wished I had a younger brother, now i'm glad I don't. 
10/10 would give the chock-o-crisp to anyone but that little brat. 

On a more serious note, this game covers some deep emotional issues, and some political. I feel it truly gives a great appreciation of what it means to be from a first generation immigrant family. Hopefully it will open your eyes to what it feels like to be on the other side of racial conflicts. It also allows you to experience what it is like to have a dependant, someone who is their own person, but is affected by you and your choices. It's important to ask yourself, what kind of role model am I? That answer, and its consequences might just surprise you. 

Graphically the game is gorgeous, you will no doubt take screenshots. Just like in the previous LIS games, the world building is fantastic and you will find yourself connecting with it's myriad of characters. In terms of replay-ability, I advise you play without reloading saves, make the journey an organic one. Once complete, whether you are happy with your ending or not, there are a wide variety of choices that make the game feel like a fresh story."
2798,"Throws you in and out of your comfort zone with effortless ease. Just as immersive as its predecessors, with breathtaking visuals and a story that says just what needs to be said. Definitely won't be forgetting this one."
2799,please buy this game for me right now i need money and my mom wont buy it for me please get me money please please please please please please please please
2800,"I always wondered which game had the hardest choices, but I found the answer. Like previous games life is strange, this game could teach the meaning of having a brother. We should always be proud of what we have and never do anything that causes us to lose it
"
2801,"ngab ngeb slurr
"
2802,"I absolutely loved this game. My older brother died when we were similar in age to these characters and somehow I found the game healing. Your decisions really do mater in this one, but I recommend playing it based on your feelings rather than trying to predict what the developers were thinking.

But you can do that too."
2803,It's just… perfect.
2804,Am i reviewing a masterpiece?
2805,life is strange 2 does not disappoint like the first game its fkin incredible. Highly recomend
2806,"I know a lot of people say this wasn't as good as it's successful first game but to me this was by far a pretty great experience, almost as good as the previous in my opinion. It's probably cause i connected really well with the brothers in terms of it's story. The visual are amazing at replicating wildlife areas a lot beautifully with Unreal Engine 4. Plenty of the selected tracks are hard hitting and some of the original soundtracks do a good job at keeping you engage in it's dramatic parts. One part i wish they hopefully fix in the new remastered is the lip syncing as it's just about the same in this game but they do better at making their movements while talking more lively.  
I'd definitely recommend getting this game if your genuinely interested in this series and/or if it's on sale."
2807,"What may be my hottest video game take: Life is Strange 2 is better to Life is Strange 1. 

LiS is all about subverting expectations with the strange. In LiS1, we’re told constantly that “this action will have consequences” yet we have the option to rewind time and avoid them. Either you can pick for all of your actions to have had meaning, or you can say you want to have never performed those actions and avoid the consequences that attend them.

 LiS2 is different; it’s all about power and the different ways people wield it. The first cop we see in the game immediately responds to what is essentially a playground scuffle with a drawn gun and he shoots an innocent man. The cop has the power completely in that situation, and he responds to everything transpiring with force and violence. This, of course, awakens the “powers” in Daniel. This is super interesting, as you as Sean are powerless to control him. Instead, the only power you have is the power of influence.

I could probably go on about the different ways in which the game presents power in different social situations and structures, but I think giving the most power of anybody in the story to a child who doesn’t know how the world works yet leads to some super memorable events.

One of my most highly recommended games."
2808,"they finally made a game where 80% of the characters aren't women, jesus christ"
2809,"Life is Strange 2 delivers by far one of the most emotional and gripping narrative experiences in the series. While a handful of wrong choices I made in the first two episodes didn't really seem to leave a consequence later in the story, I still am content with how the journey of Sean and Daniel Diaz, or ""The Wolf Brothers,"" came to a conclusion (at least in my playthrough).

Some of the moments in this game are seriously well-crafted, so hats off to the storyboard artists, music composers, and animators behind-the-scenes for bringing out the most intense and emotional scenes to life. Fortunately, I managed to get the good ending, but depending on your playthrough you might also end up with bad and very bad endings. It even imported my save file from ""The Awesome Adventure of Captain Spirit,"" which is pretty cool given how it affects some narrative elements in Episode 2.

Most other games like this seem to come to the same conclusion (well it's commonly two different endings) regardless of the player's actions throughout the story, but Life is Strange 2 is a worthy exception. Yes, there are a few flaws in the story and its focus on some sensitive topics that other players may find offensive, but I genuinely enjoyed the game nonetheless.

7.5/10 would recommend this game to anyone who loved the first Life is Strange game."
2810,good
2811,FUCKING GOOD GAME ! Need & Waiting Life is Strange 3
2812,If you are reading this... BUY THIS GAME! :D
2813,"Life is Strange 2 is definitely a different game compared to its predecessors. Instead of staying in a small town you go around the US trying to go somewhere. 

This is a very different game and while it did not make me cry as much as Life is Strange and LiS: Before the Storm it still did make ma feel something... for some of the episodes anyway. 

I liked how the graphics improved and the environments look better than ever before but the lip syncing and animations are a bit off sometimes which I hope they fix in the next Life is Strange (looks promising imo) 

Music is good too but not as memorable as the first Life is Strange, it makes you feel but it just felt like something happening in the background instead of like what they did in life is strange 1 instead where the music was integrated with everything. 

Some parts of the actions in the game felt forced and meaningless compared to LiS 1. Other actions felt like it didnt really matter in the long run since another things screws you up anyway so it didn't feel like you were in control on how the story goes, but I guess that's what they were going for... Two kids running around america while being searched by the police... 

Story wise, It's a bit of a mixed bag here (SPOILERS START)

[spoiler] Episode 1 was a great start to this game, it set the mood right and definitely took it's time to ease you in on what the brothers have been doing. This episode also hurt a lot after Daniel found out about how his dad died without him knowing at first.

Episode 2 was great as well as we met chris and his father. (NGL the prologue hit me hard as well) 

Episode 3 I felt like it wasn't needed for this whole game, It felt like filler content in an anime show so I just pushed through it, characters in this episode weren't all amazing and this is the episode where I started to question myself playing this game because I hoped it could've gone differently. Always felt like Sean and Daniel weren't the Weed Farm guys. 

Episode 4 with the cult and the brother's mother coming back was a surprise as well which as tackled in Episode 3 a bit. Seeing Sean with only One eye hurt because I can't even imagine myself without depth perception and their journey sucked. Overall I think it was okay but I wish that they could've met their mother in a different way instead of killing the reverend there to free daniel or burning the church down. It felt off and while I applaud DONTNOD with their political standpoints for the whole of this series with racism and all, this episode felt forced but better than episode 3. 

Episode 5 was great as it was the last stand between the brothers and the wall, Seeing a familiar face was refreshing as well and hearing Max and Chloe fine made me so happy (I chose the BAE ending if that wasn't clear enough) I hope to see them in another game. Seeing the reality of other people in America was eye opening as well and I hope that it changes in the future (IRL).  The ending of the game when you surrender to the cops and have High Morale is called Redemption ending, I think thats what this whole episode is about and they did a great job at it.  [/spoiler]

While I love LIS and Before the Storm a lot more this game is okay. Just don't take it too seriously as you might not enjoy it. 
I have a little sister and I took account for what I would've done were it was us in the Brother's scenario. 

I would've saved sacrificed everything for my Little Sister. 


I would rate this game an 8.5 

The game is there but I do not think it is for everyone as someone might not like this type of setup but I enjoyed my time with it even if i do have complaints."
2814,"One of the best games i've ever played. Many found it boring and not good as the first ""Life is Strange"", but that happens because they clearly wanted a game with the same mindset. It's a game series called ""Life is Strange"" not, ""Max's Life is Strange"". They came up with a new fresh idea which is really hard overcome a great success as the first title, it's like watching a TV series, with one of the best soundtracks, strong characters and a solid gameplay. My biggest turn off in games such as Life is Strange is that im always trying to focus more in the conclusion  of the game, trying to pick the dialog that wont get mad or kill one character that i like (watching the tree and lossing the forest (but maybe thats just me)). In Life is Strange 2 thats not a bother since every part of the game is unique you can just go with the flow. Enjoy!

-9/10 !!!

p.s. I diden't felt rushing it, playing each part of the game at midnight with some beers.

p.s.2 Don't frustrate yourself when the ""cool"" part is gonna start, with all the drama and the killing, the whole game is the cool stuff and you will be part of it before you know it.

"
2815,"Pretty boring compared to LiS1

3/10 didn't make me cry
"
2816,great game. probably one of the best in my opinion
2817,Ok time to Skype Lyla on my laptop.
2818,This game is one big feel. I love the story and I am glad I decided to buy and play it.
2819,"Imo too political and the most stupid decisions are made without player choice, too bad for choice-driven game.
*spoiler alert* e.g. going to town in ep. 2, working on a weed farm in ep. 3"
2820,This game made me go from 99% not wanting kids to 100% never wanting kids. Thanks square enix!
2821,"Insanely wonderful game, visuals 10/10 <3333"
2822,"Life is Strange 2 is a sad game, a hard game. One you have to be silent and think for a good bit after. In short, it does its job. It tells a story, one that will make you laugh, will make you cry, and everything in between. It's harsh, but realistic. It's great, frankly.

Now great does not mean perfect, just like nothing is. Some of the dialogue options do leave you with a ""I don't really like either of these"" feeling, or other times you pick something expecting one tonality/one thought/one phrase but getting a different one instead. Finally, the main ending choice and events are a bit... unfair in my eyes. Yes, I'm a sap who wants the best for everyone and doesn't like to see people get hurt, but even with that bias I think there could've been other options. Don't get me wrong, the endings are heartwrenching and difficult on you, they're powerful, but I think there could've been others, too. If you don't care so much for spoilers, or already know what happens, I'd recommend reading through the ""The happiest ending for all?"" section of this forum post for an ending that I kind of think would even possibly suit the game better - https://life-is-strange.fandom.com/f/p/3100000000000000756 .

Edit: Y'know, I've had a few hours since I finished the game, and thinking about it I don't quite know if that sort of ending, like in the link, would be the best possible, as it would ruin the connection that the brothers attain between themselves and between others, and the personal growth that they make throughout the game. However, I still do believe my point stands about wishing for other endings.

Finally, this game very heavily likes to get political. It is VERY on the nose about stuff, and if that's not your cup of tea well you'll find it here. It's great regardless, and the story resonates, but it will make you eye roll from time to time with how strong it comes off.

Oh, another thing: for a player choice, story based game, a lot of this game feels really overly scripted/forced. I get it, the developers want to tell a certain narrative, and they can't exactly account for every single possible choice that every single person on the planet would potentially want to make at any given time, but smoothing out the transitions a bit more would have been, I think, better, because the way it is currently, the game consists of [spoiler]Sean: Daniel, please don't do that, you'll reveal your powers; Daniel: I'm not a kid anymore! >does it anyway[/spoiler] which is pretty consistently how the plot's progressed."
2823,"If you haven't played the first LiS or Lis 2 yet, what are you doing with your life and why are you so lame?"
2824,i fucking hate daniel
2825,great games great story Life is Strange 1 before the storm or the 2th is epic
2826,"My opinion on this game is mixed. I don't hate it and it was still a good story, but compared to the first one, something felt dry with this one. I feel as if it were too linear. I know that is the type of game it is, but the first one was a lot more open in the sense that your exploration was rewarded. Your exploration in this one is just boring. 

The critic reviews say emotional and intense, but I didn't feel these characters. They weren't really relatable. I cried so many times and was so emotionally invested in the first game.

I did still enjoy the game it just wasn't what I was expecting. All that said, it did have beautiful visuals and some compelling parts.

I am still choosing recommend because it is still a strong game, just don't expect it to be like the first one."
2827,This one is way deeper and political than the first one. The choices doesnt feel as important at first but when you make progress you really feel the burden of the choices you made and that really felt real for me. This game literally made me feel like Sean. DEF PLAY THIS AND ALL OTHER LIFE IS STRANGE GAMES
2828,It's a decent game. 8/10.
2829,i wanted to go to the party
2830,"It's a great game, I really enjoyed playing this and you should try it out if you like games with different choices which has it own consequences and it's a very emotional game and I really recommend it!"
2831,this game kinda sucks lmfao i am disappointed i spent that much money on it
2832,very good game
2833,"///SPOILER FREE/////  This game .......THIS GAME!!! oooooh my poor heart. I just finished my first run of the game (the date now being the 5th of April 2021) and gosh it was amazing, first of all the music was great and now i have more songs to add to my playlist.

 I really loved all the new mechanics like the drawing aspect and the journaling makes me want to start my own. Compaired to the first game i low-key think its better that the first instalment in the franchise it deffantly felt like the choices mattered a whole lot more and not just because you couldnt rewind time but it defantly felt like every tiny, little choice had a big impact each episode. 

I got what i beleve to be one of the good endings and holy hell i weaped like a baby, i wont say what choices i made but im happy with the ending i got, i just wished i paid more attention on getting all the collectibles, i'll be honest did cheat a little bit mostly with episode three with looking into what choices i wanted to avoid and yes i know that was silly of me but i dont regret it but i employ you to experience it for yourself and not cheating like i did X3.

But all in all my honest review of this game, i realy enjoyed it and i cant beleve it took me this long to play it denfantly work getting if you love a good story - side note this is my first review of a game on steam so that tells you how much i loved this game and i cant wait to do another playthrough"
2834,Nothing but a masterpiece. Both endings have their right and are satisfying in their own way
2835,"Unpopular opinion, LiS2 > LiS.
Feels more innovative and I like the storyline better in general (although both parts are a clear 10/10 for me)

The very first thing which isn't real that has made me tear up. 
While playing this game I feel seperated from reality for a little while.
It makes me overthink my decisions not only in real life, but now in a video game.
It teaches me that family should be the number one priority in my life.
It teaches me how important all the little choices you make can affect your futute.
It teaches me to enjoy my life to the fullest before it gets too late.
It makes me think that life is nothing but continuous choices you make, some are bigger and some are smaller.
It makes me want to forget the storyline just so I could play it again.
It lowkey makes me sad.

Can't wait for LiS: True Colors.
Best. Game. Ever.

2837,"Incredible storytelling, characters, soundtrack, and atmosphere. It's a game I believe everyone, especially Americans (because of the political discussions brought up throughout the game)- should experience at least once. I felt so connected to so many of the characters and genuinely cared about what happened to everyone."

2843,"I played this game until the end.

So many things simply don't make sense. A lot of obvious and sometime more interesting choices are not there to be picked. Some interesting character developments turned to be are outright irrelevant. Some parts of the game were extremelly boring and felt like a chore. Timed interactions are buggy as hell. You can not skip through most of the scenes if you already played or don't want to see. The game forces you to do things that you didn't need to. These design choices are infuriating at many points, and for me would render the game impossible to play for a second time. 

Though they're not perfect, I did like the other games of the series. But this one made me feel punished for picking really good choices. To prove it to you, I would have to go over the story with spoilers... so, I wont. And don't get me started on sjw stuff forced down your throat.

If you're over the fence, don't buy. If you have another game that you want to play, go for that one."
2844,"Let me start; the first Life is Strange was a great game full of characters and choices that you can interact with while also clearly understanding the consequences of each choice by using your power to go back in time. Without that power, you have Life is Strange 2, where you no longer have any power at all and you have to watch your younger, irresponsible sass of a brother have it instead. Every choice you make with the small text that does not clearly define what you are doing goes straight to 11, unexpected consequences for every action that is unpredictable. Not only that, but the choices compound into your brothers overall behavior, moral compass, and whether or not he accepts your decisions.

SO, TLDR, you are watching a movie, where the decisions don't really matter because the first decision you made for Daniel impacts him for the rest and he makes his own decisions from then on. And the gameplay is terrible, you etch-a-sketch a scene once in a while by wanting it to be over and rotating your control stick as fast as you can. In fact, I'm glad I finished this game only to be done by it. The ending was poorly written and mostly every side-character was trying to put their Social-Justice down my throat. 

TLTLDR:.... I'm never buying a game from Square Enix ever again because of how bad this ""game"" was. Im glad I waited for it to be on sale, but I still hate the fact that I spent money on this. 18 hours of my life that I cannot get back."
2845,"If you're American, don't play this game. If not, proceed. All jokes aside, this is still a good game."
2846,"The characters in this game are amazing, and from the first half hour I could tell I would care about them until the end. Truly an amazing game."

2848,"Personally I loved watching others play Life Is Strange #1, so when I heard there was one with a kid near my age I got excited. I've only made it a small percentage through the game but I believe that its very fun and the story is very enticing, thrilling, and heart breaking, (how dare they kill mushroom oml). I have cried at least 10 times 10/10 would recommend."
2849,"Visually great to look at. Everything else fell short for me. The slow pace was not earned by the story being told. Characters were not interesting enough for the intimate moments to flourish. I won't continue this series, but there is room here for others to enjoy the calm play of LIS 2."

2852,10/10 Nice game :) I like Brody. I wish I have a friend like him.
2853,This game series were awesome. Keep it up dev
2854,I just love this game. Don't have anything bad to say really.
2855,It's so boring and disappointing from the character to the plot to the story line.... I have played Life Is Strange 1 with Max and Chloe twice and I still think it is interesting. Lis 2 is just so disappointing and uneventful i'm  just glad i bought it on sale.
2856,Parts of it were a slog to get through... actually took me two tries to get through it all. But jfc the ending(s) make it all worth it. Life is Strange? More like Life is Sad
2857,This story is very different from LIS and i like it!
2858,"very good, very sad"
2859,Great story-line but sad game.
2860,"Life is Strange is one of my favorite games of all time. Dontnod are masterminds at storytelling and character development. They can somehow create a world that you can either relate and get sucked into or both, and yet add an element of fantasy in there. Life is Strange's title is fitting for these games as you play as characters living and ordinary life and then all of a sudden one of those strange twists of fate change their entire lives.

Life is Strange 2 cranks this to the max with a story that had me hooked until the very end and is on par with the first game. You play as Sean and Daniel Diaz who get ripped from their home in Seattle, Washington and must escape the US and find their way to the Mexico border. I do have to warn that there will be some spoilers in here as I couldn't properly review the game without talking about certain points in the story as this is the main part of the entire game.

What I love so much about this game is how average it starts out. Just a little boy and a teenager trying to live their regular lives with their father when suddenly life turns for the worst. This telekinetic power that Daniel discovers comes out when he gets into a fight with the next-door neighbor and when Sean intervenes it all turns for the worse. A cop dies, their father dies, and Sean panics and runs. Now pause right there. Most people would just hide or wait through the trail and tribulations of being proven innocent. That's part of what makes this series so great is the opposite of what should happen happens and turns it into a strange twist of your own beliefs and choices and what the characters are doing.

As the Diaz brothers set off down towards Mt. Rainier in the first episode they encounter a kidnapper and cope with Daniel's powers, but this is where you will start getting into a gameplay loop if you can call it that. You get plopped into a large starting area that allows you to look around at a bunch of objects and listen to Sean's inner dialogue comment on it all to learn more about what's around you and some times discover hidden objects. You can also push on to the main objectives and during these long cut scenes you will get dialog options that don't seem to mean much at first, but the entire game is a balancing act of influencing your younger brother on how he ends up. Is he destructive and careless, is he too careful and caring, does he hate Sean or love him in the end? A lot of options slightly sway this and then there are larger game changers that allow two options and each one will sway the story in another direction.

Some of these options consequences are usually seen right away and some are seen in the next episode. Once you get through a tense scene that makes you choose something big it settles back down to more minor plot development and this is where the game falters some. For example, episodes 2 and three 3 are very slow and feature too much slice of life stuff such as the brothers living in a homeless camp in the redwood forest in California, and living with their grandparents and doing daily life stuff. You do day to day stuff like chores and talk to everyone, but the integration of these brand new people feel like a slog as you must endure tons of dialog to get to know them, and in the end, it doesn't really matter as they are unique to this episode. Episode 4 is much shorter and features all of the above but in shorter integrals and I felt was the best-paced episode. Episode 5 feels like a lot of filler in the beginning and takes to long to get to the end as the only ""action"" is maybe the last 30 minutes when the brothers are finally at the border.

Despite these complaints about pacing and story, it's still fantastic and memorable. There are a few minor gameplay elements tossed in like quick-time events and aiming to throw a knife or something, but there is very little gameplay. The majority consists of Sean walking around looking at stuff. I honestly could see this as just a mini-series TV show rather than a game. Many times I set the controller down and only picked it up for dozens of minutes at a time to pick a dialog option. I personally love deep stories in games, but I don't want to sacrifice gameplay. There are literally zero other elements besides walking around, examining, and dialog choices.

With all that said, the story is just amazing and very emotional. I related a lot of the first game as I personally grew up in a small town, but I also relate to this game as I live in the Seattle area have also lived in California a good part of my life. I grew up in small towns and had crazy events that change my life growing up in the blink of an eye. While I wasn't a fugitive running from the law there is always a strange thing that happens in our lives that changes it forever and can happen so fast we never saw it coming and that's what makes Life is Strange 2 so incredibly rich and realistic. The events are happening right now and could really happen in real life, but there's that element of fantasy that makes it a great game rather than a life simulator.

I also have to comment on the visuals, the switch to Unreal Engine 4 makes the game look much better, but far from not looking dated. There are muddy textures, some wonky animations, and low poly models. This is just something most adventure games suffer from. The voice acting is pretty good though, while not amazing, it does the job to deliver emotion and you really feel it. Overall, Life is Strange 2 is for the story lovers out there and less the gamers."
2861,"A great adventure game. Episodes 1-3 need a bit to get going and unfortunately have too few real highlights. From the fourth episode on, however, the story increases enormously and is emotionally on the same level as ""Life is Strange 1"" again.
The game is definitely worth it!"
2862,Excelent game
2863,"Great story, music and visual parts. Do not expect here totally the same storytelling as in the prequels. Themes of family and morality here are investigated more deeply and open up relevant problems of the social part of our life. I think, people, who just hate this game only because of the annoying MC and not less annoying his lil bro are just focusing on the wrong sides of the game. This is the story of two brothers. Of course, we can criticize some pale characters being absolute good and absolute bad ones, but overall experience is good. 76/100."
2864,"The game took me about 13 hours and was a great experience. Great character development and a good story and plot.
Keep in mind that the game has politics and takes some stands on some political still relevant ideas/thoughts.

2887,"Just as excellent as the first one, seemed to have slightly less content than the other game. Sad storyline."
2888,"I wish I could give this a ""mixed"" recommendation. Overall, if you like LiS/Telltale games, this is worth picking up when it's on sale. I did like the game well enough, but I would not recommend it for $30. $13? Yes.


LiS 1 and BtS focused on building relationships with the people around you. In this game, it's a ""road trip"" story, and every chapter you're thrown into a new place with a new cast of characters. In LiS/BtS you had your core Max/Chloe and Chloe/Rachel deuteragonist relationship, which was then supplemented with side characters that you stayed with throughout the game. In this game, the only constant relationship you have throughout the game is Sean/Daniel.  I found that every time I came to like a new character(s) and built a relationship with them, the chapter would end and then you'd be thrown into a completely new setting and would never hear from those characters again (other than the occasional letter or other indirect contact).


Another thing is that in this game, you are making choices not only for the character you play as, but your brother as well. The way that you react to Daniel's actions directly impacts how he will react to events throughout the game. You are essentially molding Daniel's character as well as Sean's. I wouldn't have a problem with this, but the issue is that you don't really understand the implications of that until the literal end of the game. Just doing things like choosing to have Daniel use his powers for a prank or not can have an impact on how he reacts to things in the future. Thinking about it, the game would have been significantly improved if there were some sort of meter that displayed how your decisions were impacting Daniel. Because otherwise, you are dealing with a hidden system and aren't ever made aware of what your decisions regarding Daniel even mean, until you get your ending.


*****SPOILER WARNING FOR GAME ENDINGS*****


[spoiler] Throughout the entire game, I never thought it was a good idea for them to go to Mexico. I played the game trying to make decisions that would encourage them to stay in the US, because I knew at the end there would have inevitably been a choice. So during the last choice of the game, I chose to have Sean surrender to the police, hoping that he'd just serve his time and that Daniel would live with their grandparents in the meantime. Now, there *is* an ending like that, but apparently my choices for Daniel throughout the game made him care about Sean above all else, and to be wreckless with his powers. Which lead to Sean getting killed. I didn't hate that ending, but my gripe is that I had *no* idea that my actions/reactions with Daniel had made him wreckless with his powers or anything like that.


I was also trying to play in a way to try to get Sean to reconnect with Cassidy because I had grown fond of her. Yet, the only way to get an ending that even remotely involves her is to have Sean escape to Mexico and leave Daniel behind. And even then, it's just Daniel getting a picture of Sean+Cassidy together. Makes no sense. [/spoiler]


Overall, I thought the character/story interactions were good, I just wish that they lasted throughout the entire game. I do commend them for trying something different, but it's obvious that it didn't work as well as they had hoped, given that they're going back to the original formula in the upcoming LiS game.


OVERALL: 3.5/5
"
2889,"This game is far-left political and thus alienates 50% of the player base.

While the first game was about innocent emotions, love and dreams for the better (such as becoming a known artist and finishing school with good grades), this game builds on and teaches criminal behavior such as theft, staged begging, assault, running from the law and acting like the whole world is ""racist"" and unjust and a bunch of other nonsense far-left crap.

The premise is that ""white"" cops are ""racist pigs"" and that the world is inherently ""racist"" even though YOUR family caused the mess by a) breaking the law b) not following the orders you were given and c) running from the law down to Mexico.

Further on the whole first and second chapters are nothing but boring chores (washing clothes, making the dishes, walking the dog). Only in third and fourth chapters you actually start to do anything of importance.

But they do have nude boob physics so 11/10."
2890,An amazing game with amazing characters and storytelling. 10/10
2891,"I like this game mainly because of the richness of it's story and the different possibilities of events. The characters are well built, and small decisions matter too. overall the game is fun to play. But, at the same time I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price, wait for summer sale or something."
2892,"It feels weird to not recommend a game I played to completion, but I feel like this game was overall disappointing and a step-backwards from the first Life is Strange.

Mild Spoilers:

This story follows the path of two brothers who are forced to flee from their home and go on an adventure across the West Coast, starting from Washington, moving toward Utah, and finally all the way down to the Mexican Border.  You play the game as Sean, a 16-year-old who is the son of an immigrant from Mexico.  A large portion of the game revolves around balancing your actions against the needs and wants of your 9-year-old brother. As his guardian, you try to engage him in the things he wants to do versus the things you feel he needs to learn to grow into a responsible person one day. This balancing act is presented to you in the form of choices you make along the course of the game. The twist here is that not all of the choices you make will be heeded by your younger brother as his own personal needs and wants will come into play and depending on how you have been treating him, he may or may not listen to your choices. For some people, this can be somewhat frustrating and make them feel like they're not in control of the outcome of the story, but there are some very important choices you can make and your consistency in your choices is just as important.

The narrative for this game does not feel quite as strong as the first Life is Strange.  If you've played the first game, you'll recall that there were a lot of personal interactions and growth between Max, Chloe, and the other characters on a consistent basis.  Due to the way this game is setup as a sort of road-trip/adventure, you do not have very consistent interactions with any other character besides your younger brother. Because the first game had these established characters, subsequent chapters didn't require as much exposition in terms of who the characters are and what their backgrounds are.  Instead, Life is Strange 1 focused on further developing the existing characters and bringing you in to a larger mystery. Not only was there the mystery of the disappearance of Chloe's friend, but there was a lot of mystery as to the nature of Max's abilities. In this game, there is no greater mystery at play... and in fact, a large portion of the story seems to be driven forward by misunderstandings layered upon misunderstandings.  I frequently found myself doubting the realism in Life is Strange 2. Characters would do/say things that seem extreme or unbelievable, racist caricatures would pop up and a very simplistic view of crime and punishment is pushed on you very early on in the game. I would try to brush off these sorts of issues as being just a part of the world's fantasy, but they're based on real issues in the world. The game's simplistic presentation of these issues took me out of the game's world. I kept asking myself things like ""Why don't they just do this?""  or  ""This doesn't seem like something that would actually happen.""  When enough of these sorts of situations are piled on top of one-another, you begin to feel a sense of skepticism and detachment from the characters in the story. The world in Life is Strange 2 no longer feels like it is reflective of reality.

In terms of puzzles, choices, etc.  I feel like this game is a bit of a step backward as well.  Most times, choices are simply A or B.  As stated earlier, since some of your choices hinge on whether or not your younger brother chooses to listen to you, you may not actually have a choice at all.  Additionally, the chapters generally end in the same way, regardless of choices with small nuances and differences based on your decisions.  This can make it feel as if your choices ultimately don't matter.  The game features a ""special power"" much like there was a ""special power"" present in the original Life is Strange, but the usage of this power lacks inventiveness and does not make for interesting possible decisions and outcomes in the same sort of way that Max's ability did in the original game.

In terms of the acting, the backgrounds, artwork, music... all of this was fantastic.  Overall, the game captures the feel of the original in terms of aesthetic.  The dialogue is cleverly written and most of the characters are likable when they aren't acting in a way that is contrary to the consistency of their portrayal.  This game takes you to a variety of different settings, from the rainy forests of the Pacific Northwest to the arid desert of Arizona. There are also a few nice nods to the original Life is Strange and it asks you for a little information about your playthrough of that game so that its story is consistent with the world in Life is Strange 2.

Overall, I really wanted to like this game in the same way as the first, but it felt lacking in many ways. This game is heavy on misery with very little joy to be found. I joked to my wife that it feels a bit like a torture simulator. You play it, knowing that it's just going to continue to get worse and worse. If you still decide to pick it up, I hope you enjoy it more than I did."

Amazing game. This game successfully broke my heart for these characters. Game was very well done... take it easy on the heart strings though, big oof lol"
2894,"as a fan of the franchise, i really like it. u go through a roller coaster of emotions and your choices matter more than u think. a different take from the first game but definitely worth a try! i connected with the characters more than i did with max and chloe so it never really got boring. and oh... the emptiness u feel after u complete the game is unbearable :')"

2899,"I really liked this game, it's better than LIS 1, LIS 2 is dark and full of injustices, but this is why this Life is strange is full of emotions. I like sketchy time in this game and it's more interactive this way.
SPOILERS! As for ending: I didn't love any ending, because no matter what you do, ending is dramatic. personally I don't think that any Judge will do that to Sean, especially after police discovered the truth, this is why I like Parting Ways ending better than Redemption version, just because in this version both brothers are somewhat happy,  soundtracks are great as always! I have a playlist especially for Life Is Strange. :)"

2903,"It's worth a shot, even though it doesn't live up to the original LiS in most aspects.

Gameplay is improved, you have new world interactions and dynamics, graphics are pretty good and the scenery and landscapes are quite beautiful, but they lack the uniqueness and atmosphere of the first game. The story itself is mostly well written, but it's not as compelling, mostly because it doesn't flow as good as its predecessors and the subjects adressed are, in general, less relatable. The characters are less interesting and harder to get attached to. There were some interesting ones (Cassidy was my personal favorite of the bunch), but they come and go quickly and there's little to none time for developing. I personally feel it's really bad for the flow of the story when you have characters being introduced up until the last act. Sean was a good main character for me, Daniel can be really annoying sometimes. Soundtrack is mostly good, but for me it's a bit of a downgrade from the first game.

TL;DR: I think this is a good game that has specific writing flaws, and it suffered a lot from the high standards set by the original LiS. Nevertheless, I think most people who are into story based games will enjoy it."
2904,"Just like the first Life is Strange game, the story is dense and full of unexpected twists and turns. The first two episodes can be a grind, but the story gets more intense as you delve further and further."
2905,"Engaging story and emotional at times with lots of things to interact with. I do wish the facial expressions were animated a little more, they were quite stiff for the whole game."
2906,this game si good
2907,"Life Is Strange 2, a sequel that is set in the same kind of universe but has some very different characters in the form of two young brothers. While the stories and characters are different, the weight of making tough moral choices between options that aren’t very appealing is at the heart of the game. The story revolves around Sean and Daniel Diaz, two brothers who are cast as a couple of lone wolves. At the beginning of the first episode, their gentle father is tragically and accidentally shot by a Seattle policeman. During their epic journey from Seattle to Mexico, Sean guides Daniel to make the right decisions through words and examples."
2908,"Such an amazing story with beautiful art, totally recommend having tissues by your side while you play."
2909,Good story and typical game-play from the Life is Strange series
2910,accurate documentative video game of illegal border immigration
2911,"As far as episode 1, the game is great. Enjoyed every moment of it. It looks awesome, and has a really cool and well-paced story. Recommended!"
2912,"Life is Strange 2

Just completed it. What a journey of ups and downs. What you could say was a roller coaster of a ride. I loved the bond between the two brothers. Also the friendships a long the way. This game had me crying numerous times lol

This game touches upon the real going ons in the world. Life is Strange 1 I really enjoyed. However I loved this second game ever so more. 

Looking forward to the next instalment True Colours."
2913,great game. i like the decision making.
2914,"Life is Strange is sad, as always xD"
2915,"Another one of my favorites series <3

Many annoying cutscenes but STILL love them somehow ,,

Good luck Sean & Daniel <3"
2916,"I really loved this game even though it gave me a lot of stress, especially on the 4th and 5th episode! (I felt like I almost got a fever after the 4th one bois). You can have 4 endings with this + 3 more variations depending on the smaller decisions you make.  I'm glad there are more endings to the game unlike the first game where I felt like my choices didn't really matter because there were only two MAJOR choices which negates all the things I previously did.

Would really recommend this game! It made me realize that you always have to be the bigger person and to be consistent with my choices because this is definitely a big factor on how you end your story."
2917,"This game starts out strong, but it tapers off towards the end. It has a cool and interesting premise, but about half way through, I was like, ""Wait. Is this building up to anything, or are these just a series of random events?"" The characters you build relationships with don't come back. There's no mystery to solve, like in the first game. It's just a string of vaguely connected events that build up to nothing. Go here, thing happens, next episode. I appreciate the multiple endings, but it also seems rather forced. I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but the ending I got (which I think is supposed to be the ""good ending"") felt just so hollow and lacking.

I also started to get very sick of hearing Sean's recaps. It's a cute idea, but it gets old REALLY fast. And he's always crying. I know it's tough, but Jesus Christ. Every single recap. Sob, sob, wolf metaphor, cry, cry.

I loved the first game, and I was prepared to love this one even more, but it just doesn't keep up its momentum. Seeing the game as a whole, after playing every episode, it feels like a big waste of time, which is a shame. But that's just my opinion."
2918,I am hooked!! This game succeeded my expectations. DANIEL IS SO CUTE!!
2919,"Life is Strange 2 is a sequel to one of the best interactive story games which features two brothers of Hispanic descent living in Seattle with their father. You control the teenager Sean Diaz from a third person view and interact with the environment, obtain collectibles, and talk to NPCs through dialogue trees.

Due to a tragedy that befalls them, the two brothers were forced to escape their town and live a life on the run. Throughout the game Sean becomes like a father figure to Daniel. Based on which dialogue trees you’ve picked, you’ll shape Daniel’s behavior towards his interactions in the environment and the people you met in the journey.

The graphics have significantly improved as well as the hair physics in the game. It still retains its painted style which is nice. The hair in the game will sway if there’s a wind, the environment are visually appealing which I took my time to explore every time I entered a new place.

When it comes to collectibles, Sean can find various objects that he can keep with him. This comes in the form of patches and key chains that you can decorate his backpack. There is a collectible mode where you can replay scenes to collect the ones you missed. He also has a sketchbook where in certain parts of the game you can optionally sit and draw sketches of his surroundings. Sean also records his experiences throughout the game in this sketchbook especially on what’s happening off-screen between episodes.

There are a few bugs I’ve encountered in the game like an object floating mid air or during the part where Sean is trying to observe and sketch a surrounding, sometimes I have to wait a few seconds before Sean is able to draw. This only happened twice in episode 4 but nothing game breaking. The story is slow paced and I almost got bored during episode 1 where it took me 4 hours to finish it but I did took my time to try and find every collectible during that episode.

Overall, I did enjoy my time with this game, seeing Sean and Daniel’s bond grew stronger throughout all 5 episodes. It also tackles relevant political issues which a lot of people still experienced today. I do recommend this game especially if you’re a fan of the first one. Get it on sale!"
2920,Its a great game

Your choises dont matter at all, and I mean it I can do anything and story will always go one path for example in chapter 1 you will still get locked up and someones basement even if you dont steal. If you enjoyed all other LiS games then dont play this. If you hate your life and are up to take care of total idiot who will just fuck up your entire life, enjoy this game is made for you."
2924,Definitely better than LIS1 11/10ヽ(•‿•)ノ
2925,This game may be fantasy but there are so many accurate things in the game that it feels very believable! If anyone from other countries want to know how bad racism really is in the USA... They should play this game. It might be a real eye opener! It goes far beyond what they see in the main stream news!
2926,very nice
2927,just a great story. i loved it to bits and would recommend it to anyone who just wants to sit and play a great story game. it only bugged on me once in chapter 5 but i may have just not been listening to Daniel when i went treasure hunting. please come with more great  games
2928,Great immersive story line and game play. Could loose yourself for hours in this game!
2929,"i felt like i got badly touched by this game. wow. i could've been in 5% people choices. After all this game treat you how to choose wisely and think before every move! and encourage you to care about the people around you a lot. being compassionate is main the point of this game.
Highly recommend this game to those who like Detroit become human or these decision based masterpieces.
chill."
2930,"Was annoyed at the little brat child you have to look after for the whole game- he is never happy. i'm just trying to look out for the little pixel child and he just gives me attitude in return- maybe that's just kids? I don't know, i am not a parent! It is much better when you are the person with the power in these games imo. 

Overall the game is good and the story is nice and long, it tackles some very important issues eg- Racist Americans hating on Mexicans, and before you say 'not all Americans are Racist' ask yourself, what have i done to stop racism today?

Any-who, buy it and play it and love it. It is one that's worth it and one you will remember. 

I just wish there was more games like this.. and make sure the player is the one with the powers as i 'can't even' deal with this again.  

PS: Might make you cry a little bit- gets a bit emosh. 

"
2931,"Mediocre compared to LiS. Plays too heavily into over the top/overblown ""stereotypes"" based US political events and opinions during development. Story line was over all a let down and predictable. Hopefully the next one does not play as heavily into tropes and is not as predictable."
2932,"I love this. 
















End of Review."
2933,"Honestly, I've at least started watching three youtubers play LiS 2 and I've always found the storyline quite flat. I thought the characters didn't quite compare to Chloe, Max or Rachel for that matter and found the pace too slow. I never made it past the first Episode. 

This was 'til I decided to give it a shot cause it was on sale and ""LiS: True Colors"" had just been announced. 
And man, what a ride it has been so far. 
Somehow the sequel to LiS has managed to get to me in a way that the first one just couldn't. Possibly because I've grown up since the first one and the world we live in has changed too. The topics and issues discussed by LiS 2 are more relevant than ever, especially in the contest of the setting of the game, the United States. 

Long story short: Sean and Daniel's ripped my heart out, they stepped on it, broke it, they warmed it, put it back together and then gave it back to me. When I reached the end it truly felt like I was saying goodbye to two friends of mine that I'd probably never see again. LiS 2 felt way more mature, hence it felt like it had more depth to me. 

I don't regret at all having bought it and having given this game another chance. Daniel and Sean deserved it. 

Seriously, I'd give this a 9.8/10 and I'm only taking those 0.2 away cause the first time around the first Episode felt a tiny bit too long. (The second time around it doesn't tho, maybe cause one knows what is to come.)"
2934,"I def recommend this game! Not giving any spoilers but I'm just going to say that the plot is AMAZING!! This game will require a PC that is on the better side but the dollars that you pay 4 it is worth it. Plus, if it is too expensive just wait for a sale."
2935,"it veri nice game, bls play thanko, arigato."
2936,made my depression worse but in a good way
2937,"I LOVE IT :D

I saw a lot of people saying it didn't compare to Life is Strange, so I was hesitant to play it. I wish I didn't because this game is amazing in many ways. The characters and the story are amazing and I haven't even finished them all yet."
2938,"Comparing to the first one, it was a pretty immersive experience. Without the time-reversing factor, it truly felt like each and every one of your choices mattered. And honestly, they really did, up to the very end.
Overall - I really enjoyed the story and the relationships between the characters, I can't recommend it enough."

2943,I'm loving the story and character development. I really enjoy the story telling style this team puts together!

Life is Strange 2 is the story of brothers Sean and Daniel who - after the discovery of Daniel’s latent telekinetic powers results in a devastating tragedy - are forced to become international fugitives in order to escape the authorities and attempt to find safety in Mexico.  

Being a sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed episodic games to date, this game had a lot to live up to.  It does in so many ways, but not so much in others;  at first glance, the episodic format and overall structure are nearly identical to the first, but there’s a slight improvement in the graphics and facial animations, which I appreciated.  This story has so many emotional and memorable moments dealing with themes that are very serious and controversial, similar to the first game.  It certainly has its moments but it’s definitely not on the level of its predecessor which doesn’t mean it’s a bad game, just not as good (I love so many things about both games, and they’re definitely worth playing).  One thing about Life is Strange 2 that’s as good as the first game is the soundtrack; The developers really know how to match certain songs with the mood of particular levels or cutscenes and the music fits perfectly in nearly every scene.  However, The biggest difference is the fact that the choices throughout the game aren’t nearly as pivotal as they are in the previous game.  It lets you make choices about Sean and Daniel’s morality and actions, but then sometimes it just follows a set narrative so your choices don’t seem to make a difference (similar to a lot of choices found in Telltale’s the Walking Dead).

Life is Strange 2 doesn’t quite soar to the heights of the first game as a result of a few story and character related imperfections, but it’s an emotional adventure that remains worthy of its title and manages to be unique in new and exciting ways.

7/10"
2945,"This is my first time making a game review lmfao. Honestly kinda saddened me reading the reviews and seeing so many people say their choices did not matter and they disliked the game for that. I was put-off by it and hesitated to play the game but I did anyway. After playing the whole game in the span of 1-2 days I realized that your choice really really really does matter. Everything mattered. The way you interact with Daniel and how you raise him throughout the game- whether through words, your own actions, and lessons/experiences- are the most important factor. This game isn't about the ending, but the journey. That's what you learn on the road. You'll meet people and leave them after a while, taking in their perspectives as you travel further. I agree there isn't as much time to get emotionally invested with some characters, but I am honestly fine with it. They are just passing characters that Daniel and Sean meet on the way. The ones that I've become emotionally attached to are the brothers and their fucked up journey away from home. I love these boys with all my heart lol. 

Anyway, the story-telling is great, the art is great, the graphics are great, the music is great, and the characters are great. This isn't a ""perfect"" game... But it is still a really good one that I, personally, enjoyed. (Also you shouldn't really compare this with the first game because they are their own respective stories with different characters and shit... Although the easter eggs that tie in with the first game are pretty great)."
2946,most intense and stressful game. 10/10 would regret life choices again
2947,The characters are even less likable than the ones in the first game. It made it pretty intolerable.
2948,Pretty good emotional story kinda sad but i like it and these type of games as well.For me 10/10
2949,pain but good
2950,"This should be called ""Life is Sad"".

Great for anyone who enjoys a game focused on narration and story. Mechanically, there is not much to the game. However, if you enjoy an interactive exploration of the raw, emotional connection between people, this game should pull on your heartstrings.

It is not without its faults. Not all episodes are created equal and some plot elements are weaker than others. Some social and political elements are well-intentioned but can feel heavy-handed, devolving into caricatures. These elements do not significantly detract from an otherwise emotional journey."
2951,"As a fan of life is strange 1 I thought that this game will be as good. Finishing this game was an absolute pain and one of the worst experiences I ever had. . My choices don't seem to matter. It's more like an interactive movie than a game. 
In contrast to the first game, I think this one is not worth playing. To conclude, this should not be part of the life is strange franchise."
2952,[spoiler] Sean commits several war crimes against his country
2953,"i actually enjoyed life is strange 2 as much as the first one
also as heartbroken as the first one
i need time to recover"
2954,Great Game
2955,"Great story, i was afraid it wouldn't be as good as the original Life Is Strange. But its actually really good"
2956,great story.(sad)
2957,"Decent game. I wouldn't call it a life is strange game though. Compared to all the other games in the series (so far, no clue about True Colors). This game is very very very political. People are racist left and right, references to Trump etc. I do miss the more light, timeless story that the previous games brought along.

I also constantly got a feeling that Daniel just doesn't listen. The fact that you don't actually have the superpower yourself in this game means you feel powerless (literally and figuratively) in some scenario's. What made it worse for me is that I somehow managed to get a bad relationship with Daniel, even though I really don't feel like I made bad choices when it comes to me and him. I avoided things I felt were immoral etc etc, and still he kept doing things I tried to keep him from doing.

Overall I'd give this game a 6-7/10. It's not a bad game, but not a great game either in my opinion."
2958,THIS GAME SOOOO GOOODDDD!!!! REALLY MAKE ME FEELS LIKE THE WORLDDDDD ARE REALLYY STRANGE
2959,I love the story
2960,"I love you, [i]enano[/i]. We're Diaz brothers, always."
2961,happy and sad
2962,Its fun to fuck around.
2963,"So, before I start talking about the game itself, I want to point out something. If you've played the previous games in the Life is Strange series and don't want to play this one because it has different characters with a different story, listen to me - PLAY IT.

*POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT*

About the game - Dontnod, as always, make fantastic story games and this one is no exception. My mind was blown by how much I enjoyed the story of this game, though, knowing it's not the Max and Chloe adventure anymore. The game very quickly makes you connect with Sean and Daniel (The main characters) and this personal connection will cost you at the end of the game.
As I see it, Sean (the playable character) is more of a side character than his little brother, Daniel. As it was in the first game, where all of our choices affected Chloe, and basically the whole story was revolving around her, so it is in this one, where everything we do is directly affecting Daniel, and you can even see the effects and consequences of your actions on Daniel at the end of every episode and we can, once again, see the outcomes in the next episodes as well.
The graphics of the game are another thing that makes it as beautiful. The art style of the game, the comics-like graphics fits the story and everything so perfectly, and it makes the story even better. I feel like making the graphics simpler and not trying to achieve 100% realism is what makes the story more immersive. As I see it, if the graphics are more high-end and the devs long for, the players will pay more attention to the graphics, and kind of drift away from the story. So, the graphics and the more low-poly style make you more invested in the story.
One thing that I find weird, yet interesting is the fact that in every episode, we are introduced to new people, which by the end of the episode are no longer with us, and we are forced to leave them. Fortunately, though, the episodes are long enough for me at least to get to know these people and connect with them, which makes us leaving them, sadder and more tragic for me. Thus, it's a nice addition to the game and the whole story.
Finally, I want to talk about the last choice of the game. *SPOILER* After running from the police the whole game due to illegal stuff we've done, we try to cross the border to Mexico, and the police are blocking the way. We have to choose whether we surrender and stop the whole situation from evolving even further, and stop our criminal life from going further, by that giving Daniel a chance to live a somewhat normal life. Or continuing on what we're doing, crossing the border, probably killing policemen and being fugitives once more. The choice is very, very difficult if you actually played and enjoyed the whole game. The game is about 16-17 hours of playtime, which is a lot of time to connect with the characters in the game, which makes you actually feel how hard the choice is for Sean. Going to jail, him and his brother being seperated, and knowing he will not see him for many years, which will probably let him live an actual life, but being a sad life, without his brother. OR trying to cross the border, living a fugitive's life, his little brother being raised up as a criminal, but not being seperated (which ends up not true, and they end up seperated either way. Sean going to Mexico, and living a life there, while Daniel is living in his grandparents house, once again without his brother.) The latter, at least, gives you a slightly better feeling, as both of the brothers are living a ""normal life"", and the lack of tenstion due to us not being in jail and our brother not having to wait for us to be released.
To sum it up, the game has an outstanding story, like all of the Life is Strange games, featuring different characters, though, from the ones in the rest of the series. This story is getting a 9.8/10 from me (not a 10 because there are things that could've easily been avoided, but weren't, for the sake of the plot.)
Another masterpiece from the Dontnod studio.
Good job."
2964,Relatable
2965,Highly recommended. I nominate it  to be the most emotional game I have ever played
2966,Great story. Great soundtrack. Love this series.
2967,BEST STORY
2968,"Hermanos lobos para siempre.
Hit my heart brutally hard."
2969,"TRIGGER WARNING - POLITICAL OPINION AHEAD






I want to be right upfront with this since it seems to be upsetting a lot of people who have played this game. 

Yes, there is an obvious 'liberal slant' to this to the content of this game. Almost every uneducated white character in this game so far has been portrayed as a yokel, redneck, and/or racist. The educated white characters and characters of color have been portrayed as altruistic and decent, though certainly not infallible. There is a very transparent underlying racial and social commentary to the content of this game.

If this is going to upset you, then you should definitely not buy this game. Why spend money on something that is going to piss you off. 


That being said, if you liked the first Life is Strange and the above is no concern to you, buy this now. Its most everything we loved about the first wrapped up into a new story. 

For those who weren't a fan of the first you certainly do not to play the first to understand what is going on here. The two are only vaguely connected. Just so you are aware of what you are getting into, this is a slow paced narrative heavy game where you make spend your time exploring your environment and making careful choices. There is practically no action. Do not expect button mashing combat. It is a dialogue heavy story you participate in, not a world you fight your way through. 

Reflecting on my own experience with LiS1, the story here is better content and pacing than the first one. More adult too - as an adult male playing as a high school girl in LiS1 was always just a little strange. The story in LiS2 more readily connects to users of any age even if the characters are a teen and his little brother. 

On a downside, I'm so far missing the puzzle elements of LiS1 here. So far it has seemed mostly on rails. We are told choices matter but I haven't seen them matter yet. 

But LiS is mostly about the great story you participate in. So far the story here is excellent. 

I would encourage everyone to play this, especially if it is on sale, just so long as the underlying political and racial commentary is not going to upset you."
2970,Good game
2971,I love this game and the first one that I played before it.  Decision based games have always been my favorite.
2972,I love the life is strange series and in my opinion Lis 2 is the best !
2973,"At first I thought, like everyone else, this game would not be as good as the first game. I was even reading Steam comments like you guys. But no matter how many negative comments you read, this game is a true legend. I strongly suggest you not to look at the negative comments and dive into this adventure. It was really perfect. I love you so much Diaz Brother, you will always be in my heart... <3"

2980,"A very sad game. Really good story, and a nice artstyle."
2981,ye
2982,AMAZING
2983,"Another great entry into the Life is Strange series. While I do feel it pales in comparison to the first two games (or maybe by nostalgia and love for the characters of Arcadia Bay blinds me), the game still stands on its own with the delivery of a gripping story featuring interesting characters. My one big genuine criticism is just the pacing, which felt very off throughout the episodes due to the time jumps. Unlike the other games in the series in which each episode takes place over ~ a day, Life is Strange 2 has time jumps within and in-between episodes which made things feel disjointed. Besides that, the game, like its predecessors, exceeds in exploring genuine characters in complex situations filled with the supernatural."
2984,"I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Life is Strange. It's short, free, and has a very good story that unravels as you go through."
2985,The ending is very emotionally heavy and I also like that there are a variety of endings you can get. The Wolf Bros will be forever in my heart. <3
2986,This game  is really emotional and touching.This is the second game that really made me cry. You get emotionally attached with the characters  in this game and you can even relate to them . I really recommend everyone  play this game.
2987,A beautiful story
2988,Very fun :D

2990,no
2991,"it was a good game and I enjoyed the story , I like the fact that the choices actually had an effect on the ending and the music was fantastic , the art style was really good too."
2992,One of the best choice based game I have played ever. ( The first one in my library and ill be honest I pirated the others I played). But the story is sooo good so far! I have finished the episode 1 right now! and I suggest you should buy the rest episode because thats what I'm gonna do!! HAVE FUN AND GOOSEBUMPS PLAYING THIS!!
2993,The Life is Strange series is always amazing. The story and emotions they put into each game is honestly breath taking.
2994,"I want to start by saying that this game was ... actually ok. And If I had nothing to directly compare it to I would probably be less critical it,
However this game doesn't even come CLOSE to Life Is Strange 1 and it's prequel (Before the storm).
And the reason why is incredibly simple, the roadtrip.

 In other Life Is Strange games you stick around the same recurring cast in the same places throughout every episode, because of this you get to create really unique and well developed character, who audiences can grow deeply attached to.
However In Life Is Strange 2 the characters change every episode, with only the brothers, who are shockingly 1 dimensional characters, to gain any sentimental value to.

I found myself honestly not even caring about the FINAL choice, and picking the one I thought would have the coolest ending, rather than the one I felt was best for the characters in the story, because I honestly had no emotional attachment to them."
2995,"If this was a book it would be great, but since its not I have to set the bar higher.  I will say I did somewhat enjoy the story, but the choices don't have enough of an effect on the story.  There is a lot more branching paths the story could have gone.  For one you should have been able to charge your phone while in the strangers car and after you stop at the motel before you went up to room.  It would make sense that the stranger would have let you charge your phone and that he might comment on it, but only if there is reason that he knows you have a phone.  Either way, your character or stranger should have brought it.  Also, it would be interesting if you were able to ask the stranger for money so you can buy things.  For example there could be a scenario where he helps you by gear for camping.  Also, the price of the food and drinks are too high to be realistic.  A two liter of soda does not cost $4.50 anywhere.  The highest price I've seen a soda is $2.50, plus places like Dollar Tree sell everything for a dollar or less.  Also, a can of soda cost 75 cents or less in real life.  Bottle water in real life doesn't cost more then a $1.50 unless your buying something bigger then 20z.  Also, Walmart sells 5 gallons refills for only 25 cents.  You buy a gallon jug of water for a 80 cents.  Can goods also don't cost more then $1.75 at gas stations.  Anyways, developers I think you need to rethink your gameplay."
2996,"I bought this game as one unit over a year after the release of all episodes.
Reactivity to player choice is non-existant.
The political commentary is so far off the mark- I can only imagine their target audience (As in people who were willing to play a choice-heavy narrative game with queer female leads) is already, probably, more anti-racist/fascist than the dev team imagined. Captain Spirit was the highlight of the game, and it was free with an ""ee""
Tighter, more defined narrative."
2997,"The story is a good one, however a very very slow one. The pace is unbearable at times."
2998,da best
2999,"it still have some annoying bugs, but overall..its cool. love the story"

3001,Second time playing this game(first was on xbox) still a great game.
3002,"don't listen to the negative reviews, this game is a great life is strange title and grand in it's scope of being a brotherly road trip to mexico, if you liked the last two games, you'll enjoy something here."
3003,"Daniel is the worst. He is annoying, selfish and the choices you make in this game doesn't matter at all because you must always agree to what Daniel wants."
3004,I loved this game so much. So touching and your choices impact the story significantly more than the first game. I have to say I prefer this game over the first one.
3005,"This game completely destroyed me emotionally, I don't think I have ever felt like this from a game before."
3006,"well that was good as well as last life is strange series was but i wish episode 4 would be better cause that was not as well as others in game 


but against lasts this was not as well as life is strange 1 and before the storm"
3007,"good story line with good characters, setting and music. would recommend it to any person who liked lis1. it's nice to see that some lis1 characters/setting came back in some of the episodes"
3008,"I really enjoyed this game. At first the story was quite slow paced but it picked up after the first two chapters. I thought it would be hard for me to play through this game if the pace was like the first chapters the whole game through, but it truly was an interesting story with lots of choices and paths to take. I think I prefer the two earlier LiS-games over this one, but this is still an enjoyable and emotional game."
3009,"As incredible as it is emotionally devastating. The game is so beautifully written & has such amazing scenery that it makes for a truly unforgettable experience. The characters are definitely more developed than the first game, and I cannot wait to play the upcoming third entry in the series."
3010,"Gripping story, a lot of the choices do matter. It's incredible to see the outcome of your actions compared to others at the end of each chapter. If you like choices matter, you'll be addicted to this one."
3011,It's decent.
3012,"Even if it's not a direcr sequel to LIS 1 i still really enjoy the story so far, just finished episode 2, gotta say Dontnod knows how to write a story when they put their mind to it"
3013,A nice sequel to the original. There wasn't as much of an emotional impact but I would still recommend fans of the first to play it.
3014,so funny and hard to play i love it
3015,Very Good
3016,"I played the first Life is Strange as well as the prequel and have enjoyed all of them thoroughly! I never played story-driven decision games before Tell Me Why, which led me to this series. Life is Strange 2 feels like the decisions you make matter even more and have the greatest impact on the story out of any of the previous games. The fleshed out characters are one of the things that I loved about this series, and everyone feels as real as ever. I also loved the Captain Spirit integration, such a wonderful addition to the story and a great standalone game."
3017,"it's a really fun game, but it does give me a lot of anxiety when making my own choices, but that's part of the fun. I really enjoy the and the brothers dynamic. :))"
3018,"Pretty boring ""quests"", go collect this, go grab that, oh now you get to make a decision that changes... well not much."
3019,THis gAme iS AmaZing
3020,"overwhelming history, love it as much as the first one! thanks for this beauty and master piece of arty game."
3021,This game is so awesome
3022,"I absolutely loved the first game and its prequel. This game was good but didn't make an impact on me like  LiS1 and BTS. While this game was beautiful and I thought they nailed it with the soundtrack, sometimes the commentary and themes on racism felt just a little forced. I did really like some of the characters [spoiler](Wish Brody got more screen time as I enjoyed his character)[/spoiler] and some of the themes resonated a little with me, but scenes like the one [spoiler]in the gas station when they were accused of stealing by that one guy or the one near the end where the Mexican family was locked in the cell and the cop was being racist[/spoiler] , just bring down the experience for me as it makes the game feel more artificial. When this game shines though, it really shines. It was a really good idea for a story and it was really compelling to see where their journey took them next. I really enjoyed certain elements of this game, but I feel that some of the commentary is set up in such unrealistic ways that make it hard to not feel forced. I know I've said a lot of negatives about this game in this review but there really is a lot to love about this game. The world is very beautiful and the art is fantastic here. The journey is compelling and there are many different endings to get that are actually affected by what you did over the course of the game. [spoiler]Some of the decisions in this game were also hard to make because of the game forcing you to raise Daniel. That was one of the highlights of the game for me.[/spoiler] Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoyed the first games, as this game is a pretty powerful game, even if it drills it's ideologies into your head a little too much."
3023,"Very engaging i was engrossed through out the whole game ,it tripped in a few places but flew in a few others"
3024,"An incredible bittersweet adventure of 2 fugitive brothers, with rich storytelling and meaningful decision-making! Highly-recommended! One of the cases where the sequel does justice to the original game!"
3025,best one yet
3026,Life is indeed strange. I didn't know that I would connect and cry way too much over this game. T_T
3027,Very good worth playing
3028,"This is a great sequel to the first game. The game's pacing feels slow off the bat, but it's very focused on the characters rather than the action at the start. It starts to pick up a lot in the second episode. 

The game gets you attached to the characters and makes you feel like you're responsible for the outcome of Daniels life."
3029,"I remember not wanting to play this game at first because of Daniel. But boy am I glad I changed my mind.

I feel like this game is underappreciated by LiS fans, which is understandable. Some people are looking for a small and quiet town setting similar to the first game and BtS. Some others are more attached to the characters of the first game and Arcadia Bay. And some think that this game is ""White man bad"" propaganda due to the heavy use of the brothers' ethnicity as a setup for conflict (which is a dumb argument, but you do you).

I tried the first episode ( since it's free ;3 ) and (almost) instantly got hooked.
At first I definitely despised Daniel but he started to grow on me after a while. Seeing both Daniel and Sean grow throughout the game is great, and actually does lead to different endings depending on what you teach Daniel to do (I got the worst ending but I'm not even mad).

Compared to the first game and BtS, I feel like the game has more stakes and more compelling drama (partly because of no BS time powers and because your choices matter). Our protagonist goes through so much pain to keep his brother safe, which is great to see and makes you feel like you should protect him. 
To me, the themes of the game are more mature and touch on more controversial subjects, making the story more compelling imo.

Anyway, I know this game isn't for everyone, I know Daniel can be REALLY annoying at times, that some episodes can be boring and that the game has cringy moments. But please, give it a try, you might fall in love with the game, just like I did."
3030,good storytelling not too perfect just like all the life is strange games
3031,"I love Life is Strange and Before the Storm, but this game feels like its missing everything that made the other games in the series stand out from other choose your own adventure games. I didn't even make it through the first episode before the cartoonishly flat characters and lack of impact my choices made on the story led me to requesting a refund. Here's hoping True Colors turns out a bit better."
3032,"[b]Pre-Game Review:[/b]

Was honestly surprised on how much I'm liking the story so far. I expected to feel meh since it seemed very different from the first game, but I gotta say, it seems like I'll love this one (and its characters) way more than the first game. 

(Will update my review as I finish the game.)

[b]An-hour-after Post-game Review:[/b]

[u]HELL I LOVED IT SO MUCH IM CRYING AGAIN LOL LEAVE ME ALONE WITH MY MOMENTS OF CALM LUL[/u]

[b]Immediate Post-game Review:[/b]

It's not bad, but it's not the best either. 

For fans of the franchise (meaning, the art style, use of music, Moments of Calm), I can confidently say you'll feel biased and still like the game regardless of the story. I know I did.

If, however, you're more drawn to the original characters (ie. Chloe, Max, and Rachel) rather than the game style and elements, this might not be the game for you. 

I won't be too critical about the game's writing since that wasn't particularly what I came for, but I did like the inclusion of more real-world relevant themes such as racism, coming from someone who could potentially experience racism too in a foreign place, but I have to admit that the writing does tend to fall flat at times. But I do believe that the twists are definitely still of Life is Strange character; I still loved them. Also, this game taught me a bit about U.S. geography lol.

Overall… Hell I'm a Life is Strange fan, I'm biased. I still loved it. If you love the franchise, go get it. It's still worth the experience, enjoy the adventure. If not, it might be best to stick with the first game.

PS. Not to compare, but I definitely cared for Sean and Daniel (and Captain Spirit) more than the leads of the first games."
3033,"This game made me sick playing it almost all the time.
the decisions it makes you to make are utter bullshit and does not give you any freedom of choice whatsoever!
The main Character is like a Monk that knows nothing of fighting and standing for himself, just likes to bend over so other people can beat the shit out of him!

It feels like your little brother is the decision maker, in most cases he is the one makes the decisions and even though you say no, you end up doing whatever he says!

and game is sooooo boring and slow most of the times, you have to listen to every none sense and uninteresting things it throws at you!

and game doesn't give you any option to get control over your brat of a brother! 
[spoiler] Oh you just picked a huge tree out of the water and risked tons of people finding out, no problem your just a kid. Oh you used your power on your brother multiple times, no problem no need to talk to him about it and beat the shit out of him, he's just a kid. every moment of this game I wanted to beat the crap out of that brat but NOOOO, he's just a kid! [/spoiler] 

about the characters and people at the start of the game:
[spoiler] Oh I don't care I have a BFF that had an accident, why would we implement an option to call her from a phonebooth or something, cause we don't give any shit for emotions and realism! [/spoiler] 

ending was something else:
[spoiler] hey we made a whole on the wall bet we can go through there after escaping the jail but NOOOO, let's go through the main border check where usually at least 10 guards would be present. AT LEAST! [/spoiler] 

and so many other stuff that I just don't want to waste time on mentioning. 
this game has no story, no realism, no plot and no emotions which is the main part of this genre of game!

I wouldn't have played this game if I know it is this way even if I was paid for it. feels so bad to see I've paid for such thing in the first place!

I won't be buying any new life is strange releases for sure, they just want to milk everyone using the name of the first series which was awesome, had story and emotions and all the stuff, this trash has none of them."
3034,Is GOOD 10/10
3035,Life is Strange never disappoints.
3036,"I love the Life is Strange series so much, and I can't wait for the third one in September. Oh also, Cassidy is amazing, and she has an awesome voice."
3037,"one super long weird road trip between two wolves, 10/10"
3038,This game is so poorly optimized that it can't run the first episode on the lowest settings on my gaming rig.
3039,perfect game
3040,What an amazing story about two wolves. I will never forget it. I would recommend any game in the Life is Strange series.
3041,Its good if you like this style of game.
3042,This game is amazing
3043,"Strong emotional impact ,a bit slow stars but I get it its the first episode . I love the idea that The Brothers are having a journey and they are constantly moving.
The sound is pretty great, but not wow
I like the Graphic design ,pretty interesting 
Personally I love the story, I think is so good because its about the Brothers hood between Sean and Daniel
One of the thinks that the game is trying to say is that there are a lot of people how are being bullyed because of there skin Color ore Nationality 
Over all I recommend this game if you like this MovieGame type."
3044,incredible story telling

[h1]In-Depth Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Pros[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
The environments depicted in LIS 2 are very well made, especially natural ones like wilderness or deserts. The light effects and chromaticity of each place are distinct, and give off the right atmosphere each time. Character models are usually rich in distinctive details such as tattoos, clothes and similar apparel - not only the important ones but also side NPCs. overall, despite not having latest gen textures or details, the game successfully delivers a vibrant world.

[b]2.[/b]
The growth of both Sean and Daniel throughout the five chapters is extremely well represented. As the older brother, Sean will have to set an example of conduct and morality for his sibling through his actions and choices. The way players decide to make Sean act will have major consequences on Daniel's psychological growth and line of thought. Not only that, but the relation between the two can deteriorate or become stronger depending on such choices, while Daniel may outright refuse to follow his brother on some ventures depending on his attitude so far.

[b]3.[/b]
The writing of narration, characters and general script is of good quality, globally. Most of the represented situations, reactions and behaviors by the people surrounding the duo, is plausible and fairly realistic in its unfolding. This however is not true at all times, as some exaggerations or impossibilities are present from time to time.

[b]4.[/b]
Sean and Daniel will face a lot on their journey. Between fanatics, criminals and the dangers of the wild, there is a good amount of action and suspense throughout LIS 2. Most of these ""enemies"" can be overcome id different ways, depending on the protagonists' approach. Sometimes however, the outcome will be set in stone.

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[b]1.[/b]
In some occasions, the behaviors and actions of certain individuals on the brothers' path will be very extreme or even totally implausible in a real-world context. I don't want to make spoilers, let's just say certain politics-related actions are overblown, distorted to an unrealistic extreme in order to promote the opposite political side's points. Games can be political by all means - however, especially for a game based on our real-world as a reference, there should not be such a distortion and implicit bias towards or against certain agendas. Games are an entertainment medium, not a propaganda tool.

[b]2.[/b]
Sean and Daniel, in some cases, could have the means to radically change the outcome of some situations, and they do, but not always. In fact there are some sequences where they are not given the chance to act, or they do but with far too limited options, in relation to their capabilities. This, to an extent, makes the narration fell artificially driven in such instances.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431066085

[h1]Gameplay Breakdown[/h1]

[b]Exploration[/b]
Is performed by controlling Sean, the older brother, in third person view. The environments have great variety as they range from urban areas to complete wilderness. While exploring, the main thing to look for are interactive objects, which can be anything from drawers or some memorabilia, to doors, tree branches and of course, also NPCs. Some of these items can be picked up as Collectibles, which have many related achievements. Witnessing some events or finding certain items may, in some cases, influence or expand the dialogue options in future situations - or open new possibilities of interaction with the environment.

[b]Interactions[/b]
Are done with a contextual menu that may change based on the object in question, and the situation. For instance, the possibility to open a door using a key will only be displayed if Sean has a key in his inventory. In the case of people, dialogue menus often have a range of questions or discussion topics, while certain items may be discussed or shown to Daniel, the younger brother, to ask his opinion and such. In some more action-oriented situations, certain special actions can be performed on people or objects, such as for example ambushing someone with a blunt weapon.

[b]Minigames[/b]
Depend on the context, but most of them are about throwing certain objects to a specific target or drawing a scenario using Sean's sketchbook. There are however some unique minigames in certain chapters, that use each a unique system not found in any other, such as pressing buttons at the right timing to name one. The outcome of these sections may influence the story, albeit never in a massive way.

[b]Puzzles[/b]
In some cases, Sean and Daniel will find themselves in front of logic-based puzzles, which can be either succeeded or failed. For example, infiltrating a location without being seen by cameras or guards, or sneaking into private propriety without making noise. These segments have usually a precise order of objects to collect and use correctly, otherwise they will fail or partially fail, with significant story consequences.

[i]It took me around 18 hours to finish all five episodes of LIS 2, taking some extra time to try out most interactions or minigames as well. The current total price of 32€ for episodes 2 to 5 is fair for this amount of content, also considering the decent replay value to see different choices. I can recommend buying for full price to Narrative Adventure fans, [u]provided one is not too bothered with occasional excessive politicization.[/u][/i]

3049,Story focused game in an era where they are scarce. Support it.
3050,"Very good. It's story is a lot more ""mature"" than LiS 1 but still just as great as LiS 1."
3051,An Epic Journey with actually great endings.
3052,perfect
3053,The story very rich
3054,It's a simply a very engaging game.  The story sucks you in.  The soundtrack is top notch.  Production value is top notch.  I just can't get away from it.  The whole series is a favourite!  It's totally addictive.
3055,"Episode 1,2,3 are interesting, but the last two ones are a bit boring expecialy the last one were we stay the entire episode in one place without action.
Anyway over all the story is great and the graphics kinda impressed me."
3056,"Made my cry, yes!
But overall didn't enjoy the pacing as much and I feel like the chapters weren't too connected, every chapter felt like a different short story altogether. And I didn't really see myself caring for anyone tbh except for Sean and Daniel... And Lyla, I really feel like she's kinda underutilised in the story, she was probably my favorite character in the whole game and she only had like like 20-30 minutes of screen time, including the phone calls.

Enough rants, now the good parts, The story is pretty good, not as great as the first one, but pretty GOOD. Characters are amazing, the less screen time with every character, and so many new characters in every episode makes sense, but it also takes away from the experience, considering how hard it is to balance it in a story like this, they did a decent job with that. I just felt like there were a lot of filler moments which I could've traded for some character development or something.

I know this whole thing might sound like a rant but that's only because I LOVE this franchise. And I feel like they can do MUCH better.

Overall I'll give it a 7.5/10"
3057,Best Game I played i want to cry
3058,"This is a complex one...

Life Is Strange 2 is certainly a very good game. It has likeable characters, a good narrative goal and tons of ever expanding choices to be made by the player. It does well at setting these choices up with their connections to the others in the past or in the possible future. In that respect, it does this better than the first game, Life Is Strange. 

But, that being said, I do have my few personal thoughts about the game as a whole and how its narrative beats are structured and whether or not there are enough of them. Throughout episodes 1 & 2 I found this game to be what felt like a chore to play. The narrative just doesn't properly wake up in the first 3 hours and I felt like I was dragged along by the story, rather than following it. It does have some serious issues with pacing in the starting episodes and this does repeat slightly further on. 

Half way through episode 3 was where I started to enjoy the game. I was finally out of the slow lane as it were. More good characters were being set up by this point and I was starting to bond with them. As a big fan of Life Is Strange 1 and Before the Storm, one of my priorities is to create and keep a bond with the games characters. The characters that were showing up were very interesting, different, but interesting. All the while continuing with the main narrative of the game. It bonded well. There was a very good cohesion of characters, situation and narrative. Something that was only built upon in throughout episode 3. While it ended very well, all the characters you had just met and bonded with in the past hour and a half were gone by the start of episode 4. Now this is completely understandable, as the main narrative events take priority in a game like this, but it just leaves the player wanting these characters to show up again. Of course there are letters and references to these characters further along, a lot of them you never actually see again. That left me disappointed. I wanted to explore these characters more than I got too. 

From episode 4 to the ending, the game has a good structure. Padding is apparent, in the form of very limited gameplay or cutscenes that aren't really story related. But, it does keep the urgency and end goal in the sights of the story. There is a sheer difference between the first two episodes and the other three. The first two, while setting up the narrative and main protagonists, felt somewhat empty. Now I'm not saying games like this should be predictable, because that would take away its point, but I was constantly thinking something was going to happen when really it just...didn't. This is why I'm glad to say that the episodes 3-5 make this game a good as it is. It took the narrative structure and shook it up in a box of new things. Finally fulfilling my enjoyment. 

So, is Life Is Strange 2 a good game? I already said. Its definitely a good game. Its story is strong. The characters you meet, quite quickly, are very human and create a meaningful impact on the story you follow, and also that bond I talked about. I loved the fact that the game takes your decisions from its predecessor and bends your narrative experience to fit with what happened in your play through of the first game. As a good fan of the original duo, Max & Chloe, I was very happy to find out as much as possible about this.

Technically speaking, the game runs well on most systems. The game is visually beautiful, while not being too demanding at common resolutions. I never encountered any freezes or crashes with the game, although there was one small progression bug in episode 5 which can be fixed easily by loading the last checkpoint. 

All in all, this game is worth it. Especially if you like the franchise. The developers made new characters and the game was executed well enough to make a good addition to the series. But, if you're like me, you may have the same thoughts. For me personally, the bond between the brothers was not strong enough. Only as I can't really relate to it, one of the reasons why I still prefer the first game and Before the Storm over this. 

I recommend Life Is Strange 2, even if you're unsure. It offers a ton of insight into the universe and is needed for future games if you want to continue the franchise. Worth a play!"
3059,"*This game lacks a content warning for its depictions of police violence, violence against Latin people, anti-immigrant violence, and descriptions of conversion therapy and child endangerment.*

I expected better from this franchise.

While the original Life is Strange, the prequel Before the Storm, and Dontnod's LiS-adjacent Tell Me Why are not without their missteps when approaching sensitive topics, and while the games sometimes over-equivocate in an attempt to add moral ambiguity to the actions of their characters, on the whole I enjoy them and I appreciate their refusal to shy away from tackling complex issues.

LiS2 attempts to up the ante of its predecessor by forcing the player to grapple with the effects of systemic racism and white supremacy in the United States of 2016-2017.  But rather than treating this topic with the respect and sensitivity that it deserves, the game feels downright sloppy.  Beginning from the Prologue, with its implication that violence from the notoriously racist and brutal Seattle PD surprises the protagonist and his brother, the game belies a callous disregard for the reality of life as a Hispanic person in the United States - the very thing that it is attempting to portray.

I could critique this game for its clunky mechanics and unintuitive morality system, or for the compulsory heterosexuality in a franchise known for its queer representation.  But what is unforgivable to me is that, despite the protagonist being Latino, the game seems to be written from a white perspective and for a white audience."
3060,"i really tried liking this game.. i did.. i had to take 5 breaks in 5 hours in order to calm myself down. The writers of this story should feel proud of themselves! They managed to create a character that i hate and wish to see dead more than Joffrey Baratheon in Game of Thrones. Not sure if that was their purpose but if it was.. Bravo!!!

They should add in the Disclaimer ""if you want to know what is like to be in a toxic relationship, play this game""

You thought you will have fun and mess around while enjoying your free time? WRONG!!! here, take this little brat that you never asked for and take care of him and no.. you cant abandon him or kill him either.. That is a Choice you can't make!! you as stuck with him and now everything is about him cuz you dont matter.. and you know what.. lets give the lill pice of shit some supernatural powers too cuz fuck you!! now deal with it!!

If you ever been happy or mentally healthy and able to make a decision that will get you out of a stupid situation but always wondered what is like to not be like yourself.. play this.. it will strip you out of all smart choices you would ever make.. 10/10 would recommend this telenovela! especially if you want to lose some brain cells in the process!"
3061,"When I first watched a portion of the gameplay on YouTube I was like...eh it doesn't seem that good. A year later during quarentine I saw the first episode was free on steam and decided to give it a play. I don't regret ANYTHING. I can confidently say this is 10x better than the first LiS. I love the changes in scenery throughout the game and found a connection with every charater I came across. I personally did not find Daniel too annoying, as long as you're nice to him he seems to follow the rules I give. The graphics were amazing and I even played the game twice to get all of the achievements. Great job DONTNOD!!!"
3062,Gret gem.
3063,so far so good
3064,"This is a difficult review to write.  Let me start with this.  I played Life Is Strange and really enjoyed it.  I also played through Life Is Strange: Before the Storm and enjoyed it, although it was not as good by a fair margin.  I could see the beginnings of a political narrative seeping into the game in places, and the lack of the main character having a special power made it less interesting (I'm sorry but knowing how to push people's buttons is not a super power).

After reading many mixed reviews on whether the game is politically offensive or pushes an anti-conservative narrative, I decided to try the free episode before making a final decision.  Here's what I found.  While the game doesn't [i]directly[/i] implicate conservatives as villains, the [spoiler]two[/spoiler] villains portrayed in the first episode are [spoiler]a green cop who panicked and wrongfully shot the protagonist's dad and a grouchy store owner who accuses the boys of stealing and tries to capture them and turn them over to the police.  During this scene, he makes a lot of remarks like telling them they're the reason we need a border wall.[/spoiler] So it appears, based on the first chapter, that the bad guys are going to be [spoiler]police[/spoiler] and conservatives.  While it's plausible (sadly these things on a rare occasion do happen), it's also going to alienate a lot of players by spotlighting conservatives as the villains.

I wouldn't say it's a [i]strong[/i] spotlight though, and I almost wouldn't put it that way, but after some reflection that does seem to be how this is going to go.  So I'm faced with the choice of a thumbs up or thumbs down.  I hesitate to give it either, but I want to give it a rating of some kind.  Ultimately I've chosen not to purchase the game at this time, although I may change my mind later.  I had the game in my cart this time and didn't go through with the purchase.  So what do I give it?  The only answer I could come up with is that my thumb will follow my purchasing decision."
3065,Really great story with good characters
3066,"Choices are an illusion and don't seem to have any real affect or they are small. Multiple choices in the game act like they will have a big effect but don't. You make a ""big"" choice but end up  with the same consequence regardless of what you chose to do."
3067,I. LOVE. IT.
3068,"It pains me to not recommend this, but I'll start by saying that this is obviously subjective and some people can enjoy this game.
Like everybody, I went into this game with expectations of seeing LiS1 quality or expecting it to make me feel like the first game did; I was hugely disappointed.
This game tries hard to be so similar to the first game that it forgets to BE a Life is Strange game. This may not make sense for people reading this before buying but I think the players can at least somewhat relate.
The melancholy of living in a small town was one of LiS1's major themes, and they may have done this well in this game also. It takes a different turn in the game when racism comes into play, as the two main characters are Hispanic, which is nice to spread awareness. But people's racist approach to these two characters is what DICTATES this game. It's almost like the developers gave themselves some slack because they can crap on racism. And the main characters are just Michael Jackson of making shitty choices that make no sense, which sends you down an alley of problem solving. I won't give any spoilers but as the two characters are already dealing with a very serious life problems and everything seems to not go in their favor, because Daniel wants a present and because Sean can't afford it, he decides to steal (you have no say in this ridiculous choice), which comes to bite him in the ass. As everybody else mentioned, there is also a serious issue of making it seem like your choices matter, but actually it very rarely does, pretty much when the game decides to do a razzle-dazzle. I truly loved the first game and played it twice, watched playthroughs and participated in discussions, it's one of my favorite games ever, but I couldn't actually bring myself to play this game after a little more than two hours.
As I'm writing this, announcement trailer for Life Is Strange: True Colors came out two days ago, and I will definitely play that game as well when it comes out, but as far as I can tell, making another LiS game as profound as the first one isn't their priority, and they might be just riding the hype train till it dies out."
3069,"If you liked the first one, you'll like this one to. Great story, a bit stretched sometimes but still good. LiS1 was a deeper story to get connected to, but this is still worth playing/watching. 
Rating: 6/10"
3070,Amazing game.
3071,"I know writing are subjective, it's depend on personal experience
I love the story on this game more than any David Cage game I play before, it more focus and personal.
I really get emotional attach to leads of this game, same as the first Life is Strange game 

love it !"
3072,most heartbreaking game.. i love it
3073,Great Story 👌
3074,"I absolutely love this game! It has amazing story with unexpected events, it has amazing brother bond and choices that impact a lot in the story. I really got emotional and attached with the story. 10/10 Thank You! :) <3"
3075,"The game is fine, played it a little"
3076,"From the beginning, I was a little bit skeptical about it. To be honest I played it just because I love Life is Strange 1. But in the end, I like it too. Not more than the previous game. Some parts look too unrealistic to me. And of course that I don't mean the kid's superpower, but for example beginning, the main plot, the policeman reaction."
3077,"Bland MC, no real plot, hard pass, really tried to find the good in this game."
3078,"Horribly underrated and under appreciated. This game may not have been as gut wrenching as the first Life is Strange, but it is packed full of the small details that really get to you if you pay attention. Life is Strange 2 was not meant to ""beat"" the first in anyway but was rather meant to tell a new story and what a beautiful story it is.

Thanks to the team for the representation Sean and Daniel bring. It means a lot to a whole lot of people."
3079,"The game is fine, played it a little"
3080,The first opus is better but this game is pretty good ! I recommend it  !
3081,"I actually don't think I will able to finish this game. It's not because it's bad, it's just that a lot of themes are very heavy for me and apply a little too closely to my personal life. I find it stressful and emotionally exhausting to play, unlike other games from this franchise, but I believe it is a game worth playing! Just take the content warnings seriously!"
3082,"Just as the first, I really enjoyed it"
3083,it was one of the best games ive ever played
3084,"I really like this game. It's nicely different from the first game yet similar enough and I love the twists and turns of the story. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the Life is Strange game and to always remember to make your decisions very carefully as they impact the world around you. 5 stars, 10/10."

3091,"Heart wrenching and relevant.  The heart and soul of this story is of course the love between two brothers. That's the bright thing.  On the dark side, you've got the oppression and racism - such is the adversity our heroes face.  If you've ever experienced racism, some of the scenes may feel depressingly familiar, so bear that in mind if you're not in the headspace for that right now.  That being said, I'm glad we have more stuff like this so people can understand what it's like to go through. World needs more empathy and that's what the game offers I think."
3092,BESSSTTTTTTTTTTTT
3093,"Really boring. There is absolutely no desire and interest to play LiS2. If you liked the original LiS, this is not the game for you. The developers removed everything that made the LiS special and unique."
3094,"Excellent game, very emotional and exciting, just like the previous products in the series.
In my opinion, even though Sean and Daniel's characters are very well-written, and their story is still very touching, their adventure is very interesting and the other characters in the game are good - I still think Max and Chloe did it better.
Each episode in LIS2 took me 3 hours, while in the previous games (LIS1 & Before The Storm)'s episodes took me around 2-2.5 hours.
The biggest difference between this product and the previous ones is that this one involves more gameplay elements, which definitely, without any doubt improved my gameplay experience, the story and the characters.
Overall, the game is fantastic. I highly recommend you to buy this game. It's an astonishing adventure, and I gurantee you will enjoy this one if you've played the previous games."
3095,"This game is exciting, emotional, so crazy and really great - like the others before.
I like them all very much!"
3096,Beautiful flow of the story with great role-play. Stayed at the good side of the choices.
3097,"It's a good game, but not as great as the first one. But I love the message that they tried to convey and how important it is. For me personally the first one was more impactful because I think Max and Chloe's bond are actually stronger. The sceneries are definitely much more beautiful comparing the first game, and the variety of the locations as well, which made me happy. If you are a fan of the Life is Strange universe, definitely play it for the journey. Can't wait for the third one."
3098,"Good story. It moves along a little slow, I don't care because i'm enjoying it muchly anyways."
3099,"LiS 2 is a very solid game. Of course its not gonna live up to the hype of LiS 1. Nothing will tbh. The Max and Chloe storyline will forever have a special place in our hearts. But to not even give this game a chance because its not like the original is wrong. I did feel real emotions in this game and kept me on my feet, and wanting to know more. Thats all that matters. Please give this game a chance, you wont regret it."

I can't understand how some people don't like this one, its has much better writing than the first one, your choices affect even more, not only on the end but on a bunch of more things. It is a great sequel, with a little update on what happened to Chloe and Max (imo that was enough). Can't wait for tomorrow and see what the season 3 got for us!

LiS 2 was awesome!"
3111,MUCH BETTER THAN LIFE IS STRANGE 1 i like that it sheds life on police brutality/mistrust in minority communites and racial injustice
3112,"I waited to play at least two full episodes before a review but so far; it's just OK. There have been some good shocks so far, thinking I'm doing the correct thing only to find it had the polar opposite effect. However, it also works in where I can do either and it literally makes no difference. I absolutely hate that. I didn't want to go out into public and be seen; but even though I said ""nah"" we do what danny boy wants to do. Didn't wanna go into the room, we do what danny boy wanted to do anyway... I get the story needs to progress but Life is Strange Season 1 just did it so much better to make choices more seamless even if they ""didn't actually matter"".

Overall, the story so far has me hooked, I didn't think it would keep my attention. I believe as long as you don't go into this holding it to be as good as Life is Strange Season 1 or Before the Storm, you'll be alright treating it as it's own little story. I just so happened to do what many did even though I put off playing this until recently since a new season is coming out. Still recommend people play this game!"
3113,.
3114,"I have played episode one and now have no desire to continue on with the rest of the series.

There was a lot of potential from what I've seen to make a darker, grittier story featuring only Sean as a fugitive, telling his story across America. But what I get instead is a cringetastic story featuring Daniel being a little b*tch and woke politics being crammed in your face like in the gas station. 

The dude mentioned the ""wall"", seriously? 
I want to be entertained, not be reminded why this entire planet is a trash fire."
3115,"A Great game overall even if it's not the same experience as LIS 1 and BTS, some little things where a bit frustrating (i'am looking at you Daniel).
"
3116,"Its tough for sequels to fill in the shoes of their ""original"" games but this game didnt just fill in the shoes it outgrew it. IMO it is a much more layered game than the original LIS and also BTS. Unlike in LIS in this game I felt that my choices mattered from every episode I played. 

The game has a strong political undertone(commentary) but it never gives you answers, it just makes you think. The gameplay mechanics as such has not changed from the previous games but then again why fix something that isnt broke. The middle episodes do feel kinda dragged on but all in all its a very entertaining adventure with all of its laughs and cries. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes these types of games. If youre on the fence and wondering if its better than the 1st then let me clear it out for you with a YES IT IS. 

ALSO, if you chose the BAE ending in the original LIS you will get the much needed closure in this game."
3117,"is good game, me liked"
3118,great game
3119,"I enjoyed this game, although in a few ways it seemed like a step down from the OG. I do think that this game improved on its ending though, despite the game not ending how i wanted it to end despite my choices, it didn't feel like it was the wrong ending."
3120,"I loved Life Is Strange 1 and Before The Storm. That games were epic, but this is not. This game's story is so cringy and felt so bad written, I hate this Daniel brat so much. One of the most annoying characters in this game world and all the game you babysit him, he was always so fucking selfish and senseless. This game is a huge disappointment after Max and Chloe's Story. I hope you guys learn your lesson from this crappy game and make a better story driven Life Is Strange 3. Shit, doesn't even feel emotional at all in the end. Please do not make games like this..."
3121,Very nice game. Cried at the end. 10/10.
3122,i almost cried 10/10
3123,"Life is Strange 2
another Legend game developed by DONTNOD
still can't reach the ""LegendaryNess"" of the first part, Life is Strange, but this one also has a cool, satisfying, well-made & enjoyable story and cast
"
3124,"Gameplay - pay play -  pay play - pay play. 

If you dont like the name Daniel you shoulden buy this game.

This is a good chill game.
"
3125,"Peaks at episode 3, goes downhill after, not half as interesting as the first game and the dialogue is really basic, even annoying."
3126,"Another great mostly stand alone entry in the LiS universe. 
It's pacing does feel different so try not to go in expecting exactly more of the same.
Ensure you read the characters notebook pages to fill in bits of the story as a lot happens off screen.

Even tho' it only has small interactions with the events of the earlier games, I recommend playing them first. (and play Captain Spirit when suggested between LiS 2 Ep 1 and EP 2) as if not they moments will have significantly little meaning to you.

Also loved the very small OXENFREE easter egg on the dispatch."
3127,Yes.
3128,decent game
3129,Didn't really enjoyed the game. I don't really like Sean and I really hate Daniel. Beginning of the first episode doesn't make any sense
3130,its a story about two brothers who lost there fatherand they are lost they are trying to get to mexico but they have problems getting there
3131,"Meu deus que jogo chato... amei muito o primeiro, esse jogo foi decepcionante demais."
3132,The game looks sooo good and well written. The main step up from life is strange 1 to 2 is that when i played episode 1 of Life Is Strange there was no hair movement at all. It only sticks out when a dummy such as myself decides to see if they have hair movement. But lucky enough Live Is Strange 2 now has hair movement So i am sold.
3133,i love it
3134,Honestly doesn't deserve the negative rep due to not being exactly like the first game. It still carries supernatural characteristics and i promise you that yo will fall in love with these characters the moment you set your eyes on them.
3135,Way better than the first and cant wait to see what the third will bring!
3136,good
3137,"As with the first, the story, art, and music are all great! Only played episode 1 so far."
3138,"I played this to the very end only because I paid for it. The story is one of the worst I've ever played of any game. The angst of it all is pretty unbearable, I feel like the only people that would think the story is that great is if you are in highschool or freshly out and your hair is multiple colors and swear your parents hate you. OR live in an antifa hotzone and are a participant of their ideology. All in all terrible game your money can go further in the first one or a tell tale game. 

-3/10"
3139,amazing
3140,"Life is Strange 2 is an unbelievable game, it changes the life of every single one that plays it. Every player should play it till the end and experience those feelings. I just hate how the story shows how the true real world and people can be so brutal and unfair, but it also shows that there are still good people, who help us with our life journey and make it better. Overall this game is something totally different from the others, and it's very special. It kinda reminds me of a plague tale. Anyway, I just don't get why there is so much hate for the second game of LIS, I know it doesn't involve Max or Chloe and I miss them, but I think this game deserves more than that. I'm glad I didn't judge it so quickly and tried it."
3141,Excellent.
3142,a<a
3143,"+ Looks good
+ Good try for an engaging story

- The powers and story did not do it for me

5/10 Finished 3 episodes, but still boring to me. Max, Chloe and time powers worked better."
3144,"Best interactive choice game ever! Anyway, i ship Lyla with Sean XD"
3145,"Not as good as Life Is Strange 1 but it has its moments.  I could personally relate a lot with the game, but the plot which the story revolves around felt forced. There are also a few moments in the game where things felt too predictable, some of which happened just for the sake of driving the plot forward. Overall would rate it a 3/5, not as memorable as Life is Strange 1 or Before the Storm, but not an entire waste of time either since it has its moments like I said."
3146,"very great game lol. brings a lot of nostalgia
"
3147,"While nowhere near as good as its predecessor, Life is Strange 2 is still a journey worth taking if you're a fan of modern adventure games.

The gameplay and interface are almost identical to the first, though you have fewer chances to use your power and doing so doesn't feel nearly as special or satisfying. The graphics are basically the same, and I do really enjoy the slightly cartoonish style these games employ.

Where adventure games can really shine is their story. Sadly, that's precisely where Life is Strange 2 falls flat. The overall plot is decent when viewed from a distance, and some of the individual beats can be great. But for the most part it's tiresome, and somewhat boring. The tension is maintained for far too long, to the point that it becomes uninteresting. The characters behave in stupid and/or unbelievable ways, often committing unforced errors when there was no reason to. They are largely responsible for their own problems, and many troubles could be avoided if the characters would just talk to each other honestly, but that's not often an option.

The first Life is Strange has doses of wonder and joy interspersed with a coming of age story. There's tragedy, yes, but it's not the primary driving force. This second entry could have easily done similarly - especially given the setup foreshadowed in The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit (which you should absolutely play in between 1 and 2) - but instead we get hit with tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. It is the primary focus here, and any wonder or joy or growing up is a minor side step, all too often happening off screen. It has the opposite of the intended effect: instead of making us as players sympathetic to the characters' plight, it makes us numb.

Play Life is Strange. If you thoroughly enjoy it and want more in the same vein then do continue with Captain Spirit and finally with 2. Just don't be surprised when 2 doesn't have nearly the same impact."

3149,"A good game, but not as good as LiS 1 or BtS. The first chapter is insanely good, but last two are a bit annoying IMHO."
3150,good

3152,"Absolutely stunning game. The art, the soundtrack, the story, the acting- it's amazing."
3153,"If you liked the first Life is Strange, you should like this one. That being said, it isn't a different vibe to it, and the power isn't the same, and what's at stake is very different. Still the relationship between the brothers is good, and has a realistic feel."
3154,"I LIKED IT
"
3155,"One of my favourite games ever! Even though I didn't play the first one, I watched gameplays of it and while it was cool and all, it wasn't exactly my kind of story but the second one just hits home for me! Not in the ""family"" kind of way but the whole travelling, finding your place in the world, meeting amazing people, doing some crazy stuff!  
The story is amazing, but to me, the landscapes and overall environment design is just soooo soothing and beautiful! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE!
Good job guys! I hope one day I'll be able to be a concept artist for games like this! You did fantastic!"

3158,"Oh. My. God.
Dontnod, yall have outdone yourselves yet again.
LiS is one of my all-time favourtie franchises. So is this game.
Even though graphics are not the main virtue of this game, the story, characters and music all together combined create something magnificent, beautiful and emotional.
Soundtrack especially is on a world-class level. It fits the tone of the game perfectly, creating such a grate ambience around it.
The story creates a bond between characters and the player.
The whole experience is remarkable. Outstanding game.
Totally recommended.

3162,pog
3163,The Life is Strange series are the best story-based games that i have ever played
3164,life is... so not fair
3165,very nice game .  i love the part i dont relly play and i just go afk XD
3166,YUH
3167,"like with the first game but moreso, it has its fair share of hilariously out of touch moments, but i still thought it was mostly enjoyable.
that said, all of the endings suck, and the final episode is overall pretty bad. it felt unfinished.
thinking back on it, life is strange's endings were also bad, but this one's were probably worse."
3168,the game has a great story to it and ca be real sad time 10/10
3169,"A decent start to the story. I enjoyed the first episode more than the others. Now that it is free, it is certainly worth a try - especially if you enjoy this style of story-rich games. 

For the series overall I have a mixed opinion and the technical problems have me lean against recommending.  It is very slow to launch, with barely acceptable performance in some situations. There are some weird graphical artifacts and occasional odd physics. The graphics are firmly in the Uncanny Valley more often than is comfortable. It crashed numerous times. Once after (a normal) quit, the process continued to run until I killed it. 

Some odd minigames (trimming in particular), are more annoying than adding any true interactivity.  

The story would have been better as a contrived mini-series drama and it did not work as well here. Some cutscenes felt dragged out just to squeeze out more ""gameplay."" Less than halfway through the game I stopped caring about some of my choices because they no longer felt like many [i]really[/i] mattered.  

The autosave system feels more like a trap. Saves do not occur frequently enough, and only happen [i]before[/i] unskippable cut scenes. Several times, I noticed the subtitles not matching the spoken words.

3170,"I loved Life is Strange 1, but this game just isn't as good. The characters aren't as cool, the story isn't as intriguing, and the pace is just. So. Slow. I get that it's a slow kind of game, but this is not ""contemplative"" slow, it's ""fall asleep across your keyboard"" slow.

Most of the choices are lies. Daniel wants something, and regardless of what I choose, we end up doing whatever he wanted. Again and again. Daniel wants to go to a christmas market, and so I have to go, even though I said no. Daniel wants a present, and I can't afford one, so the game forces me to steal. Daniel wants to open the forbidden room at the grandparents' house, and even though I say no, guess what happens...? It's just ridiculous.

I'll try to complete this game eventually, but right now it feels like a chore... not sure I'll succeed."
3171,"First LIS is better. This one was boring many times and didnt get me to care about the characters

3174,"The story was quite good, sometimes spots felt like filler content, but at the end of the day I really enjoyed it. Looking at all other possible endings I think I got a pretty good one! I'm really glad I played this game, amazing work DONTNOD. Also I will hella recommend this game to anyone. Buy it, trust me.

My ending for those who have played the game:
[spoiler] Daniel stays behind in America and Sean becomes a fugitive living in Mexico with Cassidy [/spoiler]"
3175,"Un juego increible, realmente una experiencia super satisfactoria."
3176,"Still prefer LS1 and LS: before the storm. LS2 is just about babysitting the annoying brat, if there are choices to dump him and continue with the journey I would pick without hesitation.
There some plus points for the game, graphic is nice and good music as usual. Overall is just not for me, not as enjoyable as LS1 and LS: before the storm, LS2 story line is not that memorable too. 
Not much memories and feel for LS2 characters, LS1 characters and story line really leave a very deep impression in my mind till now. Hope there a neutral rating, not sure whether to recommend this game."
3177,"really, reallyyyy boring. coming from someone who absolutely adored life is strange. I didn't bother finishing it."
3178,such a good story as always :))))
3179,aaaaaaaa
3180,"It's really hard to be a teenage dad

--
Well developed story, an excellent and varied cast of interesting and realistic personalities. Difficult choices. A lot of really pretty visuals and calming ambient music. A very different vibe from Life is Strange 1, in a fresh welcome way. Protagonist is relatable, and likable."
3181,"Good game! story is good
 [spoiler] daniel is annoying [spoiler]"
3182,best game ever
3183,"Yeah, it's good.
Not as good as first game tho."
3184,"What a huge disappointment! What is even the point of making your own choices when the game decides for you anyway? What's the point of trying protecting your brother when he never listens and does whatever the f**k he wants? I'm in episode 2 and already bored and angry. If they can't create an equal or better game as the first LiS, then don't do it all. The fact that i have to finish the game cause i bought it, is so painful."
3185,Life is Pain 2
3186,10/10 will fuck you up.
3187,"daniel is very sexy and i love every frame that he is in. I have actually screenshotted every single possible frame of Daniel in this game. My only complaint is that Daniel is not the protagonist. Coming back to this I still have a very major admiration towards.. no wait. OBSESSION. with daniel, as he is the very reason I am still walking this putrid earth."
3188,This is the game for you if you're into story based games and wanna shed some tears. Amazing story
3189,"good game, sad story"
3190,"é dahora, vale a pena.. mas ô criança insuportável véi.. 
Requisitos: Paciência."
3191,"I disliked some stupid things about it, such as if you forgot to close the grandparents room door in the second episode and while you're in the Karen's room you wanna go back and close it you can't! Also in the first episode before a serious talk with Daniel he's just avoiding it by going to a vending machine. That is super dumb.

I still like the atmosphere :) Graphics are great in this game, snow traces look amazing and music is pleasant, but I liked it in LIS 1 more."
3192,"Best story game, like the other life is strange games, worth playing it!"
3193,"Life Is Strange 2 is a direct sequel to the Life is Strange series,featuring a new story of two Hispanic brothers travelling across the USA.
Life Is Strange 2 is a graphic adventure game played from a third-person view. The player takes control of a teenager named Sean Diaz.
Sean can interact with the environment, obtain objects, and talk with non-player characters via dialogue trees.
Choices made in Life Is Strange 2 lead to different branches in the storyline and affect the behaviour of his brother Daniel and other characters.
 In addition, some decisions that were made in the free demo The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit carry over into Life Is Strange 2.
There are some collectibles in the game, some of them are easy to miss but after completing a certain episode there is an option from the main menu to play collectible mode and select a certain chapter.So in general they are easy to get.
Gameplay: 9/10 - like a normal telltale game
Story: 9/10 Great story that will keep you hooked till the end (there are some easter eggs and dialog for the first life is strange game)
Graphics: 9/10 
Sound: 9/10 
Overall: 9/10 
Great story based game with some emotional parts in it. Definitely worth checking out.

3194,"It was the first tell tale game that I play. It is awesome, I really enjoyed it
The flow of the story is always the same, what you change are the interactions with the other characters and your relationship with your brother that will define the ending"
3195,"A worthy successor to Life is Strange. A captivating and memorable story.
10/10 recommended"
3196,Los Hermanos Lobo
3197,"I almost cried, I laughed and stressed with Sean and Daniel.
Truly - Beautiful game that felt like a real adventure among Diaz Brothers..
Thank you Dontnod"
3198,loved it
3199,it gud
3200,I've completed this game. And lord it's filled to the brim with SJW talking points! Every cliche you can think of around illegal immigration is in this game. The politics ruined the game for me to the point where I thought of requesting a refund
3201,"Was an utter pain to force myself through this, Although I know choices don't *really* matter much in most games like this, LIS2 felt like it had 0 care on my input and just took the story where it needed to go for reason, I never bonded with any of the characters and just wanted it to end.

Certain characters just fall into sterotypes that I cannot and will not ever be able to stand, the ""power"" this time was alot less interesting and I feel this game was just made to try and ride the high of LIS 1.

I never felt the characters appreciated what the story was making my person do and put up with, which made the whole thing a chore, what's the point when everything is just made to feel like a time waste until the big ol' choice at the end?

I have not & will not ever replay this, I hope one day I can play a DONTNOD game and get the same emotions and attachment as I did with LIS 1, but as it stands based of this and Before the Storm, I'll likely never get that."
3202,"This recommendation is barely a recommendation... 

If you take this game on its own, its quite decent. A solid adventure, albeit with the most annoying 10 year old on the planet. It feels like there was certain concepts that were introduced but elaboration was missed (e.g the money system or some items in Daniel's inventory were never used ever...) and it felt slightly political at times but that's okay; it's a good game. The biggest problem is as follows:

Its got 'Life Is Strange' in the title.

If you never played LIS 1, go ahead and buy this game. You will probably enjoy it. 

Dontnod should of realised this and should of either made a true sequel following characters from LIS 1 or forget LIS 1 in its entirety and make something new. They did neither, and they referenced LIS 1 throughout this game. By doing this, you force the player to make comparisons to the original... and the original is leagues better.

[spoiler]
So, here is some For's for Life Is Strange 2:
7 endings instead of a binary choice
The world felt more explorable than 1
There's a bunch of nice little touches scattered around e.g backpack accessories
Daniel's actions were based on a sliding scale of the effects of previous actions, instead of just based off of one choice.

But compared against LIS 1, some examples include:
As max, you actually control your powers instead of manipulate a 10 year old to do stuff
Localised time travel is a much more interesting power than telekinesis and opens the game more up
The characters feel more fleshed out in 1 (even though most are stereotypes)
1 doesn't skip massive spaces of time. All of 1 is in a week, instead of 2 being over a year.
[/spoiler]

TL;DR This game isn't LIS 1. But its not too bad either. 


"
3203,"this game is the best I've played, it's emotional and I love it"
3204,A step up from the previous life is strange games which i struggled to play through. This is closer to the fantastic Tell Me Why and Twin Mirror than the first Life is Strange and before the storm and it's all the better for it
3205,Great game to help the time go by.
3206,"This game has all the negatives of the original Life is Strange and none of its qualities. The story is unoriginal and its meaning forced. The characters are one-dimensional, annoying and badly written and there's no mystery to uncover, it's just boring. PLUS the game crashed three times and gave me the ""fatal error"" message -besides the countless bugs like character models teleporting, missing shadows- on episode 4.

Honestly, after that and counting the fact that I didn't had the greatest of times I just watched the rest on Youtube and saved another six hours of my time. Whatever, I 'm not gonna replay it.

3209,"If you need to scratch that Life is Strange itch, pick up this game. Now this game isn't as good as the first one in my opinion, but the brotherly bond is cool. I wouldn't mind a 3rd, but in reality, I don't know how that would turn out."
3210,"This game has a special place in my heart. I really don't get why it gets so much hate, it's brilliant."
3211,"Where do I begin with Life is Strange 2? The game designers and production team(s) know exactly how to keep someone invested in their characters with all the twists and turns. Although I'd say that the first Life is Strange is still the best one made, this new story, with its implementation of themes of current affairs and growing up in the USA will ultimately take you on an emotional roller coaster. Prepare yourself."

3217,Very different from the first life is strange game! Different story same concept except now its two brothers who must escape from the law because nobody would believe their story. Still a great game however and keeps you on the edge of your seat through every episode. 10/10 definitely would recommend to story driven players who enjoy choice based games.

3226,Deep and well written
3227,"Having enjoyed the first two games in the franchise I found this a massive disappointment. The characters were stereotypes, the story depressing and the gameplay largely non-existent. Also there were whole chapters of nothing but cut scenes of the boys travels which were frankly rather tedious.

Sadly I can’t recommend this one."
3228,sure
3229,"I'm sorry, but what exactly do people like about this? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm glad the current top reviewer managed to turn his entire life around after playing Life is Strange 2 of all games, but this is clumsy in just about every way imaginable. If you dragged a kicking and screaming 1960s-era progressive into a time machine, gave them a five minute crash course on contemporary social issues and then held them at gunpoint until they produced a fictional narrative around what they'd just heard, the end result would probably be on a similar level to this. The highest compliment I can give to the two middle-aged Frenchmen who wrote this is that they at least had the balls to do something new, but boy did it not pay off.

I liked the first game. It's certainly a deeply flawed experience, both with regards to gameplay and story, but it was something new, carried by a memorable and very theme-appropriate soundtrack, a pretty great setting, the voice actress of Chloe Price, and, in my personal case, a pretty high tolerance for cringe. At the end of the day, yes, it's schlock, basically a lesbian fanfic to an intellectual property that doesn't exist, but I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I still thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. The problem is that the writers at Dontnod themselves apparently didn't really get why people liked it – spoiler alert, it ain't heavy-handed wokeness pandering.

Fortunately, I myself also don't live in the car crash video come-to-life that is the United States, and I wouldn't claim to have a firm enough grasp on their issues to come up with something relevant to the conversation, but you don't have to be a sociologist to realize just how inept this aimlessly meandering, trope-laden and ultimately meaningless story is. It's completely transparent in its bumbling attempts at emotional manipulation, and it has all our favorite characters in it, too – the playable ""dude weed lol"" teenage protagonist, the incredibly annoying little brother (how could we have ever lived without him), comforting black man in a nurse costume brought to you by the face animators from Mass Effect Andromeda, rednecks who check their property for random cars at three in the morning and make its occupant sing the ""I'm a little piggy"" song from South Park or whatever, a laughably miscast evangelical cult leader, a blogging Seth Rogen facsimile that's definitely supposed to be some kind of self-insert, and so on and so forth. Honestly, I don't think I liked anyone except for the shitty selfish mom and maybe the grandparents. Where the first game was a unique kind of beautiful disaster, this is just an embarrassing hot mess.

Also, speaking of bad animation, I think you can really tell that they'd already realized after Episode 2 that this was going to be a financial failure and just sort of gave up. How else could you explain the endless tedium of Episode 3 (anyone in the mood for character development on all these people we'll never see again?), the pathetic Episode 4 (they even gave him a fucking bowl cut), and the endless first half of Episode 5, featuring the two most outlandishly cliché'd gay side characters you'll ever see. Seriously, I don't even have a Twitter where I'm accusing people of not liking Star Trek: Picard only because it has a minority or so in it, but that shit is just genuinely fucking offensive.

Ultimately, I could go on like this for a while, but I think I've wasted enough of my time. Looking forward to the inevitable return of Max and Chloe in Life is Strange 3 (published episodically from June 2022 to September 2025), after Dontnod's accountants threaten to go on a strike. Cheers."
3230,depressing
3231,Even better than the first one.
3232,i love this game so much
3233,Good Game
3234,"I tried but couldn't even finish it (finished episode 4). I like the first episode, the 2nd was okay, the 3rd wasn't fun and the 4th really pissed me off, the mc is a pathetic s* and if there was an option I would kill the brother myself, I don't think that I could hate a character that much."
3235,great
3236,yes
3237,Good Game
3238,"Not too much to tell. I liked this game. My favorite LiS game so far. Unlike the first game where the story revolved around teen girls and their friendship, LiS 2 is about two brothers who are trying to survive on their own. It's about family. About your responsibility as an older family member to take care of your younger sibling. 
This game showed how ridiculously stupid and ignorant beliefs can affect people of different views. In this case - discrimination against other nationalities and ethic groups. I mean let's not generalize but discrimination exist everywhere to some extent and i think that LiS 2 portrayed discrimination in U.S. well. I'm a guy from ""ethic minority"" group myself, in my country, and despite the fact that i was born and raised here just like my parents, i heard and seen a lot of crap over the years. I also know too many stories where people didn't get promotions because of ethnicity. What else to expect from small eastern European country? Just like in LiS 2 there are good people and bad people. Some people criticized this game for negative portrayal of white Americans/people. I'm not a fan of this modern ""SJW"" thing but what is worse than SJW is anti-SJW. They themselves are too sensitive and made the term look like something negative these days. Ignoramus cavemen and cavewomen. As some say it - ""First world problems""."
3239,"such a shit plot
daniel is a kid, not a retard"
3240,"Life is Strange 2 weaves a deep and complex narrative that is incredible. The character design and the movement is smooth, and the game manages to keep a fantastic plot without confusing actions which confuse the player. The game could benefit from fewer cutscenes and between each episode the story will jump forward. Rather then taking place right at the end of the past episode, each one jumps forward 1-3 months. While the previous event are recorded in the protanonigst journal, it's an annoying cut in the game's narrative that oculd have been entirely avoided. Ultimately, Life is Strange 2 keeps most of the charm that made the first game great with a new, in-universe plot."
3241,"I will say this series from Life is Strange One, to the second aftermath part of Chloe that extended after, and now Life is Strange Two are definitely unique and well done, including music, story lines and emotional characters and content. But, if you understand about socialism and ""new age"" agendas, you will see remnants of antisocial/anarchy/LGBT elements/witchcraft, including the deceptive attack on traditional. family, normality, country security, including at the southern border. 

This series was obviously written to try and get people to feel sorry for illegal immigrants and those who choose alternative styles of dangerous living and expressions, and that somehow ""white people/rednecks"" and those who want a safe and secure country are somehow all criminals and racist. Also, add to that they think somehow cops and law and order are bad. This is where I have to give a negative review.  This is embracing censorship, and also embracing perversion in other ways as normality, which it is anything but. This is not what America or life was ever meant to be.

As a moral absolute and Christian believer, the tricks that are often used to play on our emotions have been well exercised and reviewed here, including coarse language, intricate music, smoking, sex/LGBT, and fake ""equality/diversity/inclusiveness"" socialist/communist deception and nonsense. 

All of this is at the heart of the public education system, including universities and colleges, the democrat party, and corrupt shadow administrative state unelected bureaucrats. I have many friends who are asian, mexican/latina/colombian, etc, but they all know and understand the above tactics and division from the far reaching corruption of evil that is being pushed in many ways will kill America..it already has in many ways. 

Do not be foolish. This is not a theory. The evidence is overwhelming. It is shocking how more do not see the obvious. There are symbols and messages throughout this game series that shows all of this absolutely."
3242,i got way too emotionally attached to this game pls <33
3243,"The first one was way better than this one. 
This was just pure sjw stuff"
3244,This game is incredible. Left me with a woah feel. Great game.
3245,"Meaning less choices, too pushy with politics, side characters are not developed - why kill the dog?"
3246,Just play it and cry for yourself.
3247,"Life is strange 2 is one of those games that makes you fall in love with its story and its characters. It is an amazing sequel to the original game of the franchise and, although it has different protagonists and a different story, the game keeps all the elements of the previous game that made it an unforgettable experience. 

This time the story follow the Diaz brothers, who must go on a journey across the USA. As you follow them throughout their travels, you get to meet a lot of amazing characters and you get to experience more of the LIS universe. This is great because the game is filled with easter eggs and references to the previous games. 

Also, I really liked the choice mechanic implemented in this game. Everytime I made a choice, I felt like it mattered. As the game progresses I felt like the interactions between the brothers changed because of my decisions. It still isn't completely perfect, as there are some choices that lead to the same outcome, but I feel like this is a huge improvement in comparison to the choice system of previous games and it's a step in the right direction for this videogame genre.

Overall, LIS 2 is an amazing game. And I recommend it to everyone that liked LIS 1, or to anyone that likes videogames with a great story and interesting characters. I am hopeful to see new Life is strange projects in the future."
3248,"Extremely talented visual art style, smooth game play. 10000/10 recommend"
3249,Also yes
3250,"Life is Strange 2: Good game, But NOT so Great Sequel."
3251,A truly mesmerizing story that manages  surpass the compelling story of the original!
3252,"This was a reasonable game, but you need to have a high tolerance for angst to get through it.  My angstometer is not what it was, so I had to take several long breaks before finally making it through to the end, and it kind of felt like a slog.  But overall, I enjoyed the characters, and I felt it did a good job of making me feel the plight of the protagonist, being pulled in one way by the need to be a good older brother, and in another way by having your own crap to deal with, while trying to grow up."
3253,"First of all, this game is one of the heartbreaking in my 2021.

Same as the first LiS, this game is so impactful for those who played it. I'm gonna be frank about this game, i love the main protagonist of this game, Sean, he's care for his brother while the brother can sometime be a jerk. Also, every choice that you make in the game is have a consequences in certain future. For me, this game is a worth to play when you just want to know the story of the two brothers, but i can also tell you that this game is a biased in some circumstances. And some ending it kinda felt like, ""just like that?"" 

In the end, i highly recommend you guys to play this game, just focus on the story and  put the things away about politics because like i said earlier this game is pretty biased but if you throw that away in your mind and give the story a chance, i'm sure that maybe you will like it.

PS, i hope that Square Enix or DONTNOT make some dlc or spin off about this game, because i felt like the ending is not makes satisfied and i hope that you will continue Sean story after he's out of jail."
3254,"Great game. lots of references to the first game and before the storm but you can play this even if you havent played the others since its a all new story with all new characters. I wish max, chloe and rachel was in the game but this is still great and the characters are likeable and you will love them and care for them. although it is a life is strange game so be ready to cry"
3255,This is another great addition to the franchise.
3256,I really enjoy playing this game. I love it.
3257,lost at dice 2/10
3258,"If you like these types of games and have played the other life is strange games i think you should play this one aswell. Although, its a bit longer which in this case is kinda bad imo, its makes for a slow progression in story and makes atleast me as a player slowly lose intrest in whats going on. The previous life is strange games I have play in a week max, but this one took months because it just doesnt capture the player in the same way and doesnt keep you on the edge of your seat like the other games do.. But in general, its still a life i strange with the iconic graphics, beautiful storyline (although slow), good gameplay and decent endings (Also, ending feelt a bit abrupt...). So good game, wouldnt play it again but worth playing atleast once! :)"
3259,Love this game so much!! Hours of fun!!
3260,Good

3264,"If you like story/movie type build your own adventure games, this one is amazing. I ugly cried at the end."
3265,pog
3266,its pog
3267,it's not as good as the first one but in terms of story games it's really high up there
3268,"This game is a fucking masterpiece.

I didn't play it immediately because I didn't think I'd be as hooked as for the first season, that it wouldn't be the same thing. It just couldn't be as good. Well yeah, it was indeed different, but it could in fact be just as good. Maybe even better. It's absolutely phenomenal. Note that I played the whole 5 episodes in a row.

I'll try to keep this spoiler free.

The story is insanely interesting, the more you go in, the more invested you are. The development is fantastic, no down time, no boring part, and nothing ever repeats itself. Each little detail is so freaking immersive, everything conveys so much emotions, from joy to sadness. Such an attention to the details. Maybe if I took different choices at times I wouldn't have felt that way, I don't know. But I loved my run, I'm at least sure of that. I can't get over how awesome it was.

A great story wouldn't be possible without a great set of characters. Everyone you meet has so much impact. Each has their own personality, charisma. It is such a colourful set of people that you encounter, it made the story and the universe so alive. You actually want to talk to everybody, to stay at range to hear what they're discussing about when they're not talking directly to you. Because you're actually interested, not just because you don't want to be missing out something from your game.

About the decision making parts, what I especially liked here is that minor decisions seem to also have their weight on how the story will pan out, on top of the major ones. It makes it harder to have zero consistency and always try to aim for the ""good choice"". Also, about the good choice: is there really one ? I always tried to act like I'm doing the right thing, and in fact, sometimes, it turns out awful. Some people seem to dislike that. I absolutely loved it. In the real life, it works this way as well. Having your choices not only impact what happens directly but also the education of your brother is brilliant. The game is not kidding when it warns you do think about your actions beforehand. And it's kinda more impactful when you can't immediately rewind to choose another option when you think about it...

Gameplay was very fine, good controls, nothing special to say about this since it isn't really the main thing one should focus on for this game. But yeah, the fact that I actually wanted to inspect every single interactible was a pleasant surprise.

Just like the first episode, great music choices overall. I knew some songs beforehand this time... I guess it wasn't by chance that Spotify made me discover them... Great ambiance sounds as well.

I'm honestly surprised this game isn't 95%+ positive. Reading the negative reviews, I see two things coming out quite often.

The first one is the fact that you don't control Daniel. I found that it was on the contrary a really good choice from Dontnod. It contributes to the fact that you can't make the major decisions with a 180° turn on how you approach them every single time. You have to play the game differently, because you are not in the driver seat. I found it quite original, and I don't think it was awkward or anything like I've read, it was really well done and I enjoyed it a lot. 

The second one is that ""there is too much politics in it"". I can't help but believe that the game is just so much on point for everything it depicts that some people recognized themselves and took offense on it. This game isn't pushing an agenda or whatever, it's just guilty of being perfectly accurate on the shitty people of the world. I would understand the critic if these depictions were completely exagerated, either in their number or the intensity of it, which would detract the player from the actual story, but that is definitively not the case here.

So yeah, I 100% recommend this game to anyone seeking an excellent story-driven game. 

That's it. That's my review of Life is Fucking Unfair.

And please Steam friends, play it, I couldn't compare my choices to anybody contrarely to LiS 1 :("
3269,"I took the episode 1 for free but after I finished it, I'm looking forward to buy other episodes! Very interesting game and soooo good story."
3270,"So unfortunately I have to write my first negative review ever. 

First of all, music & graphics are great as usual, gameplay feels even better than in LS1. 

But then. 

I think the main problem is that you aren't controlling the main character. It's just very annoying that you can make choices whatever you want, you have that second person who just won't necessarily act the way you planned it. This is what makes you feel like your choices just don't matter at all. Which is very frustrating given that choices are basically the game.

Then there are a lot of hot topics displayed in this game. Which I think is good, but it is also a lot to suffer. In fact, there is so much stuff that it probably could have filled three games. So you basically really get a glimpse of what it feels like to be an immigrant or an immigrants child in a conservative society. But there is no perspective, no idea how to make it better. The whole game you just have that feeling of desperation.

To be honest I expected something like LS1. Probably my fault, but to be fair, it's called ""Life is Strange 2"", not ""Life is a hot f♥ing mess if you're an immigrants child - and other stories of discrimination"".

Last but not least there are some very strange plot choices. (Spoilers ahead)
Killing a puppy, no way out? Is there nothing sacred anymore? 
Then forcing the player into that damn Christmas market, no choice? Even if you've been all secrecy the whole way, repeating it to Daniel all over? 
And don't even get me started on the robbery of that farm...
Forming a team with Daniel and making choices in his favor, just to get thrown out by him in that church? 
Just ONE ending in which they can spend their whole life together, even if you made it your aim to make a decent human being of Daniel? 

And those are just the ones I still remember. 

I'm sorry, but that is just no thumbs up."
3271,"Great concept, enjoyed it!!"
3272,Great game
3273,"Absolutely amazing game, same as the first series. No words."
3274,"so i want to start my review by saying that i ONLY recommend this game to people who feel that they can handle the subject matter. there is a lot of triggering stuff in this game, even more so than the first game. i do encourage folks to look up at least TWs for this game or scroll through both positive and negative to get an idea of what this game is about. otherwise, i don't rec this game, especially if you have experienced hate crimes or encounters with the SPD.

SPOILERS BELOW BE WARNED

i also want to say that i think these things CAN be talked about and portrayed in video games and other media. i just think dontnod should have included a trigger warning or rating system akin to what movies have at the START of the game so that people idk have a little bit more warning to the really messed up stuff that happens. like i thought the first game was fucked but boy oh boy. 

i do have to say that one of the largest turn offs of this game is that almost the whole first episode is just your main character being hate-crimed by white people. this is a theme that carries heavily throughout the series but is super prevelent in the first episode and the start of the fourth episode. i also SUPER dislike how much older finn and cassidy are compared to sean. i thought that they were like 18 or 19 when first playing (and WA has romeo+juliet laws so that was like /shrug/ makes sense why sean doesn't care) but there seems to be a general consenus from fans that they are much older than that. i do not like that cassidy guilt trips you hella hard if you don't want to sleep with her. it doesn't take up a huge portion of the game, but it's so poorly done that it almost outshines everything else. idk who at dontnod is writing their queer characters/storylines but they maybe need to stop. 

there ARE some good things about this game tho. i do appreciate how much more complicated it is to get a ""good"" ending compared to the first one. i do appreciate having a main character witness a ""chosen character"" type story line instead of playing through daniel. the dialouge overall is MUCH better than the first game, however i still found it very cringey at times. i DID appreciate that sean is a furry in the game - signs are all over the place and it's a nice small detail that they didn't have to add to the game but did. 

CHAP 4 could and SHOULD have been much more fleshed out, but alas it wasn't. i think if the game had leaned into that plot throughout the whole game instead of just that one chapter it would have been a lot more interesting. sean has much more relatable dialouge and reacts in a much more realistic way compared to the first game. but don't be too sure of yourself - just like the first, sometimes your answers aren't exactly the tone that you think they'll be. 

anyway, i think if someone is of sound mental health / a sound state of mind and can be critical of cassidy and finn, this will be somewhat of an enjoyable play. ""enjoyable"" doesn't feel like that right word because these games are literally trauma machines, but i certainly do feel i gained something out of being able to play as a 16 year old hispanic kid looking out for his little brother in the midst of a lot of traumatic stuff. and with that i leave yall with one piece of advice - 

this game will try very hard to make you not be a good big brother. trust yourself and you can be."
3275,"I read some negative reviews and have been afraid that this game is nowhere near as great as previous one, but nevertheless I decided to give it a go, and wow, it’s actually very good, and it even managed to surpass my expectations at certain points.

Now, in the core of Life Is Strange 2 there is a relationship between two brothers, which makes it as different from the Max/Chloe situation as possible, but it works very well in its own way. There is love and hate, harmony and conflict. The game encourages the player to be a good older brother, but at the same time it doesn’t make it an easy task, which is probably why some people are hating Daniel. Depending on the circumstances, you`ll pretty much want to both kill and protect him at all costs.

The events of the first game were happening in a little town, whereas this one is about a big and long journey, it`s almost like a road movie. There are plenty of interesting characters and beautiful locations that combined with visual style and story make the whole experience feel real, meaningful and emotional. I really enjoyed this opportunity to travel through the US and see all these places and people, it felt nice and unique.

If you played the first Life is Strange, you’d probably be pleased to find some familiar things here and there (Hawt Dawg Man included). And you should definitely play The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit before starting this one, because there are some cool connections, too.

I’d recommend Life Is Strange 2 to anyone interested in good narrative-driven games, and if you by any chance a DONTNOD fan like me, then what are you waiting for? Do not listen to any haters and try it, the first episode is free anyway, so it’s not like you’re losing anything."
3276,"Just ""brO moMenTo*""... I was saying like ""Why the F all those SJW* momENtOs happening? Why the F we can't change things way more different than the game allows to do us? Why the F we [spoiler]forced to get along and team up with Karen?[/spoiler] "" all along. The thing is [spoiler]After watching all endings[/spoiler] I thought it deserves more like than that. [u]Because this game made me think about everything(REALLY, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE)again.[/u] Like the motives that keep you alive, consequences that you face after you've done somethings before, etc... The point is, it reminds who you are and what you want. That's why I really do love the Life is Strange series."
3277,"Amazing series, I fell in love with the first one and the second one is just as amazing <3"
3278,u have to babysit an ungrateful lil sh1t of a brother
3279,"I Only Say One thing, Daniel is a dumb Duck .
What a shame i had High Hopes for the Game After Lis 1 ."
3280,"Amazing game, love the Díaz brothers. The story is amazing, I really recommend this video-game because the story and what it represent. You would find amazing characters and there's also great easter eggs ."
3281,"Didn't want to play this at first because it didn't involve the characters I fell in love with in the first two games... BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! This game is just as compelling & fresh as the first two were due to its amazing characters, music, & visuals. By the end of the season I was sobbing because of how far these two have come as characters & as brothers. Such a powerful story. The first two games will always be my favorite because of nostalgia but this game is right up there with them in terms of quality. Now excuse me while I go cry in my bed all night listening to the soundtrack."
3282,It is a great game. A little old with the graphics. But besides for that its a great game.
3283,dada go bye bye
3284,Game is just all around awesome. no other words.
3285,solid 8/10 game not the same as the first game
3286,"Before everyone gets me wrong, this game is absolutely gorgeous and the music is stunning. Just like the first one.

BUT:

The Cutscenes drag on forever.
You get to babysit and annoying brat the whole time.
It is more of a point and click adventure then anything else.
You are doing chores the whole time...
They didnt buckle up!!!!

And did i mention... you have to babysit a little shithead the whole time?

Why did i finish the game then? Because i am a whore for achievements..."
3287,"Fire

<spoiler> kinda bunk u cant plead the fifth to the cops, blizzard please fix"
3288,this game makes you feel every emotion 10/10 would play over and over again.
3289,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!

This game is so fucking good, sometimes can be boring but it has a good final if u choose the happy final, I choose the final that he kills the police and I think that's the best, I really can't decide between Life is strange 1 or 2, but it's worth the price trust me"
3290,"AMO AS HISTÓRIAS DESSE JOGO. A AMBIENTAÇÃO E TRILHA SONORA SÃO INCRÍVEIS. A DIREÇÃO DE ARTE E ROTEIRO SÃO LINDOS!! Se você quer se aventurar e influênciar uma história esse é seu jogo, recomendo jogar o primeiro antes."
3291,Awesome game ! It's worth the money !
3292,Great game.
3293,"I'm kinda salty that I didn't get to go to that party...

Overall, very good story, got the ending where the boys went down to Puerto Lobos and cracked up cold ones together.

Also loved how Max and Chloe was mentioned from the first game by David."
3294,"It's a lot different than the original and that's okay.

The fact that you're on the road helps to freshen up the environment and create new possibilities but it is harder to connect with characters."
3295,Holds up even tho liked the first one more.
3296,"Jesus man. I mean seriously, this game is AMAZING. The last game that made me feel this way was the Mass Effect trilogy and if that game made me cry than Life is Strange 2 made me have a straight up mental breakdown. I would play this game again, but it wouldn't be the same as the first time."
3297,"I don't hate the game but LIS 1 is way better.
David's super annoying and they killed a puppy."
3298,BEST STORYLINES AND DRAMA!~
3299,Best story!
3300,"Great game. Quite different than the original first two, but still quite good. More mature than the originals."
3301,Gaem so shit you guys. I tell woman i stay here for a while woman says no and i hit woman WHAT? where is my choice where is muh branching storytelling bro. texas is in california too ???!?!!!!?111!
3302,oobleck
3303,Great game. Hope they tie Life is Strange 1 and 2 together in the next game.
3304,love this game since the first one
3305,"If you came here and expect this game going to be like Life Is Strange 1, maybe you're gonna be upset.
Cause this game is a total different. The conflict, how it ends, the character, and else. 

At the beginning I feel frustated about the storyline, it feels so wrong. But in the end, this game just telling the truth, this is reality, life can be sucks no matter how hard you try not to be. 

I bought this on a CNY discount, I feel the money I spent for this game is totally worth it. So I strongly suggest you guys to buy this game on a discount."
3306,"At the end of this game, the only characters that I cared about were Max and Chloe. Also, time travel is a way more interesting gimmick than telekinesis."
3307,"To put it short, I only wanted to finish the game but it really isn't worthy of a positive review.
You have 0 powers and coming from LIS 1 like wheres the power??? I didnt ask for a non paying babysitter job. I feel like the developers could have done way more than they should considering they have potentional. My advise is to avoid this game if your trying to play LIS 1 or something similar, at least with that game you could control time and there was more of an impact in your choices. Also 2-4 hours to complete an episode come on thats just bullshit along with cant skip scenes??? like what if  your replaying the game and have to go through all those cutscenes again?? Aides if you ask me"
3308,Le epic
3309,fu ck u daniel omfg ur so fkn annoying
3310,"The game should really considering the name life is BABYSISTTING, which is all about HOW you babysitting your selfish annoying spoiled little brother. Whatever you do is about your little brother, and Daniel is so annoying.
The majority of our choices just not make any difference. And all those political references. Oh gosh,  give me a break.
Its supposed to be a great movie which shot by yourself, but now its just boring, and filled with disappointment. And the gameplay is just pure blandness. The characters  keep changing that we moved on before we get attached with them, like the beginning of the game,the dad character is kinda cool, but we move on so fast before we really get to know him just like some of the other characters.  
PS.if you like the other 2 LIS, don’t buy it, the game sucks. it just not as good as the other 2 LIS"
3311,Very good game the choices you make matter and it's very emotional at times too! This game has made a huge impact on my life and It's the best game I've ever played the music is beautiful and the graphics are so good! Now if you don't like choice based games like Life Is Strange games then I might not recommend it but if you have ever played a Life Is Strange game or a Walking Dead game or any choice based game and you liked it then i recommend this 100% worth your time!
3312,"I just love the Life is Strange series. It is such a good game, it has a little bit of everything"
3313,This game is a masterpiece! Go play it!!!
3314,Who Can buy episode 2 to me plz. I wanna play that more.T-T
3315,"This the third best game in this series including CS. I it goes LIS, CS, LS2, then BtS"
3316,Amazing as the the first one
3317,"some acting is cringe, but overall not bad."
3318,GOOD game WITH NICE ANIMATION
3319,"I like how the brothers get alone. It is a bitter-sweet game with a reflection on the real world of how we need to rely on our choices, may them come from our gut or our reasons."
3320,"Daniel is annoying af, so annoying that it made me not want to play further than episode 1."
3321,its cool
3322,"I LOVE this game.  It's very chill, but it also held my attention throughout, and it's super emotionally moving.  I cried really hard when I got to the end.  I also think the decision/consequence structure is more nuanced and involved than the first Life is Strange, so to me Life is Strange 2 improves upon its predecessor. 

"
3323,"Although there are things that need to be improved in this game, overall I thoroughly enjoyed it
"
3324,"The story is amazing, i had never wanted to feel more over for a characters in games. 100% a beautiful masterpeace. i just wish you guys would create LIS3 one day ;D
"
3325,love it
3326,I only played the first episode but pretty good so far. Seems to be that you have to focus if you want curtain out comes.
3327,"The game mechanics that make Life Is Strange so good are absent in this sequel, however, Life Is Strange 2 has a much better story due to the contemporary issues, situations and life experiences it presents.  The added variety of possible endings is also an improvement in comparison of the two games.  Overall, I think the first in the series is a bit better than the second because of the time-manipulating mechanics in the former, but I like both of them for different reasons."
3328,best game ever!
3329,"To those that played and loved the original Life is Strange: No, it's no where near as good as LiS1. Yes, it's probably better than Before the Storm! (Which I couldn't finish as much as I loved Chloe, it was just missing something...or missing a lot). 

One of the best things I can say about it is that it corrected the main flaw of the original LiS because it has more than two endings (it has 4, with a few variations on a few parts of the ending scene) that differs not only on the final choice but also on the many small choices you make throughout the game. 

Though it fixes the issue with LIS1's ending, it lacks most of the things that made the original great (you just can't beat time travel in a choice based game, without it, it just doesn't have the same dynamic). Play it if you really like a story based, choice based game and want to feel things and be engaged in the story, but won't be too bothered by plot holes or a meandering plot. Sometimes larger choices don't matter much and the options seem too limited, but other times small choices like dialogue options add up in surprising ways, and there's also a really interesting dynamic of Daniel making his own choices, influenced by Sean. But really, I play to have a story I can be involved in, and that's what it does successfully. And all in all, I found myself wondering what would happen next, caring about the characters, and wanting to make choices to protect them, and for that reason I recommend the game and say it's worth playing. 

******BEYOND THIS POINT THERE BE SPOILERS:*******

I wasn't super happy with the Redemption ending, and I didn't much like that there was no variation in ending where Sean told the truth about Daniel's power, especially when that was such a plot point (and sometimes a kind of annoying one). At many points in the game you decide to keep it a secret or not, and see both the problems with revealing it (Haven Point) as well as times when there is no issues doing so (Away and the grandparents). 

Also, from looking at the statistics of choices, it seems for many choices most people choose the same thing, and there's a few variations in which less than 10% of people get that storyline. I did like the addition of David Madsen in the last episode with the save the bay ending- at the time I was blown away with the nod to the butterfly effect of the original. But knowing that he would be there regardless of the LiS1 ending isn't quite as great, I kinda wish there was a difference other than dialogue, such as a different character or something that doesn't change the outcome for this game but at least shows the impact of choices, and anyway it doesn't make as much sense for him to be there if he wasn't grief-stricken by losing Chloe. 
"
3330,"i personally did not enjoy this game as much as the other 2 life is strange. characters didn't feel relate-able, game tried to take on alot of current issues but didnt represent them well. didnt enjoy the song choices as much as the other 2 games, but that is purely down to my music taste. didnt click with Daniel and the whole game is based around him."
3331,"Not as good as OG LIS, but a beautiful story in it's own way. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish you could take all of their problems away. Though it's just a game, every choice will haunt you."
3332,"Life is babysitting your selfish little bratty annoying little brother.

Before i get into the review, I must say i had expected this game to be as good as life is strange, and i was pretty disappointed.
Tragic story of two brothers and yet it felt like stupid for some reason.
It didn't feel like much of a gameplay and Daniel was certainly annoying and selfish causing trouble in most episodes to his brother and others.
Great visuals and musics that won't disappoint.

Overall It was a disappointment for me just because i wanted it to be as good as LIS 1
Don't hold it against me for not recommending it. Comments disabled for trollers and haters on this review."
3333,Amazing
3334,"The Life is Strange series isn't a game; it's an experience. You get to live vicariously through the lives of these characters. This series is absolutely amazing and I'm glad to have experienced something like this in my life, because I know there won't be another series like this ever again."
3335,Its like they merged Life is Strange with Stranger Things; Life is Stranger(?)
3336,Popiči
3337,"I can't decide if I like this game or the first one more. It is genuinely a well thought out and engaging game. The story is brilliant and I love how the choices you do make really do impact Daniel and what he tries to do as the game progresses, e.g. you can make him immoral as fuck if you start misusing his power or not intervening when he is going to misuse it, which leads to the two ""immoral"" endings - [spoiler] the worst ending where you try to surrender and Daniel loses his shit, or the better ending where you break through the border and live free in Mexico together [/spoiler]. I never achieved the ""moral"" ending in both of my playthroughs xD

I like how loose ends are tied up well in this game e.g. [spoiler] you can call your friend Lyla after you escape Seattle to see how she is doing (note: not well until you call her the second time where she seems to be doing somewhat better, although I think this is conditional on you calling her the first time). [/spoiler]

I do love Episode 5 though. It is my favourite episode - [spoiler] especially the start where you are trekking and camping out at the top of a beautiful canyon in Arizona. It just gave me such nostalgia for my own trips throughout the US south west.[/spoiler] In fact this whole game has such awesome locations, it's like taking a roadtrip through the west coast of the USA.

The story is so emotionally engaging when I got ""that bad ending"" it really made me go ""oh fuckkkkk"" and feel sad for the characters as if they were real xD 

I can't recommend this game enough. It's amongst my favourite games and I will likely do a third (moral) run through in a year or two time (or before LiS 3 comes out, if that ever happens)."
3338,"Probably the best out of all three LiS-games. Emotional rollercoaster ride, even more difficult decisions than in the past. To keep your morale & ethics, or let them slide to make sure everything turns out okay? Damn. Wish there were 5 more episodes of this, I wasn't ready for it to end even after all the hours spent with this!"
3339,The game was about life. I like dramas
3340,"It's good game. But do not compare it with Life is strange 1, or you will be disappointed. That's first thing I'm gonna say about it. And Tl;dr.

Now let's go deeper. What I really really liked was that your decisions really shape the game and more importantly ENDING of the game. Concequences of your decisions are sometimes suprising, but you will always know why this or that happend. I liked the soundtrack, which was very fitting for this game, as well as graphic style, which is typical for all Life is strange games. I like collectibles (and achievements connected to them), even though some of them were really hard to find. I liked new superpower and how you could use it but not entirely control it. And I actually liked that developers were not scared to be political and show some major flaws USA have now (racism, xenofobia, militant religious fundamentalism). 

Now for worse things. Game is too long. Or to be precise - there is a lot of moments where nothing is happening. Third episode is ""all filler no killer"". I think 3 episodes full of story without empty moments would fit this game better. Long parts could be justified if you actually build important relationships with other characters during them. But since every episode is in some new enviroment, your previous relationships with other characters are unimportant. Which is a shame. Only few people are actually rememberable. 

Overall the game is good. BUT it's not as good as legendary Life is strange 1. And it would be unfair to compare these two games, as they only share the name and few other details. It has simillar theme, it is as emotional as previous game, but it isn't LiS 1. This is new story with new characters and new game mechanics. Do not expect another experience like LiS 1. Thats one time in life experience and it's gonna be very hard for somebody to come anywhere near it. Also - before you start this journey, go play Awesome adventures of captain spirit. It's free and it's completition is important for second episode."
3341,"A game that is very beautiful and open minded to a player by its soundtrack, amazing surroundings, characters. Truly an amazing experience with this one. 

Thank you,

DONTNOD"
3342,"It is not like LiS 1, due to the many cinamatic scenes. But it still worth it. It is an excelent game!!!! Sooooooo nostalgyc... Chloe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3343,"This is the best Story I have ever been told in a game...
And the choices you have to make are truly something you cant decide easely"
3344,.
3345,This game is really fun
3346,all
3347,best game ever!
3348,"I highly recommend this game. It's a rare case when the sequel is better than the original. I have received the first episode for free and after finishing it decided to buy the rest and LiS1 just to compare. The story in
LiS2 is deep and have many layers and messages. But it seems to me that the dominant message is
very simple: be loyal to your kin, be strong and never surrender. Hopefully, we will see the main characters again in some future installment of this amazing franchise. 
"
3349,"This will never top the original Life is strange.

Story 4/10: Most scenes aren't memorable or even worth memorable of this LiS. The only memorable b*llshit things i remember are political propaganda racist stuff about the brothers during their journey. There are some connections to the first LiS which are welcome. I would only buy this for this fact alone. This game is a choices matter one and you get different kinds of endings. The various switchings of the brother's realities and the multiple locations you get to pass though from episode to episode are cool.

Graphics 6/10: Better lip sync, that's for sure. And overall far better graphics compared to the first LiS. 

Gameplay 6/10: You just see and interact with people, objects etc. The are the collectibles also. You can get achievements with this one as well.

Sountrack 5/10: A non-memorable, simplistic one. Doesn't even comapre to the first LiS's soundtrack.

Overall 5/10: I didn't like this at all, for the most part. As i mentioned before, the first LiS will always be cannon. I will only reccomend this to hardcore LiS fans and storytelling and 100% achievements type players."
3350,It was definitely better than the 1st Life Is Strange or the Before the storm! Worth playing it!
3351,"Honestly, it's one of the best games i've ever played"
3352,"The story is pretty good. The voice acting is great. The motion capture looks nice, for the most part. Only one bug experienced during game play that forced me to exit as everything had crashed. Game gave me all the feels. I really cared about what happened to the brothers on their journey. I laughed with them, felt angry on their behalf and almost cried with them too! So, why the negative rating?

Whilst some people would have fun going through this again and playing with completely different 'motivations', I just can't see myself ever replaying this. It's just too MUCH. That might seem strange (no pun intended) given everything I just said above. But, after a hard day's work, I'm playing games for fun, for escapism, for interesting game play mechanics... for many reasons. However, I don't play games to go on emotional rollercoasters that leave me needing therapy afterwards. 

I genuinely appreciate the hard work that clearly went into making this game. So, I want to give it a thumbs up button. But, I've got to say, as someone of colour myself, I'm still processing all the many, many terrible things that happened during 2020. Games are my safe space to switch off after a hard day's work. I didn't really have the emotional bandwidth for such heavy-handed political commentary. All those thinly-disguised let's 'Make America Great Again' Trump supporters were more than I wanted to handle during my precious few hours in an evening. 

I get how this could be extremely powerful for people who have never experienced racism, or bigotry. It's all interwoven with an interesting story and puzzles to solve. Perhaps that's on me for buying the game right off the back of finishing the first one and only reading the sequel's reviews? But, I don't think users should have to spend extensive amounts of time researching games for potential Trumpism political views on immigration, police brutality and everyday casual racism. Great game. But, it's all just a bit much and a bit too serious. And, when the dialogue writers have a point to make, it feels like the whole plot screeches to a halt while they deliver it. All subtlety goes out the window. I don't want my money back, or anything, I just really miss the days of subtlety. And, this particular story isn't what I was expecting, or hoping for. Emotionally exhausting stuff.
"
3353,Amazing game!
3354,"really, really  good game, was recommended to me, and for good reason too. just wow, i definitely recommend it too"
3355,its awesome
3356,"Man, this is one of the most boring, bland, uninteresting games I've ever played.

Characters are too short-lived and you move on too fast. No time to get to know them or get attached

Choices mostly do not matter. Like, really, its not even Telltale-style do not matter. In telltale games everything plays out the same, but your character acts differently so its kinda roleplaying at least. 
But here all you've got is a spoiled brat and an emo protagonist. Always weak, always whiny. Jesus, I better play like a cute girl rather than a weak man WHOSE GOAL IS TO LOOK AFTER EACH LITTLE BROTHER.
Nah.

I really liked the beginning of the game. The Dad character is super cool, but we see too little of him and then move on.

This is supposed to be a road movie, but its too boring and filled with uninteresting stuff.
Oh boy, talk about uninteresting -- the gameplay is pure blandness. Go pick this up, oh then this, then go over there walking very slowly thank you mr.Player coudnt've done it without ya.

So its a waste of time and money, better go pick up some of telltale games. Like Wolf Among Us, which has style, interesting cool characters, badass protagonist.

PS. LiS 2 didnt even show me the aftermath of the PROTAGONIST WHICH I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE WHOLE TIME.
I've just been shown that ""oh look how grown up that little brat is now"".
J e s u s. What a waste."
3357,This game is amazing. Life is strange series never disappoint.
3358,":steamhappy: another good game after life is strange 1. This story is full of adventurous, surviving and fight for new life. Although it does not as heart touching as Life is Strange 1, the story is just fine. I am surprise that the story got connected to Captain Spirit and Life is strange 1, that is very nice. Overall, recommend this game who love story rich game and not take too much hours."
3359,THIS SHIT GOOD!!!!!!! OWWOOOOOOOOOOO
3360,So far this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Totally recommend the experience.
3361,haha funni
3362,"As soon who played LIS1 and BTS, and was a huge fan of both of those games, I loooove this game.
First of all, if you don't connect with Daniel and expect it to be a sequel to LIS1 then you might not enjoy this game. I went into expecting it to be something completely different but with that supernatural aspect still and that's exactly what I got.
There were a lot of difficult decisions in this game, and your choices DO have an impact on how Daniel perceives the world. If I had to compare it to another game I'd say it's similar to TWDG's last season, similar to the interactions between Clementine and AJ. Your decisions directly influence whether certain characters die or live, there's more to interact with in your environment, the character interactions/movements don't feel as forced and awkward as compared to the first game.
I was immediately attached to Daniel from his first scene in the game, and I loved the interactions between the two brothers. Honestly the writing felt a lot more genuine in this game. Many scenes were emotionally difficult to watch, at some point I almost had to shut the game off because I couldn't stop bawling my eyes out!
If you enjoyed the first game and games like TWDG, then you will definitely like this game :)"
3363,"Loved this game, great characters and great story."
3364,"Doesn't add anything beyond what the last game did. Gameplay is uninteresting. The story is not as good, the younger brother comes across as annoying and unlikable, it's understandable why his big bro would love him anyway, since they are family, but it's hard to connect with him since we aren't his brother, we're only playing as him. Since the entire game is around the little brother that makes the entire story fail for me. I think this game could be enjoyable for anyone who hasn't played  the first game or Teltale's The Walking Dead for example (Better versions of this game)."
3365,BROOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3366,𝒫𝑒𝓇𝒻𝑒𝒸𝓉. ❤
3367,yes
3368,"All of this experience only based on the first episode, so keep that in mind. Maybe contain little bit of spoiler

It's been a while I played this type of game. I personally think that this game (atleast the first episode) was great and very enjoyable. Many people just comparing this game to the first one, and I don't think this is the same story telling that this game try to tell. The first one is more focused around the main character, Max, and how her choices really affect her life. In this game we played as a Sean that ""travel"" with his brother because something happens to them. The story at this game is more focused on the interaction of what Sean's choice affect not only his story, but his brother too. There is a lot of time when Daniel (the little brother) became a reason to not do a bad things in the game, because I think you'll have a feeling that as a big brother, you couldn't show bad side to your little brother. And I really loves the story about how the main character change and really curious about what happens next. Also Brody is a real bro <3"
3369,"Personally I saw similarities between how Walking Dead S1 stacks up against Walking Dead S4 in how LIS/BTS compare to LIS2.

It takes much loved, irreplaceable originals, replaces them with slightly more fleshed out characters which aren't as immediately punchy, has a somewhat senior character dragging around a whiny kid and presents as a slower paced game about building bonds / families / teaching responsibility and racial prejudice, with mature real world themes running through it alongside more believable dialogue.

Its not to say ones better than the other, LIS is almost instantly appealing due to the powers and the dark themes, this is a slow burner which almost needs to be played in the right mood to fully appreciate it.

Essential I'd say if you're a fan of the previous games, choices matter and this style of game, just dont go into it expecting LIS. 

Also [spoiler]HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE TEARING DOWN THAT WALL[/spoiler] <3"
3370,"Was looking for a sequel but got something else instead. On its own, maybe it could've been a good game, but with the same branding as the first, I just can't recommend."
3371,"Few years later after playing Life is Strange and Before the Storm, I personally think story wise this game will never beat it's predecessors. Max and Chloe's story are just too good to be compared with. However, this game still met all my expectations for a Life is Strange game. The soundtrack is still amazing, storyline is still highly deep and emotional and the voice acting and dialogue is still decent. Overall, the developers have once created a great game and I hope they can continue expanding this series, especially on Max and Chloe."
3372,"Game doesn't start - a lot of players affected, brushed off by the publishers and the support teams."
3373,Best game ive ever played and i have only played episode 1.
3374,"As if the previous LiS series were not heart-wrenching enough, Life Is Strange 2 makes it worse (in good way, of course)! This game portrays a lot of dark themes (e.g. Racism) which reflect our real world today. 8/10 would recommend friends to try!"
3375,This is very easily one of my most favorite game I have ever played. The story does a really good job at rallying up your emotions in the right way at the right moments. The characters are great and well written. I would gladly recommend others to play this game.
3376,awesome!
3377,I love the story so much.
3378,"This game is an amazing roller coaster of emotions. The story dives into various topics and really makes you think about the harsh reality of racism in America. It's heartbreaking to see some of the things that the boys have to deal with and it is a reality for many. The songs are amazing (as usual for Dontnod games) and really help the story. I know that this opinion isn't popular, but I feel like I like this game more than the first LiS. It's definitely got a lot of replay value because there are so many endings that are all affected by your decisions throughout the game."
3379,"like i could write a whole thing on how the characters are unlikeable and sean is the dumbest 16 year old alive with absolutely no convictions of his own or how the plot is avoidable down to the game literally murdering a puppy with no just reason other than i guess animating her would cost too much but the fact this game is LITERALLY unplayable? i straight up can't interact with half the things because they didn't bother to properly optimize for mac. 

but you know what bothers me about it the most? they keep calling sean and daniel millenials when they are literally gen z. the pew research center notes the cut off is 1996 and they absolutely are past that."
3380,"I'm currently at the beginning of episode 5 and so can comment on the game so far.

Life is Strange 2 is very different to the first game. It's much more cinematic and casual. You will enjoy it if you strap down for a good movie with some minor game play. It's much more casual than the first but still well done. The characters are well fleshed out and music is perfectly on point for their scenes.

Episode 1 was as expected. It sets out important backstories and introductions to the main characters.
Episode 2 was slow and not very fun at all, in fact I quit twice in the middle of it.
Episode 3 turns the game around. It explores the relationship between the two brothers. It's very realistic and resonates if you have a sibling. 
Episode 4 flew by so fast. There was some action but the highlight was the dialogue on life and finding your place in the world.

If you can quickly get through episode 2, this game is really worth it."
3381,"I love the Life is Strange stories. They are so emotional and time-worthy. This one I think I liked even better than Max's. I felt for the characters more. If you like good plot, emotional stories and games with choices, I highly recommend this one. A story about family, brotherhood, the law, treating other people, selfless help, injustice, racial issues, LGBTQ+ rights and so many more."
3382,Greatest story I've encountered in any game.
3383,I have played several story games such as this one and I love them all. This game was very dramatic and involved me with the characters. I felt so much for them and wanted to see them find peace. Their journey was so difficult and they faced so many obstacles but stuck together and saw things through. It wasn't easy but they learned lessons along the way mainly that life isn't easy but if you stay together and work together and trust in each other you can overcome life's obstacles. I really enjoyed this game and cried at many of the checkpoints and especially at the end.
3384,Try Not To Cry = Cry A Lot
3385,"The game features similar gameplay to the first game, however this time with a much weaker story. The writing in this game relies too much on shock value with random moments that don't quite make sense and WAY too much on politics to the point it becomes a turn off and gets to be way too much by ep 5. While a majority of your choices don't matter in the bigger picture, your actions do have an effect on Daniel's sense of morality which is cool to see. If you like this genre of game then you'll likely enjoy it, but overall this is a step back from the original."
3386,"I adore this game, it's such a wonderfully told story."
3387,"Emotionally touching and fantastic game, great job"
3388,"This game is the type of story that I think about for days after putting it down. I lay in bed and just think about what happened, and always asking if I've made the right choices.

Life is Strange 2 is a beautiful, gut-wrenching, heartfelt tale. It stays with me.

Edit: It's been 2 months since I finished the game. It's still buried in my brain, it's the only game I read and write fanfiction for. I'm in too deep.

Also, it's Daniel's birthday at the time of this edit. Happy birthday enano!"
3389,good game
3390,"Dog dies 
0/10 won't play again"
3391,it a good game
3392,The problem with the game that is the game too easy
3393,I personally liked LiS 1 and LiS before the storm more than this one but still it's an amazing game with a beautiful story. Definitely worth your time and money.
3394,fooooking good

3398,"Life is Strange 2 is the sequel to both Life is Strange and Life is Strange: Before the Storm that is set in the same universe but has different characters in the form of two young brothers.

Pros:
+ Story is good but feels like a level down form the first Life is Strange game.
+ Graphics are great.
+ Gameplay is very smooth and the environments are rich.
+ Music is excellent.

Cons:
- Some characters are uninteresting and annoying.
- Gives you the illusion of choice but in reality it is very shallow and your actions mean nothing.
- Writing is clunky in some places.

Overall, Life is Strange 2 lacks the charm of its predecessors. It had no grand mystery and gameplay was less engaging. I would only recommend this game if you like Life is Strange or story rich games in general and it is on sale."
3399,"Without doubt one of the best games I've ever played. Beautifully presented and well written, the storyline is captivating and once you start, you'll be desperate to see it through to the end. Masterpiece. 10/10"
3400,"Life is Strange 2 is aStory about 2 American Boys with Mexican Roots. Daniel has Telekinese & can use it for good or evil. He is still very young & an Accident by a bad Policeman that kills there Father without a Reason bring them on the Wrong Road of Decision.

They have to surive with few & the younger brother health force Sean to do what is necessarily for it even stealing food & clothes/ tent. He always get attacked without a Reason by Hillbillys, Drugdealers & stupid Policeofficers.

++ Good Story but to less with Grandparents, Mother, Friendship Lyla
+ David from Life is Strange if you blow Arcadia Bay (phoning with Chloe, Greeting Max)
+ Many different Locations & good hidden Special Souveniers
+ 7 Endings, but not one i would prefare

- no Chloe/ Max directly
- Lyla is like non existing
- Side Characters are some good like Brody Holloway, Chris Eriksen, Cassidy, Sarah Lee Hackerman, Mushroom, but to less & i miss Broke, Samantha & Co. from Life is Strange 1 

Good for everyone who like this kind of games.

- Lyla"
3401,Yes
3402,"I love the storyteling, the writing is amazing and the characters are gorgeous"
3403,love game despite game crash sometimes
3404,Good story 🙂.
3405,"It astounds me that I haven't heard a lot of hype about this game. As someone who adored Life is Strange 1 and Before the Storm I can understand missing Max and Chloe but this game is such a unique experience compared to those. This game feels like pure love. I feel so deeply for Daniel and Sean and their relationship really makes this game. The feel of this game is really similar to the previous games. While I personally feel this game is far more intense there is still this genuine and real sort of feeling. It hits you deeper and deeper as you grown to love the Diaz brothers. I also really enjoy the little references of the previous games, they aren't overwhelming but they also aren't too small that you miss them. Overall this game is very close to my heart and I can't recommend it more."
3406,I played the first one maybe two years ago and the life is strange series slowly became my favorite games to play. I love the real world issues tied into a game play story line. The absolute best game for solo gamers. You can also see the stats of what you picked to do compared to your friends.
3407,"I'm sorry but this game is not comparable to LIS1. There is almost no character development... for example: Why don't the developers let the player go to the party to meet Seans crush etc. Why wouldn't the developers let the player go to work as Sean. Also Lyla had so much potential to be a great character but they did not do anything with her.  I mean just give the player more time to find out what kind of person Sean is so the player can relate. Most of the decision i really couldn't relate and understand for example: Why would Sean run away in the first place? xD I mean, I would not have done that for sure. Maybe i could have related and understood Seans actions IF i knew more about him at the beginning. But that was not the case since he ran away like right at the beginning of the game. 

Also some players also mentioned the case that your choices does not really matter since the outcome will be the same. I feel like the developers were too lazy to think of more divers story outcomes...

The game is still playable, but It is just literally not good enough to be compare to LIS1. Out of ten i would give 4 or 5."
3408,"This is how collectivists see the world, treating people by their gender, race, etc.
Instead of treating them as individuals

Sad political propaganda game 0/10

""The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities."""
3409,best game ive played in a long time.
3410,sooooo goood
3411,"It's the only game during which i was crying, yes choices are mostly illusionary, but the story is so so good, just amazing"
3412,Hard to describe perfection
3413,such an amazing game. I've finished Life is Strange 1 and it makes me addicted!
3414,This is a tough review to make. In all honesty this game could have been miles better in comparison to the prior Life is Strange games. There were graphical errors or bugs frequently and didn't have a great story in my opinion. Chapter 3 is complete garbage and otherwise it feels like your choices make no difference at all. I could be wrong but I feel like if I redid the story with polar opposite decisions nothing would have changed. In the end I see this as a game worth getting with time to kill and / or a good sale on it.
3415,"This game killed my main man fuck this game. But i love it to itty bitty bits, also this game contains vewy scawy zombies. Oh and Shrooms is the cutest dog every especially when she chases the sticks <3 <3 <3 8=====D"
3416,meh
3417,dontnod <3
3418,Very cool Game
3419,"LiS1 was good, even BtS was good, but this game is annoying as hell, an idiot annoying kid, and the game is so try hard on making you feel guilty all the time, it doesnt matter what you do its always bad, and the idiot kid blames you for everything but you still have to go after him despite i dont really give a darn about him."
3420,"yes
"
3421,Incredible like the previous game. DONTNOD doesn't miss.
3422,I like the there is more action at the start than the first one and its like a real adventure. I learned a lot a lot in this story  Sean deserves a carefree and happy life too I wish he would attain it when I next see him in another story. THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE ! hands down
3423,"I liked LiS1, this storyline so far is pretty good ; i recommend"
3424,"Interesting story, but I have to admit, but the first LIS has raised the bar a lot higher."
3425,"Even though it is not as good as the first one, this game is really good. In a gameplay perspective, it's way better than the first one, but I doubt the story of the first game can ever be surpassed. The first game was situated in one place, Arcadia Bay, but the sequel feels more like a travel story. Not a very happy one, though. But for me, it taught me a lesson or two. I didn't have to cry as much as in the first game, but still, I felt very connected to the characters, and that really got me sucked into the game. I honestly can't wait for the third installment, even though it will likely be not as good as these two games. But really, you should play this game, it's awesome!"
3426,Cried after playing it. Such a beautiful and emotional story.
3427,"GOOD  
"
3428,"At first I really liked the game. The style is beautiful, so much to explore and to decide. But from episode to episode, my hatred against ""little wolf"" grew and grew to a point where I tried to get rid of him or get him killed (which obviously did not happen).
This whole game would be so short, if David could just not be a prick for once, they would act instead of talking for hours or they would do what everybody else would do. No, they just decide to mess it up again and again.

Besides all the frustration and simply stupid decisions of the two brothers, it is a nice game. But I just got way to upset that I was short before deleting the game midways multiple times.

HEAVY SPOILER:
[spoiler] Like seriously, they blew a hole into the fence. Talk for hours instead of getting over the damned border. Break out of jail and do not return to the hole, BUT GO FOR AN OFFICIAL BORDER CROSSING? Even after hearing, that the police awaits them? How stupid can they be? [/spoiler]

"
3429,"One of the best games I have ever played. Great story, amazing music, interesting characters, a lot of emotions and thinking about choices you have made... Incredible journey!"
3430,"Honestly, I had a mixed experience playing this game.
I played LIS1 before, and I loved it. So, I thought the sequel would be enjoyable as well. I was quite wrong.

The main point of the game is you influencing your brother's choices. But throughout most of the game he just upright ignores you and makes stupid decisions that cause you to even more trouble. It was mostly felt during the 2-4 episodes, and it was annoying and frustrating. It felt like a babysitter simulator and no matter what you do he will have multiple tantrums aimed at you.

The game sometimes felt too political in my opinion, and it felt like 50% of the random people we meet are racist assholes while the other half are cool peace loving folk. Most of the side characters felt very shallow.

I did like the first and the last episode, but the ending made the game feel quite pointless. 
I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave a negative review, but after realising that the mid-game wasn't that fun and how the game compares to LIS1(which was quite a masterpiece), I decided that I can't recommend purchasing this game."
3431,"I dropped this game on 2 episode. The first game was masterpiece. This game is much worse.

I believe this game was sponsored by democratic party for election of us president 2016.
The heroes of this game are 2 young mexican stupid addict criminals.
They try to escape from police to mexico but they are too stupid to do this.
The pace of this game is too slow for me.
I can't stand how slow Sean speaks, and I cannot 4x speed up his speeches. :("
3432,One of the best games I have played. Greatly improved the lip sync from of the last game.

3442,"White people are evil: The Game. Featuring travel montages!

Devs shit the bucket on this one"
3443,Wolf brothers forever!
3444,"Life Is Strange 2 is such a good game, in that it it brings light to something that has been an issue in the US for so long (the inciting incident that is), and gives realistic struggles for the characters, aside obviously from the part that is a superpower. Life is Strange is definitely the best game series I could conceive. The fact that it cover such traumatic events, and brings light to stuff like it does, and presenting characters that act and feel real, makes it my favorite game series ever. I hope that anyone and everyone that has the ability to play this game and all the others in the series does or has already. I will 100% be replaying every game as I wait for episodes of Life is Strange 3 to release all episodes."
3445,if you want something like life is strange 1 don't buy this game lmao. your choices don't matter as much as they should and the entire game is basically the same shit with no actual development. because this game was also made in 2016 its all shitty political references. tldr; game sucked
3446,depression only for 15$ otherwise the best game
3447,"Life Is Strange 2 is a really good game, despite the fact of having many flaws in the plot structure. But even for the relationship between Diaz brothers alone, it's worth it to experience by yourself."
3448,This is the game that can surprise you with unexpected event and something affects to your mind.
3449,"BEST GAME EVER, but i would play life is strange (1) first, you don't need too but there are some cute add on's to the game they you will like if you play it first, either way this game is totally worth it, and the story line is fantastic, but if you are sensitive to a lot of stuff then don't play it cuz it does have some bad stuff in it, other than that, TOTALLY buy it dude!"
3450,"I used to play the life is strange first series for an hour everyday until I finished it, but for life is strange 2, the sequel is not even worth going for the second episode. I don't recommend u to buy it."
3451,"Danial is an absolute shithead. Don't even bother being nice or a good role model to him, it's pointless as he ends up the same no matter what. Honestly the best playthroughs have been the amoral ones where I ignore him as much as possible."

3454,"great game
"
3455,Cool game
3456,"Terrible. Could be OK if it was not named ""Life is Strange"", but absolutely no-winner in comparison with the first season and BtS."
3457,"I really enjoyed the first Life is Strange, but in my opinion this sequel is better in almost every way. The gameplay is usually meh, but something about the dialogue and world makes you forget that basically all you're doing is moving around and clicking left mouse. It's a great story I think most people will get something out of."
3458,yummy
3459,"I think Life is Strange 2 is an excellent interactive story-telling experience, but for stretches it feels more like an interactive novel than a game. That said, the plot, how Sean and Daniel are constantly forced to move on and ultimately only have each other to depend on throughout the game, really does make you care about the two protagonists.

While I'm fairly certain that Life is Strange 2 offers more opportunities to shape the story through your decisions than the original Life is Strange, it doesn't feel that way. That probably comes down to the time-rewind mechanic of the first game. This game lacks that ability, or something similar, which hurts it a bit, reducing the chance for experimentation as a player. However, the lack of rewind does add weight to your decisions.

The developers should be applauded for the truly difficult moral choices they force players to make from start to finish. They also deserve praise for taking a clear stance on a variety contemporary social and political issues, instead of pretending their game is apolitical like so many companies do today."
3460,amazing
3461,"Woah, heavy man, maybe not as good as the first one, but with a fresh perspective nonetheless. I can see some political narrative here against the Trump administration, however the game and the story is good nonetheless. 
The main character faces a lot of racism in the game, some of it is well done and some of it kinda comes out of nowhere. 
Maybe things are different in american than they are here in europe.

I've noticed some minor graphical glitches and bugs, textures being black instead of what they are supposed to be, one time Daniel despawned and Sean was talking to himself, another time a character was supposed to move but just stayed in one place. It's nothing gamebreaking.

The characters are well written and memorable, however i think the main character seems like all he can think about is his little brother and his sacrifices sometimes make me question if he has any self preservation instinct left.

8/10"
3462,daniel go stupid. daniel go crazy.
3463,Nice one and great brothers
3464,"I love the first life is strange and it was hard to play this one. During all game i had a hope to see or hear something about characters from the original (and i got a little), so i couldn't focus on new characters. The thing is that this Life is Strange is like totally diffirent. It's just hard to accept it, but it's good. Maybe it would be better to play this one first, and then the original)"
3465,"it's amazing. They improved. Graphics and lipsync are better in 2. the story is great so far. It's more of an adventure. they are traveling unlike lis. I would recommend playing 1 first, but i guess it's not needed? It's about different characters. I miss my girls, chloe and max. Love the 2 brothers and their dynamic"
3466,"Depressing, kinda kinky."
3467,"It's the best game I've ever played. I don't like speak about or comment something. Actually, believe me"
3468,"The only game that you really come for the ""Story""
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
3469,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

3477,"The original Life is Strange, for all its flaws, left a big impact on me and in some ways changed my life. It feels weird to say that about a game where teenagers with plastic haircuts verbalise emojis at one another but there it is. It came out at the perfect time and it will always have a place in my heart.

I wasn't very high on this for the first two episodes, but it really picks up in episode 3 and peaks very nicely in the finale. It's great to have a proper next instalment in the series from DONTNOD after how disappointing Before the Storm was for me. Sean and Daniel's story is touching, tense, political and reactive and I couldn't be happier that this franchise finally has choices that have impacts over the entirety of the narrative, which was my main issue with LIS1. The graphics have that warm hand-drawn quailty again and with some lovely lighting this game looks amazing at times. The music isn't as memorable as the first game but Jonathan Morali still does amazing work with a soft acoustic score with hints of electronic variety at times. The small connections to the first game were really well handled and respectful of the choices players made in that story while not distracting from this new one, which was nice.

I also want to praise the writing for all the characters Daniel and Sean run into, their relationships with the player are complicated and vary significantly based on choices you make. The writing was at its strongest when interacting with them and these moments made the game a real treat to go through. And just like LIS1, it's full of social commentary and representation that, while not always handled with subtlety, were great to see and will encourage a lot of players to reflect on themselves and the world they live in. 

It didn't leave the kind of impact on me that Max and Chloe's time shenanigans did back in 2016, but I don't hold it against LIS2. This is still a lovely narrative that anyone who enjoys story-driven games should check out, with plenty of strengths to appreciate."
3478,"This is truly a must play. I bought this thinking ""hey life is strange is one of my favorite games this one cant be to bad right?"" and let me tell you i was wrong. It's so much better than the original. In my opinion of course. While the first one was captivating yes theres just something about this that speaking to me. Following these two brothers on there journey to be free together is amazing. While there were some bugs that maybe stopped me from shedding tears and taking a moment to laugh instead there to many time where i shed tears from sadness and happiness. There something about a good story in a game that just... pulls you in. You never want it to end but at the same time you do. You want the best for the characters. Over the last four days I've completely stopped playing anything else as I needed to know that Sean and Daniel was going to be okay. Im not gonna lie it was kinda weird that I heard my own name said alot while playing (I share the same name as the main Sean just spelt the right way) but after a while it passed. To add to it one of my favorite characters was a guy named Finn which also happens to be the name of my cat. Anyways back to the review. You meet so many amazing characters along the way and watch as these two kids grow up even Daniel faster than a 9 year old should. Maybe its because I only turned 18 a month ago but there is something that speaks to me in that. In many ways I feel like I've grown up and in many ways I still feel like a kid. But there's something that this game has shown me. Maybe I would have found it out on my own but its shown me that even though I wouldnt call my self an adult anymore Im no longer a kid and I need to find a bit of my own freedom now Im not gonna be fuckin' hitch hiking anytime soon if I can avoid but still a bit of my own freedom as an adult. It's also shown me that my little brother is growing up to and as much as I hate it he's going to and I should be by him along the way. Any ways 0/10 shit game because the dad called him self ""Papito"" which is basically what you'd call your boyfriend in bed. PLAY THIS GAME"
3479,Fantastic
3480,"(This review is solely based on the free Episode 1）

When Dontnod studio stops making action games, they are a good friend of mine. Though they suck at making action titles, for the regular storytelling games they are indeed good at it. Anyway, I played Life is Strange 1 long ago. For Life is Strange 2, they deliver the same high-quality story as the first one (at least for Episode 1). There are some common settings like the ability, but also some differences between two stories. Life is Strange 1 is a love story that happens in day-to-day life. It feels a little faster, more exciting, and the story happens in a more limited social space (i.e., certain acquaintances and known locations). Life is Strange 2 on the other hand, is a road trip around two brothers. It is slower and more peaceful, requiring more time to taste the story. And by nature, it happens in more unknown locations and you will meet more people. There is no which one is better in this aspect. They are both very heart-touching and feel real (I can’t speak for the lesbian but I can speak as a big brother). Especially, I feel exactly the same in my daily life for the part where the protagonist treated his brother impatiently and later felt guilty about it. Surely, certain people have different taste. Like me, I sort of have a road trip complex so to me I prefer the second game. However, some people may prefer a faster-paced story and they might like the first game better. Again, they are both good. It only depends on your liking.

Besides the story, there is a nice improvement in the second game. In the first game, there are many big scenes, meaning you are put in a large space to explore, whereas the second game scenes are relatively smaller. I really appreciate this change because a bigger scene means you have a bigger chance to miss stuff and also more random things may happen, which will interrupt your pace of playing a game. By narrowing down the scale of a scene and adding more cutscenes, Life is Strange 2 is more linear, which is good for keeping the focus on the current story and maintain the pace.

I can pick some weaknesses though. You might call it nitpicking but I think it is reasonable to pick on the story because writing a truly good story really requires some delicate work and attention.

- There are too many uses of “I guess” at the end of the conversations to emphasize the hesitation of a character. It feels repetitive. It is kind of bad, I guess (sarcastically).

- You have to fit into the mindset of a teenager to understand some motives of the protagonist. For example, the protagonist freaked out and ran away because of his teenager’s immature thinking. For normal adults, most people will just speak out the truth instead of running. For someone like me, I can understand his motive because I think in a teenager’s mindset to justify his action. But I believe not everyone is capable of doing that and they might call this plot absurd. Another plot that even I feel a little absurd is where the protagonist threw away his phone. The game never properly explains and justifies the necessity of doing it, but I guess he is afraid of the police will track his phone. It feels very compulsory because it requires not only the mindset of a teenager but also a bit of conspiracy theories. I mean, you can just turn off the phone. If the police can really track you down even the phone is off, you guys would have already been busted in the forest!

- The part where the little brother finds out the truth is too rushed. It is so fast and not as intense as I think.

Yeah so far from what I played this game is good. I will play the complete version once I got some $$. Try it, Episode 1 is free anyway."
3481,No. Just nope. I'm disappointed a lot.
3482,"What a story, i cried after i finished this game"
3483,"Amazing and heartbreaking game, if you like story driven games this is a must play in my opinion.
It's definitely worth it to at least try the first episode since it's free to see if you would like the full game"
3484,"Pretty good sequel to the first game as it treads a bit different ground. I do like the fact that choices you make along the way influence your brother which mechanically and thematically dovetail nicely. I can't wait for another Life is Strange game. It would be nice if they turned this into an anthology series.

For those wondering, I got the Redemption ending."
3485,VERY GOOD GAME !!!
3486,"The athmosphere, story, music, characters and overall feel of the game are somehow even better than the previous games. Good freaking job, Dontnod Ent. Good job."
3487,good
3488,"If you didn't enjoy Life is Strange 1, give this game a hard pass. It's the same sort of experience. If you're considering playing this game and haven't touched Life is Strange 1. Do that instead. If you played the first game, and its expansion, and are looking for more of the same. This is like that but a bit watered down. This game is more of a road trip with more varied locations but shallower characters. And less narrative complexity. Both the good and bad forces were a bit exaggerated and lacking redeeming features. Its prettier and more polished. It does show some of the ugly of USA too."
3489,:)
3490,"I love everything about this game. From the story to the freaking symbol of the big wolf and the little wolf when you make a choice. All of it just tugs at your heart and immerses you completely into the lives of Daniel and Sean. I'm part way through the second chapter (ignore my playtime, I accidentally left the game idle all night... Twice.) and I just had to pause to just express how much I'm enjoying everything about this story. When I first realised that the story was in the same world, but not including Max and Chloe, I admit I was a little sceptical just because I loved the first game so much, but I've completely forgotten about that, now. Don't watch any of the trailers, don't read any of the reviews, if you've managed to get this far without any spoilers then just play the game and see for yourself."
3491,"Life is Strange 2 is one of the best stories in video games. The special relationship between two brothers that will make your heart hurt in the best possible way. It is emotional, evocative, heartwarming, and heartbreaking."
3492,good game
3493,Super fun. Great story line. Totally worth buying. Highly recommended.
3494,Lovely game.
3495,i personally love this game about 2 and a half hours of game play per season and honestly amazing!
3496,"I really liked this game.for me it was the best choice game i've played so far. 
Very heartwarming story with a lot of messages and made me relate to the characters."
3497,"This game is really boring, and Im not a fan of politics in my games"
3498,"Amazing Story Game With Good Controls And trust your choices matters a lot in this Game, So pls Choose carefully because it can entirely change the ending you can get. I  have till now finished 2 episodes And I am fully into this Game. Definitely If you love Story Games You should Try This. And Also This Gmae is much better than Life Is Strange 1 At least In My Opinion. Good Luck And Happy Gaming"
3499,"All of the choices are really confounding, the choices are not reflecting the desirable results. There is no lesser evil on the choice, every choices are an evil for each of perspectives. Buggy and glitchy, many bugs and glitch can be occured while playing the games. But, overall is an improvement from the first one whether in graphics, choices available, worlds size, soundtrack, cutscenes, and also consequences from episode to episode. Just worth to buy when it's on sale."
3500,this game makes me ejaculate honestly no homo
3501,cried 6 times
3502,"Can't run the game, can't refund the game. 
Thank you, DONTNOD Entertainment, for doing literally nothing about this situation.
Yes, I tried to reinstall and check files integrity, it doesn't help.

UPD: I installed insider preview build of Windows 11 and game started to work for some reason. 
Though the game itself is very good, I'm still disappointed that developers didn't help me at all when I was using Windows 10."
3503,"I have mixed feelings. I think I can safely recommend this game as a stand alone story but not as a follow-up to the first Life Is Strange. It simply doesn't compare. Developers tried to make the story deeper and more political but since they only offer a bias leaning towards one side of the spectrum, it feels much more like a not very well executed lecture about modern US and its problems. I am all for morally ambiguous scenarios and coming-of-age tell-tales. They're universal and anyone can relate to them. This game is just too pushy with illogical, one-sided agenda that makes you look like a bad guy if you disagree."
3504,life is traumatizing season 2
3505,"If you like to chill but still wanna play something story rich, this game is for you. The first game was awesome, this one takes it to another level, trust me. It hits those feelings hard so grab some tissues if you weep easily haha"
3506,"A worthy successor to Life Is Strange.

On a technical level, everything has been elevated: Sceneries are more beautiful, levels are bigger, tons of interesting characters and the soundtrack is as great as the first one. Chapters are also longer.
 
On the narrative and characters, I fear this will be the contention point: This is as the cover indicates a brothers/roadtrip story and the pacing and story will flow off as that. It's not the storytelling everyone will enjoy, but fits into line on how abrupt roadtrips can change. It's not a mathematically calculated perfect pacing, but it's the proper pacing for this kind of story.

While the first games could've happened pretty much anywhere this one wears the US setting on it's sleeve and has became even more tied in due to some unfortunate real life events after it's release. This is very properly woven into what characters feel and think, but if you told me you want a game to forget reality and happen to live in the US then... yeah this wouldn't be my first recommendation.

I give in to some complains that some of the choices could be phrased better, but honestly it's only a few dialogues far in between that suffer from this, and nowhere near as bad as other games do (trust me, I've gone through more than enough games where ""choices don't matter"" and this is definitely not one of them [looking at you TellTale], just don't expect something insane or TRPG-like).

Aside from that, a couple technical mishaps and a few scenes that could've been arranged better this is an enjoyable experience, altough not as revolutionary as the first game and will hit bullseye on a much more niche crowd."
3507,"Pulls at your heartstrings like all Life is Strange games :'( 
Interesting to see your choices throughout the game influence the ending instead of just the big decision at the end alone."
3508,"Without going into too much spoilers, Life is Strange 2 tells a new story surrounding two brothers, who are forced to run away from home after an unexpected tragedy. This game builds on the strengths of the first game and improves them. The storyline is emotional, impactful and gut wrenching, packed with difficult choices that affect your later gameplay. It touches on a lot of current underbelly issues especially relevant in America, such as racism, religion and drugs, without coming across as too preachy (though I suspect not many can stomach how certain issues are portrayed).

I especially like how your choices in this game impacts an important character instead of yourself and how it builds toward the finale. I also like how the game is set in the first universe as the first, instead of a distinctly new story.

While your choices do matter in the game, I'm just a little tad disappointed in how the endings played out, meaning that not all your choices will be reflected in the ending cutscene. In addition, there are only 4 major endings with some additional content. I wish that Life is Strange will be able to incorporate some form of closure ala Fallout New Vegas style but the game is good enough."
3509,"Hey, so this is going to be a hard review honestly the hardest one I’ve ever done because I’m a fan of games. Also, I am not going to bring up ( Life is strange 1, before the storm) it’s wether or not this game is recommended or not. I can’t help but feel that this game is two things. A baby sitting simulator & a political game. It bugs me in how throughout my gameplay (I did finish it) in how this game was built throughout the hole trump campaign & when he became president with all the Mexican stuff that was going on this game feels way to damn political. I came to play a good game to escape the politics not get in them by playing the new game. As for the baby sitting simulator it’s definitely just that. Quite unfortunate really... Sean is always looking out for his brother and his brother being 9 throughout the game is exactly key point in how the game will play throughout so expect that. Also 90% of the game discusses racism & getting beat up by racists which can sometimes be true but as a Latino myself I’ve still yet to get beat up by a white dude or get in any situations as these two did. I couldn’t recommend this game at least in my opinion their was a few good moments that were a 10/10 but the overall game would be a 4/10. Politics and games especially in a good series really sucks for a slight pre sequel of a game."
3510,"I love you, enano"
3511,Pretty good game besides Episode 3. Just think you should spend this money on a happy meal instead
3512,Very immersive game with great story line and graphic design
3513,"Its really interesting, easy to understand, and make you really think about how you do things, it also has 5 game saves, meaning you can go through 5 different pathways"
3514,Wauw this game really got me crying many times. Really good story and I love how your choices affect the bond of you and your brother <3 Loved the first life is strange but this one is imo the best :D
3515,"Great looking game with thoughtful commentary on the real world issues, Not as good as LiS but still a very good game nonetheless."
3516,"Hell of a game. Hell of a journey.
Very gripping story, takes you trough a whole variety of emotions, if you allow it to connect with you. 
The endings are real tearjerkers, no matter which one you're going to get, it's just sad to see this end you know? I'm gonna miss the wolf brothers..."
3517,"I rally like it,u can chose your future and need to make hard decisions!!!! I recommend!!! <3"
3518,"Lovely story, great graphics"
3519,you would love it!
3520,"I loved LiS and Before the Storm but this game plays like ""Life is Woke"" the simulator. Perhaps the game would have improved if so much leftist dogma were not injected into it. 

I recall a scene from episode 2 where Sean finds a book in his grandfather's night stand and says ""Stephen and I wouldn't agree on politics but at least he's not preachy"" while the game itself is nothing but preachy over the entire five episodes. (Some spoilers ahead)

I would have been able to look past the grandstanding were it not a veiled attempt to conceal the insignificance of your choices in the game. For example; every episode Sean tells Daniel to conceal his powers and not to share them with anyone, and every episode Daniel does the exact opposite. 

The ending i received was meant to show that in the end Sean helped Daniel, Daniel eventually listened to Sean, and went on to make a good life for himself to show Sean the man he become 15 years later.

Which leads me back to why I absolutely can't recommend this game for anyone else. Leading up to this ending we're confronted with a series of judgmental, homophobic, bigoted, and down right racist ""Christians"" throughout the game. The symbolic gesture of the ending I received was overshadowed by the symbolism that America and its politics are binary, that we're all of these awful polarized archetypes to such a degree two hispanic boys would rather break through the wall to live in an a violent, and impoverished country. Nothing is further from the truth. 

I don't have to agree with the politics to enjoy a game. LiS had political elements I didn't agree with but the first game did well to not lean on it so heavily as this series has. The LiS story comparably was mysterious, thrilling, and overall beautiful. This story unfortunately misses the mark."
3521,SUCH GOOD StorYY!!
3522,"Okay so i'm going to go and say this game is awful. It has its charms, but it really doesn't live up to original. The graphics are pretty much a step-up from the first game. And the characters are pretty good. The difficulty is non-existent. A pretty casual game. Now I'm not going into the political/religious message the game had, though it does seem out of the ordinary for the company to pull off after the first game was a mystery, and this is a political activist film. But the other thing is that unlike the first game, your choices don't matter. Now I will be pulling examples from the first chapters, if I go into the farther chapters then I guess I won't put context in. (SPOILERS) First one, at a gas station, you need to buy food, you have to option to steal, I chose not to. Later an old man accuses you of stealing. Doesn't that seem like a strange plot device to put on track? Next one, your friend wants to steal from a drug dealer with help from your brother. You can say no or yes. I chose no. It happens anyways. The game is just pulling at strings for any conflict. It's an illusion that there is choices but it's just a story with slightly different outcomes. Play LIS2 if you want, but keep in mind the Choices Matter tag wasn't true."
3523,"This is such a nice game guys!!... I LOVED IT
"
3524,"Boring as fuck, LiS1 is a top notch, this is some cheap shot, DontNod get yourself together pls"
3525,+1
3526,mucho loco
3527,"Your choices really do determine the outcome of the game.  Awesome characters, love it!"
3528,"Daniel is probably the most annoying, unruly, bratty character ever in the middle chapters. If I could've ditched him somehow, I definitely would've.

The ending still got me in tears though. Glad I didn't ditch Daniel."
3529,mega worth
3530,Nice story adventure. Protagonist's brother is extremely hateable but that's okay
3531,"I do not connect with the brothers. The pacing of the games drove me nuts for many times. What excelled in the first LIFE IS STRANGE game was hard to find in LIFE IN STRANGE 2, except for the statistics of decisions at the end of each chapter.
The good thing is that the game is technically well made (soothing natural sceneries) and glitch-free."
3532,I want my 18 minutes back.
3533,good
3534,"The story is captivating and the game does a great job of making you understand and care about the characters. The whole way through I found myself eagerly awaiting what happened next and making decisions i felt would best impact on Sean and Daniel. I also loved the fact that Sean was bisexual so it was up to the player to pick which romance they found best fit their story. Overall, this was one of my favorite experiences in a game and it's story is one of the rare gems that will stick with you forever."
3535,"The people that say that they got sad or heartbroken from this game baffles me. The story is not good not even close to LIS 1.  
Daniel your brother that accidenttly kills a cop in the beginning is the one with the power this time so you are stuck with Sean to do babysitting work for your annoying little brother just so you can get chained to wall, infiltrate a cult in the desert and get the shit punched into you, get the shit pucnhed into you again in the middle of the desert by some neonazis hillbillies,  blow a hole in the border wall and then  get chased and shot at with assault rifles again by neonazi hillbillies this is also in the desert btw 
It also trys so hard to make the player like these homeless teenagers that dont want to find a job beacause fuck society and then they to go work on a weed farm in the middle of the forrest so they can be gay and swim naked freely. 

All this so the game can preach its political agenda that marks every cop and every white man as a racist or a triggerhappy  braindead baffoun."

3537,This game is so boring that i forgot about it for 3 months. (Why did i spend money on this crap)
3538,"Story wasn't as good as the first one. The characters were annoying. 

The only pleasure I got was derived from trying to ruin the little shit's life. I had wanted to abandon the stupid brat since episode 3 and was pleasantly surprised when I managed to do it at the end."

3540,Very Impressive game. I love it
3541,"Fantastic game, takes on what the previous one did and improved on most of it. The story is engaging, the characters are great, the endings are big depressing and the themes are fantastic. Highly recommend."
3542,so far loving the story line though i have yet to complete the whole series.
3543,"BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!! So profound, it really gets you!"
3544,Great game. In my opinion even better than the first one. (10 out of 10)
3545,yes.
3546,LOVED THE STORY LINE
3547,Dontnod sure knows how to write poignant stories.
3548,Its kinda fun
3549,"The story is great - the emotions are almost too real. The voice acting is superb. So far I'm enjoying it more than Life is Strange 1. The attention to detail improves immersion but it isn't overwhelming, which is an issue I had with the first instalment in the series. Fair warning: you WILL do anything for Daniel. His character is so believable and they made him painfully cute.
4.5/5 so far, but I'm not even done episode 1."
3550,"AAAAAAH!! 
I just.. can't believe it's over! Can I get a Life is Strange 3, pretty please? 
To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from Life is Strange 2, but it was far over what I had in mind. Life is Strange series NEVER let me down. 
I'm trying to find my words, but I feel speechless. I had such a wonderful time while playing it, felt so much, it's overwhelming. 
100% recommend it!"
3551,Still looking for games like this :)
3552,This game is shit nobody buy it
3553,"Great game, great story, mediocre gameplay, but this second version of the game is well designed, I really liked the game:)"
3554,"This game is literally worth to buy.
Just buy the game and live the experience.
There are 4 main endings, and there would be some different outcomes in each end depending on what you did on the previous episodes.
THIS IS MY BEST STORY-BASED GAME SO FAR.
P.S: just be careful, it contains nudity"
3555,"เนื้อเรื่องดี ยังคงมาตรฐานเดิมในหลายๆด้านได้ดี ขยายสเกลการเล่าเรื่องได้ใหญ่ดีแต่บางทีก็รู้สึกว่ามันเกินควบคุมจนบางครั้งมันก็มีความไม่สมเหตุสมผลของมันไปบ้าง ที่น่าเสียดายคือเกมไม่น่าจดจำเท่าภาคแรกทั้งๆที่เนื้อเรื่องเล่นกับประเด็นที่ใหญ่กว่าเดิมมาก การเล่นเรื่องสัญลักษณ์ของภาคนี้ก็ดูไม่น่าจดจำเท่าภาคแรก (ภาคแรกเล่นเรื่องรูปถ่าย ภาคนี้เล่นเรื่องหมาป่า) แต่โดยรวมก็ยังคงดีในตามแบบฉบับของ DONTNOD เหมือนเดิม เรียกได้ว่ากด EP.1 มาคือต้องรีบกดตอนต่อไปมาเล่น 

8/10"
3556,Well spent 14 hours!
3557,very good and playable for lowvision like me. Thank You
3558,"Interesting addition to the series, but could have been better without invisible time limits on choices, visible time limits on choices, lack of a way to look at dialogue history in case of missing parts of what was said OR  (much more than in previous LIS games) choices leading to unrealistic outcomes. Good soundtrack.

8/10

3559,"Again with the first Life is Strange, this game is a masterpiece.
I see some saying how because the main characters are male it doesn't hit different.
Nah, it still hits the same, and that's kinda sexist but whatever.

11/10 WOULD PLAY 100 MORE TIMES <3!

3560,"perfect game , I like it so much ."
3561,"Somehow after my shit ass adventure I still got the best ending in my opinion. Holy fuck this game had some up and downs at first but by the time I got into the third episode I was hooked completely and crying off and on constantly. It's cringe at times but if your only reason for not playing this is anything a long the lies of ""damn liberals"" firstly, fuck you and second grow the fuck up. I loved the first game but I think this one is my favorite. Please play this game."
3562,fun and great story
3563,Good Game
3564,Good game.
3565,Awesome Possum (°o°)
3566,"As many people, I liked LiS 1 more. Since that one came out 3 years prior to LiS 2, I think I expected more improvement from the first one. 

In many ways it is the same. Moving story, great soundtrack, much attention to detail, slightly annoying protagonists in my opinion. As someone here (perhaps multiple people) expressed, what happens after you make a choice often doesn't make sense. You want to keep a low profile in a tiny town, but agree to go shopping there? This takes away from the experience. 

If you consider buying this, just know it has way less 'gaming' than LiS 1. In fact I'm pretty sure there wasn't a single gaming element. Sometimes you have to push some buttons fast, and that's it. It doesn't seem to affect the story in any big way. I hope if a LiS 3 comes out, they will include more actual gaming elements. I'll definitely want to buy it regardless."

3568,"I was initially a bit sceptical about Life is Strange 2. The original game was, despite its flaws, one of the more impactful gaming experiences I've ever had, with one of the most well-implemented game mechanics of all time. LiS: Before the Storm was a less mind-blowing, but still very well-written and more traditional choice-based prequel in the Telltale vein, with some great character moments. In some way, I guess I was hoping that LiS2 would continue the story about these characters, and thus I held off playing this longer than I should have. Because this is a gem in its own right.

And at first, LiS2 seemed like a less interesting version of Before the Storm, where we had even less of a central game mechanic, instead being delegated to influencing our younger brother into doing what we as the player wanted. However, what I thought would be the games main weakness, ended up being one of it's biggest strengths. Because what LiS2 lacks when it comes to a cool game mechanic, it more than makes up for with its story and writing.

The writing for LiS2 tones down the more out there aspects of the original, and instead opts for one of the more poignant and heartfelt coming-of-age/roadtrip stories I've ever played. The dynamic between Sean and Daniel is constantly changing, and we the player are torn between the urge to see Sean have fun, fall in love, make new friends, and the need for him to be a good brother. The two are hard to combine, and you will inevitably fail in some way. In the end, our actions actually feel like they have some real impact, and that is why LiS2 shines and stands out above most other games in the same genre.

LiS2 isn't quite as impactful as the original, but this is a sequel that stands on its own legs and does something different, while still retaining the things that made the previous games special: the moody, melancholic graphics, on-point indie soundtrack and great voice acting."
3569,"All endings are so bad, they ruin the whole game."
3570,i miss max & chloe :(
3571,"Well I don't know what to say for this game. I want to recommend it but I cant, I didn't like it as much as I hoped to. From a person who loved the first game it didn't really stand out. It had a weird and iffy story line and honestly felt forced, just like it didn't need to be there.

As far and episode 4 goes, it was trash. all the sudden out of the blue Daniel joins a cult that he doesn't no that he is stuck in and Sean's mother rocks up out of the blue to help. It just all felt forced and not needed and with episode 3 at the pot farm in the middle of know where. I feel that's why the story line felt boring and forced.

I loved Life is strange 1, I think that it is one of the best games there is. It had a amazing story line that flowed, it excited you, frilled you at the cliff hanger. But this game didn't do that it felt not needed, It didn't excite me as much and it felt boring.

Another factor of this game is the sound track, and did have and alright sound track, but some parts of the story didn't really match the mood of the story. But still it the sound track is alright.

Don't get me wrong though, it had amazing action scenes and don't even get me started on how good the ending was on this story was but half of it wasn't needed. I think that I could recommend it but I just can't. maybe I had my expectations to high for this game, but it was just alright.

5/10"
3572,"what I expected: good story plot like every lis game. 
but there's an unnecessary death that i really really am sad about :("
3573,"I thought i'd miss Chloe and Max and this would be just another cliché teenager story... But it went way further than what I thought. This story teaches you valuable life lessons about different social values. I loved it since the beginning to the end, from the increbidle well done character development and adaptation to different environments considering their past to the astonishing visual scenarios and I can't even describe how magical and harmonious the soundtrack is... Definitely one of my favorite games ever together with all the Life is Strange series.

Also for the lis1 players it HAS FUCKGIN ARCADIA BAY REFERENCES!!!!"
3574,It's like watching a movie but you won't fall asleep cause you need to constantly press buttons.
3575,so good so sad cry
3576,best!
3577,"Very enjoyable, emotional, story-based adventure game. Starts off slow, so slow that I was literally yawning, then suddenly it improved and got interesting.

Compared to the original Life is Strange, there is less of everything. Story, choice, plot complexity, enjoyment, everything is less. However the original game was so good that there's still enough left over to make a great game."
3578,The story is engaging
3579,......
3580,"A good game with major flaws that undermine its potential greatness. The graphics and art direction are simply outstanding, as is the soundtrack. Some characters are very well characterized while others are less. The story bravely tackles current (today perhaps more than two years ago) and difficult topics such as intolerance, marginalization, immigration, and religious fanaticism. However, although I have loved the other life is strange and many telltale games, in this case, I have found myself repeatedly frustrated by the system of choices. Many times you have the feeling of having no control over the development of the story and it seems to move on already established tracks. At other times, you even very easily predict what will happen well in advance and you understand that there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Due to this, even your own character ends up contradicting himself with respect to what you have made him say up to then. I would recommend the purchase only to those who love this genre of games."
3581,"This game is 2 interesting, but have 1 great problem - its freaking Daniel. 
srsly man im dont 5king kidding. this boy a huge pain in the ass, shark in your boots. 
all game it is based on ""Daniel want something -> you do this OR you WONT do, but you MUST do this.""
this blsht makes me mad. Game 9\10. Daniel 0\over99999999.
"
3582,one of my favorite game of all. loved the first one and BTS. really looking forward to seeing a third game in the future!
3583,"""Your choices have consequences and a strong impact on the story""

Daniel: ""Can we keep the dog?""
Me: ""No""
Consequence: We kept the Dog

Daniel: ""Can we call it mushroom?""
Me:""No""
Consequence: We named the dog mushroom

Conclusion: Really felt the impact I had on the Story."
3584,yes
3585,"Despite sharing the same name and similar logo, Life is Strange 2 is very different compared to Life is Strange. For me, one of the uniqueness of LiS is that we play as a character with powers, in a choices-matter game. Here, the one with powers is the brother of our character. Because of that, I think this game is more comparable to LiS' prequel, Before the Storm, since Chloe has no powers as well. There are almost no connections between the 3 games, with the exception of a single LiS character making an appearance and some references throughout.

The game's story revolves around Sean and Daniel Diaz, two brothers on the run after killing a cop by accident. Unlike the previous titles, the game doesn't take place in a single area in a small timeframe, but around various places in a long timeframe. Therefore, every episode has a unique setting and a different cast of characters. While this may sound cool, I'm not really a fan of this, because you will meet many interesting characters, and never see them again. Realistic, yes, but it's painful, and now we have the Internet to easily exchange information to reconnect with them again.

The game may start out slow, but it gets really interesting in the middle. Episodes 3 and 4 (the drug farm and cult church) are my favorites, the stories get really interesting there and you meet some decent friends and foes. Sadly, this game lacks the ""surreal scenes"" present in the later episodes of LiS, which are really cool in my opinion and sets the game apart from other choices-matter games.

The main mechanic in this game is morality, where your actions could positively or negatively impact your brother's morality, which will make him became nice or ruthless, and obedient or ignorant. While I think LiS is a lot better with a tighter story and more interesting gameplay, I think LiS 2 is still a pretty decent choices-matter game."
3586,"im not even gonna waste my time writing about this one. not gonna lie, it had a great premise, then just straight up turned into crap. tbh you'd all be better off starin into space for 10 yrs than to play this god awful game. save yo selves yo moneys"
3587,"One of my favorite video games!!!!!
"
3588,Amazing game great story worth it for 5$
3589,Very Good Game.
3590,"The only thing in common with the first Life is Strange is the art style and great music.
The game is quite political, and if you are the other 50% of the population that is Republican you will find your personal views jabbed at by this game. The villains of the game are your racist for no reason ""Evil Trump Supporters"" who say stupid things to inaccurately portray the right wing. It seems like nowadays everything is trying to shove political garbage down the throats of viewers and it's sad to see such a great game series do this, I have no issue with anyone's political views but ffs keep that shit out of a product you are trying to sell to more than the 50% of the population that shares your views.
(SPOILERS): [spoiler] In addition to being a political game, the choices really don't feel important. Every decision you make to tell Daniel not to show his powers or something stupid results in him doing exactly what the other option does, which is sharing his powers or doing something stupid, and getting you in deeper shit. I understand the argument that he is a little kid, but when the secondary character keeps messing things up because your choices don't matter in a ""Choices Matter"" game it becomes frustrating.[/spoiler]
Summary: I really wouldn't recommend this game unless it is super cheap on sale. This is not a ""Life is Strange 2"" but rather a different game with the same graphics."
3591,"So disappointed with this game. After great LiS1 I really hoped for similar experiance, but I can't even force myself to play a second longer... Your choices are completely worthless, all you do is try to save your little brother from his own stupidity and complete lack of brain or do errands, like cleaning, cooking, shopping, just to end up in some shitty situation because of your brother who never listens to you. 

So, you have two choices (LiS2 style):
-Don't buy the game*
-Don't buy the game*

*This action will (not) have consequences."
3592,"Great game with interesting characters, great soundtrack and unique locations, though it is a different structure from LIS 1 and bts, its still an awesome addition to the franchise and is a must play for any LIS fan."
3593,Great Story Game
3594,very story based and not action packed very often. A game to vibe chill to!
3595,"Tons of feels, have a box of tissues ready..."
3596,"Honestly, it's a MASTERPIECE. I played it just now, in 2020. Never heard anything extra positive (everybody keeps talking about Max and Chloe)... but come one! This one is SO real. This story could've happened in real life. It's all about human relationships, problems, fears and hopes. I felt every single line (made a walkthrough videos with cam on and there are 100+ times when I was so synced with the character that we spoke the same line same time)!!! It's AMAZING. Really need more games like this one."
3597,Game is good but i did not like danieal at all he was my least favorite chactour but would reccomed playing but he is very selfish
3598,"Fantastic story, you grow extremely attached to the characters - it's like watching a TV show, but you get to explore and make your own decisions. The game does not require any prior knowledge of the series AT ALL for the story to make sense. The multitude of endings and choices make it quite re-playable, if you are into that sort of thing. And if you are planning on playing this, I would highly recommend playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, as it adds some cool backstory and cohesion to a part of the story that I really enjoyed (I would suggest playing it before going far into the main game as it adds a bit more impact to one of the scenes). Fantastic game, BUT if you like a faster pace and lots of freedom to explore this game is NOT for you. IF you do enjoy an emotional story (and especially if you have siblings) this is a 9/10 from me!"
3599,"Doesn't matter what choices you take the story doesn't change so much neither the personality of the characters in this game. You just follow the story and to be honest is not a good story, it's really slow and exaggerate with the drama"
