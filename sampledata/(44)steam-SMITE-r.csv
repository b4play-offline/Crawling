The community is the most cancerous people I have ever met. Do not ever install this game. Go outside and get fresh air. Sit and stare at a wall. It will provide you more enjoyment than you would ever receive from this game."
1,"it isn't the worst, i wish it got more attention."
2,no
3,I LOVE SMOKING CRACK
4,Been playing since the game was in Beta. One of my favorite games!
5,"stick with it, its hard to get back into"
6,do not play this
7,Its trash and toxic!
8,"Jogo bom, constantes atualizações."
9,smite > league of legends

13,Mostly balanced MOBA with a fun interface and easy to understand strategies. Overall hours of fun
14,my fave <3
15,"I write this review after coming back to the game after about a month and a half away, playing a single game, and uninstalling. This game is fun, but only for certain people, I am not one of those people anymore. If you can download a game, and listen to the shittiest, most toxic, sad excuses for people and still enjoy yourself, play this game. If you want to install a game, and turn off every single form of team communication you can, you can enjoy this game. I have been a part of several toxic communities over my sixteen-ish years of gaming and this one, I can say, is the fucking WORST. I had more fun playing League of Legends then I had playing this game in recent memory. I had more fun playing R6S during the height of it's toxicity issue, then I have playing this game in recent memory, and that is saying something because that place was like a fucking prison. Every match you picked the biggest guy in game, ran his shit, or you were the bottom the whole game. I digress, for the people who skimmed, unless you wanna be treated like absolute trash while learning or relearning this game(if you are returning) turn off the chat, or just don't even install."
16,"I have played Smite since 2013, it is a fun and interesting Free MOBA that will always be enjoyable!"
17,this game is trash both dota and league are better options for a moba. but am i gonna turn my brain off and mindlessly play this terrible game for another thousand hours? probably
18,"Frolicking, free, fantastic, friend filled fun.

Just dont get carried away with in game purchases, can easily have fun for free = D"
19,Good gam much rage fuck zues 10/10
20,"league of legends gateway drug
fun tho"
21,"Pretty good, gets boring I think but is still really good!"
22,Simple and way more fun than all other games in the same out there :)
23,good game need a matchmaking fix
24,"A fun & fancy Pantheon of Ancient Gods & Goddesses? Yes! Easy to get into? No. You will have to persevere, as to end up on the winning side. Still sexy and a unique point of view-camera mode for MOBA's!"
25,dogshit dogwater game
26,"Hate to not recommend after 1400 hours, but here it is. The only concern of the developers is creating skins to make money. There are so many balance issues that have been overlooked for the entirety of my play time, it really is crazy. 

I want to love the game, but instead of adding more characters, and balancing the game, it's just constant new skins."
27,fire
28,Gay
29,this game
30,game fun
31,"trash game, buggy and broken garbage"
32,This is one of my favorite games. Do yourself a favor though and don't play it. You will become an insufferable tryhard like me.
33,Made me not want to cha cha real smooth.
34,"One of the best free games ever made. It's not for everyone, but Idk how many games I've bought over the years that collect dust or never get re-downloaded but Smite always has a place. I'd say the ranked system is pretty broken so it is definitely a game to play casually."
35,"If u are looking to go back to this game, don't. I got my account wiped after a few years of inactivity and really bothered me. It's not a great game after all, and the devs don't put any effort into it."
36,"TL;DR - Don't waste your time or money unless you have lots of online friends who also play this game or like getting trolled by 10 year olds.  

I began playing this game when it was still in beta and took a long hiatus several years ago due to the toxic atmosphere and poor matchmaking.  Fast forward about 5 or 6 years and I'm disappointed to see that it has not changed much.  I understood then, as i understand now, that this is very much a team based game.  You must depend on four other people to understand the game, pick a roll that helps the team then play that roll correctly.  So, if you do not have at least eight or so friends willing to spend countless hours forming a functioning group and possibly playing a god (or roll) you really don't like; don't bother.  If you play any form of match solo, more often than not, you will be pitted against a pre-made team who have practiced, have some sort of voice communication and are very adept at playing the game and their specific roll.  They will destroy you.  Then, you will re-queue only to find another pre-made is waiting.

If Hi-Rez or Titan Forge read this comment:  Please make separate queue's for solo and group play.  Doesn't have to be for ranked play, just for fun.  This game is entertaining but with the constant loosing (correction - being absolutely destroyed), it is not worth the time or money.  And remember, even if you don't care about the time, you do care about the money."
37,No
38,"I have played smite probably at least double what my steam profile shows. I took a multi year break but decided to try and play it again. It has been a waste of time. God forbid you have a single bad team fight at the start of a match, someone will inevitably rage quit. Well before the 10 minute mark. Even on non-conquest modes. In my last 15 matches I think I only had 3 that all 10 played through the match. The game is fun. The community is too weak minded."
39,This game is absolutely perfect if you need an excuse for wanting to put toothpicks in between your toenails and kick a wall...
40,The pain this game causes might be the worst pain in the world. But I must keep playing.
41,needs more realistic gods like the teenage mutant ninja turtles
42,"third person League of Legends, DOTA, or whatever moba. with gods. pretty good concept but play in groups. solo play sucks."
43,Yemoja
44,Best RPG ever.
45,It's Smitin' time!
46,It's ok I think
47,fun
48,"Incredible game, hours of fun with friends. Would recommend getting the god pack for infinite heros to play, but probably still possible to have all the gods you need f2p."
49,Good one!
50,Cthulu awakens
51,beautiful work of art
52,"Fun, but steep learning curve"
53,"Una mierda de juego, no se les ocurra descargarlo, yo ya no me puedo safar, me cago en mi puta estampa.

54,Dead game. shame it was good
55,Don't
56,"It’s the kind of game you’ll immediately want to replay again from the beginning.. Amazing
The hours spent playing this masterpiece were the perfect encapsulation of why videogaming is such a favourite waste of time for so many of us. 
A brilliant game in every facet of its design and execution, with not a single dull moment in the lot.
No gamer should miss out on this one.
Simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre.
Prepare for many a sleepless night. Most importantly, it also has that most elusive quality, the fun factor, in spades.
This game is so much fun to play, and does everything so well that it is totally almost impossible to put it down... 
The delivered promise of video games to stand alongside cinema and literature as works of art. It accomplishes this through extraordinary graphical and audio prowess, wrapped around a riveting story and conveyed by unsurpassed gameplay...It is, bar none, the finest game I've ever played.
It will challenge you, it will move you, and it will force you to make hard decisions. It is unbelievably immersive and tenaciously inventive. It is a game that sets the bar high for others to follow—for its art direction, narrative, and gameplay.
May very well be the best video game of all time.
The game speaks for itself, in a loud, scary voice. It says, ""I'm one of the greatest games ever. Add me to your collection and let me take over your pitiful life."" I'd listen, if I were you.
One of the most well crafted, and thoroughly developed game i have ever seen. It dazzles, it awes, and it entertains.
To put it simply, there is never a dull moment in this game. In playing the game we could hardly account for a moment when we didn't have some kind of excitement or anxiety.
It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre.
I am however completely enthralled with the game.
One of the best games ever made. Not getting this game should be a crime.
Addictive from the moment you begin.. worth the money
No other game does as many things as well as this. Game of the Year!
This game could consume you too, it could change your life. Good news on one level but even if it's bad news and all your friends and family disown you, there's still a silver lining. This game is value plus for money!
Awesome and addicting in everyway.
I'd like my life back.. please
If you're looking for a game that sucks you right into the screen, this is it.
They don’t come any better than this.
A masterpiece of game design and development. 
As a whole it is almost overwhelming in its depth, irresistible in value and certainly, unreservedly, brilliant. 
The closest thing to perfection you'll play this year. You'd be a fool to miss out.
It's a game that somehow manages to simultaneously fulfill all expectations yet finish with the player unsatisfied and craving for more.
May very well be the most beloved game of the year.
This is truly an achievement.
Nothing less than a revolution in the gaming industry that will keep gamers busy for years to come.
We laughed, we gaped, we cried, screamed, and on a few occasions, came dangerously close to wetting ourselves.
Make no mistake, This is a masterpiece, as pure a gaming experience as exists today.
hours and hours of my life already wasted and many more probably going down the drain. Thanks a lot. Great Game
What masterpiece.. a game which will be played and studied for years.
It's unreservedly brilliant.
Part of what makes this game so remarkable is it doesn't assume that all you have to do in your busy life is play this one game, and so it delivers a high-quality experience regardless of how much or how little time you're able to invest...A stunning achievement that will make you feel privileged to be a game player.
A tremendous game. Wonderfully fun and thrilling, inspiring and energizing, just a great amount of fun.
You owe it to yourself to experience this game, by far one of the most compelling games this year.
This game is like a music album that has a few tracks that you aren't particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you can't help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible.
A game that is best experienced rather than described. Simply Awesome
An impressive masterpiece of technology, refined gameplay and art design.
There’s always a hesitation in giving a perfect score since you are essentially saying that it’s perfect but as things stand now that’s exactly what this game is.. Perfect
This game isn't flawless, just like any great work of art, but that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece.
This game is a triumph, an absolute masterpiece that needs to be played by anyone with the slightest interest in gaming. 
Without a doubt, This game is a shoe-in for hordes of Game of the Year nominations.
It is the kind of game you could easily find yourself dusting off two years from now and enjoying just as thoroughly.
A modern-day masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come.
A must-play title - as much a part of videogaming as it is anything else
History in the making. It raises the bar for interactive entertainment, and then uses that bar to club all other games into submission.
Overall, This game is definitely worth a purchase. There simply isn’t a better experience to be had right now.
One of the best games ever made, and the experiences continue to amaze players throughout the whole game.
If you want to lose yourself completely in a game or need a reminder of why you enjoy gaming so much, This game is exactly what you need.
It's a beautiful game with fantastic design and writing that's a little short but delivers boatloads of action in what time you do end up playing.
Fans have waited for this one for a long time, and they won't be disappointed. 
An incredible game.
This game is the perfect example of a game that transcends its genre.
One of those games that is so good, even the credits rock.
It constantly presents you with variety, surprises, and new challenges to keep you hooked.
It's atmosphere and unique style have changed the face of the gaming industry.
A technical masterpiece with a story that reaches too far.
Hands-down, the best game I've seen in years...
An adrenaline rush in a box...Everything about this game shouts quality.
A masterpiece of epic proportions.
This is a sublimely engineered game with a simple, elegant core design and all of the rough edges ground away.
The best game ever. There will never be another like it.
It is a triumph of artistry, technology and design. It isn’t perfect, but nothing this ambitious ever is
It is, without a doubt, the best game ever. Period. It is so good for so many reasons. But most importantly, it is fun. I mean really fun.
Revel, savour and bask in the brilliance; this is a game that no gamer can afford to ignore... This is why we love gaming.
An awesome game, and exceptional fun.
It is an incredible and very addictive game; once you start playing you won't want to stop... 
A feast of atmospheric entertainment. While it might tire after a while, you'll likely get your money's worth long before that point.
This is a jaw-dropping, exhilarating game. It's the game you'll remember for years."

60,"Congratulation HiRez I thought that Dead by Daylight has the worst matchmaking ever added in game but no dbd matchmaking is god tier compared to this s**t. I mean I love to play with new players as lvl 145 vs full premade team lvl 160 masters. Yeah sure. This is the biggest mess that I ever saw. I hope this game die really quickly.
Devs don't give a f**k about anything but money.

To all new players. Please don't even try this b******t game."
61,"DO NOT PLAY THIS DUMPSTER FIRE OF A GAME. I have played it for far too long.  I love the lore and mythology baseline behind the characters and the fact it is a 1st person MOBA.  Other than that, it is dogshit. Absolute atrocious matchmaking at all levels of the game.  One game you will have a level 5 on your team who plays like a bot whilst the other team is a group of 5 plat players.  The next game you might get a plat player that plays full defense xing tian jungle and f6s 10 mins in.  Fuck this game and all it stands for I hope this game dies and hi rez lose it all. The most toxic, stupid community I have ever encountered in my life."
62,My favorite Multiplayer game since it's the only action 3rd person action Moba I like
63,"bought gems during the recent sale only to get permanently banned for 'suspicious activity' and have all subsequent tickets ignored. without a doubt one of the best games i've played, with one of the worst companies managing it.

doesn't help their case that my account was created back in 2014 and had an active purchasing history throughout my time playing, so i'm really glad to have lost all my progress and an account with 600+ skins for ZERO reason"
64,what happened.
65,Good game
66,played many days - do it
67,"Very fun, I have 1000 hours across both console and pc, I love this game and the concept of gods v gods
"
68,"this game can be really fun when you play with friends, but sometimes the matchmaking is questionable."
69,"Can be a complicated game, but is such a fun game to explore all sorts random stuff you can have fun with. More fun with friends for sure, but I've lasted about 800 hours sans any"
70,This game is worse than drugs
71,i love this game its like chess on drugs
72,Awesome game!!!
73,"Game mode: Arena 

very fun way to play 3rd person hero select and as always fun with friends.

Friends: recommended"
74,"Played the hell out of it, most fun MOBA I've played, which includes the ability to give you self loathing and anger problems.  10/10 would recommend."

97,"You like to be ignored by devs? Blamed for the terrible coding? Enjoy being a victim of poor balance? Enjoy getting penalites for ""abandoning"" even tho you can't control this buggy mess of a game and its frequent crashes? Enjoy being flamed by a full partied team because you made 1 misplay? Enjoy getting called the most racially abusive slurs that are typed out with letters and numbers and people getting away with it because no one actually bothers with the reports and its an automated system? Enjoy people trolling in vital roles because they didn't get the role that they desire, proceed to feed and spam surrender for a 40 minute game? Enjoy massively outplaying your lane opponent but getting punished for playing properly because the game was made slow and boring with the 9.5 update?

Look no further, smite has it all"
98,"Smite is a MOBA unlike any other! Fight as a god, alongside gods, against other gods! Slay beasts to gain an edge in the battle, land the finishing blow on a titan to secure victory! I've been playing Smite for years. The learning curve is mild. It can seem intimidating with all the cool items. awesome gods, and fun game modes, but Smite makes learning the ropes easy and fun. The community is also quite helpful with tons of guides and builds online and on YouTube making the next step in your conquest for glory so much easier. A game that has a role/mode for every playstyle. Did I mention it's free?"
