0,Refer back to my comment on Portal 1.
1,Originally played via console. Game is a ton of fun with a partner in co-op. Single player story is also a textbook example of how to build upon a previous game's tool set while also adding some experimentation. Most of the characters are memorable.

15,game was very good
16,Great game to play alone or with a friend and the puzzles are really intelligent.
17,"words cannot describe how much i love this game. from the story, to the graphics, to the environments, this game is amazing. every single level in this game is a 10/10 for me. would recommend any day."
18,game good
19,yes play
20,"Who hasn't played thousands of hours of portal? It's one of many reasons I built a PC. If by some miracle you haven't played this game, I highly suggest that you do asap!"
21,This is AMAZING. Really fun
22,i love glados

29,goood game
30,"This game contains 4 areas and the third one is really really dark. Even with the maximum possible brightness.
Other than that, this is quite a good game. Do definitely play Portal 1 first if you haven't already"
31,This game is so good its a crime that Valve hasn't made a sequel.
32,"A worthy component as GOAT, being an overall improvement over the prequel.
Amazing character dialogue and visuals, and more fun puzzles and mechanics.
Fun co-op as well."
33,"Still a classic. I seem to be getting faster at it too. I've only played it a couple times over the past decade, surprisingly I finished it at 6 hours. Short and sweet though, the game is basically perfect - if a bit too easy at times.

I wish I could play through that co-op campaign though. Too much anxiety/nervousness. Oh well, I'm sure it's just as good as the single-player campaign.

10/10 would play again."

36,"Very good game, You can play with your friend. This game so fun! Recommended for you want to play with your friend"
37,E.
38,"What more is there to say about Portal 2 that hasn't already been said. It's perfect, there I said it. Taking everything its predecessor presented and upgrading it in every way, the puzzles, soundtrack, level design, and overall retro/ apocalyptic vibe the game presents makes it superior to the first game in every way (not at all meant to knock Portal, as I love that game too.)

The lovably moronic Wheatley, the maniacal yet sensitive Glad0s, and the character that is Cave Johnson are characters that have stuck with me for years. Still, to this day, I find myself quoting: ""I don't want your damn lemons!,"" to confused friends and family members, much to my enjoyment.

I genuinely have nothing bad to say about this game except I hope to have the privilege to live long enough to see Valve finally come to their senses and make a third one. Its been 11 fucking years! Learn to count to 3 already!!!

Genuinely, not only one of my favorite games of all time, but one of the best games I've ever played. Which is why I have no qualms in giving this masterpiece a:

10/10

61,Ti is fun
62,"Portal 2 builds on the foundation that Portal already set.
The same basic principle is reused: get to end of place using portals or objects
but it is way more than that.

Portal 2 has amazing storytelling and intrinsic feeling level designs.
The coop mode is also really cool, its basically just a whole ’nother game baked in.
This is a MUST-HAVE game to have in your steam library"
63,"Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
to kill me twice?


Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice


You want your freedom?
Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
but
Now I only want you gone


She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too


One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
will never happen to you


You've got your
short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone


Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad


Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad


Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone (×3)"
64,"After the wonderful Portal (1) I wasn't disappointed.
Although Portal² has a tutorial,
I recommend playing the first Portal game before this one."
65,veri gud would reccomend
66,Portal 2 is a very intense interactive game that I will admit had me down right confused at times (In a good way) But overall the story is amazing and so is the rest of the game. Good puzzles and good job!
67,"gods gift to mankind, also puzzles
"
68,It is Portal 2
69,"very fun, not much to do once you finish the story."

82,"Wow, i absolutely loved this game! This was my first play through of this game ever and it was well worth it. If you have not played this before please don't wait any longer."
83,funny
84,I can't explain how good this game is
85,"Hands down one of the best games I've ever played, in my top 3 of all time at least. Its got story, its got humour, its got atmosphere, its got puzzles and a little action. Its only crime is being so good that knowing there will probably never be a Portal 3 actually causes emotional pain."

99,"An amazing game. I remember in 2017 that I got this game for my Xbox 360 and I had an amazing time playing by myself and with my father in co-op. I lost the game 7 months later. I paid for it and played it yesterday as of writing this. An instant nostalgia blast. I felt like I was 9 again. I miss those times with my father. Overall though, it's an amazing game. Thank you Valve."

113,SOOO GOOD
114,This game is the reason why I want to have Valve back as a successful game developer! It has everything to let you entertain the whole time while in-game - alone or in coop! 🙂
115,"If you don't like puzzles and comedy, i dont know why your here."

126,10/10

129,good game except for the part where he kills you
130,:)
131,Just best game ever made. I feel bad for playing this game only now
132,fun
133,This is a great  strategy game that challenges any player disregarding their skill level. Portal maintains a great story line with the mysterious abandoned science laboratory and the test subjects in cryogenic storage. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves a good puzzle.
134,"If you are breathing or not in the space, you should definitely play it!"
135,Great game. A classic
136,really fun and creative game
137,no
138,valve i want portal 3
139,"Portal 2 is for many a straight up upgrade from the fist game, which is already an amazing title. Many things that lacked in the original are now masterfully inserted into the experience, like a fantastic story, marvellously written characters, lore, way more gameplay features and length as well as updated graphics and how to forget the co-op mode. But for me this game falls short of its predecesor, simply because in this one the atmosphere of lonelyness and discomfort are gone and it feels more like a normal game, a really good one, but not an experience that I will remember all of my life like the first. However, even though I think the first one is better, for many people this game will clearly be the best of the two, and the co-op mode is an spectacularly funny experience with your friends. A must play for sure, even moreso if you have friends who play."
140,Came back to it when I got the deck. Time to play the mods.
141,portal
142,GG
143,"Really, it's just a lot of fun.  Plenty of jumping around, danger, and puzzles."
144,"Having just beaten the base game i can safely say that this is my favourite game... ever, comparing it to the first game the comedy has been massively improved, the puzzles however have not, some of them felt like they dragged on for too long, the best puzzles hit me with a eureka moment right before i started to get frustrated. the climax of the game was the best part in my opinion 

10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes comedy or puzzles in games... and most people who don't like them"
145,It was fun
146,"it aged well and for its age and price, it's amazing."
147,"Played it in coop only so far
Game is okay, if you want to kill some time with your buddy, but that's it"

165,fun game :)
166,Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games in my opinion
167,Very good graphics and they fixed a lot of bugs. I have a pretty bad pc and I still get a solid 75 fps.
168,"Fantastic puzzle game, and the workshop content is fucking amazing."
169,The best story driven puzzle game of all time. Portal 1 was amazing and this game managed to out do it.
170,Great
171,glados 2
172,Nne of the best co-op experiences!
173,I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS FOR forty hours AND CAN SAFELY SAY THIS IS THE ....... GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
174,"As a sequel that is both improved and enhanced every aspect of the previous game, Portal 2 is a unique, quirky and remarkable game that has everything from a solid community still developing new stuff for the game and allowing even a co-op partner to get in with the fun. A must-have."
175,game!
176,God I love this game.
177,"imagine if you have the dumbest person in the world and a funny person playing this, then mad gaming 10/10 wouldnt recomend if you are unfunny"
178,i fucking hate simon cowell.

180,"one of my favorite games very fun co-op game

181,Truly one of the most interesting game mechanic of all time.
182,"Fun game, good story"
183,10/10 what did you expect?
184,"I first played this on my PS3 in 2021 and ever only heard about the Portal franchise but when I first played it I was amazed at the graphics because I knew it was a pretty old game. It story is really awesome and characters are just loveable. After that, I wanted to experience it on my PC aswell and it was just as awesome. Now I can also play some amazing mods! Overall love the game :D"
185,"I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone"
186,I BROKE THE LAWS OF PHICYICES
187,"I loved this game because it was longer than the original Portal, and had more of a storyline. This game was visually amazing for its time, and all i can say is that i am impressed."
188,The fact that I had this in my library for months without playing is a crime. Like what the fuck is wrong with me. Literally everything about this game from start to finish was amazing.
189,"Portal 2 is a perfect sequel to the first game. Introducing new puzzles to solve, mechanics to use and reveals a ton more about the story and characters! It also gives the character of GLaDOS and a new character, Wheatley so much depth. It's a game definitely worth picking up after finishing the first."
190,e
191,"this game slaps 
ive played it before on other platforms so my hours on it are prolly somehwere in the 500s

Go in blind for this game, don't watch any playthroughs, (unless that's your thing, then go for it) go in blind, it is 10X more fun like this!

Thank you!

220,"I couldn’t suggest this game enough! One of the best games of all time. I have beaten this game at lest four times so far and every time gets better. Portal 2 expands on everything that the first game puts down turns it to 100, the puzzles are legitimately well made and challenging the characters are expanded and fleshed out, the music is improved and gives a different feeling, where the first game’s music feels lonely and depressing the second games music gives more of a industrial feeling and I absolutely love it. The graphics for coming out in 2011 beat even the graphics in some games that have been released nowadays, and also the set peace’s in portal 2 are so grand and beautiful, when I look at some of the set peace’s I just aw at it’s greatness. So anyways I could gush about this game forever but I’ll spare you from that so anyways buy the game, do it, do it now"

251,"Valve, make a Portal 3 before Ellen McLain bites the dust"
252,"Great game, Test chambers/puzzles are set up so you g=have to think, but feel smart at the end. Plot twists, for all audiences. 5 star review. Even CoOp tests! Built-in Community Test chambers. You can even build your own. CoOp, and Single Player Community Maps! 10 Chapters in Single Player; 10 being the credits. Made before 2015, and looks better then games made in 2019! Amazing storyline! Portal (1) is also a great game. I got Portal 2 first, but if you're interested in the story, then definetly consider getting Portel 1 first."
253,sometimes i wish i could clear my memory of the portal storyline and play it again. it’s that good.
254,A beautiful game. I have enjoyed playing multiple times.

259,"lots of fun, makes you think a lot"
260,"Just as good as the first.
Buy it!"
261,"This game is by far is one of my top 5 all-time favorite games. There is obviously so much time that was put into this and more puzzles to do. The story line is awesome as well. I never thought a game like this would be so awesome and so entertaining at the same time. In my opinion, you should get Portal 1 and beat it so you know the full story and what is going on. (Also a good game) But Portal 2 just has so much more added to it and it just makes this game so much better. The only ""downside"" is that there is not a Portal 3. I wish there was because I'd buy that in an instant. And I'm sure that it would be awesome as well. If you are new and checking out this game, I highly recommend getting this and any other Portal game made by Valve."
262,"classic game. had to buy it again on steam. logged tons of hours on xbox back when it came out. 
challenging puzzles, cool lore, cool vibes, good humor, cool celeb voice cast, innovative puzzles, frustrating puzzles, ""oh jeez it was that easy the whole time?"" puzzles, space space space, the cake is a lie"
263,"AMAZING GAME. The story, gameplay, puzzle solving, and everything else in the game is perfect! With user created levels it gets even better. The game have fun story, Awesome gameplay, and the puzzles are perfect. Here are some things you can do in the game: You can place 2 portals, orange and blue and go through them, you can also throw objects through portals, such as gel. there are 3 diferent types of gel, Blue, Orange, and White, White gel allows you to place portals on it, Orange gel allows you to go fast when walking on it, and blue launches you into the air. There is also water which removes gel. There is also turrets that will shoot you if you go into their line of sight, which makes for some challenging gameplay. Co-op is fun due to two players being able to work together (or sabotaging eachother). Overall, I definetly recomend buying this game. 100% worth the money."
264,"This game is really fun, but I do highly recommend that you play the original Portal before you play this."

286,Good fun. Easy at first and difficult to master! Great for all portal fans alike!
287,"bro I did one playthrough of portal 2 and IMO it was quite possibly the most BORING GAME OF ALL TIME LMAO. When I first got it I didn't know what the game was about. All I knew was there was a big community for the game and everybody liked it. I had no clue what to expect from the game mechanics. All I knew was there's portals and you gotta do stuff with portals. So when I came to realize that it's a puzzle game like 1 quarter of the way through, I was like, ""Bruh, I've just spent money on a puzzle game. Welp, maybe the puzzles will be fun?"" Spoiler alert, THEY WERE NOT FUN. Maybe I'm just dumb but for ALMOST EVERY PUZZLE I had to search up a youtube video on how to complete the puzzle and move on. After I finished the game I wasn't satisfied at all, I just felt dumb and sad that I spent my time and money into the game. 0/10. I could watch two kangaroos fighting on the internet for free and get way more entertainment than from playing a fully developed game that many people consider to be legendary status. Then again, I like games with explosions and epic cutscenes so it's kinda my fault I didn't look further into the game besides the reviews. But the fact that the game is so highly rated is just mind boggling to me. Like am I the only person that didn't like the game? Idk. But that's my take on portal 2. Maybe the first portal was more action-packed? Idk and honestly I doubt it was so I can't be asked to check."
288,Best physics game ever
289,"+better story than portal 1

308,"A perfect sequel. Portal 2 expands the core gameplay that made its predecessor so beloved with new mechanics that add more depth to puzzles (the different gels are particularly interesting), adds a meaningful follow up plot and takes the time to immerse you in its word. I think the most impressive thing about portal 2 is how excellently it paces itself; puzzle room gauntlets are interspersed with big setpieces as well as more subdued exploration sections that progress the plot and build up the world. The first game was a concise series of interesting puzzles with some great writing as decoration. Portal 2 is a gripping plot with hilarious writing and uses the creative puzzle solving as decoration. The co-op mode is a completely distinct campaign with its own story and a further expansion of the mechanics, while somehow never being too convoluted or obtuse. It's everything a co-op campaign should be."

311,"The highest rated game on steam for a very good reason.

Seriously there is literally no reason not to get this game, it is a classic.

The first portal is already extremely good and this is just that but longer and better, what is there not to like?

The Co-op mode alone makes this game worth it, and that is not even counting the top-shelf campaign and all of the available workshop maps that people have put their time and effort into (especially the ones made in hammer editor and not the baked in level designer).

Valve, please make Portal 3... 

There isn't much else to say... The game is like Half-Life 2 in this regard... You just kind of need to have it as its just a big part of gaming as a whole. And a game like this will always be good regardless of the time period, you can just feel all the effort and soul put into it. A fantastic game. That's all there is to say.

Absolutely recommended."
312,great game
313,go and try portal reloaded

362,"One of if not the best game ever made.

The original Portal was already a great game, but Portal 2 improves in basically every aspect.
The puzzles are more refined, more type of puzzles are added and each and every room is designed extremely well.
The story is more pronounced, but also not forced upon the player. If someone just wants to rush through the levels, you can, but you can also explore some levels for clues/easter eggs.
The music is phenomenal.
The voice acting is top notch.

Then there's also the coop mode, which just gives the whole game a new dimension.

Cannot recommend this game enough.
Also it's pretty cheap now, even cheaper with discounts."
363,the game is v good and the grafics im in love
364,"Love both Portal 1 and 2, I replayed them a lot of times.
Hope Portal 3 will be possible after all those years but at the end of the day it's up to Valve.

The Portal Series and the mods from the community are masterpieces."
365,In this game I often find myself in the situation of been helpless dumb. This is what makes the game such a nice experience and the End is killing it!

Edit: Lore Guide: THX1138, TF2 engineer is like Cave Johnson, Information Processing by Marilyn Bohl. Carolyn's book is warning us that it's really (c) 1944 Heinrich Himmler, not 1980 IBM! (With the small exception of a picture of a mircroprocessor die w/ wire bonds!)"
397,Incredibly funny and so fun to play. One of my favs.
398,i should show this game to my physics teacher 😂
399,"this is the third time i've purchased this game. first on xbox in 2012 when it came out. got it from the eb games (now gamestop) at fairview mall in toronto. played tf out of it, so much so that it felt like i had to pee all the time. totally psychological from the feeling of irritation of not being able to figure out the test chambers. true story; why would i make that up? i missed a few days of middle school. watched one of the hunger games movies in theatres and had to leave to pee like 5 times. the day before it happened i went to canada's wonderland and rode the leviathan for the first time. good times. i actually have to pee right now while i'm writing this review, but don't worry it's legit. i got portal 2 again for ps3 in 2021 for the trophies and to enjoy the game for the first time again after a few years of not really playing it. i've since trophy and achievement hunted it on both 360 and ps3. i did briefly play co-op on my ps3 in 2017 but it was my cousins copy of the game. i have now completed the story and achievement hunted from memory along the way on steam. only one i missed was pturretdactyl but i went back into challenge mode and got it after my game crashed after i beat the game. so would i recommend portal 2? absolutely. it's an 11/10. it's got some of the best writing, story, gameplay, atmosphere and environments of any videogame ever made. plus it's a dope puzzle game that gets you thinking... with portals. there's no cake though. and you never got to meet ratman. but it's okay. look, just don't pee if you feel like you need to but you don't actually have to."

after nine years in development
hopefully, it will have been worth the wait."
407,"In my own opinion, this is the best singleplayer game valve has and will ever make."
408,"This game combined my two least favourite things; puzzles and cutscenes. I usually tend to stay away from linear games, and i hardly ever play puzzle games (mainly because im bad at solving puzzles) but this game took the two things i hate most in games and created a masterpiece. you've heard it a million times before but this truly is an incredible game, and i think everyone should play it at least once. it was funny, it was heartwarming and it was beautiful. amazing game completely worth it."

Single player was good, though I played it awhile ago before writing this review so you'll have to look for another review with more information on the single player side of things. 

Overall, 4.99/5.00.

538,"While the puzzles of this game are easier than the first, the amount of new mechanics combined with the (decently challenging) co-op campaign and the ability to make your own levels makes it a great game.  After all, not as good portal is still portal."

Features amazing puzzles, humor, level design, I can continue on reciting on and on...
Only because I've spoiled the entire single player campaign, I haven't completed it, but me and my friend have done every single co-op course twice, I would say co-op is even better than single player.
Definitely recommended, especially if you have a friend to play with!"

611,Good first time
612,"Never had a more welcome sequel in my collection. As classically good as the original was, 
Portal 2 is four times better. More or less. I don't have the psychological rating figures
 in front of me at the moment. 

Though I have always had one complaint. If anything cried out for a small retcon it's this: 
[spoiler]the ending would have been that much sweeter if the first thing Chell
 sees as she exits the facility is a startled deer skipping off into the distance.[/spoiler] 
Missed sight-gag opportunity. But other than that: perfection."
613,i like it when i have s*x with metal ball 😁👍 s*x with moran is great also where the caves🤨🤨🤨johnson sed he has caves and burning lemons 🤨🤨🤨

You start from a simple blame bed room ,to the end, at the main brains of the studio and fighting with your ones enemy and try to kill your ones friend. The puzzle are Mmmmm.. (chef kiss) MUST BUY!

Chapter 4 now and Im really having a blast, had to cheat once because I was getting impatient and thought I only needed to find a specific white wall to portal... I was wrong and was humbled.

I can recommend this game to anyone. Its timeless and deserves the top spot on steam."
625,Fun
626,portal game is fun but hard in some parts cant wait to have portals irl
627,One of the most well crafted games that I have ever played.  Valve clearly knew what they were doing when they created this game.

633,"Such a timeless design. A masterpiece! 

Portal has many things to offer, great story, great gameplay, great mechanics. Even on 2022, this still feels such a good game, and what makes it even more great is that community is still working on those player created maps. Its amazing that there is still active community around this game."

636,much fun many psychopaths
637,just amazing

639,"A great single player campaign, with enticing musical score, jam-packed to the brim levels and the story just sucks you in. When I first heard GLADOS speak, I literally was soo thrilled. 9/10 Would Play Again :D"
640,Pretty cool game.
641,cool
642,i mean.. it's portal 2? It's great.
643,gg
644,"A beautiful game in all aspects. Great story, great design and it even has a great co-op mode. It's a wonderful continuation of the first game and I recommend getting it if you liked the first one.

Another good thing about it is the addition of new features to make it difficult for those who are used to the mechanics of the first one. 

10/10 game"
645,"Not as good as the first one in my opinion, but still a great game. It is much more story focused, and the puzzles are a bit more strict so you can't cheese them as easy. There are parts here that are just hard invisible walls and such which I never ran into in the original. The story is super intriguing though, and I love all the twists it took."
646,"Love it, best game there is!!"
647,good. buy

In fact, buying Portal 2, the player gets two games. Since playing in co-op with a friend is not just entertainment for a few minutes, or repetition of the plot - but for two. No - this is a completely separate story in which puzzles move to another level of complexity.
In case they seemed simple to you, I advise you to contact the workshops for custom tasks.
The game itself has undergone minor changes in graphic terms. The game has become much more dynamic and difficult, which was facilitated by the destruction of the laboratory in the first game. Thanks to Whitley, we will be able to learn a lot of the secrets of the Research Institute that the players have been guessing about.
The game is recommended for the acquisition and joint passage of both storylines."
650,Great game
651,"I got stuck in a portal, Very epic."

660,loved it
661,"The best game ive played in a while I heard it was a really good game and going in I played the first it was good but I wouldn't say my favorite the opening of this game had me smiling all the way through.  This game is so good I see why it gets as much praise as it does and it don't deserve's it.... IT DESERVES MORE. The game play, story, comedy, characters. Wheatley (or Harold) as my friend calls it has to be the best twist villain ive seen in a game. Not because it came out of no where, I called it from the start its predictable enough where I could see it happening but I wasn't to sure and also I hate seeing him become the bad guy. It works because it makes you care about him and that is one of the strongest parts of the game and I am SO GLAD I CAME IN COMPLETELY BLIND. This game is a masterpiece I would give everything up to play it again Mia if your reading this I am starting the clock waiting for multiplayer 10/10

I also remember really liking the new turret variants they added to the game.

726,the best puzzel game ever made if you enjoy puzzel games this is a must try
727,"Valve has done an incredibly good job world building for this game with little details that stick in the back of your mind where it comes in handy till the very end. The lore is also consistent within itself and other sources allowing a larger image to occur in our minds.  Even though the maps are massive they only follow the paths the player needs to walk, hinting in the correct direction to travel, sometimes its obvious and others we only subconsciously follow them. The puzzles themselves are rather challenging and often take time to step back and think allowing for a larger sense of achievement when you complete them.

Overall the game is highly enjoyable and I recommend playing till the very end.

the first portal game was good and revolutionary at the time but portal 2 is an incredible experience. The story is engaging, and the voice actors were incredible and put on amazing act, the graphics still hold up despite this game being made in 2011, this is one of the few games that doesn't have forced humor and it's consistently funny. The puzzles really make you use your head and when you beat the test chamber, you get this big feeling of accomplishment, the secret achievements were fun to find, the ending was so good, that you're upset that its over. 
I would recommend this game to everyone it's one of the best gaming experiences you can ever have

875,"I would 100% recommend this game. I recommend playing Portal first though, this game has an amazing story and really good humor!"
876,"Portal 2 took an already great game, then deepened the story and expanded the gameplay. Truly a masterpiece."
877,"Amazing game.
It can be boring in places but if you manage to persevere you are rewarded with the best Bitter-Sweet ending that i know. And the game managed to do that with only 4 characters ([spoiler] Chell, Cave Johnson, GLaDOS and Wheatley [/spoiler]), And all of them feel real. And...





Goodbye Caroline <3"
878,I think
879,"It's as addictive as meth, 10/10"
880,best game of my childhood
881,Very fun game. Its just fun. I cant tell you much more
882,:D
883,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD.
"
884,cancerous rocks make cool game
885,This game doubled my robot hyper fixation!
886,the greatest game that has ever been made
887,"This is just incredible, really!"
888,men
889,love it.
890,"I love the game, had it on PS3, still holds up!"
891,Turns out I don't like puzzles that much (maybe if the game was tougher it'd be more interesting). Dialogue is cool though.
892,it is good
893,I ENJOY
894, it's a great game ive played it a couple times
895,"Felt much longer than 10 hours.
Great game."
896,10/10
897,"Not great with reviews, but if you like Stephen Merchant, this is a must play. Make sure you play portal 1 first thoug"
898,"One of my all time favourite games, worth the money and is also as good as HL2 which you should also buy if not already.

∞/10"
899,Is this a rhetorical question? Play this game...
900,amazing mechanics and amazing story
901,"This game is simply a one-of-a-kind masterpiece I've never been able to find elsewhere. I've played through this game literally over ten times despite it's gameplay consisting of puzzles that you'll be able to speedrun after solving them a couple times. It's almost too good, and almost makes me not even want a portal 3 or a successor to this game because how do you even top this?

Almost. It almost makes me not want portal 3. I still fuckin want it. I need it."
902,Horror game for ornithophobic robots 10/10
903,good
904,Still Awesome!
905,this game has some pretty funny moments that made me genuinely laugh. the plot was great and some of the puzzles threw a nice challenge in. Highly entertaining
906,It is goo
907,"If you loved the first one, you'll love this one even more! At least, that's how it was for me. If you're a fan of puzzle games, insane robots, singing robots, and combustible lemons, then this game is for you! I love how they took the first game, and then built lore onto it, and let your gradually explore it. BUT the thing is, they don't give you too much lore, so they let the fans make their own unique interpretations of how the lore of Portal and Portal 2 connect. 

P.S You don't get any cake in this one. :( 

Overall, great game: 10/10 Would play again."
908,"While long, and very difficult for low-tier gamers like me whose brain is relatable to a mushy potato, the game is very satisfying and rewarding once your brain finally hits that click moment. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to ANYONE. 1 Problem. The price is kinda high, so wait for the steam summer sale, or wait for that rain check from your grandma."
909,this game is the best game i ever played i would rate this 10/10!
910,good gaming
911,best puzzle game in game history for sure
912,i think half life is better but pretty good game
913,An excellent puzzle game with a compelling story. Props to Valve!
914,very good game :D
915,I didn't get my cake :(
916,"This game has an incredible and comedic storyline.
You can play this game for an extremely long time. (around 10-30 hours)
The characters are extremely well put together and the voice acting is phenomenal.

10/10 Would recommend."
917,"Strong storyline between friend and enemy, when suddenly they switch positions. Sometimes there are so hard puzzles, but none of them are not impossible. Little bit timing, thinking and investigating solved all tasks."
918,"this game is so good i don't even know what to say about it. Even the fact that I'm giving a review says something. so many plot twists i didn't expect, especially since i didn't expect a plot in the first place. great job on the game"
919,fun
920,good!

"
931,"i love this game because of fun it is 
"
932,I like faster paced games but this was pretty fun 7.5/10
933,One of the greatest games I have ever played. Absolutely worth the $10.
934,"its good, but if you  play with someone else make sure they are smart as fuck cause losing braincells may be fun, it gets hectic after a while"
935,i have not played the game in years so i bought it again to relive my young self and i forgot how fun it was 10/10
936,"Good game, i liked using a few brain cells (the ones i have left). 10/10 5 stars poggers game"
937,portals go brrr
938,literally perfect game 12/10 like how is this possible
939,fereaking sweet
940,the best story ever a little slow at the start but when u ge tto it u will love it
941,funny lemons
942,"Great Game, Even runs On my potato pc"
943,al capone be like XD
944,Best Game Ever!!!
945,"One of the best games out there, still looks gorgeous too.
Excellent at making you feel stupid for not realising the solution to a puzzle after 10 minutes of looking for clues.

The story is fantastic, GLaDOS is a GOAT villain, Wheatley is an annoying b*stard but a lovable one.
Valve has made some of the greatest games and I wish they would make some more; sure they kind of killed any possibility of a prequel with the OG Cave Johnson arc of the campaign but I'm positive there is potential still for another Portal sequel or a half-life mashup, Gabe just needs the right motivation.

Hell I'll even take a top down Sims ripoff where you play as Chell. 10/10"
946,"I heavily enjoyed this game, 100% worth it's price tag, suprised the graphics still hold up today, but then again, it's a Valve game. My favorite part is Old Apeture. With the huge open spaces and insanely cool level design. And I love the Test Chamber Creation Iniative. And making a complex test feels awesome. One huge negative about this Test Chamber Creator though is not being able to combine tests to make a testing track without having to go in and out all over again. and just a ""Play"" feature so you don't have to click edit, wait, then play it. and it kinda sucks how limited you are and how you can't add vines, and make your test chamber look overgrown or like Old Apeture or have those ball shooting things. And sadly for the Apeture Co-op Testing Iniative you needs friends or you have to play with strangers. The ending is very satifying and nice to watch. Wheatly's final boss isn't ragingly hard. and the replayability is probally the best part about this game. And the comedy, top notch. Especially Cave Johnson's Lemons rant in Old Apeture. and the way you get the Pit Boss achievment is really funny too. Hint for Pit Boss achievment: It's after Old Apeture. But before the final boss. And involves jumping into a pit. But yeah, really fun game. Def buy. PS: Portal 3 please?"
947,man its fun im stuck but cant get mad at it its just fun
948,"What a banger of a sequel!!!.

This game takes everything good about the first one into the ultimate level

it can get tricky at times but the satisfaction after beating a hard puzzle is worth every second and with the cool mechanics and how it all connects with the Half-Life series I can confidently tell you that I didn't wast my time playing this game and you should play it.

You won't be disappointed. (But make sure you play the first one first)"
949,"I originally played the single-player on the Xbox 360, and this game still holds up as a great experience even today."
950,This game is a masterpiece. 100/10 game
951,yes
952,"I love the story, the dry humor, and the puzzles. It makes for a great game that I think all gamers should experience."
953,yes beans please
954,"One of the best games I've ever played, with enough replay value that I haven't gotten bored of speedrunning the game for 80+ hours. Singleplayer has a great storyline that builds on the first one, and co-op is a fun little addition that you can play with friends. There's a few glitches in the matrix, but they don't break the game completely and more of just allow fun tricks in it. Very fun game, would recommend buying if you haven't already."
955,Portal 2 is a amazing game and anyone with a computer should try it!

979,good
980,portal 2 is literally one of the best games <3
981,Glados insulted me now im depressed
982,A classic well worth playing.
983,its kinda the standard for good writing in video games no its true its true!
984,"This game is really fun because its like a first person shooter game but just a puzzel game and i rember playing this game on the xbox 360 just the first one
"
985,"This wasn't just a game, it was an experience. The characters are well written and the dialogue that isn't lore-based is humorous and always brings a smile to my face. If you haven't bought this game, please do. The puzzles are challenging, but rewarding. You feel like you've learned something every time a new mechanic is brought up, and the game is overall put together very well. 10/10 game."
986,"While being the more robust counterpart to Portal and it's series with how much it adds and changes, it's still grown massively as a series. The amount of love that this sequel of a gem gets alone is extremely surprising. The amount of character buildup, realizations, humor and killer level design that was put into a simple puzzle game really goes to show that Valve really cares about the games they make. While the story may be pretty simple from a regular gamer's perspective, the story is still interesting to look into and research, especially when there's unanswered questions involved that are definitely answerable with theories, in-game secrets, and more. The introduction of new gimmicks really adds to the experience overall and makes it feel expansive, rather than feeling like a game where you do puzzles while a robot is literally trying to murder you, although that is the same case for both games. Twice in this game alone. The introduction of Wheatley as a character adds so much, especially since in the end, you get to partner up with both Wheatley and GladOS, where they come up with strategies to basically artificially kill each other, while Chell is just progressing through, trying to find a way out. I won't talk about the ending in this review because the ending is actually unexpected, and proudly admits to reusing the GladOS final boss by showcasing how the game and the boss design has been heavily upgraded. Neither of the Portal games offer replayability in most cases, however even if it's a single playthrough game, it still delivers as a fantastic game, and is truly the 2.0 of Portal."
987,finally played this game for the first time in 2022 and damn is it good. It's funny and has amazing levels what more could you want? plus having J K simms himself as a voice actor made the experince even more amazing as you discover the origins and downfall of aperature science/ G.L.A.D.O.S. I hope one day valve can count to 3 to make portal the best trilagy ever made
988,Worse than the original in my opinion but still good game. Sometimes got tired of really long sections of the game though.
989,"My absolute favorite Portal game.  It has everything that I love in a game, great story (one that keeps surprising you is always a bonus) great gameplay, and original puzzles with completely upgraded parameters from the first game. I love the first portal, but this one just has so much depth to it, getting to know everyone behind aperture. I'm so glad I left that abusive A Hole who said I wouldn't like this game years ago and finally played it. I love this series so much that I wrote my own fan fiction around the origins of [spoiler] chell, and how caroline actually does rememeber chell, from when she was a human, and not Glados. [spoiler/] I have fallen in love with valve and half life and I'm on the bandwagon for a #3 of anything!"
990,very nice
991,verry good
992,I CRAPPED MY PANTS
993,there are portals and stuff pretty cool 10/10
994,I don't even have to tell you why this games amazing.
995,"I love Portal 2 it improves on the original in so many ways it adds more lore to the game linking it even further with the Half-Life series as well as it builds on its own lore by introducing Cave Johnson, and many other characters also this time you explore the lower parts of the facility not seen in the previous game which also gives you more vast and open test rooms which adds another level of complexity and variety to the puzzles this time around, hopefully this review convinces you on this purchase also why don't you own this game yet?"
996,FUN SADISTIC MURDER ROBOTS
997,GLaDOS is a CHaDOS
998,Portal is great. I don't think I have anything to say in a review that the myriads of reviewers have't already said.
999,"Honestly my favorite game the characters are memorable and the lines are iconic
10 neurotoxin emitters out of 10 would recommend."
1000,good game but unfortunately no romance options

1013,"good game

Written on my Aperture Science Review Apparatus"
1014,VERY GOOD.
1015,One must play it
1016,"I loved Portal, and i didn't mind that the second game took more of a turn on the narrative side of things. some of the puzzles are so fucking hard, that it took me 20 minutes before i gave up and looked up a guide to keep my cool. On the contrary, there were some parts that had me rolling with laughter. The ending was [i]  out of this world, [/i] and i wish i could experience it again."
1017,e
1018,"GLaDOS: I think this is where he kills us
Wheatly: Hello! This is the part where I kill you
Part 9: The part where he kills you
Achievement unlocked: The part where he kills you

Guys I think this is where he kills us"
1019,One of the greats of all time. Play Portal first for the best experience!
1020,Masterpiece that never gets old.
1021,"its a cool game, and marks the end of valve's creativity and ability to wow us with incredible original game ideas. I guess thats the way things will be now."
1022,Solving all the test chambers on your own makes you feel like a genius.
1023,"Graphics - 9/10 - Has aged REALLY well
Story 11/10
Gameplay - 10/10
Humor - 10/10

Pros
The puzzles are great
There's community levels
A top grade story
Some really good mods (Portal stories: Mel, Portal reloaded, etc)

Cons
Open areas can be confusing
Some people got motion sick

Overall

Stop reading the reviews and go buy it.
Its 100% worth it"
1024,stressful fun :)
1025,one of the best games ever made
1026,great game im addicted and im wanting more

1032,"good to play by yourself or with friends
"
1033,Pretty good ngl
1034,"Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever made. I've had so much fun with this game. I am just so sad that it hasn't received more attention, had another sequel, or been integrated with combat modes in a game. This game has so much potential but am still very happy."
1035,"fun and playable with weak PCs and labtops
"
1036,IS GUD.

1042,"the only game that has made me cry, its such a great game and i absolutely love it"
1043,Nice
1044,best game
1045,"An incredibly expansive sequel to the 2007 classic. A better narrative, more interesting characters and deeper game mechanics improve every aspect of Portal. Beyond the great single player is also a cooperative story for friends and community test chambers."
1046,The characters and the puzzles are the highlight of the game and that's majority of the game. portal two as well has multiplayer but it's not necessary to have an absolute blast falling in love with the characters.
1047,very good
1048,"9.6/10 fun game!

Pro tip: Choose your COOP teammate WISELY... 
I haven't played this game in a LONG time, but I f*cking remember when I played with Erlendsvik...
I am never going to do that mistake again...  *Wrong portal closes intensifies*"

1068,hi
1069,"I've been back and forth with getting portal and portal 2 but after about a month of research and reading reviews i finally decided that it was time to purchase these games. and i dont regret it one bit. i dont mean that i think it was a good idea to get some fun out of a new game. no. i mean that these games have just made my life better and also helped me think of the world in a different way. the jokes are fun, the problem solving is amazing and the whole mechanics of this game on just the best. if you are on the edge about getting the portal games i would highly HIGHLY recommend it. just buy the bundle (because its a better deal) and start just enjoying the games. have fun"
1070,its portal 2
1071,Great game!!

1074,"Great humour, tricky puzzles, evil robots. What could go wrong? Oh, well there's death. Death could happen. Actually, it probably will. Have fun. Or die. Yes, die. That would be good, now wouldn't it?"
1075,"Had a ton of fun at first in singleplayer, then in co-op with my friend. This is mind-blowing, cool, awesome and all the adjectives that are synonyms to the written ones. Just awesome, don't consider buying, JUST DO IT."
1076,pog
1077,"this is the best game
from 2011?!
the graphic's is like 2022 graphics

1078,"Before i played Portal 2, i had a small wee-wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression,and absolutely no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good."
1079,fun to f**k with friends

1088,"If you like potatoes and if you like puzzles come on down and play this game!!

Seriously, this game is a lot more fun than the original in my opinion due to its puzzles being more clearly laid out. The comedy is still there, and the voice actors doing some amazing work."
1089,"Portal 1 and 2 is probably the best game series on the internet. The graphics are beautiful, the story is intriguing, and it's very comedic. Highly recommended."

1092,"Worth the money, no questions asked, buy the game now! I only thing I don't like is how they changed the movement and feel of the source engine, and the tone shift and aesthetic of Aperture Science, don't get me wrong, its still great, but it would have been great to keep the same feel of the last game and make the jump between games less jarring. I would love to see portal 2 re imagined to be like portal 1. 9.7/10"

1117,"A sequel is a work of literature, film, theatre, television, music or video game that continues the story of, or expands upon, some earlier work. In the common context of a narrative work of fiction, a sequel portrays events set in the same fictional universe as an earlier work, usually chronologically following the events of that work.[1]

In many cases, the sequel continues elements of the original story, often with the same characters and settings. A sequel can lead to a series, in which key elements appear repeatedly. Although the difference between more than one sequel and a series is somewhat arbitrary, it is clear that some media franchises have enough sequels to become a series, whether originally planned as such or not.[citation needed]"
1118,"Great puzzle game, decent replayability. Wouldn't buy it unless it comes on sale though."
1119,yes

1131,one of the best games ive ever played. good if you like puzzles

However, its missing something. A third game.

1156,its a game I think
1157,This game brings so many memories and I just love it
1158,Good game
1159,this is the best game i have ever played! even though it was made 11 years ago its still awsome for its graphics and not boring. Definitely reccommend to buy
1160,"My opinion for Portal 2. It’s like a 7/10.

Mods: 9.5/10 (good mods), 5/10 (mix mods), 3/10 (bad mods)
Puzzle mechanics: 9/10
Musical cutscenes: 8.5/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Lore: 8/10 (if it was a alternative canonical sequel), 6.5/10 (as a direct canonical sequel)
Plot: 7.5/10
Setting: 7/10
Co-op: 6/10
Portal worthy: yes, but I think the sequel could fitted as a alternative canonical sequel... well except a few parts with its gameplay, puzzle, even sure a some of its plot, than a direct canonical sequel, due the plot and setting feels like more/less portal 1, but an what if Valve’s soft reboot version of portal 1 could’ve been. And some areas from first chapter should be rework or move it as the second/third chapter instead, as it feels way too much fan service."
1161,it's good
1162,the game is very nice. you will enjoy it if you like mystery games
1163,Gud
1164,Its a great game!!
1165,Potaytoe
1166,i like walking
1167,Great Game!!!
1168,"Even better than the first game imo, love everything about it. Fav chapter is The Fall. P2 gives more history on what went on in Aperture Labs, it’s engrossing. Coop is awesome too. Can’t think of anything I would change except wishing The Fall was longer. Lol. Want a 3rd game pls :("
1169,fun
1170,"the missions were not repetitive but started to get bored after a while, didnt need to be this long normally i would play games for hours without stopping cant say i did the same with this one however still worth playing it"
1171,bruh
1172,THIS IS THE BEST GAME TO EVER EXIST
1173,"just great omg
this game is a classic that never gets old and i DEFINITELY recommend playing it
It's cool, cheap, and it has smexy robots and a cool dilf voice talking during a half of the game"
1174,"I like this one better

edit: see portal 1 review"

1187,AMAZING PUZZLE GAME
1188,Yes
1189,good game
1190,p o r t a l
1191,"This game is such an iconic staple in media for it's stellar game-play, characters, funny dialogue, and storytelling. Heck, even if you never played portal, most people know what the Portal Gun is. It's what I wish more games nowadays would do. I believe the Portal series is a good example of what you can do with both story and game-play. Even with Valve not adding onto this series anymore, the community is still so strong for this game. 
That's how much this game has made an impact in gaming

Overall, highly recommend to anyone!"

1199,Always Awesome!
1200,some youtuber said it was a waste of time and it brings down reviews of a game if i leave a negative review. so uhh stop leaving negative reviews and play teh game i guess?
1201,"Welcome to Portal 2, please let me know what you think, I can be reached at: gaben@valvesoftware.com
Thanks, and have fun!"
1202,"Great challenging levels both for Solo and Co-Op gameplay along side an equally great storyline and set of characters, there is little surprise why this (and its predecessor) became classics."

1204,outstanding!
1205,VERY FUN!!! I ONLY WANT TO MURDER MY FRIEND 20 TIMES BECAUSE THEY KEPT DROPPING ME IN THE GOSH DARN SLIPPERY WATER LIKE A FUCKING SCRUB. VERY GOOD WOULD KISS GLADOS FOR FREE!!!!!!!!!
1206,"Everything you can expect from a Valve game. Perfect lore, perfect characters, perfect gamplay, pretty good graphics for 2011 and so on..."
1207,the story is amazing and so is the co-op
1208,By far the best coop game I've played! The puzzles are amazing and the humour is just perfect.
1209,"Great game, great coop, great community levels, pretty cheap and goes on sale frequently, no reason not to buy"
1210,"Was very late to the party with this game. I had watched loads of videos on youtube and made sure to never spoil the story. Picked it up recently and have become completely hooked. Amazing graphics for an 11 year old game, fantastic writing, love wheatley and glados and even after finishing the incredible story i now have endless amounts of community made mods available to play through. Great game, everyone should play it!"
1211,"You can call ball with eye a moron and plunge your friends into Nurotoxin

1212,"This game is very much the same as the first Portal game in terms of gameplay, with a few changes to keep things interesting. So if you liked the first Portal game, you will certainly enjoy this one. I have to say, I know that ""quirky, fast talking, chatty british character"" was probably popular at the time this game was released (thinking specifically of Assassin's Creed) but frankly, it is a little annoying at first. It does get a little better in that regard as the story progresses, and the story is very good. Clearly a lovingly crafted sequel to the original and definitely worth playing."
1213,best Game of yes
1214,potato
1215,"if you want a good video game experience, either single-player or co-op, then buy it right now. it's worth the money, it is a better sequel to the first Portal with improved gameplay and an emphasis on story with a seperate 2-player co-op campaign and a level editor. 12/10"
1216,"Portal 2 is one of my favorite games of all time and that's not going to change. It has an enjoyable story, great soundtrack, fun puzzle solving gameplay, and one of the best coop modes for friends to solve together"

1221,GOOD GAM :)
1222,buy it.
1223,"Absolutely amazing, the original story is just mind-blowing how it was created 11 years ago! Like this is better then most modern games I've played. It's absolutely insane! And the Co-op playing is hilarious, especially with random players. 100% recommended!"
1224,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1225,fun
1226,The first Valve game I ever played after reading reviews about that came out over 10 years ago! Was blown away by the storytelling and ingenuity
1227,"An astounding tale of narrative, sound and level design, and story telling. An emotional roller-coaster that even a decade later still amazes by masterfully creating something, destroying it and then re-creating in new eyes."
1228,very fun :)
1229,"Quite amusing plot flows and twists, also challenging puzzle game.
Will remind you about your physics fundamentals back in your old school days.

Well if your into science, story, and puzzle games at same time, this is the one for you!
Outstanding and well recommended.

One thing missing though, need someone to do co-op courses. Anyone there care to finish the achievement also?"

1271,great game any ways back too beating my child
1272,"It's good. Focuses more on story than puzzles compared to Portal 1. There is a lot more than the core game here though. You can make and play maps with the inbuilt map maker or hammer (which is how the devs made the base maps) There are also some great mods Portal stories Mel which exceeds the base game in visuals, Portal reloaded which is more of a portal 1 successor mixing up the portal mechanics further for a new puzzle challenge.

Then there's speedrunning which is the reason I'm on 1000 hours and not 500. There's a robust challenge mode with community leaderboards for individual level speedruns and least portals which is it's own rabbit hole. There's also the normal full game leaderboards as well as a mod the removes most waiting in cut-scenes and dialoue to finish.

1000 hours and I'm not finished."

1279,"Really cool game, an unforgettable experience. Also has player made maps, which are pretty cool themselves."
1280,"Portal 2 is genuinely one of the funniest games I've ever played, with some of the best writing and voice performances in the industry, introduced at a time when neither of those things were trendy yet, making Valve yet again a pioneer in the business. I genuinely laughed out loud every few minutes, its charm and wittiness so timelessly endearing more than a decade after its release. Of course the gameplay and puzzles are fantastic, of course the cinematic art style and story beats are superb, but this is Valve, of course it is, but the reason I recommend Portal 2 to anyone willing to listen, is because of the humour, and because of the ""characters"", and the writing. That's truly what set it apart, at least in my opinion. Portal 2 is a masterpiece of writing, performances and game design, and you owe it to your Steam Account to play it."

1356,"Listen, I love this game. The puzzles are great, love the story, have yet to play coop, but theres one major flaw that makes me sad because itll probably never be resolved. Occasionally, if you die, it corrupts your file and you just cant load back in and it keeps you frozen on the main loading screen with no buttons and no escape but using task manager. You cant try another save from that game either, nothing can be done that ive found, you just have to make a new one. The first time it happened I was kinda upset but just reset because I had just started chapter two and it wouldnt be hard to keep going. The second time however, I was at the verryyyyy end of chapter 8. I still restarted it but now i have to completely redo all of chapter 8 puzzles and I'm really hoping I get to finish the main single player story before it happens again. Sad ): but great game if you dont mind the possibility of loosing progress due to accidentally falling and it deciding its a perma-death."

It pretty much just expands on the lore, and adds more characters, and makes the puzzles more difficult, which in turn makes them more gratifying. The game is just wonderful. If ANY of the stuff I said above even remotely interests you, then give the game(s) a chance. They aren't that expensive and from my experience they are totally worthit."

1423,"This is the perfect amount of challenge where the puzzles make you REALLY think, but not so difficult that you can't figure it out without a little trial & error.  I feel like escape rooms were born because of this game.  Many times puzzle games get to the point where the answers never make sense, even if you cheat and look up the answers... this one was never like that.  The answers always make sense and don't be tempted to look up the answers -- the fun is in the trial and error of figuring out the solutions.  Humor is abound and plentiful.  Has an emotional element that makes you want to binge your way through the entire story in one go.  Enjoy this classic -- It ages really well, even over a decade after its release."

1467,"Who wants to make 60 bucks?

An all time classic game. Myself and my assistant Caroline lived a good life, and this tale is a reflection of that journey. It is a shame those lab boys had to go and shove Caroline into a computer and ruin everything! Ahhh jeez who am I kidding, I have asbestos, that should be the least of my worries."

8/10"
1469,"The campaign is great, the singleplayer stuff is fun, and co-op is a blast. Its not nearly as grueling to 100% as the original portal, but still takes some time and skill."

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Portal 2 is the sequel to the award winning and hugely successful Portal developed by Valve Corporation. It features a single-player story set after the events of Portal's story; and a brand-new Co-op game mode, featuring additional test chambers designed specifically for Cooperative play. Portal 2 takes place an indeterminate amount of time, somewhere between 50 and 50,000 years, after the events of Portal, which saw Chell destroying the sentient computer GLaDOS, and landing outside the facility, only to be dragged back inside of Aperture Science where she was ultimately placed in a Relaxation Chamber by Doug Rattman for the indefinite future.

[b] Story - [/b] First I must say Portal 2 has a masterpiece of an intro! The story brought back GLaDOS (which I'm really glad to see come back). You will find many interesting twists through your playthrough and I honestly really enjoyed it. It’s a big step up from the previous game and a longer story which I'm really thankful for. I felt like the first Portal game was a bit too short so Portal 2 fixes that and makes the story really fun with more dark humor.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] While Portal had some amazing and unique mechanics, Portal 2 ups the craziness even more! Physics plays an even better role in this game and it makes the game even harder when you get into the later stages. The environments are so stunning and a big step up from the previous game. You still have the same tool from the previous game, which is great and Portal 2 doesn’t add any weird mechanics for you to use and still keeps it simple. The gameplay is still a masterpiece just like the first Portal, but with more puzzles to mess with, so no complaints here. Ever wanted to play Portal with your friend? You are in luck! Portal 2 now has a cooperative mode, and I must say it is absolutely incredible. So easy to set up and download maps from the Steam Workshop. I mean it’s Valve, they never really mess up, so no surprises. Honestly Portal 2 is just ahead of its time.

[b] Difficulty - [/b] When I reviewed Portal, my biggest issue was the puzzles, and how easy they were (and I'm really bad at puzzles). Luckily Portal 2 fixes all these problems. You will still find some easy ones here and there throughout the campaign, but my goodness some of them made me use my brain meats a little too hard. Some puzzles in my opinion, were really challenging and people who love puzzles will absolutely love this game a ton. User created maps are also really challenging and bring so much replayability to this game.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Really fun story
	[*] Funny dark humor
	[*] Amazing level design
	[*] Gorgeous graphics for 2011
	[*] Co-op puzzle game
	[*] Really challenging at times
	[*] Amazing mod support
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] The second half of the story felt slow
	[*] Co-op with randoms can be a hit or miss

1636,This game builds upon the first game and exceeds it in almost every way. There's more story this time around and way more content. There's more puzzles and fun characters you get to meet with new and unique puzzle ideas from the first game. This game is a must play for people who played and enjoyed the first Portal and people who like puzzle games.
1637,probably one of the best games i have played.

1756,play this game
1757,it's a classic
1758,"""How are you holding up? Because I'M A POTATO""

this is one of my absolute favourite games of all time. It is extremely worthwhile getting this masterpiece by Valve. The puzzle-solving is very brain wracking and extremely fun. The gameplay is made even better by GLaDOS and Wheatley, honestly one of my favourite parts of the game. Definitely a 12/10"
1759,amazing game
1760,Fun and entertaining
1761,This good game makes my dumb ass feel smart
1762,Such a fascinating universe. If only they made more.
1763,2/2. Would be 10/10 but just like valve i cant count past 2

1771,twas good
1772,Amazing game. I definitely recommend going through this experience at least once in your lifetime
1773,eh its ok
1774,"From chapter 6-7, it felt like I wasn't playing Portal 2 anymore. (in a good way). This game is incredible and there's no denying it. It's jam-packed full of content and can get very creative. 

After finishing Portal 1, I felt that it was a bit lacking in things to do. It made a hole in my heart. But that hole was fixed shortly after when I stumbled across the sequel. The puzzles felt rewarding to solve and gave me the motivation to keep going through each test chamber. GLaDOS' dialogue was out of context at times but still comedic. Wheatley wasn't as random but it was cool when he popped on screen. And of course, the companion cube only appeared in one level but made a good appearance.

This game is truly a masterpiece, being one of the few sequels to be BETTER than the original.
If you have not already, i highly recommend picking it up, It's only $14.50 AUD. and is well worth the price.

Oh, and the line ""BECAUSE I'M A POTATO!"" is the funniest line in the game to me.

10/10: Best 15 bucks you will ever spend."
1775,it was a good  game and also  good story.. for the create test chamber is very fun that all people can give idea and create a good map which is it can give us to be creative
1776,good game
1777,yeah it's big brain time
1778,The Best Game Ever Played!
1779,"AAAAAAAAAA I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH????? LIKE I PLAYED IT ON XBOX 360 OVER 7 TIMES??????? it is SO good and i honestly do not regret buying this game for pc at all, this is just portal but on a smaller screen (i use a dinky little dell inspiron laptop, bear with me here) and i will never not grin like an idiot when i hear/see wheatley every consecutive time. <333

this game never fails to be one of my most favorite of all time."

1817,"goood
portal and shit"
1818,
1819,"An amazing sequel to an amazing game. Great puzzles, great story, great coop, so much greatness too it. My only complaint is that the game has two sections it likes to switch between, the puzzle chamber bits, and the story heavy bits, where there are very few puzzles. I wish that these two types of gameplay were integrated with each other a little more, so we could have gotten a little more story during the puzzle chambers and a little more puzzles during the story bits. Still, Portal 2 is another Valve game that is a must-play experience for everyone."
1820,"Second playthrough, the jokes just do not get old :)."

I always get stuck on a puzzle and think: ""This is it. this is where I have to look up a walkthrough"". But somehow I always find the patience to solve it myself. I'm not a patient person at all, this game is just so fun."

1837,Good game but no robot sex :(
1838,h
1839,alot of fun puzzles that will have you playing for a couple of hours
1840,Slighty better than Portal 1. Really good game overall. Story mode had an actual story to it compared to Portal 1 and a lot more puzzles and levels to go through and solve. There's even a co-op mode with a unique story that works with online play. 8/10

1850,This is amazing
1851,"From great world-building to story, puzzles, and gameplay mechanics. One of my favorite games of all time."
1852,like portal but 2
1853,a cool puzzle game with co-op and a level editor. sold
1854,big robot
1855,kills brain
1856,"Portal 2 is a 3D puzzle game that uses portal mechanics to solve levels and navigate through the game. You're probably familiar with it already unless you're very young or have lived under a rock for like... a long time. The puzzles vary in difficulty, but never feel unsolvable. The main reason to check this out is the humor, which was considered a bit dark at the time, but nowadays it's pretty tame compared to what's out there. It's witty and still holds up. 

I came back to this for a nostalgia trip in 2022, last having played in 2010 or so, and I thought I'd grind out the achievements this times. Everything was great until I realized that nearly half of them were co-op achievements. Now, Portal 2 was a big enough deal that it probably still has a fair enough player base (haven't looked into it), but I've got a feeling it's still going to be a pain due to the nature of some of the achievements. (One required pairing with someone who hasn't played co-op before and another requires playing with players specifically from your friends list.) I haven't decided if I'm going to bother yet, but that's really the only negative thing I have to say. It's a masterclass game in my opinion."
1857,good

1892,this game i love the boss fight and the graphics are too good
1893,S Tier
1894,"In the wake of Portals release in 2007, it would be an enormous and almost impossible task to create a successor worthy to sit on the same level and share the same remarks as ""one of the greats"". 

However, Valve being Valve,  responsible for creating the most successful video games in history did what they do best and created Portal 2.  Not only did this game build upon its predecessor in many different ways, it essentially became its equal, earning a legendary status and critical acclaim within the PC gaming world.

Portal 2 still draws upon it authentic roots from the original. The portal gun makes its return, along with the incredible mind blowing physics, scientific applied environments and off course the notorious puzzle platform to accompany. The levels are harder, contain more props than previously i.e lasers, beams and scientific created gels.  Rational problem solving skills and effective decision making are required to come to a solution, especially in the later levels. 

Portal 2, has an entirely new campaign that certainly draws upon the original, but explores the history and depth of Aperture Science.  It brings context to missing parts of the story in the original Portal as well as introducing new characters and of course Half-life related connections that fans will appreciate.

The level of graphical representation and colossal vastness of the levels is also incomprehensible. It gives the player an almost melancholy feeling of how such mega structures are built, a feeling of being trapped inside a huge void. Furthermore this is compounded when you plunge into the terrifying abyss into your travels. It gives you that Black Mesa perception, comparable to Aperture Science, both gargantuan complexes underneath, yet subtle from above like an iceberg.
 
The time differences were well observed during the game that linked the story together. Not just by technology advancements but also by the surrounding structural environment that seemed dilapidated and left behind like a hidden time machine.

One of the best highlights of  this game is its consistency to build upon the cross of deadpan and dark humour and it does not cease to amaze. Especially when between the main robotic characters, even filtering down to the types of robotic turrets, the dialogue is truly creative and reflects what we are to believe an unemotional AI would be. Bravo to Valve for the introduction of J. K. Simmons into the story line, I just knew that voice sounded familiar.. Spider man anyone?

I will not need to say anymore than what has not been said by numerous critics and outlets. Accolades, game awards, extremely positive reviews and reception. You would be silly as a wheel not to have played this game in the last decade and/or deciding to play it. 

A solid amount of hours you will spend in this game, with cooperative option included and community based maps, you can test your intellect and learn all you want until your bum cracks!

1954,"so much fun. kept seeing this on ""best of"" lists for years but honestly thought it looked kinda lame but now i know what all the fuss is about. Definitely play Portal 1 and 2 but this eclipses the original in just the volume of puzzles and variety of twists and the voicework and humor is the icing on th cake. FUN!"
1955,"one of the first games you should buy on steam.
why? yes"
1956,"Great concept, timeless classic"
1957,YES. Buy it now. Go grab ur moms credit card and buy it now.
1958,"gameplay is pretty straightforward and nice just like the first game, some levels seem impossible but once you figure it out you feel like an idiot. It has tons of memorable moments and sequences such as finding the old Aperture Lab or the ""This is the part where he kills you"" sequence. Story wise the game is really good at too, the characters are super memorable. My only complaint is i wish there were more hidden secrets because most of them are right infront of you and pretty obvious. other than that the game is super great."

I'm unsure if it affects the entire game or just the levels, and I'm not sure how to fix it. My singleplayer story save doesn't seem to have been affected, but I'm not sure if it's linked to the cloud. How to fix ?"
1963,yes
1964,Do I really need to tell you all why Portal 2 is one of the greatest games of all time?
1965,"Fun game, good story, workshop support & coop but a third edition to follow is needed."

1968,da
1969,great
1970,fun to play with friends
1971,10/10. You get a potato friend. Need I say more?
1972,"New to Portal? Play Portal 1. Portal 2 assumes you played the first game already, and will throw you into complex puzzles right away.
Speaking of the puzzles, they are really clever and still confuse me even after multiple playthroughs. When you're done with the campaign however, there's still more for you to do.
I suggest playing Portal Stories: Mel, or Portal Reloaded before jumping into the puzzle editor, as these games further add onto the knowledge Portal 2 sets up, and can help you make better puzzles.

That brings me to the Puzzle Editor, Portal 2's double-edged sword. Portal 2 offers a really easy to use and readily available puzzle editor, however this means the workshop is often flooded with really simple puzzles that are further recommended due to people voting for puzzles that they can beat instead of puzzles that are clever. This results in experienced players not having as much content, and those who make new content for experienced players finding their puzzles being buried under waves of puzzles that make Portal 1 look difficult.

Look, Portal 2  is a great game. I suggest you try it, but I also suggest you take a moment to better your skills before you start making content for the game. Play community made mods, try out some of the more popular and challenging puzzles. Just please, take a moment to dive into the rabbit hole of Portal 2's mechanics before jumping into the editor. There is so much to learn, and I honestly believe it still holds up even without the rose tinted glasses."

1982,Best game ever! Game play and puzzles so much fun! It has a captivating lore and gladOS and wheatley are the best companions you could ever have!  Ultra recommended!
1983,Really good
1984,:D
1985,Co-op mode is a great way to team up with my son and solve fun levels together. Whole family enjoys playing portal.
1986,Sexiest sounding potato right next to Mrs. Potato Head from the Toy Story movies.
1987,Lots of fun. Good story. Interesting mechanics. Highly recommend
1988,"This game is an absolute masterpiece, I recommend"

1997,"Both portal 1 and 2 are one of the greatest games of all time. I honestly don't know what made me like this game SO MUCH. I don't even like puzzle games and this is one of the best games I've played in ALL TIME. And don't even get me started on the co-op. Playing with friends (or the ones you don't have) You can do so much stuff together. Like solve puzzles, solve puzzles, solve puzzles, and don't forget that you can even kill eachother! One of the greatest games of all time."

Its very deep and interesting.
You should have a fun time playing this even in singleplayer.

But multiplayer is a whole different story.
The amount of goofy things you can do with your friends is just hilarious.
And dont even start with the portal mechanics.
Its just beatiful.
Definetly recommended"
2064,"This game is a masterpiece, one of valve's best. The feeling when you play it is incredible, the level design fits perfectly with the atmosphere, it have puzzles without being too hard. Really enjoyed to play it, and I surely could play it again."

2168,The best game
2169,Splitgate in Half Life
2170,Amazing story and dialogue. Simple mechanics and intelligent puzzles. Expands nicely on the original game. Worth every dollar. Everybody should play this game at least once
2171,fun
2172,"speedy thing go in, speedy thing comes out"
2173,Great puzzle game. The puzzling doesn't stop after the main campaign either. This is a fun way to get into solving and designing puzzles.
2174,splitgate 2
2175,"This game is simply a masterpiece, I reccomend this to everyone"
2176,you shoot walls and walk through them
2177,"
The Standard Engineer RIG is the most basic form of Resource Integration Gear available for engineers throughout the course of their employment. It closely resembles the Standard Astronaut RIG due to the fact that it is almost skin-tight and has a small projection system for holographic display.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isaac's ID tag can be seen on the left of his chest while wearing the suit, but disappears when the RIG is upgraded.
From the beginning of the game, the suit appears to be badly worn and damaged. This pre-existing wear slowly disappears more and more as the suit is upgraded.
This suit only has 10 storage spaces, holding fewer supplies than any other suit.
The suit also made an appearance in the Previously on Dead Space feature for Dead Space 2, even appearing in the representation of Dead Space's ending.
Despite being put on like any normal helmet, the suit's helmet still forms an airtight seal, it could be speculated that it uses the same membrane system when the helmet is put on as the more advanced CEC Engineering Suit."
2178,"I jumped down the pit because Wheatley asked me too, albeit very politely."
2179,"One of the most unique games of all time.
If you love a good mysterious story imbed into a game where you have to solve a ton of insanely well crafted puzzles this is for you.  There is NOTHING not to love about this game."
2180,way better then number 1 and very nice epic cool great game

2200,Truly a classic. So nostalgic remembering the early 2000s in game development and the wholesome storylines displayed here. One of the best games I've ever played along with portal 1.
2201,the most video game of all time
2202,10/11
2203,dont play if ur stupid lmao
2204,"The definitive Portol experiance, Portal 2 is one of Valve’s materpieces standing toe to toe with half life and Tf2. While the original is great, Portal 2 overshadows it with a much more diverse and overarching story, complex and fun puzzles, and higher Replayability. The new coop mode is a fun to play with friends, Its hard to resist messing around to the point you dont get anything done. The creation mode is great and fun, if you take time to practice you can make some pretty incredible levels, not the mention the thousands of great levels already created.

Story 10/10
Gameplay 10/10
Graphics 8/10
Multiplayer 10/10
Workshop 10/10
Replayability 9/10

Overall 10/10"

2222,Still get confused on co-op levels even though I've completed the co-op like 3 times and still have more friends to complete it with
2223,"I had a lot of laughter on this Playthrough. I love that they inputted another character into the fray and made it so good. The game was what I imagined and it's very surreal, I wonder how the coding for this game works. It defies the very structure of the ordinary games that I played so far no wonder this was a classic game to be remembered for all generations. I remember the jokes of Wheatley (most comical of the group) and Glados interactions as well

Visual: 8/10
Story: 9/10
Game Design: 10/10
Overall: 10/10"
2224,good game
2225,perfect game. best game of all time
2226,I play through this game at least once a year ever since I got it and I cry every time I beat it (also every year) this is an absolutely beautiful game that if you somehow haven't gotten around to playing yet you have been missing out. Well worth it and absolutely deserves a sequel despite Valve being afraid of the number 3 hahaha
2227,portal
2228,amazing physics
2229,AMAZING GAME!!
2230,one of the best single player games ever
2231,reminded of pubg
2232,""" No Cake in this one :( But you get crackhead Wheatley as your Friend and Foe :) ""
  Gotta Love Him <3"
2233,"I do not like video games, but I cannot stop playing Portal 2. 

I asked my gamer partner if he could find me a game I actually like and BOY HOWDY does Portal 2 deliver. We started with coop games so he could teach me how to play as we went. As a true technophobic no0b who has never really played anything more complicated than Tetris, I can say that the way the game leads you through the steps and puzzles gradually is both fun and easy to understand. Now that I've discovered that I can play single player, I think my life as I knew it is over. I love this game so much and all I want to do is play it till I drop. The narrative is compelling and engaging if you want it to be, but negligible if you don't. The puzzles are challenging but not infuriatingly so. The mechanics of the game are fairly intuitive and there are only a few mechanical things you can do, so there's not much to master. 

We beat the game today and both of us - me, a known Luddite, and him, a seasoned gamer - were so sad it's over. It was fun and engaging for both of us, despite our different levels of experience. 

I may not like video games, but I LOVE Portal 2."
2234,Very cool game
2235,o8kuyuikgyjuj
2236,very fun.great writing and commentary
2237,"its puzzly as shit son,."
2238,Good if you aren't Wheatley
2239,"ty cave johnson, now i will play this forever again"
2240,A perfect sequel to a perfect game. ''Perfect'' is not an exaggeration either. Also I wish Valve could produce merch the way they did in like 2013 as I now earn my own money and would like to buy it all. A masterpiece.

2251,"ohh my god. This game is amazing in almost every way. The gameplay, level design, soundtrack, characters, voice acting, and mostly the story, is simply amazing. I don't know what you're doing reading these reviews, but just play this game already. Its only $10 and even cheaper on sale. It's totally worth the price for a game like this. And don't even get me started on the ending.

Also, i don't really know if it's normal or not that it took me over 15 hours to beat this game

Forgot to mention: bri'ish robot funni"
2252,Very fun two-player mode!
2253,very cool

2309,fun coop game =)
2310,"Portal 2 is a classic. A timeless masterpiece of puzzles, story line, and humour. There are hidden gems and lore hidden through out the game so keep your eye's open while solving and adventuring. Portal 2 does offer a longer story line than portal 1 and keeps you interested through out as it develops. though this game was made some years ago, graphically it still holds up in later years. the puzzles are In my opinion on the difficult side of medium difficulty. Where some puzzles may give people a challenge and you'll have to think it though logically, but others are straight forward. over all still one my Fav puzzle games.

Overall gameplay/experience: 9/10

2416,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2463,"Really great atmosphere, brain-teasing puzzles and very nice graphics and shading. The storyline is quite engaging, the voice-acting excellent and the game in general is improved in every way compared to the much simpler and shorter previous Portal. 

Runs surprisingly well even on an under-performing iMac."
2464,DO NOT PLAY ALONE!!!!!
2465,"Fantastic puzzles, great story and sense of humor, and it still holds up in terms of visuals and game play after 11 years. You owe it to yourself as a gamer to play this."
2466,certified hood classic
2467,a classic
2468,"The single player campaign is great, the coop campaign is amazing, and there's a post-campaign coop chapter!"
2469,"5/5. This game pisses me off because it's the first game I ever played that wasn't Minecraft or DSIware, and I still haven't found a better game. Set my expectations way too high."
2470,The trailers for this game completely nailed how the Co-Op feels to go through.
2471,GOOD SHIT
2472,Portal
2473,"https://youtu.be/9gsHXbPisbg

Single player is a slight step back from the original but the additions for co-op are a great addition to push this title to greatness."
2474,"One of the best games I’ve ever played. Great writing, creative ideas, and good challenge. I went in completely blind which made it even better for me."
2475,I still did not get my fucking cake damn it
2476,Easily one of the best games ever made. I wish Valve still made video games
2477,"This game is fucking amazing. Unlike the first game, Portal 2 significantly expands the story and characters. So much so that I feel that the story is the best part of the game."
2478,"Very great game, has lots of great content,"
2479,Wonderful
2480,"If you don't love this game you've got something wrong with you, or you were born 2022."
2481,"Bit late with the Portal Games, (played 'em last year) but everything about this and the 1st game is amazing. The story, GLaDOS is and will always be one of my favourite video game characters and the overall gameplay and game mechanics are wonderful. Beautiful games... Highly recommended."
2482,Why are the robots so mean to me? :(
2483,"Best Game I've played, very epic."
2484,"A staple of any steam users library, and a must play if you like puzzle games and playing with friends."
2485,Funny puzzle game
2486,Big robot tells me I'm adopted 2
2487,he didn't kill me
2488,Space.
2489,This is my (probably) most replayed game and I love everything about it.
2490,"Even after 11 years this still stands as one of my favorite games. It has a decent story with decent story time, plus the co-op mode gives even more game time. The graphics are not horrible and even can still stand up to some modern games. Overall, this game is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone thinking about trying it out!"

2505,"I love this game so freaking much, best game I ever played. 10/10."
2506,"You should definitely play this game. For 10 dollars you're getting a pretty amazing puzzle game with great visuals, amazing writing, and some really fun game play. 

Honestly there isn't much to say other than the game really pushes it's gimmick of creating portals really far, and the testing environments do a good job of feeling very purposeful with their design while the parts where you are outside of the testing areas feel like you shouldn't be there which is incredible level design.

If you hate puzzle games don't pick it up. For anyone else this is an easy recommendation to make."
2507,"[h1]Worth a play 11 years after?[/h1]

You know this game, how can you not? Re-played recently, just want to point out how bloody brilliant it still is! Spot-on puzzles, jokes, dialogues, absolutely spot-on!

2508,"I am a 55 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
2509,uhhhhhhgggn stinky portal uerrm uh idk this game is boring but uhbhmmm me and my dad used to like it so ill give it the blue thumbs up thx u

2514,short coop campaign
2515,"while a great sequel in my opinion and many others, i felt that the game may have had a bit too much going on and i was at some points stuck due to the difficulty of the puzzles. im pretty stupid tho so anyone smart would rate 10/10 i would rate 7.5/10"
2516,"shows that aperture was in financial trouble, doesnt show how they got out, refuses to elaborate further
10/10"
2517,"Just an amazing puzzle game with a great narrative, likeable characters and a good sense of humor. If you have a best friend or S/O, you'll love the multiplayer mode. This game is just a classic, and - to be so controversial - better than the original, by sheer virtue of having everything that made that game great, and so much more."

2526,"best game and lore ever created 
"
2527,"I personally found this game to not live up to my expectations. The game was very hyped up to me by others as well as the amazing metacritic score and a supposedly much longer campaign. I did still enjoy this game a lot however i feel part of what made portal 1 so great was missing. This combined with a dreadful chapter ""the itch"" right before the amazing ending to the game led to me being disappointed upon finishing the game. Looking back at the game it is very good and i would 100% recommend it to people however it was not as good as portal 1 by a long shot"
2528,FUN  :)
2529,glados my wifey <3
2530,"This game is absolutely amazing. Has a lot of features, Funny dialogue, and more.
"
2531,"Got this as a bday gift from my sibling

At first, I thought it was just a Puzzle Game, but I realized that I was wrong once I started playing it.
The story is unpredictable and has a ton of twists and turns, which gives the meaning behind the puzzles. While playing, I got so focused around the story that I even forgot that I'm playing a Puzzle Game.

The boss battle is harder than in Portal 1 ofc"
2532,Easily one of the best games of all time. Ridiculously fun puzzles and absolutely hilarious writing. The kind of game you'll find yourself coming back to over and over!
2533,its a feelgood game thanks gaben
2534,"Best gameplay, one of my favorite video game story lines. Where's portal 3 tho"
2535,"""it's pointless mad""
The best puzzle game in history, which has unique levels and a memorable and detailed story, great sound and performance, and high replay value, creating a memorable experience that will last for a hundred years.

Along with Stanley Parable, this game is the best game of my life"
2536,One of those games that you just should play before you die!
2537,This is an amazing puzzle game with a captivating story to go along with it!
2538,A must try title.
2539,"While it's not a difficult game, the puzzles have a way of making you feel really smart about figuring them out. Besides, it's a classic. The story is awesome."
2540,"I was around 11 or 12 years old when I played this game for the first time. I remember liking the game quite a lot at the time that I was playing it, but for the life of me I couldn't pin down what exactly it was that made me like it so much. Of course there were the funny ramblings of Glados and Cave Johnson that I remember, and I remember how the game played, but it never occurred to me that this game was truly a special piece of media until I decided to replay it last year.

I hadn't played played the original Portal before I played Portal 2, and did not play it until years afterward when I got the Orange Box (a criminally underpriced collection of Valve's greatest games, and Half-Life Source) which had the Portal games in it. I decided to revisit Portal 2 after playing through Portal for the first time, and, even on revisit, a more mature me finally understood more of the writing qualities of the game while simultaneously feeling like I was being welcomed home by the gameplay, while still having it offer up a challenge due to my years of absence, and while I liked Portal 2 the first time, replaying it felt magical. 

I wasn't too keen on the story of the Half-Life games (and those games are still really good, don't get me wrong), but the snappy writing of Portal 2, the environment to compliment it, and the themes that tie it all together combined to make not only a good story, but also a good way of telling it. The gameplay is surprisingly simple, with changes coming sparingly, yet the game still has a progressively challenging and fun cycle that tests the limits you have with your portal gun. It is a superb single player experience whether you are a casual or hardcore gamer, and whether you prefer gameplay or story. Wheatley, Glados, and Cave Johnson were all hysterical to listen to, yet endearing in their own ways.

Furthermore, Portal 2 not only stands alone as a fantastic game, but also as a sequel that improves upon its series. It puts many story beats of the original Portal into a new context, turning what was a funny little puzzle game with a creepy twist into a riveting story that wraps itself up in a satisfying way. Unlike some of Valve's other titles, you don't really see an outcry for Portal 3, because Portal 2 sufficiently ends its story and caps it off with the most fire breakup song known to man, which is one of the best endings to a series that anyone could ask for.

However, what truly makes Portal 2 a special game is in its versatility. This is a game that is easily recommendable to everyone, (unless you are allergic to puzzles or terrified of robots, I guess). 

It's campaign provides fun on all fronts, and the singleplayer experience alone is worth the 10 dollars, even though the campaign only takes 5-7 hours to go through. However, its nature as a precision puzzle game with numerous quirks in the physics engine allows for a very fun speedrunning experience that's easy to learn, but hard to master.

All of this doesn't even begin to introduce the multiplayer aspects of Portal 2. You can choose to team up with a friend and tackle the co-op game mode, which itself holds hilarious writing and fun gameplay that requires coordination between you two that can improve your teamwork for other multiplayer games, or result in sabotage that leaves you both laughing by the end. Furthermore, you can flex your creative muscles by designing your own levels for others to enjoy, and enjoy the levels of others when the base game tires you out, by proxy.

I tend not to recommend games based on my own personal enjoyment of them, but by how much they can be enjoyed by others, and the scope of who is likely to enjoy it. Some of my favorite games of all time are slow-burning, turn-based JRPGs, but oftentimes they can only really be recommended to a particular demographic. Portal 2 is one of the few games that, I feel, can be recommended to just about anyone. Whether they are picking up a controller for the first time or a seasoned veteran of a variety of genres, Whether they play games for laid-back fun or top notch competition, whether they enjoy a slow burning story or complex and fast-paced gameplay, or whether they wish to consume the work of others or showcase their own creations, Portal 2 is a game that can scratch any itch, all at an affordable price with content that can last as long as you need it to.

I understand that another positive review on Portal 2 is just a drop in the bucket for a game that receives near-universal praise, but these were thoughts I just wanted to put into words for a game that I think warrants all of the praise it gets, and sometimes I think people need to step back and remember what makes games like Portal 2 so special.

This game is (at most) 10 dollars, you'd be foolish to even consider not buying it, if you somehow don't have it already.

tl;dr: funny potato half-life spinoff belongs in everyone's library. get it now. 10/10"

2561,"Absolute classic, with fun puzzles, a very impressive physics system, unique humor, and intriguing lore. I always recommend my friends play this game if they haven't (because it also means I get to enjoy co-op mode with them).

2562,AYAN SUCKS ASS ON IT THOUGH L
2563,Just get it!
2564,fun
2565,"They removed the old trilogy, make people buy the new. The new is non playable, crashes, drop of frame rates, and much more as is known. Asked for a refund since I bought it for PS5 and sony is refusing because the game was downloaded and played for less than 2 hours. Told me that the publisher does not acknowledge the new trilogy as non playable and so no refund. I feel scammed. They are multi million dollar companies and steal from players that trusted on their services with hard earned money and refuse to get back what they took? Don’t get me wrong! I understand that if people buy a game and play it shouldn’t be refunded because the person even not enjoying the game, the game is working but on this case, the trilogy is broken, have to exit the game several times because cutscenes freezes the game, cars spawn everywhere and explode, kill the character even on a mission, and much more. They should be accountable legally. This is stealing.

Small addition to my context: I was mad while writing this and I'm sorry if I did not specified this before!

I get that the game was made and sold by Rockstar Games and I got it thru my PSN account for PS5 version. I don't blame Sony for the broken game, I blame Rockstar! My beef with Sony is that when I spoke to the manager, he told that he understands my side and wanted to help but the policy does not allow this since the game was downloaded or played, even tho under 2 hour mark of gameplay. I understand Sony does not want to take a hit since is Rockstar making the sale, but is also my understanding that Sony is allowing this to happen. The manager said that they are getting thousands of complaints, but unless Rockstar acknowledges that the game is broken, Sony won't do anything.

Some people are blaming me for buying a game I thought would remind me of the old good days. Yes I did not have seen any review before because I was trying to get a first hand experience with this remasters and get that wow feeling like it was my first time. I regret this, but it is what it is.

Please stop saying that I am a Xbox fanboy, because I only play PlayStation, and to be honest, I don't even belong into this stupid console war. Anyone should be playing where they want without being insulted on their choices. I don't mind Xbox but I grew with PlayStation and that is the platform that most of my games are and is where I feel happy to play when I have a chance.

Why people need to insult me for being frustrated against a multi-billion dollar companies that have the chance of doing what is right instead of doing something shameful like this? The terms of Service specify that if you download or play a game is non refundable any more and I get it, but at least expect the game to be working! In this case is not and so I was sold a faulty copy of something that is not working as intended. If you get a phone, a computer or even clothes and after two hours or less you find out that is not working or not being able to get the proper use of that exact thing, you have 14-30 days to return and ask for a refund or replace that exact thing. Sony could make a refund in wallet and I would gladly spend that money into another thing on their store. All I ask is for the game to be on working condition or at least playable.

I understand that this is not happening to everyone and that the game is playable to some users. I'm happy it is and I wish that would also be my experience but is not and so, please do not insinuate I am lying to get a refund. I have proof that the game is non playable and I can get even more proofs by just playing 5 minutes. My point is, if it is working for you, please feel free to enjoy and share your achievements, but for me is a nightmare and so I feel frustrated as any of you blaming me would be if you were in my shoes.
FUCK SONY, AND FUCK ROCKSTAR GAMES!!!!


To everyone who understands my side, thank you so much! People shouldn't judge if they don't know exactly why it happened or how it is happening. Just chill! You are not getting anything from defending this companies that would do the same thing to you just like they are doing it to me. All I am asking is to get my working product or getting the money at least into my account so I can spend it somewhere else,like another game or one of their subscription products like PS Plus or PS Now.

I played single player, BEAUTIFUL.
I played co-op, FANTASTIC.

The game play it makes me feel like I'm on the beach, as the sun is setting, drink in hand, mans best friend right beside me, as a warm gust of wind brushes against me, and a smile appears on my face, the joy from completing puzzles, going through the story,
the characters I met along the way, the unexpected friends I made, the journey was a pleasant experience, the environmental story telling was like god handing me a burrito, 
after I completed the game, a single tear fell from my eye, it was over just as it started, It was the adventure I was looking for,
and I found it.

Glados was super cool :)

there will never be a portal 2 puzzle game by valve like this again.

I want to give a sincere the biggest thank to valve team who worked on this,

My life has become better from playing this, I learnt things, a lot of things; friendship, betrayal, how to make portals, 
but in the end, I really enjoyed this game.

[b]Review:[/b]

You are curious about the game Portal 2? It is just an awesome game, developed by Valve in 2011. Though it's quite old for a game, it is still awesome for modern standards. The Game is built around the Portal universe, but you don't have to play the first part (but I recommend it). It is not as buggy as the previous part, for example, you can't shoot a portal if you're inside a portal.

Lost inside the puzzle rooms is sometimes your lot. Even though it's sometimes quite complicated to find the solution for the puzzles (especially with the gels -> it still destroys my brain), it is still awesome.

The re is a workshop with a strong community with awesome puzzles which are often better than Valve's puzzles (which are still amazing). There is also a coop mode which is pretty fun if you have friends.

Game play is also awesome. There is a story that is quite good and the level editor is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It is possible to build quite complex puzzle rooms but you also have the option to build complex logical contraptions. For example, I buildt a four-bit full adder and included it inside a puzzle (which is quite fun imo). You can find it in my workshop.


I waited till I reached the 42 in-game hours. Why? Just because!

2604,"So originally this review was one of those copy paste review things but after some consideration i've decided to delete that old review. This game means too much to me to just play it of as ""just another game"" cause it isn't! Portal 2 made me realize the quality that games should strive to go after. Of course this is just my opinion but i think that those who look at older games and say ""Eww oLd GaMe BaD!"" are idiots.
(Also this review will have minor spoilers)

Portal 2 is a 3D puzzle platformer set after the original portal (btw portal 1 is also very good). It mostly follow the same gameplay loop the original game had but instead of the clean, sterile look of the first game, we now instead navigate through a more old, run down facility, where veggitation grows everywhere. It's quite a different feel. This is an excellent way to showcase the world without GLADOS, and how us defeating her in the first game really shut down the whole facility. Also, as always, the portal and movement feels very good and is a massive improvement over the first game.

Anyway let's discuss the story. 

(Here is where there is A LOT of spoilers so if you wanna buy it DONT READ THIS)

The game begins with us waking up in our sleeping chambers, but something isn't quite right. The voice that normaly says how long you've been in stasis for glitches out implying that we may be hundreds of years in the future! Then we get introduced to the greatest ball in all of gaming. Ladies and gentlemen and whatever genders there now are, I present Wheatley! (voiced by Stephen Merchant) He adds alott of charm into what otherwise is like a lonely test facility. Anyways in a really cool cutscene (playable of course since valve) he gets you out of the stasis chamber and into the old testing areas. We traverse through it until we find THE PORTAL GUN (yellow not included) With this we finally delve into the core gameplay and traverse old test chambers that some may find familiar. After a bit of puzzling we step into the room where GLADOS's corpse lies, lifeless. Wheatley remarks on how a human defeated her (not knowing that was us). We continue on until we find the control room were Wheatly quotes god, makes the elevatior move upwards and you know just REACTIVATING GLADOS! In a stunning cutscene we see how GLADOS makes herself whole again and then focuses on you. She remarks on how long it's been and tosses Wheatley aside. Guess what? Testing time!!! Which also means the DUAL PORTAL GUN!!! Finally it's time to test as GLADOS does her best to repair the broken test chambers. After alot of bullying recieved from GLADOS, Wheatly comes to the rescue! You and Wheatly make a run for it and end up in the manufacturing and closed of section of the facility. It is here were Wheatley makes a plan on how to defeat GLADOS! So you go aroung and destroy the Turret manufacuring aswell as her ""deadly neurotoxin"". With all of these gone you head back to once again face GLADOS. As she realizes what you've done you plug Wheatly into the core transfer to give Wheatley control of the facility. You end up succeeding and Wheatley begins to send you up the victory elevator but oh no ohhh no! The twist you didn't see coming! He becomes EVIL! He begins to pull the elevator downwards. After turning GLADOS into a potato battery he smacks you down, breaking the elevator, causing you to fall down the very long elevator shaft. You eventually land and see GLADOS getting kidnapped by a bird. You begin traversing these large rooms to eventually discover that this was the original Aperture science testing facilities. Then you hear old speaker recordings echoing throughout the large caves. None other than Cave Johnson/J.K SIMMONS! WHOOOOOO! Oh and his assistant Caroline but she totaly isn't that important. While traversing through the test chambers you hear the slow downfall of Apeture, and get new game mechanics! After some time you arrive on a bridge, where Cave J delivers one of the most famous video game quotes of all time,

""Alright, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?! Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!""

This review will be continued..."
2605,"Wonderful story in single player, and who doesn't enjoy betraying your friends in the name of science?"
2606,Truly one of the best games ever made. It's just perfect.

2647,"trange as it may seem to start a five-star review on a note of concern, I worry about Valve. It's not that I think the developer has put a foot wrong so far, or that its latest release won't meet the impossibly high expectations of its audience. On the whole, the titles that Valve has produced have been critically lauded and have sold very respectably.

But if the history of art and entertainment has taught us one thing it is this: if you habitually make genius look easy, audiences and critics will round on you if you stumble, even more viciously than they would have done if your track record was of a mediocre quality. Valve's winning streak has to get snapped at some point, doesn't it? And if it does, the knives will be out in force.
Well, thankfully, Portal 2 isn't the game that's going to cause this, which is remarkable when you consider it's arguably the sequel of 2011 with the toughest act to follow. The first Portal, released in 2007 as part of the Orange Box, was a short, ingenious puzzler wrapped up in first-person-shooter mechanics, underpinned by a darkly comic story about scientific research taken to dangerous extremes. The game seemed like lightning in a bottle and a sequel sounded unnecessary. Still, Valve has managed to go one better than what its team created before, and then built on its impressive foundations.

Portal 2 kicks off with player waking up in the Aperture Laboratories, the human behaviour research facility from the first game, and finding out very quickly that things have gone haywire. Aperture is a wreck: without GlaDOS – Portal 1's female AI antagonist – to run things, the facility is in an advanced state of disrepair. Walls are crumbling, test chambers malfunction and every room the player moves through is riddled with smashed windows, natural overgrowth and broken machinery. In the opening stages of the game, players are introduced to Wheatly, a stammering, motor-mouthed droid voiced by Stephen Merchant, and reacquainted with the Portal Gun, which creates interconnecting portals capable of bending distances, and physics, in their environment.

They're also soon reunited with GlaDOS, who takes umbrage at their presence and decides that a new round of potentially lethal tests is in order.

While the set-up will sound incredibly familiar to Portal veterans, Portal 2 is hardly a retread of the first game. Yes, using the Portal Gun to navigate one's way through every new environment is the core premise of the game – and cubes, gun turrets, floating platforms and pressure pads all make a return. But Valve has added some mind-bending mechanics and tools to the mix.
As the player advances through the Apeture Labs they're introduced to new items that the research facility has created to exercise their grey matter and potentially kill them off. There are Hard Light Bridges, which can create walkways or block off the sensors of lasers and gun turrets. There are Aerial Faith Plates, which fling the player through the air. There's Propulsion Gel, which allows them to zoom across the floor, building momentum for jumps and portal leaps. Puddles of Repulsion Gel can create areas the player can bounce on– and the higher the ledge they drop from, the higher they'll fly through the air. White Gel can be sprayed on to surfaces to make them Portal Gun-friendly. Excursion funnels are blue tubes of anti-gravity, which gently transport the player from one end of the map to the other, and they too can be redirected and repositioned with the Portal Gun. Each new item is introduced gently, to let the player become familiar with its capabilities, and then Valve starts ramping up the difficulty.

The puzzle rooms are incredibly well designed in that there's no hard and fast rule with the game's difficulty curve. Once the tutorials are out of the way, it's down to every individual player's desire to break the code on each environment, which allows them to move from the entrance to the exit. Even if one player finds the solution to one particular room obvious, this doesn't mean that everyone else will, and some puzzles may take up to hour to solve. All the while GlaDOS pours scorn over the player's efforts, with a stream of insults that are petty, vindictive and immature – made more hilarious by her robotic, sing-song voice.

The humour in Portal 2 is another trump card in the game's well-paced, engrossing and unsettling story. Without giving too much of the game's plot away, the player will find Portal 2 funny throughout, but also faintly spinechilling. GlaDOS and Wheatly are by turns funny and monstrous and the Aperture Labs take on an increasingly oppressive atmosphere as the player ventures deeper into the facility, learning more about its origins. Meanwhile, the unseen character from the first Portal is still lurking behind the scenes, scrawling paranoid messages and horrific cartoons on the walls.

The game's main campaign is longer than in Portal 1, and arguably better too. Once that's over and done with, however, players can return to Aperture in the multiplayer. This mode is a standalone story starring two cute droids, Atlas and Peabody, who are sent testing by GlaDOS, and the series of puzzles they have to navigate depends on them working successfully as a team. While it may sound strange that a game offering such a successful solitary experience as Portal should include such a mode, it's actually delightful fun. Once again, the puzzles are well-balanced and brilliantly constructed and, GlaDOS has a new collection of insults.

Valve has created a masterpiece in Portal 2. The depth of content, the mind-bending mechanics and fantastic experience are almost certain to satisfy ardent fans of the first game; and to all newcomers to the series, it's as simple as this: prepare to have your mind blown. Over and over again."
2648,brilliant.
2649,this game was very fun to play with puzzles and humor but i finished the game in 7 hours not very long but it was nice playing for a cheap price it is a very good game.
2650,"Best game ever! The top rated community chambers are awesome, I can't stop playing this game."
2651,"By far, one of the best puzzle games i have ever played. i loved everything about it, especially the dark humor!"

2656,good game
2657,"The first part of the game is easy and fun but, the second part of the game is confusing because the puzzle got harder."
2658,Best game series on steam.
2659,"My favorite game, will probably always be my favorite game. Don't talk smack about it."
2660,"I would say to get this game, with all of its wit, charm, and it being the best puzzle game, but the orange box exists, so, get that, you get half-life 2 with episodes"
2661,i finished it two time now and man i love this game its the most perfect game i ever played its my favourite game

2683,Portal I grew up with. and part two improved on what was set up in part 1. gameplay is excellent. highly recommended
2684,"most fun puzzl game i ever buy on steam
"
2685,"This game didn't NEED to give GLaDOS the depth and character development she gets in Portal 2 but oh my God this game would be lesser without it. Stephen Merchant does an astounding job voicing Wheatley and I lost my mind after I heard J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson for the first time. 

Cave and Wheatley are tied for being the funniest character in the game, but that's probably because there's only a total of like 4 main characters lol. Combining these with the puzzles similar to the ones you in play Portal is the recipe to a perfect sequel. Probably Valve's OBJECTIVELY best game. Stay mad, HL fans."
2686,Co-op is alot of fun
2687,vroom vroom portal gun fun game
2688,good game
2689,"This is probably one of the best games of all time and you really owe it to yourself to experience it as blind as you possibly can. The music is amazing, the sound design gives you that feeling of momentum, and the puzzle design is fantastic. During sales it costs like $2 so very good to pick up then."
2690,"Gameplay is incredible, the dialogue is hilarious, the voice acting is crazy high quality, the story is engaging. 10/10 mastapeece"
2691,"This game still holds up, even after a decade."
2692,i like and love playing this game
2693,"If you enjoyed Portal 1, you will enjoy Portal 2.  Wish they would hotfix the controller Y-axis inverted bug though.  You change Y-axis to inverted in coop mode and it doesn't change it.  sadge"
2694,You don't have a real Steam account unless you have beaten this game.
2695,it ok
2696,Great game
2697,good.
2698,"This was a triumph
I'm making a note here; ""Huge success""
It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction
Aperture Science:
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are
Still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart,
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now, these points of data
Make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned-
For the people who are
Still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you?
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke *Haha - Fat Chance*
Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist
Look at me: still talking
When there's science to do
When I look out there,
It makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive
And believe me I am
Still alive
I'm doing science and I'm
Still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm
Still alive
While you're dying I'll be
Still alive
And when you're dead I will be
Still alive
Still alive"
2699,"if you like puzzle / brain teasing games, this is a game for you"
2700,Brain hurt but good thing
2701,fascinating
2702,get this or you ill trip over on a cashew
2703,"Portal 2 might just be the best game I've ever played. I don't think I could've asked for more. An absolutely charming cast, well-paced gameplay with new mechanics that fit well into the puzzle design. Unlike some other puzzle games, Portal 2's puzzle solutions are always sensible and as such, the game is never frustrating and never overstays its welcome. The environment design is absolutely stellar, from the various signs filled with hilarious tidbits to the environments reflecting various periods in the history of Aperture. I liked how straight-to-the-point the story is, and while it is quite short as a result, there is other stuff to do. Messing around in the level editor making a wicked puzzle for a friend to try is great fun. The co-op is also phenomenal and has led to some of the most hilarious moments playing with a friend. 10/10 would recommend."
2704,Great game!

It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you
Maybe not quite as heavy
Now little Caroline is in here too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone"
2731,The gem.
2732,"Portal 2 is a superior sequel when compared to the first portal game so either buy them as a pack or just buy portal 2. It introduces a new co-op mode which is fun when you are able to have fun with (or sabotage) your friends. The best thing about this game is the story and how it connects more with the audience and it's comedic touch of humour. Also there are new game mechanics (which I will not spoil) which improved the game by a vast quantity. If you are looking for a fun game to play, then play this."
2733,this game is better than mario odyssey
2734,never trust british people
2735,"Amazing game. The puzzles were challenging, the story was enticing, the characters were brilliant; it's certainly worth playing through Portal 1 and 2."

2750,"A masterpiece by Valve. Genuinely one of the best games I've ever seen, and something every enthusiastic gamer, young or old, should experience at least once.

Gameplay, story, graphics, atmosphere, feel and performance are all fantastic.

Only real downside is a lack of replayability.

Maybe the only 10/10 I've ever played. Should be at the top of your list if you've never played it."
2751,"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER its great  
"
2752,"I mean it's Portal 2, it's a cult classic, if you have Steam you should own and play Portal 1 and 2. 
Graphics - The graphics are still beautiful even with today's standards, and the atmosphere is immense
Story - The voice acting is impeccable, especially GLADOS and J.K.Simmons
EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY IT"

2792,Game is great! Has some of the best humor and gameplay i've seen from a game. Really hope they eventually make a portal 3. But since Valve has created Steam i don't think the odds are good. But i still reccomend this game to every puzzle game enjoyer!

2811,10.9 hours putting a portal on the ceiling and floor and repeatedly falling faster and faster and then falling on the turrets who gets sent on the other side of the room as it shoots everywhere and then saying `i dont blame you` as i throw it in the deadly liquid. other than that its amazing

2830,"While Portal 2 was a good game, it was not as good as Portal 1. The developers' made the game bigger and the game felt bloated."
2831,I can finish this game but cant pass a math exam wtf
2832,No need for explanation. Simple perfection.
2833,fun asf
2834,The only possible thing which could be better than portal 2 clearly has to be portal 3.
2835,"a big step up from the last game which i'd give 4.5/5 -- portal 2 is a 5! i'm glad there's so much more content and lore, can't wait to play multiplayer"
2836,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
2837,"Jogo top do começo ao fim, e esse é o problema dele, ele acaba."
2838,both the story and the mechanics are exceptional I highly recommend this game
2839,the gameplay is amazing to me its slow paced sometimes but fast paced sometimes
2840,"Excellent game that can only be played for once. Extremely immersive worldbuilding and puzzles, hilarious line in between, and the A-HA moment is so intense you would feel like unlocking an extra slot in your forehead into a sixhead."
2841,Yes. Great game. Fun. A masterpiece.
2842,i didnt press the button again
2843,yes very pog indeed
2844,"A ingenious, funny, clever, simple and complex, unique first-person puzzle game. If you liked the first, this is a great sequel."
2845,"remember watching my dad playing as a child, now i get to experience it myself. Just as great this time around"
2846,very cool. nice mechanics
2847,"portal 2 is honestly a 10/10 game, they did so much with portal concept, which was already great to begin with and added so much more to it. the writing is also really funny, that carries over from the first portal. i love the new mechanics introduced, they are very fun to play around with"

2877,"One of my favourite games of all time. Valve cannot stop impressing me by how good they are at making video games. Left 4 Dead, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Half Life, Team Fortress, Dota.. These games go back to more than 10 years ago, yet thousands of people are still playing them and working on them. Portal 2 is no different. The idea of the game is original and innovative. The amount of content existing thanks to the community is insane. 10 on 10. ♥"

2895,this game was before its time.
2896,Simply an amazing game and a great classic. The gameplay is very original and the story has lots of surprises!
2897,"I wanted to like this game. I loved the first one, and fully expected those feelings to carry over to the sequel. And it does have a lot going for it, you can really see the dedication the developers put into it and the lengths they went to to expand every part of the experience. We learn much more about the game's lore with Aperture Science, what they're actually about, and the true nature of GLaDOS. There are a bunch of new puzzle features like bounce gel, energy bridges, and stuff like that, which are very interesting and can be fun to play around with. And the game has more of a clear-cut, interesting story beyond just ""do tests (and try to escape)."" To be fair that is the basis of this game's plotline just as much as the first, but there is more depth to it, twists and turns, and more characters. 

My main issues with the game are 1) It is not nearly as intuitive in design as the first one, and 2) It is way too dark for the majority of the game. 

In Portal 1 the levels were generally very bright and clinical, you could see everything in a room and could much more easily parse out what the mechanics of the level were. In this one it feels like I'm constantly straining my eyes to try and figure out where I am or what the room around me looks like. There are long linear chase scenes where you race across catwalks and whatnot in the facility, and they made me feel frustrated and like I was missing things because I could hardly see where I was going. The problem was most egregious in the lower levels (pun intended) where large complex puzzles had to be solved in very low light. Several times I got stuck because I couldn't see where I was or got confused because I thought there was somewhere in the darkness I was supposed to try and reach, but there was nothing there.

This ties into the level design in general. In Portal 1 I enjoyed all of the levels (although I was impatient in the first couple levels to get a fully functional portal gun) and only got truly stuck one time. In this game I got stuck much more frequently and found myself getting more and more frustrated. With the first Portal I played the whole thing in only a couple of sessions and could hardly tear myself away from the game. With this one I found myself wanting to play it less and less. By the last third or so of the game I was no longer having much fun. I wanted to get to the end and see how the story concluded, but I wasn't enjoying myself on the levels themselves. I think this is related to the level design (being poorly-lit among other things) but also because I think the 2nd Portal game is much harder. There are a lot more mechanics and machines to remember and they interact in interesting ways. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (in fact it's probably a really good thing) but it got overwhelming for me and lessened my enjoyment.

The first portal game was generally a pretty relaxing experience for me; as previously mentioned I only got stuck once in the whole game and it was generally pretty simple for me to determine how to beat each level with some low-stakes experimentation. It was fun to see how the different mechanics worked together and it never took too long to determine the way forward. Maybe it's just that it was easier, and I'm sure many other players will welcome the added challenge. But each room took so much longer in Portal 2, and I died much more frequently. I got frustrated, and it honestly diminished my enjoyment. Say what you will about me complaining that a game was too hard, but I really liked Portal 1 because I thought it had a very good balance between interesting, complex levels and difficulty. This game lacks that, at least for me.

P.S. As a result of me taking so much longer to complete levels, as well as the greatly expanded NUMBER of levels in the 2nd game, it felt very very long to complete. If the levels were all as fun and intuitive as the original this wouldn't be a problem, and I understand to a point why there were so many because it introduced so many other kinds of mechanics and machines. It's wonderful that the developers wanted to include so many new and unique ideas. But it just seemed like way too much for me. If you see my # of hours played you'll see that this took twice as long to beat as the original. And honestly after all of that I feel too burnt out to really muster any enthusiasm for repeating the experience, much less recommending it to others.

TL;DR- respect the developer's efforts to expand the experience, but found the game frustrating, counter-intuitive, and not as fun as the original.



EDIT: Played the game through again, got a better set up where I could see the dark parts of the screen better. Its still kind of an issue in my opinion, but not a major one. Anyway, the game grew on me. I helped my little brother in his playthrough it as well, and we had fun. So I suppose I WOULD recommend it to others, as long as they understand that this game is noticeably more challenging than its predecessor."
2898,it's portal
2899,pure perfection
2900,noice
2901,"It's Portal 2, there's little one can add about it that hasn't been said before. It might feel a bit short, but the comedic factor, soundtrack, atmosphere and gameplay ALL make up for it. Besides, there's even a co-op mode with plenty of missions (too bad I haven't anyone to play it with). You might need to buy the original Portal game to fully understand the story, but it's quite straightforward to understand even if you don't want to play through the first game. All in all, I'd honestly recommend this to anyone."

2913,"good

2914,"I was scared this was going to be a sweaty gamer game that I wouldn't be able to play, so I avoided it for a while, but I was very wrong. It is hard, but It's still playable if you don't have good reflexes. There are so many different types of puzzles and each one is so different from each other, even the ones in the same chapter. usually puzzle games get boring after a while because once you've seen a few puzzles, you've seen them all, but I have been playing this for 12 hrs straight and I'm still getting new game mechanics. I'm not a huge gamer, so maybe these are things most people know about the game, but to those like me who know nothing about games and have a hard time with timing and dexterity based puzzles, I highly suggest this game. The plot is also great and the characters are hilarious. It's already become one of my new favorites."
2915,"this game is a gem from 2011 buy this game NOW just ask anyone, and they will tell you to get this game. (i love portal 2)."

2944,"Greatest game of all time, we're never getting Portal 3"
2945,"I love this game, the memories that this game holds are deer to me and I am so thankful to valve for making this game - I have many more hours but they are on the PS3. Since I first started playing video games portal 2 is one of the first, with its fun puzzles and gripping story, followed by a deep lore which takes you even further into the aperture world there is very little not to love. If you have not played this game before I cannot recommend it enough, the single player is so good you will wish that you could forget the story and play it all over again.

How long this comment will remain I do not know, how long it will be relevant I do not know, but one thing I am sure of is that portal 2 is one of the best overall games I have ever played since I began gaming in 2012 (along side MW2 which i'm sure many will agree is also at the top).

2976,"Like the first Portal, this game is not only hilarious but challenging too.  The thought that went into the dialogue of GLaDOS, and the pre-recorded messages from Cave cracked me up.  Even the signs throughout the game are funny.  Having worked in the government and in the military, the way Aperture views its employees and test personnel is pretty spot on with the military and government. It's not as blatant as in the game - yet - but everyone knows that as a federal employee or soldier, you're just a number to be replaced at any time regardless of how many cardboard cookies they give you for jobs well done. 

The game play keeps you going and going.  I have to force myself to stop at a new chapter in order to eat, sleep etc. Valve is one of the greats.  I wish I could personally shake (or fist bump) everyone's hand who took part in its development.  Like Bethesda and its Fallout series, Valve is original and produces excellent games. Playing them is like watching a movie you don't want to end. Thank you!"

3080,"ok listen, this is literally one of the best games ever, single-player or multiplayer, so just freaking buy it already, its 10$ (but get the bundle with both games if you don't have the first one)"
3081,"Awesome game, even in 2022. Great puzzles, hilarious dialogue, and immersive environmental storytelling. One of my all time favorites."
3082,one of the best mind bending experiences I've had

3090,yes
3091,You place one portal THEN you place another one and you can walk through it and other things can go through it too like the goo and there is the bouncy goo and also speedy goo then you shoot them out your portals from a tube then you run off the ramp with speedy goo then bounce of bouncy goo and you win the puzzle then you kill the final boss by giving him friends.
3092,"one of the best games
play it"
3093,Amazing
3094,"It made me attracted to talking eye. Wheatley is so seductive, funny, cute, but can be dominant and dangerous as well... Perfect hubby material.

But seriously, I still remember playing this game for the first time and how captivated I was by the characters and plot twists. I love how it expands on the first game and lets you explore the huge, nonsensical facility more in depth. It's an over the top setting and the game presents it just so well. It somewhat feels more alive than the first game, gives off more positive vibes with all the jokes and stuff. That doesn't make the first game worse in any way of course, it just had a very different vibe, more horror-like. I also adore the voice acting in both games.
The puzzles are fun and satisfying, utilizing one of the best game mechanics ever made. There's a lot of new features and obstacles that didn't appear in the first game, so the gameplay is different, and sometimes even more challenging in my opinion.

The multiplayer has its own little story and is very well designed, giving you even more options to play with the portals in a new and unique way. You can hardly find a multiplayer puzzle experience similar to this.

I personally enjoyed it even more than the first game, because the story was on point and the multiplayer was very enjoyable. Both are a gem though."
3095,"The fact that it has taken me until now to review this game is unbelievable, this was the first game i ever bought on steam, I ended up beat the next morning. This game holds a special place in my heart as a game i grew up watching my favorite youtubers play, everything about this game is beautiful. 10/10, thank you valve"
3096,"The original Portal had the element of surprise. Its style of first-person physics-based puzzle gameplay was unique. GLaDOS, the murderous robotic villain, was new and vibrant and evil in the most charming way. Cake jokes and songs about surviving dismemberment were still hilarious. It was short, succinct and essential. Creating a sequel without playing all the same notes and making it feel like Portal: The Longer Version is a tough task. For Valve, it's apparently no problem.
From the first moments of waking up in the rusting Aperture Science facility to right before the credits roll, Portal 2 rarely falters. The world is bigger, the story thicker, and the character development more surprising. The mania of GLaDOS, the facility's operator, is molded into unexpected forms alongside a host of brutally funny personalities. The history of the Aperture Science facility is filled in, character origins discussed, and though its pacing suffers as it occasionally strikes a more serious tone, an abundance of cruel jokes and cheerfully sincere death threats prevent it from losing its sarcastic charm. When you're not staring at your screen with wrinkled, pained expression on your face trying to figure out a puzzle, expect to be laughing."
3097,"One of the best games I've ever played. The story of Portal and Portal 2 was so attention grabbing and personal attachments were made to different characters within the series. Personally, Wheatley had a connection to me when he was on the good side since he felt like a genuine person trying to help and not just some programmed AI giving you instructions in a boring manner. 10/10 would love to play again. 

Sad we'll never see Portal 3"
3098,It’s portal 2 …… need I say more?
3099,Hands down one of my favorite games of all time
3100,"I beat this in 1 sitting, I don't recommend you do the same. Its a good game though just best played slower than what I was playing it. It Really hampered my enjoyment."
3101,Just play it...

3106,Such a great game. Portal was awesome and Portal 2 too
3107,very good game
3108,"A bona fide classic puzzle game that's engaging but never gets super difficult. The dialog and humor has a universal charm similar to a Pixar movie that evens out the serious puzzles to make the experience much more light hearted. Similar to Half Life 2, the environments feel fully realized and lived-in and even sometimes inspire awe with their scale."
3109,i like the living lightbulb
3110,"The best puzzle game, hilarious as well"
3111,good
3112,The voice chat on multiplayer is absolutely amazing go check it out
3113,The perfect follow up to an already amazing first game. It took the original formula and perfected it. The story and lore was amazing and the ending is one of the greatest endings i've ever witnessed in a game. Easy 9.5/10.
3114,
3115,its fun to bully the friend ur playing with
3116,"This is one of my favorite games.  This is one game that I feel everyone to give a go.  I played it long ago on the PS3.  I'm finally playing on PC, man it's just an awesome game.  I look forward to being able to enjoy the mods that are out for it as well.  If you don't know anything about this great game, please watch a couple videos if you must.  This game is special.  I hope to find someone to do the co-op with at some point."

"
3126,"Must-play if you like first-person puzzle games.
Must-play if you like puzzle games.
Must-play if you like games.
Must-play if you don't like games.

Story and puzzles are just as great as in the first game, if not better.
Several new and easy to grasp mechanics have been introduced. 
The Singleplayer campaign is also much longer, clocking at around eight hours. 
In addition, there is a two-player cooperative campaign just as extensive. A blast to play with a friend.
On top of that, in the workshop you can play (basically) infinitely many user-created maps, both Singleplayer and Cooperative. The community is still active, with thousands of maps created each month. 
(Note: sorting these maps by most popular gives you a good overview of [b]some[/b] of the best maps there, but you can also look up curated lists of maps with great puzzle design, for example RedSilencer's ""Introduction to the Workshop"" for Singleplayer.)


Masterpiece."
3127,"The graphics, and story line of this game are great! Totally recommend."
3128,great game. i love it so much! the story line is much better than portal 1 but i like that to. its a real challenge to play but you get the hang of it. valve really outdid themselves!
3129,Wheatley is hot
3130,After playing a second time as of 2022 this is one of the best games ever made. The Narrative and story is just so good.
3131,Funny gaming
3132,this game is very nice
3133,"Very fun game overall. The controls are extremely simple, and the game is fun and intriguing. I would definitely recommend this game."
3134," 0/10. The controls are so bad, when you hit the ""say apple"" button your character also jumps. This speak mechanic is horrible because it never comes back later in the game. Worst of all is the voice acting of this mechanic. There is none for your character at all. If you say apple, he will just silently jump."
3135,fun game just the first one was better
3136,good game
3137,Portal 2 player.
3138,A lot of personality and fun new mechanics
3139,I LOVE THIS GAME !!! ITS 1 OF MY FAVORITES !!!
3140,"JUST THE BEST STORY GAME EVER!
This game takes portal and make a new one but takes out all the crappy stuff and adds a more engaging story and once you finish you don't just have to be done because there's a whole advanced CO-OP mode.
This game is a great original steam game! You do not want to miss out!

Highly Recommend Buying This Game!!

3168,"Portal 2 may very well be the best first-person shooter of the decade it released. The sequel to the legendary Portal, which used incredible mechanics and a fair share of dark humor to captivate its players, Portal 2 simply improved on an already amazing title and literally made it perfect. Unlike the original, which focused primarily on the puzzling tests, this game also featured an incredible story, following the end of Portal. The mechanics alone make a great game, regardless of the way they are used: with your Aperture Laboratories Portal Gun, your protagonist (named Chell) can teleport in marvelous ways. Left click on the mouse, and a blue portal will shoot from your gun and land on the nearest wall, if it is portal conducting. Right click, and an orange portal will come out. You can now walk through either portal and teleport to the other. Some very fascinating concepts spring from this. For instance, if you drop from a ledge and fall into the blue portal on the floor, and you have an orange portal on the wall, you can fly out of the orange at a very fast speed onto another ledge.
The fully voice acted characters are quirky, fully formed, and at times, [REDACTED].
Honestly, the game is worth much more than $10, considering the sheer amount of work it took to create, the replayability, the entirely different co-op campaign, and the endless stream of community levels, plus the easy to use level creator, and of course, the lovely song sung by GladOs at the end.


If you cannot tell already, this game is something you must play. I mean, if you have the devotion to read this entire review, even this tidbit at the end, then you must be thinking about purchasing Portal 2.





Get it.





What more do you want? I gave you a review. It's a perfectly good game. Now you know.





Okay, man. Fine. I'll tell you.





Here it is.

3187,"This game masters the art of unpredictable length. 

If the end goal is clear, you can often try so blindly to reach it that you don't really have fun on the way. If that happends every new level is a new frustration.

In this game however, what you believe to be ends of the game is sprinkled throughout the game, yet you don't feel cheated when there is more. The progress feels real.

Every chapter is as satisfying as it's own game, yet the whole is as coherent as the singular game it truly is."

3199,"Did you know?!! For all its Hollywood antics, impeccable humor, and mature gameplay, Portal 2 remains a hermetic jigsaw puzzle, theatrical first-person sci-fi play. But we love him no less for that.

I think hardly anyone has forgotten Portal, released in 2007. Adventures with a portal gun and a companion cube took no more than 5 hours (considering only a single company). But these adventures remained in the brains and hearts for several years. And then comes April 21, 2011, Portal 2 is released.
Old and new acquaintances.

And now the solemn moment! You eagerly launch Portal 2, start a new game nervously. I would like to say that you rarely see such a richness of events in the first hour spent playing the game: you get acquainted with the nervous Whitley robot trying to save you, demolish several gates, break the room in which you supposedly live, meet the GLADOS machine that you destroyed at the end of the last part and 
many more fun things!

ORIGINALITY:

At first glance, Portal 2 is not far from its predecessor, but this feeling is dispelled after a few tests. Speaking of tests! The local ""brain breakers"" are noticeably relieved, but some still make you think.

PLOT:

The plot is closely intertwined with the last part, similar characters, similar places. But it plays completely differently. In Portal, we spend 95% of the game time running around the laboratory, making holes in space and no plot twists. Here the plot takes up a significant part of the game.We run away from the evil ""aunt"" GLADOS, and almost an hour later, we find ourselves in the same position with her and are forced to help her. Plot twists are waiting for you everywhere, not even an hour of the game passes, as something does not change in the situation.
Many beautifully staged story clips are pleasing to the eye. Portal 2 has noticeably added in directing, which is worth only a fall from 4000m. or even the opening scene, where the game greets you very ""friendly"".

GAMEPLAY:

Portal 2 is the benchmark for video games in the Valve genre. Coming out in the distant 2011, I still want to go through it. Throughout this time, many games have borrowed certain features from ""half life"", which confirms the high level of this game, hundreds of games are equal to it. If for some reason you have not completed this game, then know that it is worth doing. If you like puzzles, you will enjoy it anyway, because this game has its own extraordinary magical atmosphere, this game can still pleasantly surprise you.

GRAPHIC ARTS:

Portal and Portal 2 are classic examples of games where the actual gameplay outperforms the graphics. In any of the games there is nothing particularly remarkable in terms of visual complexity, but the settings are instantly remembered. Bare white walls and ominously mocking voices have left their mark on many gamers. And we're pretty sure no one has forgotten about the crudely painted cake pieces covering some of the walls.Portal 2 creates an atmosphere with well-designed levels of graphics

SOUND AND MUSIC:

At the same time, Valve is honestly trying to complicate and deepen the original sound and music, for which a number of tricks of varying degrees of success have been invented. There are, for example, gels that can be used to cover the surrounding space, some turn any surface into a natural soundtrack, others lubricate it with an accelerating song, others allow you to open portals where it is forbidden to do so in a cake)
Portal 2 containing almost all the music from the game. The soundtrack was released to the public on the Internet in volume after volume over the period. Along with the soundtrack, Valve included several Portal 2-themed ringtones that are regularly used not only for their intended purpose, but also as the song (GLaDOS) sings about is a masterpiece.

The mechanics are simple but the tests can get really hard, especially if you're playing the community made chambers which are a great addition to the game and really add that bit of extra content the game needs. The story isn't very long, as was the case with most games in this era, but it's interesting for the time it lasts and surprisingly has a good variety in environments for a game located solely in a science facility. The co-op half of the game is also a really great addition and not only makes the levels considerably more challenging, but allows for some really fun and satisfying moments finally solving a really tough test chamber. I don't know the price of this game offhand but, whatever it is, it's worth it. There really is no other game like it."

3279,"Jugue el Portal 2 un poco desganado porque había visto gameplay del mismo tiempo antes, pero aún así el juego no me decepcionó para nada. Es un juego de puzzles en primera persona que tiene una excelente música y ambientación, por no mencionar que las mecanicas están pulidas al máximo. Tiene un guionazo y es imprescindible el papel de los personajes en la evolución de la trama. También tiene una musica muy bien escrita y ejecutada, que potencia enormemente el gameplay. Obra maestra, debes jugarlo."

3328,This is a really good game. That's all I have to say.
3329,lemon
3330,Just awesome! Wish I had bought this game (with Portal 1) a lot earlier.
3331,"Played this game in 2011 ish along with Minecraft and it's this single game that has given me so much hope and want to live due to knowing the importance of development in intellectual property like patents that I have devoted much of my working brain when I can to reading patent applications pretending to be one of Cave Johnson's sciencists working on portal technology (well not portal technology necessarily, more just on everyday stuff most people take for granted) . If this game had not existed, I might not be the person I am today, for better or worse, but this game has gotten me through pretty hard times , not that I play it during hard times, but I look back on playing it in 2011 and it gives me a reason to keep pushing forward, because if Cave Johnson was able to do it, so can I, he died for a noble cause and his drive is what's a great personalty trait I try to live forward to. He knew Black Mesa was outbeating him on every corner with government funding but yet he marched on , and invested in the Civillian Sector , or whatever , doesn't matter but he kept on pushing forward and even though he failed miserably and made stupid mistakes like buying moon rocks (earth is made of a decent chunk of moon rocks and he already mined a huge complex in the salt mine for miles and likely already had them), he kept pushing even through bankruptcy and in the end, it was money on pieces of paper but he went beyond a patent application and did the real thing."
3332,Great game but i hate being blown up in co-op :(
3333,BEAUTIFULLY DONE
3334,"i only did puzzles with a friend so far and i love being creative and thinking. if you like solving puzzles in a very eccentric way, portals, get it! i recommend this for sure simply from the co-op itself!"

this game has portals
"
3354,best
3355,"Excellent sequel. The story transitions from the themes of horror and isolation present in the original to a witty, charming, and endlessly funny sequel; it's lighter, but richer too (what an awkward phrase). The puzzles feel slightly easier, but that may just be me learning to think with portals. The graphics hold up too. All in all, it's a great game."
3356,Just the best
3357,ITS FUCKING AMAZING GET IT

3386,Fun and funny. Loved it!!!
3387,Love the puzzles
3388,Truly one of of my favorite possibly the one. It’s an amazing game with amazing gameplay also mixed with amazing writing and beautifully crafted characters. It’s a must play for everyone regardless of you like puzzles or not.
3389,The pure comedy from Wheatly is astounding and is the main reason to play the game. 10 minor cases of serious brain damage out of 10.
3390,amazing 10/10 portal 2 is my favorite game. the cake may have been a lie but these comments are nor
3391,"amazing series. everything steam touches is gold 
"
3392,"A game with a very simplistic concept that goes a long way. Would reccomend if you're into puzzle solvers. It also has a great story, and a plethora of custom levels so you never get bored. It also has a co-op mode, so if you have a friend who has Portal 2, or just generally want to play with a stranger, you can also do that. Plus, it's cheap for the content your getting."
3393,"Cute dating game with cute robots!!!! <3 <3 Absolutley adorable, i love the lemon arc!!! My favorite robot has to be rick, he so gentle and slim <3 UwU Rick>Gladdy"
3394,"have been a fan of portal two for a while now, recently played with my gf. Within 5 levels, all of our relationship problems were solved. Thank you portal 2."
3395,"One of the greatest puzzle games ever made, and one of the greatest story games ever made. plain fantastic and beautifully builds on the world of half life and the original game"
3396,because yes
3397,"very good 
"
3398,I do in fact like the portal in 2
3399,"must have game i enjoyed it a lot
if you just starting pc gaming you should buy it 
and were the f*ck is portal 3 ?????"
3400,yes
3401,play portal before portal 2 trust me its worth it
3402,"Played trough it coop style and gosh it was amazing.
Puzzles making my brain catch on fire. 10/10 need a transplant.
Also why glados insult me i dont understand."
3403,You probably already know about this game. The concept it's cool. Definitely recommend it. Cheers to Valve.
3404,"Absolutely amazing game. Storyline is rich and graphical detail is great. The new mechanics certainly made the game all the more interesting. Valve, I swear, you keep making Portal games, I'll keep throwing my money at them."
3405,"big fun, very cool valve"
3406,if you would like a fun puzzle game with a story and fun mechanics and a run down version of aperture labs. so far this game is a 10/10 and can be played without playing the first game.
3407,I´m in space
3408,Something about cake 2
3409,Eh it was ok tbh. Better played with multiple people.
3410,I like the abuse.
3411,Better than the first game in every way I can think of. Portal 2 is one of the highest rated on steam for a reason. It still has that lonely atmosphere but the changes it does make to the formula are welcome. Not to mention a co-op campaign that doesn't feel tacked on to follow the 7th generation meta at the time. Portal 2 somehow took one of the best puzzle games I've ever made and washed it in comparison to itself. Definitely worth the full price. Only con I can really say is that like with most puzzle games the replay value is low here
3412,i dont even like puzle games but thsi got me addicted tottaly worth trying
3413,So much fun to play this game with mates. Highly recommended. Lots of LOLs to be had.

3426,"Shit game, snooze fest"
3427,"The best puzzle game sequel ever made. It is an emotional roller coaster and very funny, overall one off my favourite games. I Would Recommend trying the co-op to which i havent tried but it is supposed to be good. also check out the community for the game you might like it, it has a good few mods for the game."

If you somehow haven't played the portal series yet please do yourself a favour and try them out, I promise you won't regret it!"
3436,Need portal 3
3437,What do you mean you've never played Portal 2? Drop what you're doing and buy this game right now! Take a day off to complete it if you have to.

3465,"One of the best games I've ever played. The story is phenomenal, and the puzzles are so much fun and can be insanely difficult at times due to all of the mechanics they can use. This is easily Valve's best game as well as my favorite puzzle game of all time."
3466,"11/10 dialogue, humor, gameplay, and puzzles. this game slaps"
3467,"One of my all time favorite games alongside its precursor. Great puzzles, fun story , and wonderful lore. I love it. beyond the single player  story, the multiplayer co-op is excellently designed and very fun. the graphics are also very nice and seamless.
"
3468,awesome game
3469,"A wonderful story-driven puzzle that runs on basically any computer...
Although Portal 2 is a ""direct"" sequel from Portal 1, you don't need it to understand P2, as it catches up the player very effectively. Everything from the jokes to the plot-twist to the puzzle mechanics are extremely well thought-out and polished, and the striking visuals in decrepit Aperture can make your hair stand on end. 11/10 play it now."
3470,its portal

3490,"Even 11 years (jesus fuck that's a long time) after the release portal 2 is still just as polished of a game as it was back then. It's one of those rare instances of a game being evergreen, it still feels fresh and smooth, yeah it does have a very source engine™ feel to it, but that can be a pro or con depending on your affinity for older pc gaming."

3503,Good.
3504,"I felt proud for not looking the answers online while playing with my friends, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment.

The game has a base mechanic, the portal gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through… It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more challenging as you go further in the game.

3512,"One of the best games ever made, a must play. 
It's not necessary to play Portal 1 beforehand (though that adds more to the story)
Fun puzzles that make you think, and a magnificent story. Very rarely do mute protagonists do it for me, but this is the exception. It's funny, it's sad, it's action packed, it's calming. It's everything you could possibly want in a game. I've played this game on two different systems before buying it a third time on pc. 
I replay it every few years, after enough time has passed for me to forget the puzzles.
If I could experience any game for the first time again, it would be this one hands down. I can't recommend it enough."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 26 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3553,"I mean, who can really review Portal 2? It's amazing. It's a classic. If you like semi-dry humour, Stephen Merchant, robots, SPACE, slime, and puzzle solving - HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. This game is enhanced even further by the co-op options in which you play opposing, but loving, co-operate robots. I love my flag hat. Kill your friends. Laugh. Die. Seek the cake. PLAY PORTAL YOU IDIOT!"
3554,good game and im in space
3555,giant robot lady i think
3556,Probably my favorite game now. GLaDOS is bestgirl.
3557,"What can I say about Portal 2? Besides being one of the best games of all times it is one of the best gameplays of all the FPS that I ever played. Never played Portal, play it before playing the sequel. Have you played Portal before, but haven't played Portal 2? Stop what you're doing and play it now."
3558,Super fun game !

3577,very good gameplay and physics
3578,The most impressive game in this genre with very amazing puzzles!
3579,why are you looking at reviews for portal 2 instead of buying it right now
3580,"Even though this game is 10 years, it holds up incredibly well! Especially story and visual wise! 10/10"
3581,pp
3582,it took for ever but it was worth it omg i have to do it 4 more times ughhhhhhh good game tho

3589,"Best game I've ever played. The graphics, humour, gameplay. Everything makes this game amazing. Good job Valve. I've never had so much fun playing a game."
3590,it good
3591,Probably the best puzzle game ever made. The great humor and story are just the cherry on top. The level maker is also great.
3592,"Great game, 10/10"
3593,"highly recomend this game,one of the best games ever made with a amazin storyline and fantastic graphics. it doesnt need a really good pc and can run on a windows 7 laptop. + a amazing ending that makes you shed a tear. 11/10"
3594,It look fine -scott the woz
3595,"I've played this game a couple times through and it is always a joy. Instead of being a game where you spend hundreds of boring hours, it's a solid several hours of fun gameplay. The mechanics are very intuitive and get you used to all the basics very early on and then builds upon those systems. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun adventure.

**Note, I have not played the co-op adventure yet and am only rating the single player adventure."
3596,raggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

3600,<3
3601,cake is a lie multiplayer
3602,there's more companion cube
3603,"It Honestly Doesn't Surprise Me Why This Is The Highest Rated Game On Steam. Probably One Of The Best Games With Impressive Graphics, Tbh This Doesn't Feel Like A Decade Old Game, Also The Ending Is So Good. If You Have Never Played Portal 2 Go On And Try It, It's Really Good."
3604,"They really dont make games like this anymore. When I got into a sci-fi puzzle game, didn't know I would be emotional in the end.. 10/10"
3605,"dead braincells, love it"
3606,This goddamn potato saved my life
3607,it a very good game in my opinion. i play with my friends alot on it i really like fighting wheatley because hes just so funny to shoot at with his own projectiles so please make a third game.
3608,And now I'm thinking with portals.
3609,Fun

3619,what are we some kind of portal 2?
3620,it is so gay i love it
3621,"Portal 1 and 2 are some of my all-time favourite games and have been for years now! Even 11 years after its initial release, this game still holds up so well and is nothing but a complete joy to be able to come back and play!"
3622,It's Portal 2. If you have a Steam account and you don't have this in your library then I don't know what to tell you.
3623,Its Very POG
3624,good stuff
3625,"You open up so many holes, it was amazing!"
3626,I am so dumb...
3627,its so good please dont play if you havent beaten portal 1 but iis so good!
3628,"I have one problem with this game, it's too short!! I also love Wheatley"
3629,found cake
3630,"great game, great co-op, and great quality. 9/10. only thing that's missing that 1 left is it was too short for such a masterpiece."
3631,it is very good i love it the 6th and 7th chapter is incredible
3632,SPAAAAAAAACE
3633,ITS FUN

3644,PLAY TH GMAE
3645,yeah
3646,i love this game the charaters the story its all good can't wait to play this with my friend
3647,Now you're thinkin with portals
3648,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
3649, the game has one of the coolest story lines i've seen and  the mechanics are realy cool
3650,portals
3651,"If you enjoy puzzle games with a lonely aesthetic then this is not the game for you, for that you would like to go to Portal 1. Portal 2 is more ""filled"" with personality's, so at least you wont feel lonely. The truth is, Portal 2 is a good puzzle game that returning fans and new fans will love."
3652,I go back and play this game every year or two.  This is near perfection in gaming.
3653,One of the best games I have ever play + no bald people. 100% recommendation 10/10
3654,absolutely amazing game please pick this up
3655,:)
3656,Nostalgia

3665,funny wheat core
3666,Very nice game! totally recommend it to play it alone and with a friend
3667,"ok deadass: one of the best games i ever played, i know there is alot of of good gamnes to this era: god of war, dmc, yakuza, elden ring and all that shit but nothing can compete with the portal thinking method

Bloody hell, just finished the game and started writing.
Truly a masterpiece that I wish I could forget and replay
For the first time. Bravo VALVE, Bravo. from the characte

Game is truly one of a kind and there will never be any g
-ame as good and as original as this game. I loved it, lov

-eleting this game off of my hard drive, I want more but
There isn't any.  I will come back to this review when I fi

P.S: The Community chamber things IS SUCH a gem of a

Is immense. And I'm glad to have experienced this in my
Life time."
3673,cool
3674,This is great. Sometimes it makes me feel like a Neanderthal. It's really good.
3675,funny portal game but now it has multiplayer

3678,this is like the second game of that cool game called portal
3679,good
3680,"Great game. 10/10
It finalised the story began by Portal 1.
I almost cried at the end, like I had that feeling you feel right before you cry right from the start of GladOS' final goodbye all the way to wheatly's  last words,
The game I tried to avoid at all costs since I was younger came to me, and now I feel upset I wont see more from this franchise.
I am tearing up as I write this,.
Farewell, Portal."

3705,NO CAKEEEEEEE
3706,"Clever and funny writing, objectively one of the best games ever put in the market. The puzzles are fun and easy enough to solve that keep the flow of the game going. The only problem is that it's a little longer than it needs to be, it loses steam around chapter 7. The first half might cause you to develop a humiliation kink. Haven't played the multiplayer because I don't have friends.

All in all, near perfect for what it is. Played it for the first time over a decade after it was released and it's as fresh and impressive. Both Portal games are cream of the crop. Buy them."
3707,Great game. The last hour or two of puzzles were genuinely challenging and the story was unique.

3721,thought portal was a bit to calming and this just made everything is much more interesting and fun and sexy will replay this twice a year bro
3722,"Three words
   Portal 2"
3723,"I don't actually want to type anything here, but Valve forces me too. :I"
3724,"The single-player and cooperative campaigns are a blast to play through. They make you use your brain just enough to solve puzzles, but not so much as to allow players to multi-task and shit. Then you realize that there's an super accessible custom level creator that literally anybody with the game can use. From here you'll either be playing levels that require a goddamn Harvard-level education to solve, or playing levels that were (literally, in some cases) made by a 3-year old on LSD.

So yeah overall it's an okay game I guess."
3725,"although the short game time, the puzzles and the level playing made up for it and it was an all around amazing game."
3726,it lag
3727,"Portal 2 expands upon the first Portal game in every way. The game mechanics have been fine-tuned and expanded. The size of the puzzles have become much larger, and the puzzles themselves have become more complex. Portal 2 is much longer than the first game. The story is filled with more twists. There is much more information about the story to glean from Portal 2 than there was in the first game. Overall, I really enjoyed Portal 2. It is a huge step up from the first game, and it is most definitely worth playing."
3728,worth playing
3729,"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this game yet but seriously though, this game is amazing so if you haven't already played this game before or if you're a fan of the Valve games or something then buy it. It is so fun!

Trust me, it'll be worth it!"
3730,makes my brain hurt in a good way
3731,"A classic. One of the all-time great games.

Engaging puzzles, funny and surprisingly compelling characters, as well as a co-op experience that is unique to video games.

If you haven't played, you're missing out."

3809,"even better than the original, near perfection!"
3810,fun game
3811,The best continuation of the legendary game
3812,"Very good game, especially if you like speedrunning"
3813,yes
3814,"Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.
At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.
The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.
One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.
Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.
I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. 
Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

3907,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

No matter if its full price or on sale it's worth every single dollar. Now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna play this in the shower on the switch."

3941,"Peak Valve gaming, for sure! In terms of single-player campaign this one expands the first Portal game in so many ways. Truly spectacular!"
3942,Great story line and quite a good game.
3943,"This has to be in my Top 3 games of all time. The first one was immaculate, and this one is even better imo. The story is fantastic, the puzzles are challenging and fun, and GlaDOS is at her absolute best. Playing this game is worth it for her alone, shes one of the best videogame antagonists of all time, and Ellen McClain does an absolutely stellar job providing her voice. 

The addition of the co op mode is great, i played it through with my friend (who is much better at puzzle solving than i am) and we had a great time, solving the actual puzzles but also just f*cking around and annoying GlaDOS

Unless the game description sounds unappealing to you, please give this game a try, you wont regret it."

3995,"I don't care what you do with your time and money... so long as portal is involved. Honestly, you can skip portal 1 and not really miss anything. It's a bit like skipping the preface in a book but still starting from the first chapter. After playing through the first chapter you'll understand the scene, plot, and situation. I won't spoil anything, but I can say that this game never gets old. It involves a bunch of puzzles but has a somewhat comedic and somewhat eerie, dystopian twist. Enough of each to have fun while keeping you on your reinforced toes. Besides, it's on sale. You can get both games in a bundle for like a dollar. That's 20+ hours worth of campaign enjoyment(if you're not some speed runner that hates life and plot). I don't know why I'm still rambling. It doesn't take much to become engrossed in the falling apart future."

4050,Some of the most fun I've had in a game in years. The puzzles are hard yet fun and rewarding. The characters are so interesting and lovable. When I finished the main game's story I was desperate to see more of these characters and this world. 100% recommend

4086,"Amazing game. Challenging puzzles, great story and super funny.  Although I think a playthrough of the first game would greatly help new players with the story, it can be played on its own."
4087,"A great sequel to a great game, Portal 2 delivers on more of what was done in the previous Portal by instead having your player character Chell being helped by a new robot character name Wheatley. Just like in Portal, you carry on one-sided conversations with NPCs while solving puzzles to escape from your new situation. This game also has a co-op feature for playing with friends, though it follows a different story that parallels the main one."

4095,"I love this amazing game! It is one of my favorites. If you love puzzle games, you must try this one, but only after playing the first Portal game.  It is very challenging, but incredibly rewarding. I love how immersive the game feels as you engage on solving the puzzles that Wheatley has set for you. Spoiler Alert! ............... I  enjoyed a lot how the game progresses as it take you to the origins of Aperture Sciences Enrichment Center, while reuniting with your clever, and sarcastic frenemy."
4096,I probably have double - triple the time I would've if I wasn't so content on never getting a hint on how to beat a puzzle but it was slightly worth it. Great game though 10/10 genuinely the funniest game(s) I've ever played
4097,"Incredibly noice, play the first game before this tho, not just to understand the story but it also lets you enjoy portal 2 more."
4098,its a brilliant game. 20/10 would recommend

4115,it is hurt my brain
4116,"[h1]Incredible game[/h1]

Absolutely incredible puzzle platformer. This game is the highest rated Steam game of all time, and it is well deserving of that title. The story telling is amazing. The level design is well thought out, and levels progress fluently with one another. The characters are actually fleshed out and have personality to them. I loved every part to this game.

Not only that, but the co-op mode had a lot of thought put into it's level design and storytelling as well as the single player, which is a thing that not a lot of games focus on. It is a really fun puzzle platformer to play with a friend.

Please pick up this game if you haven't already. You will not be disappointed :)"
4117,All time favourite of mine. Great story line and puzzle like game play.
4118,just play the game damn it!
4119,"All of my reviews are memey, but this one, no.
I respect and love Portal 2, its a great game, a beautiful story and a challenging puzzle game.
And the CO-OP has brought some great memories I'm glad I was able to make with friends.
There's plenty more to say, but I'm not good with words, but if you're into puzzle games and like a good story every now and then, get Portal 2."
4120,just play it its only a buck fifty on sales

4122,One of the best games ever made.

4124,One of the greatest games of all time. Must play.
4125,jogo portal muito bom 2
4126,"Brilliant game that stood the test of time. Puzzles that are decently challenging, cool narrative and the sense of scale with how monolithic most structures are as well as the price tag, makes this a no brainer to recommend as a triple A single player game. Co op adds a little more to this perfect cake but if i had to nitpick most of the co op stages are very simple compared to the single player (aside from the additional courses)."
4127,"The epic second part of the most revolutionary game in industry, love this game and Valve for this masterpiece."
4128,So much fun!!!

4130,Great game :)
4131,"Man, this is a good game. Puzzles are interesting, sometimes pretty hard. The graphics really suit the atmosphere they were going for, and the story... It's great. I love looking out, in the underground, wondering... what was this place like, when it was working?

4143,PHENOMENAL GAME AND MOST OF ALL GOD TIER VOICE ACTING.  100/10
4144,"about 7 hours long, and really fun. i brought it simply because it was on sale; and yet its still a timeless classic that i really enjoy. this is only the 2nd time ive truly played through it and its about a 7 hour game (2 hour if you're a speedrunner) but its a blast through and through, and genuinely worth the FULL price. almost a decade and this is still one of the best singleplayer and co op games out there, valve hit gold with this one and didnt even sell out. i'd love to see more of GLADos and Wheatley, they play off each other soo well. the story is super well written in both the plot and the characters themselves. alot of great jokes and funny moments, like wheatley calling you a ""fatty fatty no parents"" because you're an orphan. i cant wait for a couple years so i can play through this again."
4145,good
4146,"10 years late to the game, but I could not resist playing this magnificent game. Needless to say, you should too. Fantastic puzzles for all ages, hilarious comedy, and wonderful sense of impending doom."
4147,
4148,"Great game! The uniqueness of the levels and the puzzle solving really makes you engaged. Learning all the strategies and paths will make you say ""OHHHHHH I SEE"" 8.5/10 game most definitely!"

4163,"consider this a follow up to my portal 1 review, this game manages to become 10x more cursed, this time the valve guy starts TURNING AROUND, if the last game was cursed, this game is outright satanic, i again urge people to stay away from this game at all costs."
4164,"Absolute must play, especially once you've played portal 1. I can't believe I put this game off for so long, such a masterpiece of gaming. Short and sweet which I consider a plus."
4165,Humorous story & fun puzzles.
4166,very fun
4167,.
4168,"TLDR: Very creative sequel and a great one at that
So i dont have a very good description on how good this game is, it has a good story and way more gameplay than the first portal game but it has so much to say about, from the overgrowth in the original stages to the new ways for movement (repulsion, propulsion, and portal surface gels), having a new character and much more. the end scene (along with the space scene) are very unique and remember the companion cube from the first game? you end up getting it back at the wheat field scene

10/10 reunite with companion cube"

4176,good game slug recommend
4177,good game 10/10
4178,"The game lives up to its hype. 

That's it. That's my review. Play it.

P.S. This game is a lot more CPU heavy than GPU. Make sure you're fans are running at high enough speed to keep your temps under control."
4179,Fun
4180,"Absolute classic, and it still holds up as a banger story ad puzzle game"
4181,"great game. my favourite part about it is that it has more comedy,its longer and you revisit the old facility!
I still can't get over that we got to put a portal on the moon!
A portal 3 would blow the internet!"
4182,"I really, REALLY like Portal 2. I really like it because of this one feature, Community Test Chambers. Creating your own tests is really cool! I also really like how at the end, you go to the moon! Wheatley was also a really good add in too. So I really recommend this game to others who have or haven't played Portal 2 or Portal."
4183,"Nice puzzle game,relaxing at the same time."
4184,good game funny gaben
4185,i cant kill the potato woman who killed my friend cube and i cant kill wheatley or turn him into bread
4186,Amazing Voice acting and story. love the challenging puzzles. Love This!
4187,"now there is 2 talking robots



awesome"
4188,This game is SUPER fun. i would 100% recommend this title to anyone who has played the first game!
4189,"This game is top tier. It has all the aesthetics and visuals of a dystopian science fiction game and the concepts of non-euclidean physics, gravity and portal concepts make for a stunning presentation. 10/10"
4190,top
4191,Rich atmosphere paired with incredible voice-acting and gameplay makes this one of my favorite games of all time.
4192,"Played this game back when it initially launched in 2009 I believe it was for PS3. Came with a steam key which was nice. This is a classic. If you enjoy the first Portal game, this one is much more ambitious, longer, has tougher puzzles and even co-op multiplayer with specifically curtailed puzzles just for that mode where teamwork is very important.

It's hilarious as ever with GlaDos being one of the funnier characters in the last couple decades.

The only thing I want from this game is closure... it ends on an even more ambiguous note and Valve apparently doesn't make games anymore lol"
4193,h
4194,"This game is my whole life. I offer to every person which I meet to play Portal 2 with me. It’s my childhood, my life."
4195,I like going in and out of places. Just like your mom

4208,overall good puzzle game and if you have friends its got some fun co-op
4209,i made a penis with boxes and it was the greatest moment in gaming. The game's alright too i guess.
4210,you shoot two portals to solve puzzles.
4211,"Amazing game. Insanely fun. Looks amazing for an 11 year old game, and has realy creative storyline. If you have a friend who has this game, it's insane fun."
4212,good game :)
4213,Classic.
4214,it's cool
4215,"If you thought Portal 1 was good, you would be blown away of how good Portal 2 is. Rich environmental story telling, with some of the most recognizable, best, and funniest characters in gaming. Buy this game!"

4224,"Top 3 video games of all time!

(check  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648163/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0  if you don't believe me)"
4225,Well first valve game(i will check portal 1 for sure after this) i play and makes me said to realize that valve has stop making games(not counting the VR games since i think VR in general is kinda meh). We are in a day and age where games have stop being good or at least triple AAA is so hard to find good ones with the exception of some comp like fromsoftware. This game makes me happy and sad at the same time was so fun and so good to play but the thought that we will not get another gem from valve makes my heart broke. Please Valve come back we need you to make games again.
4226,Great game. Great soundtrack. Great puzzles. Great Atmosphere. Excellent Voice acting.
4227,"Honestly a huge step up from the first game in every way. I really wasn't ready for how good the graphics are for a 2011 game, and the new features and lore kept surprising me. Play the game, its worth your time!"
4228,"the graphics are AMAZING for this game, the lore is good aswell"
4229,havent finished playing but this is nice :)
4230,"truly something else i kinda didnt like ""the fall"" part of the game but every thing else makes up for it"

4242,If u have friends bought it
4243,Everyone falls in love with GLaDOS.
4244,Portal
4245,Story so good and engaging finished the game in one sitting in 5.4 hours. However if you dont rush you can get 7-8 hours of just story mode which is a great mind-boggling gigantic world with you in a pickle or two. Worth all the money especially on summer sale.
4246,Even better than the first game. Narration is funny and puzzles are challenging. Probably one of the best game sequels.
4247,GREAT GAME
4248,"It's a fascinating game with loveable characters and an engaging story. The puzzles are of similar difficulty as they were in the first game, but that doesn't make them any less enjoyable. The co-op is also remarkably satisfying. Primarily because of the unique levels and the need to cooperate with your friend. Also, who could forget about GLaDOS mocking you once again. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is the style of challenge levels from the first Portal. But this is outweighed by the story, co-op and community modifications like Portal Reloaded. Overall, I enjoyed Portal 2 so much that I'll have to replay it sometime in future."
4249,i played with funny portals then i got scaryd and quit!!!!
4250,yes
4251,I want to put my pp in glados

"
4255,   portal
4256,Classic game. Good puzzles. Good Story. Awesome.
4257,"The #1 game I've played period.

Absolutely amazing story, puzzles, characters, and everything. I first played Portal 2 before I was in grade 6, and yet it's still the one game I can come back to every few months and replay and STILL find something new and charming about it.

I seriously cannot praise this game enough. Especially given that it's like $2 most days with steam sales. And while you're at it, get the original so you can have the full experience."

Personal Notes: OMG! Where do I even start the story is 10 times better than the original and the gameplay is 10 times better than the original, I could write a 10 page essay on everything about Portal 2, Let's go more in-depth (no spoilers but i recommend you play the 1st Portal) The continuation is very well executed and the way the story switches up mid game is  phenomenal. I'm not going to bore you, The atmosphere is executed way better than Portal 1 and you really get to experience a post-apocalyptic game and its gets you emersed into the story but like the last game I found myself searching a playthrough at some times. 10/10 would play both Portals again."
4263,"This game is funny as hell
and good as hell
and great as hell
and awesome as hell"
4264,"needs more pickles, but it's good."
4265,"Honestly beautiful.
It's a once in a gaming experience.
GLaDOS <3"
4266,"One of the most endearing, well written, funniest but also tragic games I've played with iconic, lovable characters, especially Rattman if you learn about him and why the song Exile Vilify in the game exists for him and Chell too.

Stephen Merchant does a great job with Wheatley as expected and the new overgrown ruins of Aperture Labs and the new test chambers are a glorious, beautiful sight to behold. The new gameplay mechanics including the paint gels especially are extremely fun and game changing and the co-op is HILARIOUS and a MUST PLAY with a good friend and voice chat or so.

They took a demo made for experimentation/fun and turned into an amazing, iconic game that was way more successful than they anticipated. Now they made a sequel to that game that develops on that game IMMENSELY in so many ways and is such a unique, stand alone experience too.

Portal 2 is absolutely incredible and I will always love it."

4275,Such a fun game and an awesome experience. I got a girlfriend after I started playing. Correlation = causation.
4276,"A perfect sequel to the original (which I recommend you play first because it's a mastapeece). The gameplay has been heavily expanded and feels fresh even after playing Portal 1, and the story is a lot meatier with a lot more lore and backstory to the Portal/Half-Life Universe. While I haven't played it yet, the level creator and co op adds more replayability than the original. 10/10 Oscar Grammy Award"

It is my opinion, but I think this is definitely harder than portal 1.
now if you liked portal one than you have to get this game, it is worth every penny it costs.
Now you should probably install it right now. I have also seen that people search for negative reviews. if you are one of them:

STOP IT!!! JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY!!

4338,"Wow, game gives super fun time...very good. Could be better optimised for modern pc's. I'm sure my computer could handle loading the next level as I'm about to finish the current one. Loading screens are a buzz killer."
4339,play it
4340,"okay, honest review

got to be one of the best stories in gaming history. the gameplay could be confusing at times but still fun. truly a masterpiece"
4341,"Literally Portal 1 on steroids, this game can't get better."

4348,so the game crashes sometimes and i have to restart my computer sometimes please fix this bug.but other than that its a good game
4349,I loved it a vary good game!
4350,"Portal 1, as impactful as it was and still is, was only a glimpse into the unique identity Aperture Science would come to accrue. Apart from the still impressive portal gun mechanics, most of the bones constructing that first game's skeleton are obvious reapplications of Half-Life 2 assets. With the sequel, almost nothing like that is present at all--everything feels uniquely Portal. Some mechanics, like the red lasers, are both functional replacements and vast improvements over older, similar concepts (in this case, the energy balls.) There are also more efficient, not to mention cooler methods of building and releasing momentum for movement-heavy puzzles. Heck, functionally turrets are the exact same, but their placement is carefully calculated for minimum cheese and maximum squeeze, and it makes all the difference in the world. The Portal series really came into its own with this wildly innovative sequel, and no gamer's collection of experiences is complete without it.

tl;dr my key point here is how this game reinforced the series' identity, but in general, Portal 2 is mandatory gaming, go play now"
4351,its really fun to play i would recommend
4352,10/10 has homicidal birds.
4353,"This is my first time actually playing this game on PC.
Now, while it is a good game, what makes it a GREAT game is the fact that it doesn't have Colin Hanks in any capacity. This is what true gaming is all about."
4354,robot wife
4355,"What can be said about this classic that hasn't been said already? The story is very good and its hard to get lost, even if you haven't played the first one, the portal mechanic is still the most unique game play tool I've seen in recent years, and the game isn't too long that it starts to drag but not too short either. If you haven't tried it yet I highly recommend getting this game. ^^"
4356,this game stress me out of my mind!!!

4415,absolute phenomenon
4416,"Hands down best puzzle game ever made.  Granted, Im not a huge puzzle dude but this game had fun enough machanics.  However, the reason i love the game so much is the story and its presentation.  It isn't the best story ever made, but it blew me away for this sort of game.  9.5/10"

4460,hard
4461,This is and was one of the best games that ive ever played. The atmosphere is both humorous and tense. The puzzles were hard but satisfying to complete and the story line was great. I litelary have no improvements on this game other then graphics which were good back when this was released. Overall i completly and totaly recommend putting all your attention on this game even if you havent played the first.
4462,11 years later and still just as iconic.
4463,unga bunga is confused.

4471,Good game
4472,An amazing sequel to the original. Would 100% buy it.
4473,The characters ruin my self-esteem
4474,"I think I get it now. I think I understand why Portal 2 is the greatest game of all time. I don't know why it took me so long, but I get it now. It's the fact that the game has so much content, something is bound to appeal to you. People love the story of Portal 2 and how it recontextualizes the first game, for good reason. The story of what happened at Aperature captivates people, obviously. But the gameplay is relatively standard compared to the first game, with some new mechanics added. I'm not gonna get too into it, but it's very clear that the Multiplayer is a big factor as well, for good reason. It allows for so many unique ideas that wouldn't be possible in singleplayer. There's also a level creator, allowing you to do the obvious, allowing people to express their creative wings through portal. If you are a fan of first person shooters, multiplayer games, story-focused games, level creators, the like, something in Portal 2 will appeal to you. I whole-heartedly reccomend it."
4475,loads of single player content
4476,Masterpiece and a great co op experience
4477,"Really fun, def worth it"
4478,"I wonder why I didn't play this game even though I heard a lot about it. Its an incredible puzzle game that, I recommend to everyone."
4479,Immensely enjoyable ... Portal cam out in 2007 #1 and 2011 #2 and they both still stand up today. The playability as well as the storyline and writing are top notch. You WILL laugh out loud !!
4480,Graphics are *chefs kiss* and the rich storyline is very great. The co-op mode was very well thought out and perfectly fits the game.
4481,spaaaaaaaaace
4482,"bought this came for 0.20 cents

worth it"
4483,"Fun fact if you're obsessive like I am, please PLEASE don't find a friend who will play games like this with you. For multiple months all I did all day every day was play this alone and then community chambers with a friend after midnight every night. It is an amazing game but it's downfall is it is too good and will become a permanent part of your soul.
Be careful kids."

4508,"great game, easy levels, hard levels, nearly impossible feeling levels. will make you feel stupid and frustrated. will challenge your problem solving abilities and patience. exactly what you would hope for in a puzzle and reasoning game. it forces you to think outside the box in a way that truly makes you feel rewarded to reach the end of particularly difficult puzzles. the workshop has amazing fan-made puzzles to solve which increases its playability 100%."

4514,"An amazing game. I'm not sure how many times I've replayed it between my Xbox 360 and Steam, but at least 10 times, and it's a joy every time. 
If you haven't experienced this game yet, you need to. It's short, replayable, and sometimes difficult."

4523,This is Portal 2. Physics puzzles everywhere!
4524,If you need a co-op game this is the game for you! The unique challenges presented are very fun and test your intelligence and if you're a troll like me mess with your friend :)
4525,mio-n approves
4526,Portal 3 pretty please with a cherry on top valve
4527,"This game pleases me.
It will likely please you."
4528,This game is incredible! Amazing puzzles that will test your logic and spatial skills. It has a good pace with some nice twists and turns in the narrative. I think it improves on Portal in every way and keeps the same humour that was so good in the first game. I only wish the main story was longer! But there are also the community test chambers that can arguably be harder than the main game puzzles if you are up for more of a challenge. Overall a really good value game you should try. It also runs on pretty well on older laptops in my experience.
4529,I like.
4530,This is a masterpiece I NEED PORTAL 3
4531,worth it

4539,"Welcome to Team Fortress 2. After nine years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!"

It had a lot more story, in depth mechanics, and just overall fun times than the first game in the series. If you havent yet played it yet like I just barely did, then I fully recommend trying it at least for 1 playthrough."

4610,It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
4611,"Portal 2 is the quintessential co-op experience. Everything about it is the definition of team-oriented, from challenging puzzles to timing your jumps, this game will force you to work with your partner to overcome all obstacles. An absolute blast from beginning to end. 9/10"
4612,fun game
4613,Good game: The Sequel
4614,Loved the part where he kills you.
4615,"I cant believe it my friend was obsessed for thios game that I had to play and you know what it was hard I got very confused because I saw PORTAL s in places and I didnt know how to shoot TWO portals and I wasnt sure ifd I should be FANBOY some times it takes some WORK and since I am a BOY it was so good I had to play in school. I wouldnt recomend being on any DRUGS playing this because I dont think it would change this game for the better. I was platying this game and saw something very cool but it was good that I RECOREDED IT. I couldnt bellieve that someone said this was a guy only game its very sexist even though IM A GUY. SOme people call me PIZZA because I own a bakery and play this there. The bottom line is taht I would play this when I would take a mental health day from school and I LIKE IT. My mom said if I play  this TOO MUCH THOUGH i CANT GO TYRICK OR TREATING THIS YEAR, but she just wants ATTENTION"

It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
To kill me twice?
Oh, how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here, too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
If it weren't so sad
Well, you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone

4646,"genuinely one of the greatest games ive EVER played, if not the greatest
in all fairness, this may be a bit of nostalgia talking, saying that portal 2 is one of the first games ive ever played, and ive honestly done at least 2 runs for every year ive had it (prolly since around 2014), but i honestly cant point out a single flaw with the game, it never gets old, the characters are amazing, they told the story perfectly, and honestly its such a joy to play

(NOTE/EDIT) before i look dumb, i only got the game on steam recently, ive mostly played it on xbox"
4647,"this game made me feel like i was being stabbed in the chest, but in a good way. awesome"
4648,"It is not a very long game, but its a must play. Lot of funny achievements"
4649,"It's been 5 hours without Fortnite, I can’t stop shaking and I’m having severe mental breakdowns. I woke up today trying to log onto Fortnite but the servers were down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldn’t go to school today, I am so worried that I even took my dad's gun from the shed, thinking of killing myself. I am nothing without Fortnite, it is my life, it is my destiny, without Fortnite, I wouldn't be able to do anything. Fortnite is the best thing ever made and I can't get rid of my addiction to it, it is the best game in existence. I can't stop trembling and crying, I am very worried. I can't reach 20 kills in un-filled squads. I can't play FFA box fights, I am trembling more than the marleyans experienced when the rumbling was around. Shivering in fear of losing my progress at my weekly missions. I am so scared that I might lose my mind and go insane. I want Fortnite back."

4732,"i finished the game last night and this was seriously the best game i played in ages. the gameplay itself was a pain sometimes, but i think thats just because i suck at puzzle games. well written story, well executed character development,  great soundtrack, amazing animations and a lot more. 
this game has like the best ending in all of gaming history. i think it wrapped up chell's story very well but it would be great to see a third game one day. if portal 3 ever actually becomes a thing, i hope wheatley and the space core will be in it somehow"
4733,"amazing game

just buy it

Cheap, runs well on older hardware, amazing gameplay, not too challenging, has co-op to play with friends, funny characters, good story, everything about it is just good, I didn't even encounter a single bug in my playthrough of the game."
4734,Puzzles :)

4743,This happened to me
4744,Good Game
4745,glados is real
4746,everything about this game is firee
4747,Valve never disapoints. Can't wait for Portal 3 Kappa (will never happen)
4748,"Where do I even start? This game is phenomenal. From the characters to the story all the way down to the level design and puzzles, this game never fails to impress.
The story is fantastic, getting to learn more about Aperture and the backstory of GLaDOS was something I wanted to know for ages after playing the original.
The characters are the cherry on top though. Wheatley is hilarious, and GLaDOS is well, do I even need to explain?
And Co-Op. The hours I spent in Co-Op with my friends and family are something I'll never forget. The amount of times I had to explain what a portal gun was and how to use it, how to solve puzzles, and everything in between are things I won't forget ever.

10/10, fantastic game."
4749,"it has a cool gun athat makes holes
"
4750,yes
4751,One of the greatest Steam games of all time.
4752,Amazing experience.
4753,"Im not gonna lie portal is one of my favorite games is really entrataining the puzzles are challenging, it has a very good story and the dialog gets really funny."
4754,iminspace
4755,Fun continuation from the first
4756,"I shat myself while playing this, its a good game though."
4757,It's just sooo good

4760,EPIK!
4761,"yo mama was so stupid
she thought twitter
was social media

XBOX LIVE"
4762,"Hmmm. strategy? Oh yeah! I would never recommend playing this game on a controller though.

This will be the long time awaited replay of the game with a GTX card.

I could not imagine this game with a VR ... once the price comes down on a RTX card and a legit VR set. So I will just have to imagine in SHD 1080 P. Could you imagine this in VR?

Still awesome with your just ol mouse and keyboard cranked up to 1920 x 1080 Super Dynamic Resolution.

Sure, you could tell your NVIDIA driver to ASPECT your RES to 4K, but it is summer now and no sense an overcooking your GPU. Wait until winter unless you live in Alaska to do that. Wait, wait you got a water cooled RTX... by all means, any water cooled GPU have at it... but this is certainly not the game to test it."
4763,It's okay
4764,You play as a potato's best friend
4765,very amazing puzzle/adventure game with lore
4766,good puzzle gmae
4767,its fun and the story makes it even more fun as well as the testing
4768,Beated the game in 6.3 hours. took abit of time because of lack of expirience. still good game. been trying to play it for a long time. still will try to get more achievements.
4769,The best game that i have played all year. genuine 10/10 title.
4770,This game is raw as fuck
4771,Never will I forget the perfection that is Portal 2
4772,"10/10    

would help a robot potato"
4773,i love this game it's beautiful way better then portal 1 I did find some glitches but there very minor overall 7.5/10
4774,Hideo Kojima was really lacking when he brought out this game until they added single player

4782,"The game is very fun, and you can build your own test chambers. You can also play with you friends or someone random online. People making these test chambers are very creative."
4783,"Big mama glados  saved my life and became a potato
11/10 would play again"
4784,"My friends can't keep up my smoothest of brains.  Also, my one friend just got back from vacation and we think the one guy who watched his house at the cat poop"
4785,nice
4786,"its good
"
4787,"I've got to say, that was one hell of a ride. I can't even express how many hours I spent on this game. Portal 1, on the other hand, felt pretty easy when I first played it. It took me about 4 hours to complete it. Don't get me wrong, I think they're both great. I don't often to play co-op though, but yet I have to admit, this is a really great game and I think you should buy it regardless."
4788,"This was triumph.
I am making note here, huge success.
Its hard to overstate my satisfaction.

10/10 hands down."
4789,"Блин, а что такое сейф?"
4790,da

4797,awesome game 100% would recommend

4837,"definetely recommend buying the valve complete pack (on sale as of writing this review), you get all of the portals and other valve games. very fun with friends when playing custom workshop coop campaigns."
4838,I like that the puzzles have some physics involved. The puzzles also make you use your brain.
4839,Nice puzzle game to play with your brother when you return home once a year.
4840,"Portal and it's sequel are excellent staple puzzle games, and the ability to remote play together really puts this up into the level of staple, required games in my opinion (especially as it is frequently very cheap)."
4841,Fun
4842,best puzzle game ever!
4843,this game is great!
4844,Still a masterpiece.
4845,This is a great game if your into puzzles and all sorts of confusing things! This gets the mind working while telling the story behind the portal. All sorts of fun things to do while following around the audio tapes.
4846,"A amazing game overall. Great puzzles, story, and humor. One of my personal favorite games of all time."
4847,real gud
4848,had an argument with a power mad british man and killed him with the help of a potato
4849,game good. had fun.
4850,i love portals
4851,"10/10

This game stands the test of time. Even after 11 years its just as good as I remembered."
4852,"yazz queen

4853,"One of the best games out there, you will fall in love with the story! I loved portal 1 and ofc I got 2! The co-op mode is worth it! HUGE RECOMMEND!"
4854,:)
4855,"portal is cool and trippy, would recommend"
4856,Very good puzzle game. Fun to play with family and friends (minus the family and friends)
4857,"Really fun game, some of stages are hard but fun to solve. I suggest you to play it."
4858,gud game
4859,1 of the best games ive played
4860,"Was gifted the game because I held out on buying it myself. Honestly after playing through it I definitely would have bought this myself. Unlike the first portal game, the online co-op mode and the custom test chamber feature give this game infinite replayability beyond that of the main campaign. Good stuff."
4861,very good game
4862,I AM NOT A MORON!!!
4863,Still holds up! A must play for everyone.
4864,cute cube
4865,this is one of the best Games i ever Playd
4866,This game is very fun but some of the stages of the game legit fry your brain. Its quite hard puzzle game but the graphics and the story is one of the best. I would give it 8/10.
4867,a very good game
4868,llololololo
4869,"Nice game. Good mechanics, good puzzles, good story. Nothing that hasn't been said before."

4874,"Very good single-player, didn0t expect to see GLaDOS as a potato. Anyways the multiplayer tells its own story as well, also in one of the single-player levels for the game there is a cameo of the robots following you and doing their own tests"
4875,very good me like
4876,"Great puzzles and history.
The only drawback are loading screens at some specific moments that interrupt the experience (not every of them), but overall I enjoyed it a lot."
4877,Just play it!
4878,Teleportation is cool !
4879,good
4880,I loved  the game but the part where i got launched out into space yeah that is the part which I hate the most  thgers not even good internet out here -by wheatly
4881,"overhyped imo, im sure most people just cheat the level, plus the fandom around this game is reddit tier"
4882,gud gaem
4883,Probably the greatest sequel I've ever played. They went so much further above and beyond what I could have expected a Portal 2 to be. It's super sad to stand in the empty dry dock of the Borrealis knowing that we will most likely never get to see the ship - but I am so incredibly thankful to have this game. It almost makes up for no HL3
4884,Pretty dope. Wish they made a 3rd one.
4885,Nice puzzles & story
4886,"Short game (5ish hours), but amazing and so worth the price."
4887,I like my robot partner but i hate the mean robot
4888,yes
4889,"I help thicc robot lady to beat bri'ish robot man

4890,"---PROS---
A phenomenal game in both story and gameplay, with enough content to last hours for what you pay. 10/10.

---CONS---
Game does not contain Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance"

4901,portal go pew pew and person go fly
4902,"I absolutely love this game! The story is great, and the puzzles are great. Everything is great. I love the character development throughout the story and learning more about the past of Aperture. This sequel to the already great Portal 1 game is perfect! The game takes about 2 hours to go through the story but I have over 40 hours in the game. It has a lot of replayability and community maps are great. Not only is the story great but the humor within the story is hilarious! This game has some of my favorite lines in any game/movie. It is a MUST PLAY!"

4915,Best game
4916,"If Portal 2 was a person, I'd fuck it so hard because this game is so good man, in conclusion it's a very good game."
4917,i really like the idea of navigating out of test rooms with portals! i wish i knew how to code a game like this myself.
4918,Nice a bit complicated in a few places (but that is pointed out)
4919,"1. launch game
2. wait for your friend
3. realise your friend dont like this game anymore because it's old
4. contemplate your loneliness
5. decide whether to play alone

4923,"Very good, the puzzles and the story is fantastic. They say don't humanize you're villain but here it really works, and i like how we go through the ages of aperture and gladOS' passive aggressiveness makes for some really funny dialogue. Infinite repeatability 10/10."

4964,"The story mode really made justice. It's well written as always and chalked full of puzzles to solved.

In my opinion though, the real gem of this game is the workshop content, especially the co-op chambers.

This is a great co-op puzzle game with limitless content thanks to the workshop."

5049,"It's just a good game, I definitively recommend it."
5050,"contrary to what my play time implies, i've actually played this game through I just did it on a friend's account.

You'll like it if you like...
- Fairly complex puzzles
- A neat sci-fi atmosphere that's vaguely reminiscent of horror
- Teleporting a lot
- Having a robot voice insult and converse with you for hours

You won't if...
- You like combat and want to fight enemies
- You prefer open world games
- You want to loot and/or collect things

5089,"This is my favorite game. When I try to explain the conceptual video game as an art medium this would be my top example to point to in terms of AAA gaming. The way Valve melds story and gameplay elements makes Portal 2 a joy to play, and something to keep coming back to years down the line.

Simply a must play."

5094,"- start playing the game
- have fun for a bit
- eventually reach chapter 8
- it gets more challenging
- get stuck on a chamber for half an hour
- check how hard the game is on google to validate yourself getting stuck for so long
- everyone is calling the game a cakewalk
- ""The puzzles in Portal 2 weren't challenging in the slightest""
- after a few minutes of research, realise just how stupid you are
- rest of the game becomes more and more soul crushing when success isn't immediately found
- feel like shit for the rest of the experience
- weep at your own incompetence afterwards

good game, just made me feel like genuinely awful.

5133,"OH MY GOD. Sequels are normally hit or miss but Portal 2 is an absolute hit. They did such a good job adding new mechanics, story, etc: While also keeping true to what was set in Portal 1. I absolutely love this game and It's always so much fun to playthrough."
5134,"One if the best games ever made. And thats fact. My favorite game for years now. Good written, entertaining and funny."
5135,"Portal 2's co-op is pretty fantastic in that it is a completely different experience than the single player, in every aspect. The story is different, the characters are new, and the puzzles are two-player required. While many games that feature co-op, if they even bother, just toss both players together in the single player campaign, that would have been disastrous with a puzzler like Portal 2. So major props to Valve for developing this campaign, just for us."

5143,"The Portal series of games is a series of puzzles that are solved using spatial portals.
By and large, Portal 2 is still the same Portal only with the nuts twisted. All the advantages of the first part are present in the sequel - great music, eye-pleasing graphics, interesting humor"
5144,Great game! My favorite game at the moment because of how much content is has for you to enjoy over time. I thought it would be like portal 1 being able to beat the game in one sitting but this game has a lot more content and has more features that aren't in the first portal game! Would recommend!

5160,one of the best games ive ever played
5161,This game will never get old
5162,"--- One of the best games I have ever played ---

I had an absolute blast playing Portal 2 - and I'm sure everyone else has. It does make you think, so it isn't too easy, but that isn't really why I love it. I love it because, well, it is fun. The game actual feels like it is made to be enjoyed - with great jokes everywhere and not overwhelming you with new mechanics. The game introduces new mechanics to you slowly, and so that they make sense. The return of GlaDOs is incredibly welcome, but the new character of Wheatley is probably what makes me love this game so much. ""What you just did there is jumped.""

So yeah, if you haven't already... PLAY THIS GAME!"
5163,This is a great game. It has many puzzles and u can make the things. (thicc)
5164,very good game
5165,"Wowzers this is one of the best games i have played' i finished it 4 times now, and it wasn't even boring replaying the whole thing a day after beating it! really reccomend"
5166,"Pretty cool game, especially in coop"
5167,Good game if you have a brain lol.
5168,"I played Portal 2 on release in Spring 2011 on PS3. Now that I'm back to PC Gaming after a 16 year hiatus, it is so good to play Valve's gems. Wishing for a Portal 3 and of course Half-Life 3."
5169,bad game dont ever play with friends you WILL hate them for the rest of your life
5170,its a good game. needs more content and more dlc s to be honest but the core idea is one of the best among puzzle games
5171,
5172,n
5173,10/10 Valve makes good games
5174,portal 2 so good!

5176,
5177,It's pretty good but it can be very laggy
5178,"This game is a Masterpiece. Definitely one of the best video games ever.
I've played for more than 100 Hours and still have a lot of fun. The main story is awesome but the Co-Op is simply perfect and haven't found a single bug after all this time.
Best money i ever spend.
Congrats to the team and the community who keeps creating new maps."
5179,It's more Portal.
5180,best game I've ever enjoyed playing co-op
5181,"Is this Stephen Merchant's best work? Yes, I think it is."
5182,the extra puzzles are SO much fun. Workshop maps also rule. Fun for days
5183,"The overall experience is great if you like puzzles and a decent story. 
Would definitely recomend this classic."

5211,"Playing this game with your friends be like:
""I AM NOT A MORON!"""
5212,its fun and you have to think
5213,This game is pretty drippy
5214,"This is a linear story game that is maybe about 3 hours long at most. Somehow I have 100 hrs in the game. This world has occupied my mind ever since I first played at the age of maybe 7 or 8. Portal 2 is a masterclass in world building and character. Years later, I see this game as an essential part of my outlook on life, as it perfectly encapsulates my own fear of what the world could look like. They didn't just imagine a bunch of puzzles involving a portal gun, they created context and a society around said gimmick. It's a beautiful experience."
5215,i stg if you havent played this game you need to. definitely play portal 1 first but you will not regret playing this. its the best puzzle game youve ever seen
5216,BBRRIIISSSHHHH
5217,good video game
5218,"it good
"
5219,"this game is an absolute masterpiece, and WHERE IS PORTAL 3???. All jokes aside this game is fantastic."
5220,kinda funny
5221,"I first started playing the Co-op of Portal 2 with my dad when I was twelve on our Xbox 360. I fell in love with the game and thought it beautiful that after watching my dad play the first game for years that the devs took the time to make a second game with a two-player feature. It was only later that I learned about the single-player mode and fell in love with that as well. The story was well-executed, with twists and turns and a heartwarming end. The concept was truly something special, and overall this game holds a special place in my heart to this day.
Years later, I bought a Portal board game for my dad, titled: Portal: the uncooperative cake acquisition game. With it came a free copy of Portal 2 for Steam. After asking my dad if he wanted it, to which he said no (he already owns the Orange Box), I was able to get my own free copy of the game. It's even better than I remember with the new(ish) Test Chamber Building feature.
Anyway, if you're reading this, know that I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes that ""I DID IT!!!"" feeling, anyone with a quick sense of humor with a taste for sarcasm, and anyone who just likes a good story. The brain-bending puzzles aren't for everyone, but at least try before you look up a tutorial.
Happy Testing!"
5222,"Worth e very penny

5241,"The graphics are the best i ever have seen but the thing is some levels are hard but that the fun part
also the lore is very good, much better then the dream smp. and there is alot that i can say but i dont have soo much time so that it"
5242,"singleplayer was enjoyable and the multiplayer is a blast everytime i replay it with friends, there isn't too much to say other then this games fun if you love puzzles."
5243,"Now that I've beaten it, all I can say is: Amazing. One of the best games ever. It's so good, there doesn't need to be a Portal 3. I would like a Portal 3, but it I don't think it would ever surpass Portal 2. 

Gameplay is superb, story is stellar, music is a jam! GLaDOS and Wheatley are unforgettable, the Puzzles were mind boggling but never unfair. It's also only 10 bones (1-5 bucks on a sale) and a potato can run it, so no reason not to play it."
5244,You get to see more of valve man's head than in tf2... and the games good I guess

5249,"played it through multiple times and I still don't get tired of it. the lore behind it is impressive too and thinking with portals is fantastic. the steam community with their maps is also extra content so check them out too. especially Portal Stories: Mel and Portal Reloaded. see them as DLCs
Co-op is also big fun with a friend and more with community maps"
5250,GLaDOS best girl
5251,The plot is full of holes.
5252,just play the game
5253,cool
5254,"Perfect second installment of the Portal series. It adds so many new game mechanics and lore, and balances it perfectly with the first game. It's great because it doesn't feel like it was made just for money. 
It's really amazing to see ""behind"" the test chambers and such, and the huge areas are just amazing to look at. It really gives an interesting picture behind the past of Aperture Science. It was so entertaining to complete the gel tests, with the pre-recordings of the CEO playing in the background. 
I also think the difficulty of the puzzles were great."
5255,"9.3/10
Is this a masterpiece or what? First of all, go play the original if you haven’t yet.
Portal 2 is like the complete game after Portal being the beta version. So much more stuff is here. You have gels, you have the crazy bot lady, you have a new British bot guy, you learn about the history behind this crazy lab, you get an ending which you wouldn’t see coming in anyway. Jokes? Still there, even funnier. Launching yourself by jumping into portals? There’s more of that. It’s amazing how a story can be so stupid and serious in the same time. Puzzles are so innovative. I was so annoyed by seeing some similar puzzles in games over and over again but in Portal 2 there’s none of that shit. Portal has a unique style in puzzles which it commits to till the end of the game.
Now co-op is a whole other story. You can buy this game just for the co-op and not even play the single player. Remember that Portal style which gives you so much freedom to experiment every possible way? Well imagine doing that with a friend. You can get as stupid as you want and the game just does whatever you want. Every stage is a showcase of how creative the designers are and how they invite you to use your creativity as well.
I had a blast playing Portal 2 and definitely gonna go through it again soon. This is a must play for every gamer."
5256,
5257,"This game is a must-play. So is the first one. Why? Because it gives you something no one game is going to give you. If you find yourself scrolling through your library and the store, endlessly looking for the next game to captivate you, scroll no further. You will laugh. You will be challenged with critical thinking. You will have a damn good time. 

And then it will end, and you will be right back where you were: Looking for the next game to give you the dopamine hits you crave. But what you won't do? Regret playing this gem. 

$10, full send"

5310,Mind fuckery to the max
5311,"One of my absolute favorite puzzle games. Much more expansive and complex than its predecessor. Very charming and quirky characters and story, as expected. Thoroughly recommended!"
5312,is great game
5313,that shit is tight son
5314,"P0rtal has always been that classic series that simultaneously makes you feel like an intellect and a complete moron; I love that give and take. Even after replaying this series so many times, there are moments where I stand in a room and feel like Gandalf the Great(""I have no memory of this place"").  And the fact I can experience this with a friend, which is exclusive to P0rtal2, makes it even better; nothing like making a fool of yourself in front of your friend as you forget you can simply walk through a portal.  
P0rtal 2's lore is so in your face, yet hidden, that it's truly a treat any time I notice something new.  
Oh, and GlAd0s's humor never gets old, even when it tears away at my self-esteem. 
Buy p0rtal 1 and 2 now. full price."

5327,Nice game! Can't wait for the third game................
5328,"puzzles and boss fight are a bit easier because it's made for c*nsole ""players""

nah jk this is a pretty good game"
5329,"Such a great game that not only expands upon the core premise of the first game but also allows the community to get creative. Additionally, the story is immersive yet hilarious, and it really allows the user to gather a deep understanding of this world. I'm happy to further boost this game's ratings among the thousands of others who agree with me. Portal 2 is a blast to play."
5330,"Apart from the gameplay, the storyline is so good and has drastically improved from portal 1.

100/10, fucking amazing."
5331,"great puzzle game if you never played one before, has a memorable voice-cast far exceeding their expectations! Fantastic 10/10 game"
5332,"if you go through a portal, is it still you that comes out?"
5333,"A really breathtaking game story wise, while also consisting of alot of great puzzles. It is a worthy if not even better prequel of the greatest must-plays in the history of video games!"
5334,Portal 2 has taught me that Valve must add more musical numbers to their games.
5335,AH

And, A little Addicting."

5345,"Fun fact: did you know that if you're caught reading reviews instead of buying this game, you can be declared legally insane?

But you wouldn't do something like that, would you?!?!"
5346,"this game made my brain feel like someone removed it, put it in a bunsen burner, then poured the liquid remains into my skull. i love it"
5347,"A great game with unique mechanics, wonderful storytelling, and an incredibly active fan base. The game never loses its replayability and is (so far) my favorite game of all time and very much so one of the best games of all time."
5348,Poggers

5350,Best game ever made. Great puzzles. the best writing of any game.
5351,yes
5352,heavy
5353,Portal 2
5354,"One of the best games ever created by a humanity.  The major disadvantage is that you can't play it for the first time again. The story, the humor, voice acting — that is something to consider.
But, fellow player, put aside a keyboard/mouse, joystick or Deck and move yourself outside sometimes, so you don't become as fat as Chell"

5364,Cool Game
5365,backrooms but literally
5366,robot is friend
5367,"Absolute classic & timeless, one of the greatest games I have ever played."
5368,This game will always be in my heart for the amazing story and atmosphere. The puzzles and little secrets you can find are amazing and are a big part of the game even playing co-op is really fun! This also has replay value I've played this about 8 times already and 2 times in co-op. Also the people who make there own levels are amazing if you find the good once that is. I really would recommend this game its 100% worth its price.
5369,Story is super exciting and the actual gameplay is fun!
5370,"this game is so addicting and fun ,its exhilarating and puzzling but it takes patents."

5419,very good game
5420,I was really liked this game this is my favourite
5421,"ima be honest with you. even if you had the portal gun in real life, you wouldn't be able to use the portals to get yourself some bltches. stop hoping and start going for boys bro"
5422,Probably one of the best games you can buy on steam for $10. What else is there to say?
5423,portals go bloopy
5424,"It had some bugs but portal 2, was alot better than ANY game i have playyed"
5425,pp pp poo poo
5426,"very good game. great story, amazing puzzles, brilliant characters, and a great world to play in. Highly recommend"
5427,"Really fun classic 
10/10"
5428,thank you portal 2 for creating lesbians
5429,"This game is a classic! it has graphics that still hold up to this day! The gameplay does get frustrating, but no boring, so this game is a 10/10"
5430,"Amazing game.It's a puzzle that actually makes you think and when you're done with the story, you can play levels from other people on steam and even make your own. the concept works perfectly and the game runs smooth on my 7-8yo computer."
5431,"Portal 2 is a masterclass example of what a sequel to an already good game should be: more story and characterization, fun new mechanics that are mixing familiar with the unexplored, as well as better pacing and more content. Portal 2 offers exactly that!

Without getting into spoilers, you meet 2 wonderfully characterized, written, and voice-acted characters (well, 3 now that I think about it) that follow you throughout your journey, offering some nice dialogue and more world-building.

Gameplay has been enhanced; you got your classic Portal gameplay - portals, lasers, turrets, cubes and buttons, but Portal 2 introduces mechanics such as Repulsion gel (blue gel that makes your jumps higher, and is pretty bouncy, allowing you to jump great heights if you have fallen from enough of a drop), Propulsion gel (which makes you go faster, and as you might remember from the first Portal, you keep your momentum while entering portals), Conversion ges (this gel creates surfaces that can allow portals to be placed on them), as well as Excursion Tunnels (tunnels that propel you forward while you float in air). There's also solid light beams, that can be used as pathways since you can stand on them, as well as walls that can protect you from turrets.

There's also co-op - 2 players, 4 portals, which makes the gameplay even crazier!

All in all, a must-play for every gamer, an enjoyable experience through and through!"
5432,portal good
5433,goood
5434,"Best puzzle, Great history and a lot humor. GOTY"

I love this series, co-op is one of the best additions to this! its super fun to make your own puzzles and make your friends solve them, Amazing story line, its an entire masterpiece! props to everyone who worked on it!! I've replayed this game too many times to count, and I will not stop Its definitely become one of the primes of my childhood :) Thank you! (not to mention I feel like a genius after solving a puzzle)"

5455,This game is what you call a sequel. It has all of the old mechanics with other new ones to help advance your game play. When playing this game I am all ways shocked to how these puzzles are made. 100/10 game.

5475,"i like the part where you solved puzzles, pretty cool"
5476,"Nothing like anything I've ever played. Super fun, engaging, challenging enough but not to where it's impossible; would totally buy again."
5477,Portal 2 is a very great game for 2011. This game hits the bar for a great game. I personally love this game and play it almost daily for at leased 30 mins at leased every session only because of the amount of brain power that this game makes you use. This game really sets high standards for puzzle games as the puzzle story in this game makes your playtime skyrocket because of the games ability to stop you from quitting by throwing new content at you left right and center. The fact that I have played this game for more than 20 hours in 1 month and I haven't got bored makes me happy. I love that I can't get bored of a game like this because then I can play more. The dialog in this game makes it really funny to play because of the pun/joke filled story dialog that this game provides. In the end I give this game a 5/5 and recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games!

5545,"A perfect sequel to the masterpiece Portal.
I had a great time playing this gem with my best friend in coop.

If you haven't played it by now, do it, you won't regret it."

5547,"Portal 2 is the best game I had the opportunity to play this year. It interests the player from the beginning and stays like that to its final minutes. It entertains with great, humorous dialogue, intrigues with compelling puzzles - as a result you keep staring at the screen and forget about the world around you. Valve's newest game is also a well-written product with great attention to detail."
5548,very cool game
5549,Just f*cking yes dude xD
5550,fun
5551,my favorite game period
5552,"The game is really good. If you're a fan of Sci-Fi, I suggest you play this."

5560,"Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice

You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone

She was a lot like you
Maybe not quite as heavy
Now little Caroline is in here too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you

You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone

Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad

Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone"
5561,Loved the characters
5562,one of my favourite games its funny it has a good story and is so much fun to play. highly recommend
5563,A great sequel to the first Portal game with amazing game play and new various puzzles to solve compared to the first Portal game along with new characters and a whole different adventure. Portal 2 answers a lot of the unanswered questions and mysteries from the first game. For the best experience with Portal 2 I highly suggest  you play the the first Portal game so you get the most out of this game.
5564,glados is probably where my degradation kink came from

5572,The sequel to the great Portal succeded to deliver on all fronts. The graphics are improved courtesy of the new engine and the game utilizes it to its full extent on the physics. The liquid physics were amazing for their time. The game added a new flavor to the mix with a much longer and better fleshed out story with new fun characters. The game improved almost everything the first game had and added a mini coop campaign which was a blast to play with friends.
5573,is gud
5574,"Awesome puzzle game, fairly deep story too. Definitely worth the price!"
5575,Innovative and  great game
5576,e
5577,it makes me morb so hard every time i play it
5578,"Portal 2 is, much like most of Valve's other games, an icon of gaming, and that reputation is most deserved. The game possesses genius writing for it's memorable story and clever puzzles that you will never run out of with the vast number of community-built test chambers. To say I recommend this game would be an understatement. Oh yeah also prepare to have lines of dialogue from this game stuck in your head for years to come."

5604,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, go below, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
5605,Awesome game
5606,"Now portals, You're are thinking with"
5607,"Ok First of all, if you're reading reviews to decide whether or not to buy this game, STOP. BUY IT. NOW!! It'll be one of the best games you ever play. 

Pros:
- Characters
- Plot
- Graphics
- Gameplay
- Potato

Cons:
- It ends

Overview:
Portal 2 is probably the most well-crafted game I've played. It takes what the original portal did so well — progressive puzzle solving, hilarious dialogue — and ramps it up 5 notches. I was actually dying of laughter several times while playing this game. The plot is much deeper than the first game, and it manages to constantly surprise you (in hilarious ways). The puzzles are never obvious, and some are pretty complex, but none of them are *so* hard that they'll stump you for weeks. 

Oh, also potato."
5608,its portal 2. still one of the best games ever made
5609,"good story, play portal 1 first"

5617,"This game is pretty fun for the most part, the only problem I have with the game is when the robot woman says something about your mother, its pretty sad, espessially if your mom died when you were young, thats coming from a person that lost his mom at 11, other than that, great valve game."
5618,yes
5619,Absolutely. This game is delightful. I love it. I wish I hadn't played it so I could play it again all over again.
5620,"You just have to play this game, IT'S SO GOOD!"

5643,"I'm not a big fan of puzzle games but I loved Portal. Especially because of the setting, atmosphere and characters."
5644,This game is incredible. It's funny and fun for its entire duration. I personally like it more than portal 1 though would recommend playing portal 1 first if you haven't already.

5650,Mad at myself for never playing this before
5651,"It was cool and all, but I feel like it's either overhyped or a product of its time. The singleplayer story was meh. Playing with a friend however, that's where this game is worth getting. I personally would only buy it to play the infamous co-op with a fun friend. Portals and shenanigans still hold up today."
5652,"This game is fun, PLAY IT NOW"

5684,"If you want a good, fun co-op game, then you this game is a definite. You must make sure you have a good duo though, since you're going to have to play the whole series with that specific person. It might ruin friendships, like it did when I befriended someone for placing the wrong portals every single time. Although the inevitable fact that the person you're playing with will become your worst enemy, you should get the game."
5685,"perfect game. coop is good too if you actually like your friend. I hated the coop, since I hate my friend. I hate him even more after playing the coop with him."

5704,"1234567890

5705,"Again, the best story line out there. Would highly recommend getting the first portal as well. Very very very big well done to the developers and the script writers. If you are into dramatic scenery with lore that keeps getting deep as you go, and a bit of humour, this by far the best game for you."
5706,very boss
5707,Best game dialogue Ive ever experienced. Excellent game

5718,It's Great! Every one should play this mind blowing game!
5719,i love space and talking potatoes
5720,this game is shit. I shat in my hands and clapped this morning and it was much more fun than any time i've ever played this game
5721,"Portal 1 exceeded all my expectations but this game was able to go even beyond that! 
This is one the best sequels ever, everything is amped up from the first instalment and few extra things have been added.
The eerie, strange, apocalyptic atmosphere is still present and I just love it, for some reason it just makes the game so so much more immersive and once you go to the old parts of Aperture organization you will just be awed by the scale and details of the things.
There are a few more characters this time and all of them are fantastically voice acted and kudos to the dialogue writer(it is just amazing) Glados is still amazing and the standout, Wheatley is a great new addition, Chell remains voiceless and Cave Jhonson voiced by JK Simmons is just amazing!
This time around there is much more story to the game and if you peek around here and there a little bit you might find some really cool easter eggs that reveal a lot about the characters.
The main part of the game that is the puzzles are still amazing like Portal 1, it is just hard enough to not be impossible but to give you the satisfaction of feeling smart. A few new mechanics have been added which are great and keeps the gameplay fresh.
The graphics are great for what it is.
I encountered no bug during my gameplay.
I would recommend this 100%, the cost at which this game is available is a no brainer!"
5722,I miss when Valve made games.
5723,"Portal 2 was good, and still is.

Continuation of story is really good. After many years, Glados is back for tests. You get new companion a blue core named Wheatley. He helps you, and you help him. I will not spoil much just one bit because I like it (the part that you co-op with Glados). Story goes smooth with a big turn around.

Gameplay is very smooth too. Portal/portal2 is known for running very fast. For a potato pc player, it's for you. Very good graphics that gives levels a mood. Doing puzzles are sometimes not easy, but after all it's game for all players.

Soundtrack in this game is fantasic. Voice actors did a really good job with characters. Music is great too. Futuristic and mechanical music will go with you all the way in gameplay. Songs are also great and funny.

Now let's talk about community maps. Those are great. They took something simple and made something complex. You have maps from big castles to unreal worlds when you can go upside down. People takes those assets (blocks, buttons, ext.) and makes something new. The most great I remember was ""Temple"" and ""Unreal 1-4"".

After all this game is 10/10 and I love it."
5724,very good game
5725,Must play puzzle game for any gamer.
5726,yes
5727,How to defeat the final boss when his health got low shoot the moon. Good music in the credits.
5728,"Portal 2 is fun, enjoyable, and challenging as the levels go on.  The only problem I had with it is that as of now I cant open the game but I don't think it is the games fault.  All I can really say is PLEASE get this!"
5729,It's nothing short but a masterpiece the original Portal game was innovation but i found myself bored with it but this game was amazing the story was beautiful thank you VALVe
5730,i like it
5731,if you're on steam and haven't played the portal games what are you even doing? play them

If you haven't played either of the 2 games and haven't been spoiled yet, don't look anything up and play them! I recommend playing the first game before if you want to understand more the story. Im certain you will not regret playing."

5780,"This is best game I've ever played in my entire life. This game is so much better than the first Portal, and all the Half-Life games except for Half Life: Alyx. It's also better than Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. I got a lot smarter after I played the entire story mode since it is a very awesome puzzle game that is very mind bending. Valve is so amazingly creative for making a game this cool. I have watched Portal lore videos on YouTube and now I understand the entire Half-Life/Portal story. This game is life changing."

This game takes what was so very strong with the first portal, and cranks it to 10! The comedy, the way the game makes you feel either really smart, or really stupid. This is the perfect sequel. So excellently taking what was great before and adding more to it. Great game!

Wheres portal 3?"

5816,didnt get racially profiled within the game itself but played on call with friends and they called me slurs so 10/10 expierence
5817,This game is amazing
5818,its aight
5819,just finished the campaign and boy was I not ready for anything that happened. Also I've completely ran through the co-op twice as well and is always really fun.
5820,"My favorite puzzle game, everything about this game is well made. If you haven't already go play Portal Reloaded"
5821,it good
5822,"YES. PLAY THIS. GOOD LORD IT'S GOOD.

The story is full of suspense and a good number of comedic moments, the puzzles are complex but always have a solution in plain sight, and while I did get stuck from time to time, I didn't need to look anything up to finish the game. It is significantly better if you play the first game before it, as that establishes a lot of skills that make this one a lot easier, but on its own it still does everything it needs to.

JUST PLAY IT ALREADY YOU MORON."
5823,"Despite that fact that the most amount of recommended reviews belong to this game is true, literally really fun and a ton of twists, lives up to the name best game on Steam, and you can even play user-made levels and create your own too, if you say otherwise i'll be stealing your kneecaps"
5824,it go pew pew
5825,good game
5826,legitimately good game
5827,ITS FUN AND MAKES YOU REALY THINK OF ALL POSIBLE ASCAPE RUTES
5828,This is a classic game one that you can have many hours of fun playing with friends trying to figure out the puzzles. And when you're done with that you got a load of community made maps to keep going.
5829,Loved playing this new to me classic.
5830,SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5831,good game
5832,"One of my favorite games of all time. Its not just smart, its actually really funny as well"
5833,portal
5834,"This game expands on the first game mechanically and story wise, not to mention the characters are great, seriously play the game it's good"
5835,Lemons
5836,is gud uwu
5837,fun game they should make a prequel to this
5838,best puzzle game
5839,"If you never played Portal 2, you are missing a truly masterpiece, both the puzzle aspect of the game, and the narrative, are more than well done. And the best part, you can play with a friend. Now, who is ready to make some science?"
5840,One of the best games ever created. A Must play.
5841,"best game, its was better then shitty mobile game ads."
5842,"This is my personal favorite game, 10/10 worth the money."
5843,How do you not have this game yet?
5844,
5845,it's a really fun game and it's also a  multiplayer game it is also fun in more then 1 way you have to complete fun obstacles.
5846,Good game.
5847,It's Portal 2. Play it. Now.
5848,"A great step up from the first Portal game, much longer with a much better story and characters. 

Very fun"
5849,yeraehae
5850,"I wish I were some master author so I could write Portal 2 a love-letter as a review to do justice to the experience it gave me when I played it - and, for all I know, which it could still offer if played again.

However, even if I had that capacity, Portal 2 might be most impactful if one knows as little as possible going in, similar to- although not quite to the same degree as- Portal 1.

In terms of story: [spoiler]If you're reading this review, the cat's most likely out of the bag for you at this point that the Portal series actually has[/spoiler] [spoiler]a universe and story to it, instead of necessarily being just a set of rooms in a computer space like Mario or Quake. If you didn't, I recommend booting up Portal 1 and playing it through before Portal 2. There actually are references to Portal 1's simple events, and while it isn't necessary to have played Portal 1 to understand the gameplay or what's going on, Portal 2's harkening to Portal 1 is in my opinion one of its most enrapturing aspects, and the fuller understanding is worth it.[/spoiler]

In terms of gameplay: If you know Portal 1, you probably know the basics, and if anyone reading this doesn't, here they are: The player walks around in a 3D space, moving between rooms/chambers. You have a a very light hop and the ability to grab things; you're introduced eventually to the signature ""weapon"" of the game, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, and its signature ability to make quantum space holes on (most) walls becomes fundamental to reaching point B of each chamber [spoiler]- and on occasion, other goals that deviate a little bit from getting to a particular location.[/spoiler]

With this simple formula, and various environments that can adapt to your actions, Portal 2 manages to reintroduce familiar gameplay with a new attitude. [spoiler]It isn't all more of the same, though.[/spoiler] [spoiler]Aperture Science gradually reveals new tools, devices, and even substances as you go deeper in, that create new gameplay and new possibilities. For me personally, these new things were so exciting that they are exciting to see as story developments.[/spoiler]

The visuals and audio in Portal 2 are sublime and would arguably merit their own review. Surfaces are successfully shown as severely decripit without being over the top. The architecture, the test-intentional objects (cubes, switches, etc.), and  the Cheli-Shayim of Aperture Science have their own distinctive visual identity, each individual item with intricacies that seem interesting in their own right without being hammy, that stands out, and largely defines the eerie Portal experience and then goes on to fit inside thsi experience. Granted Portal 1 does the same; and yet Portal 2 still seems like Aperture Science from a new angle and with a new sight of vulnerability.

As for audio, eerie soft noise of the luft and the reverberation of sounds such as footsteps give the facility a spot in the uncanny middle ground between decay over time and the over-engineered cold industrial facility we met in the first game - all while retaining, largely, the sense of loneliness. The gameplay-sounds, such as blips for when buttons are activated, and the nearly-harsh pulse sound of a launched portal, the warbling of the portal pulse as it flies and the light burning sound of a portal already set, all seem to fit into what  you're actually doing in the world itself instead of being only for our ears and not for Chell's.

Add to this the voice acting on top of the writing, and Portal 2 is certainly a game to look for a chance to play with the volume on.

Each one of these merits - the audio, visuals, story, world-building, gameplay - deserve their own deep review, and all this doesn't even touch upon how they each serve each other.

If you have already played Portal 1, and you have decided there's anything at all about it you'd like more of, I definitely recommend giving Portal 2 a chance. That goes especially for the new highly affordable price, which is about the cost of a pound of beef at a local deli here in suburban Texas.

___

Oh, and by the way, I've only ever played single-player. Reader and I alike have no idea what wonders might also lie in store for the much-anticipated co-op mode. Consider this if you also have likewise-curious acquaintances who'd like to go a round with you."
5851," Still one of the best games ever released, both singleplayer and co-op are amazing and are worth playing anytime. There's nothing to not like about this game."
5852,one level lets you take the box with you 10/10

5859,"Great game until the end
great gameplay, graphic story, puzzle
"
5860,funny british robot only complaint is when he turns evil he gets angry instead of stabbing us and robbing me
5861,haha two portal guns go brrrrr
5862,"Brilliant game, my favourite on Steam, 10/10. However, I am currently encountering a bug in which my game crashes upon pressing the 'create test chamber button' in community test chambers, meaning that I cannot create tests. Despite this hindrance, I am able to thoroughly enjoy the large experience that the game provides for such a cheap price, from story to co-op and community test chambers."
5863,"this is an incredible, challenging and also funny game and i really recomend it to lots of people. it is alot better when played once you have finished portal 1 and there is a bundle that you can use to get them both for alot cheaper. keep in mind this is a puzzle game and it is very challenging but i love it.  10/10 game!!! nice job valve"
5864,Portal 3 please.
5865,"good game and i definetly recomend, but it's kinda expensive for me (Rp.70K or something) and i'm still waiting for Portal 3 & a game theory episode on portal, hope it will be good as we waited for a decade now"
5866,"Are you really looking at reviews? For Portal 2? As if something here is going tell you ""Oh yeah this game is actually garbage despite a decade of people considering it one of the greatest puzzle-comedy games out there."
5867,its fun
5868,This game is a masterpiece. If you like portal 1 you'll love portal 2.
5869,Portal 2 is one of the few puzzle games I really enjoy. And the community test chambers allow for near infinite playability. I wish more puzzle games had this same level of quality and mainstream appeal.
5870, very good game portal 2 very good game very worth of my money very good game

5898,Destroyed my friendships
5899,we need more games like this
5900,good
5901,6 hours in and it's a fun ride. I love how lean the story is so far. They've really captured the spirit of the original. I need to find someone to co-op with!
5902,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
5903,Great
5904,"just play it, u will know."

5936,I have been a PC gamer since I typed in games from RUN magazine into my Commodore 64. The Portal franchise is STILL the BEST GAME concept ever. My 13 year old son played Portal and Portal 2 from this Steam account and he even said they are the best games he has played so far.

5976,good game
5977,"When I first saw this game I KNEW I had to play it. I bought it just before it came to Linux, so I had tons of technical problems, but I worked through it to be able to play this (Yes, this is one of THOSE games). I even downloaded and installed steam for this very game. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't as much of a story to it as I thought, and the logic of the ending is, well, questionable, but it's still a great game.

When I first got it I remember thinking that I'd always be able to play it because of the workshop content, but after a while you get kind of tired of the gameplay mechanics. It's still worth the price but it's fun won't last forever."
5978,Gud

5997,This game is a very fun 2 player game
5998,it's portal 2 whaddya want from me? haven't tried multiplayer yet 4/5
5999,The classic co-op game that really tests your trust. It makes or breaks friendships. Good luck.
6000,I Think This game was good but not enough Morgan Freeman.
6001,help brain ouchie
6002,"   Most of my hours have been accumulated from back when this was released on ps3, and you were able to connect your steam account. Having the option to cross play this with friends on PC was awesome for the Co-op game. Story is a lot of fun and keeps up the same tone/humor from the first game. I've spent hours looking around in the environments trying to picture how things must have been back in the facilities hay-day. 
   Solving puzzles and moving into new sections feels very satisfying. It kept me interested in the world and the characters till the end. I always felt inclined to try and reach new areas to explore and find hidden lore. If you haven't played this yet and aren't quite sold because of the puzzle aspect, I would still recommend to give it a chance if you find it on sale. Can't think of any gripes or any negatives tbh. 

9.5/10 
Nearly perfect game.  Although I find myself thinking about the first one a tad more. I think that has to do with the fact that it was such a fresh concept when I played it for the first time, It left a impression on me. That and I played it 2342 times (probably) on The Orange Box."
6003,"Standing here
I realize
You are just like me
Trying to make history

But who's to judge
The right from wrong
When our guard is down
I think we'll both agree

That violence breeds violence
But in the end it has to be this way

I've carved my own path
You followed your wrath
But maybe we're both the same

The world has turned
And so many have burned
But nobody is to blame

Yet staring across this barren wasted land
I feel new life will be born
Beneath the blood stained sand
Beneath the blood stained sand"
6004,Game too hard
6005,"recommended for everyone but those with little patience.
I had little patience and I had some frustrating experiences.
couldn't have finished the main story without the first game.
What a beautiful ending that was.
now would anyone like to do co-op with me?"

6017,"Portal is a great game! You shouldn't buy it! Steam, WHERE'S PORTAL 3??!!!!!!"
6018,I love this game so much it's hard to put it to words. The incredible storytelling and puzzle design are amazing and there is nothing else like it. The co-op mode is insanely fun to do with a friend. You'll spend hours thinking your brain out and it is so satisfying. This and Portal are my favorite games of all time. There's a reason this is one of the greatest sequels to a game out there.
6019,this game is just puzzle perfection
6020,"Valve. Good job. 


I will say, I don't think there should be a third. Just leave the series here, it allows the player to come up with their own ending. (You also don't want a bad sequel to ruin the entire franchise/story)"

6026,10/10 would brainwash myself to forget it then replay it 3219952891817408102972087 times
6027,"pros: quite possibly the best 3d puzzle game ever. the graphics, story, puzzles, etc. still manage to hold up in 2022 as amazing. other games have admitted to get inspiration from this game, like superliminal. if you like puzzle games, im not really sure why you wouldn't get this. literally, the only negative reviews are people saying it is too difficult, and it only accounts for 2% of the people who played the game.
cons: they flex that potatoes can run better than my laptop
conclusion: 10/10 would get adopted again"
6028,Stop scrolling through reviews and just buy this game already if you haven't.

10/10"
6038,good game. it fun
6039,"I played this on a potato. 11/10, would follow Wheatley to the ends of the earth again"
6040,"12 years later, this game still remains one of my favorite experiences of all time. The incredibly complex gameplay looks deceptively simple at first, and it's only once you get into the meat of the story that you can start to see how the characters - and the world in which they live - became what they are. This is a fascinating and entertaining journey from beginning to end. If you've never played this game, you owe it to yourself to try it out."
6041,good
6042,funny potato robot
6043,omagad i can also shoot portal but  no kill robo? Wai nevamin i kill robo very fun but with a 2
6044,good

6052,"Just replayed this for the 4th time on the Steam Deck, the cake is still a lie"
6053,Cant do the robot :(
6054,"got it on sale, pretty good game"
6055,Favourite game ever
6056,this game deserves to be the highest rated game on steam
6057,"This is a complete masterpiece. They improved everything from Portal 1 and added a lot more content, especially the brand new co-op.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
As the name suggests, you create portals for solving puzzles and getting over obstacles. Since only two are present at a time and on certain surfaces, it limits our options and we need to think of a clever solution. In Portal 2 they added a lot of new mechanics to the puzzles: lasers, force-field beams, gels that increase your jump or speed, and much more. It adds a lot of complexity and increases the variety of puzzles this game can offer.

Now there are tons of stuff to do in Portal: singleplayer, challenges (if you want), co-op, and even workshop maps for both single-player and multiplayer. I was surprised that many community maps are on par with the original campaign, and some of them even have their own steam page.

[h1] Story [/h1]
One of the elements they really pulled out nicely is the story. It is now very deep and a lot more is revealed about the lore than in the prequel. You get to meet funny new characters that play a huge role in the plot along with GLaDOS. In addition, when I played Portal 1, it felt that most of the game was all about puzzles. Now, a lot is going on in every chamber. Each dialogue and action make you feel the story's progression, and add a lot to the atmosphere. 

[h1] Artstyle [/h1]
Absolutely wonderful. You can really see how their improved engine works at its best. The water reflection, high details, and ariel's perspective really make this game look realistic. In addition, the level design looks fantastic. What I love the most is the combination of green plants and a ruined environment. 

[h1] Co-op[/h1]
That feature alone makes the game worth even at full price. It is completely separate from the single-player in both story and maps. In co-op, both players must think, since there are puzzles that require them to be in separate positions. As a result, every player sees only part of the solution and their partner the complementary. Communication and coordination between the two-player are the keys to success.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
The single-player and the co-op can be completed in 10 hours each, and adding the workshop it can go to infinity and beyond. Portal 2 succeeds in every aspect and is truly worthy to be called a AAA game. I never write it in my reviews, but for me, this is really a 10/10.

[quote] My advice is to get Portal Bundle even at full price. [/quote]

6058,yes
6059,"the best game ever
"
6060,"I could not recommend this game enough. If you like sarcastic evil/moronic British robots narrating fun, sometimes mentally frying puzzles and your journey, then this is the game. I was slow on the portal wagon and I think if i'd got into the franchise earlier, the past couple of years would of been less depressing. BUY THE GAME"
6061,BEST
6062,Its really fine the story is solid
6063,it is a good game
6064,if you dont like this game you may have a minor case of severe brain damage
6065,"When I first played Portal 2 back when it was released on consoles over a decade ago. I had a lot of fun. Coming back to it now almost 12 years later, I can honestly say it is still an absolute blast to play."
6066,Epic
6067,This is a very fun puzzle game. Co-op is good. Wheatley is funny.
6068,its great worth the monei
6069,"If you're a fan of puzzle games, Portal 2 is a must-play."
6070,Add gay robot sex.
6071,Portal 2 becuasse the likes 2 robots and like 2 protals with 2 main robots and a character with two legs with 2 arms very accurate
6072,I have trouble with some puzzles but so far so good!
6073,"I am soooooo late to the portal party but oh bot what a fun (pair of) games. The first portal was a bit short but what an end screen! (THE CAKE IS A LIE!). I am just underway in Portal 2 and have been ""treated"" to 2 familiar voices ... and although the beginning levels are similar in content it is not long before some new mechanics come into play. I picked up both games for a tenner. Both games have additional content beyond the single player campaign, and Portal 2 has co-op (wont be into that for a bit. If you want a challenging, funny, frustrating rewarding puzzle game; this (these) are a must have."
6074,omg omg thanks valve for the game
6075,"Usability/Playability: The game is still playable because it is not a game known as the best graphics out there. It is known as a puzzle coop game and the game does not feel old for me. The graphics are still good and when you are playing with friends it is fun. 

Narrative/Story: Portal 2 is an after apocalyptic game in which you are controlling robots. There is no human left and an AI (Artificial Intelligence) experimenting on you with some puzzles. This game is still playable for me because it feels right when you are playing the story. The story is interesting and playable. 

Fun/Enjoyment: When you are playing with your friend it is fun because there are two humans and there are many more ideas for solving puzzles and it is easier to solve puzzles. It is fun in single-player too because the story is interesting, and gameplay is fun. 

Visual Aesthetics: Visuals are quite good for the 2011 release date game. It feels like you are really in an experiment, and you are the lab rat. But I think if there were some trees and something green it could be better because you are in a post-apocalyptic era and because of that there are no humans left. If there is no human left, there could be some trees bushes. There are security cameras, and they are watching you and tracking your movements and it feels like you are a lab rat again. 

Audio Aesthetics: Audio is helping players to feel right in the environment. The portal guns audio feels good, the robotic voice is feels good. But when you are moving you can hear just the steps. I think if there was a robotic leg sound it would be better. 

Challenges/Difficulty: It is a puzzle game so sometimes it is quite hard but mostly you can just see the way like there is a forty-five-degree platform. When you see this, you can just think it is part of the solution and you are trying this platform. If there were more similar objects it could be harder but game would be harder and playability would decrease."
6076,This game has style.
6077,gud game
6078,good game

6179,"Just wow. Shorter than I wanted it to be. Felt shorter than Portal, but still an amazing single player play through. The real gem in this though is the co-op mutiplayer mode with an extensive pile of puzzles requiring a pair of players to complete (also nice is that the puzzles requiring two players to solve are a bit trickier that the single player ones!)"

6182,"Solid game play, Wheatley is hilarious 10/10"

Even on high settings. I'm not sure why this happened, but I'm glad I get to run Portal 2 with amazing FPS on High settings."

6226,"An amazing sequel which surpasses the first game. The level design is incredible. The mechanics are brilliant. The game offers a variety of mind-bending puzzles with increasing difficulty but are properly balanced so they never appear Sisyphean. Despite the mechanics seeming limited in number, Valve cleverly designed the levels injecting novel and creative use of the mechanics, so the experience is anything but monotonous as you work through the puzzles alongside a gripping storyline. The production in terms of in-game characters and voice acting is legendary. 

Apart from this, there is a co-op mode. If you've gone through the story multiple times and want a challenge, the community has a lot to offer and you can play awesome community maps! There are some amazing community mods too like Portal Stories: Mel and Portal Reloaded which extend your gameplay experience further.

This is the epitome of game design. Valve smashed it. It's a perfect game.

Go play it."

6246,"Portal 2 is an amazing puzzle game on Windows, Linux, and i'm pretty sure Mach, where you use portals to solve puzzles and escape Aperture Science. The game can also be played on the Xbox 360 (Xbox One and up if you use the same account that had it purchased), and the PS3 (bundle coming out for Nintendo Switch pretty soon). The Steam servers for both don't work anymore, so you can't play online on them anymore. Portal 2 has to be my favorite game because of the capability it has for the community. Some people can deal with the game's normal code and make an amazing work of art for the internet to enjoy, and some people can make their own things that the internet can also enjoy.  On the PC version of Portal 2, you can play custom levels and make custom portal guns (though the portal gun model would have to be tampered with). Overall, great game! I hope Valve and the writer of Portal make things work out ad make Portal 3."

6268,It's pretty good.
6269,I have no idea how I never wrote a review for Portal 2. This is literally in my top 5 favorite games of all time and to this day the samba music is my ringtone.
6270,"very fun,thinking with portals,and the co op with friends,and building chambers for others to play and making co op chambers,and again playing chambers that others made and there co op chambers,lost of fun"
6271,"This game is the equivalent of a brownie, that's been topped with ice cream that has toppings that were then topped with whipped cream, and then smothered under the all delicious cake.
Now that we're done with the real review, let's get down to business:
Portal: great! but short
Portal 2: Great!! and longer
Portal: blood
Portal 2: no blood
Portal: little language
Portal 2: some language, but it was to give character depth to .................
Portal: good graphics
Portal 2:great graphics
Portal: It has a shtick
Portal 2: It has shticks on top of shticks\
Portal: It has an in-depth story
Portal 2: it's the sequel, it adds an in-depth story to the other in-depth story
overall: they made a perfect game even better in the sequel. Buy both."
6272,"I can make cool maps with it. But of course, Hammer is often a huge pain to work with."
6273,ive replayed this game about 5-6 times
6274,The potato is mean with me and I like the british boy better even though he is sadly brittish
6275,The Portal games have been a long standing favorite of mine.  If you enjoy challenging puzzle games then Portals 1 and 2 are for you.
6276,Top 5 Games of all time without ever playing a HL game.
6277,"Valve has done a great job on this game, as well as many others, it exceeded my expectation on what the ending could have been, he graphics and physics are excellent. It's story is full of twists and turns, it is definitely worth a shot. 9/10."

I think that was the whole point, sure you can play solo but the co op was the bread and butter. just so fun with another person trying to figure out the puzzles"

She meets Wheatly and finds out the secrets of Aperture Science. Wheatly then goes nuts and causes chaos. Chell and GLaDoS make a portal to the moon and Wheatly gets SUCC into space and the end. This game has a lot more secrets and has a co-op campaghn, and a test room builder, and access to the Steam Workshop so you can post your test rooms around the world!"

Go play this amazing work of art. It's still one of the best things out there today!!!"
6327,yes.
6328,"I cannot tell you how many times I've played this game either on Steam or Xbox. The level designs and story are seriously well thought out, and I can say that Portal 2 has made my top 5 list of favorite all time games. I highly recommend this one for anyone itching for a critical thinking game that'll have you stumped on several occasions. 11/10"
6329,Oh yeah
6330,"This is my first review on steam, i hope it's good enought for the first one. Portal 2 was my first game on steam a few years ago (i think it was 2017), and even thought i didn't even knew anything about Portal and Portal 2, it was very fun and interesting. I can't remember anymore how long it took me, but i can remember that i played throught the story pretty fast. I played the story already a few times by now and i've built a few test chambers (it's been a while since i built one thought) and currently i'm finally playing the coop mode (i didn't know there was an online mode until a few weeks ago) and it is also very good. I can only recommend playing it and you don't really need to play Portal to understand whats going on in Portal 2, but if you played Portal before Portal 2 the story also continues. Don't know how to describe it. It's really a good game and worth the money."
6331,portale
6332,This game was very fun and I was able to beat the entire game in one day (5 hours)
6333,"One of the best games ever made

Great after beating the game:

6352,Great story and game mechanics
6353,one of the best games
6354,"i love how GLaDOS is still a salty **** after the events of the first game though she wasn't at first at the end of the first game one of the lines in the song ""i'm not even angry i'm being so sincere right now"" but 50000+ years of reliving your death would defiantly make you spiteful voice cast 10/10 graphics foe when it came out are still fantastic if there is a portal 3 i will most certainly enjoy it"
6355,good
6356,i never got my cake :(
6357,One does not simply own steam and not this game.
6358,A timeless classic for every gamer out there. Portal 2 should be the first game in any newbie's library.
6359,Play the first one (portal) before playing this
6360,Just play it. Being the #1 rated game on steam should be enough to convince you.
6361,good game just wish there was more games
6362,"great puzzles, love the story. Would recommend portal and portal 2 to anyone who likes puzzle games"
6363,"The only real reason i got this is to play co-op with my fiance, and it was great!"
6364,good game i beat it so many times on xbox its fun and great on pc and co op was so much fun
6365,"As I haven't been a pc gamer for long (about a month). This is my first portal game, I really love this game. The story is probably one of the few stories I've played in a while. If you like puzzle games and just want a casual walk through of a game this is it."
6366,pORTAL 2 iS A GREAT AND PUZZLING GAME. I LOVE ITS CO OP
6367,good
6368,cool game i recommend
6369,"im not smart enough to beat this, however its a good game"
6370,simply perfect hands down 10/10 the world needs a sequel
6371,"If you need a game to introduce someone to gaming, this may not be a bad choice."
6372,craig loves this game as it is a classic found in the hood.
6373,good just yes
6374,I spent two weeks grinding the first level 10/10
6375,poopo
6376,"The singleplayer is a straight banger, easy 10/10. The voice acting, the puzzles, the story, the absolute wacky off-the-wall nature of it all.

If you haven't played this gem, go in blind. Portal 1 is nice to have played before, but I didn't and Portal 2 made perfect sense. Other than a major spoilery easter egg at the end."
6377,it gud
6378,gooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
6379,amazing
6380,
6381,Portal. Made possible by a small group and then Valve approved of this amazing puzzle/horror/adventure game. I love it. I have made some chambers for ideas for Portal 3 (Just saying: Could y'all at Valve make 1 more portal  game please?) Anyways good job on portal 1 & 2.
6382,"Portal and Portal 2 are classics, they are must plays for anyone remotely interested in videogames. The combination of often mind boggling puzzles alongside a great and secret filled story has made 2 absolutely amazing games. This is once again proof that Valve is an actual competent game studio (unlike some others).
Sure, its a bit old, but that doesn't make it bad. Graphics still look beautiful even though you can practically play these games on a toaster. IMPORTANT: PLAY PORTAL 1 BEFORE THIS GAME (they interlink heavily trust me). This game is worth full price but you can get it in a combo with Portal 1 for basically nothing on big sales."
6383,just completed this game lmao.
6384,"There is a reason you dont see any negative reviews, the game is so good and you wont regret it."
6385,Really well made and runs great even on low end devices.
6386,ok this game is quite literally a masterpiece there is no flaws i can think of which make me give this game anything less then a perfect score and the writing for the characters is great the maps and level designs are gorgeous and the plot is super engaging with the intense bits actually having me on the edge of my seat this has and will probably always be my favorite game of all time 10/10 would recommend
6387,"Speedy in, speedy out"
6388,"very gud, complicated,

6409,our cause is just.
6410,if you're on steam and you don't know what portal 2 is... I feel sorry for you.
6411,"top tier game 
"
6412,"Puzzles, Portals, and the infinite loop. Exciting challenges that you can take on solo or Co-op. Check out the mods."
6413,The idea of this game is just marvelous.
6414,i died 10/10
6415,it's very fun and a challenge no matter how many times i play it
6416,it is just a good game with a lot of back story.

6426,This Play Is The Best Game Ever You Must Play It Every Day I Love Wheatley He Is Just So CUTE!
6427,"this game is my past and present while taking place in the future. this game is so much fun and after 6 years of waiting i finally got the game on dec/25/21 and i've been playing so much, it's so much fun! the story, the characters and even the co-op is amazing! 10/10 best puzzle game i've ever played."
6428,"It has such a good story, great puzzles, and a fantastic coop mode. I would recommend this to others"
6429,"Portal 2 is a very great game! There are cool puzzles and even a cooperative mode to play with another person. Also there's a level editor so you can make your own test chambers and share them in the workshop, and you can play other people's creations. Anyways, really recommend this game. It's amazing, and sometimes even a bit mind bending."
6430,"I picked up this game to reconnect with a friend and get back into gaming.  It's casual enough to have a conversation while working through it, and challenging enough to keep things interesting. I'll probably play through single a little way down the line just because it's so fun."
6431,"One word. Amazing
"
6432,loved it

6438,Good
6439,"glados is so cool i want her to sit on me
"
6440,Portal 2 is probably a perfect game. It does everything it sets out to do at a level of excellence that is rarely seen. Valve at their best.
6441,gud
6442,Robots with a british accent is kinda sus
6443,The game is amazing!
6444,Really really really good puzzle game
6445,"fun
"
6446,"From all the puzzle games I've played Portal 2 much like Portal is still to this day one of the best by far. The characters are charming with a good sense of humour and the puzzles are fun. In terms of difficulty, the puzzles are a bit more complex than the first game but only because they added new mechanics however it's still a game that can be completed without much trouble even if you are not good at solving puzzles. Something I quite enjoy is that there is more time spent outside of test chambers just traversing the facility and seeing different parts of it. There is also more to the characters than GLaDOS now there is Wheatley too their interactions are great it's the best part of the game. Anyways, fantastic game even if you're not the biggest fan of puzzles it's a game full of life and creativity that anyone can enjoy."
6447,"The engine, graphics, story, and characters are all pretty timeless. I would only say that the puzzles are fairly easy for today's standards, but maybe that's just because of how many times I've played them. Nonetheless, there are also tons of user-created levels you can try."
6448,"Loved it, especially the potato part"
6449,"Back in the good ol' days when valve made games, it was truly something special. Portal 2 is a signature example of what great puzzles and wonderful writing can do for a game. My only wish is that one day, in some profound future, they make portal 3.

Oh, and co-op is here too. Its also great."
6450,f
6451,this game was way ahead of its time
6452,"Just yesterday, I almost ruined this game for myself by watching a livestreamer play it. Left after the first five minutes and decided it's now or never to finally play this. And I'm glad I did.

While I knew it would be cinematic and story driven, I did not expect it to be this good. Portal 2 is a game right out of it's era of graphics and action scenes, with gameplay and comedy that holds up today. I honestly cannot believe this is running on the Source Engine. 

Nostalgically, I still remember all the hype from game informer magazine about how ""Portal 2"" was going to be happening. Around that time I played Portal 1 and was defeated by it's puzzles. But here all the way in 2022, this game was likely a better experience than ever before, now that the value of single-player has been forgotten by our battle-royale-driven industry.

This entire game brought me back to 2012 when Halo 4 was just around the corner and the internet was made of cats. A nerd nostalgia trip of unfulfilled hype from when the game first launched.

People really don't make games like this anymore. I'm so happy I allowed myself to experience this classic."
6453,good
6454,really fun so cool the story is epic i recommend the game its worth the price I would pay more if I can
6455,"great game , very funny"
6456,Honestly one of the greatest games ever created
6457,:D
6458,cool game. fun
6459,REALLY GUD!
6460,Almost makes me wish I was a test subject for a robot who wants me dead but isn't very good at it
6461,ending make me cry because i remembered my childhood and this game i played on repeat and i had no financial problems and neither did my parents *thumbs up*
6462,"if you don't own this you're doing yourself a disservice and probably living under a rock, it's an amazing puzzle game and it really makes you think with portals
the singleplayer and co-op campaigns are a thrill
play it"
6463,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The campaign is not too long and not too short, the story is amazing, and so are the characters. Every gamer should play this before they die.

20/10."
6464,"Good game for testing your brain, but it gets pretty boring after you beat the main story and the co-op. Overall, 7/10"
6465,"This games lives up to everything I'd hoped it would be after playing the first game, and more."
6466,"""yeah we're going to make this really interesting and atmospheric setting and design the coolest looking gun ever but instead of doing something cool with it like KILLING PEOPLE you're just going to shoot circles onto walls""
jesus christ this one's bad. thank god the guys behind this don't make games anymore."

6522,Made me realize my brain is still able to think logically
6523,portal good
6524,gotta love valve
6525,IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED
6526,"Well, I finally beat it. Can you even call yourself a gamer if you haven't played Portal 2? Maybe. But it will definitely hurt your street cred. If you've played the first Portal, just buy it. If you haven't played the first Portal, first flog yourself 3 times, buy that, play it, then buy this.

What can I say about this that hasn't already been said? It's the definition of a perfect game. Story, voice acting, subversion of expectations, mind-bending puzzles, horror, it's perfected them all. And once you've finished the main story, there's hundreds of player-created maps that are no joke just as high quality, I feel like I'm playing DLC. Writing this in May 2022 and the last update was less than a month ago. 'nuff said."
6527,i like how the robot calls me fat
6528,"There are like portals and stuff...
[strike] help [/strike]"

6535,fun unique puzzle game
6536,this game is ultimate gaming experience
6537,"everything id good
"
6538,"This game is really fun, and it works on computers that are old and bad. It didn't even lag, which was a suprise since this game is so big. I recommend this. I hope valve actually makes a new portal game, because this is really fun!"
6539,This game is one of the winning games in 2011. plus its even a sequel. i gotta say when i first saw this game was when i saw my brother playing it. that's when i got atractive to it. I gotta say i recommend playing this game and so should you. i get on this game mostly because i just go on community  chambers to play. or make one. and yes Ive made the series through the hard tests and i say you should go check it out. anyway have fun playing this game.
6540,really god wheatly sexy
6541,It is so much fun and I would definitely recommend it to people who are looking for a good challenge!
6542,Portal 2 is 11 years old but still beat a lot of modern puzzle solving games
6543,"This game is SO good the test chambers will be hard but look up tutorials and once you beat it, it will be easy"
6544,.
6545,"This is the first time I played Portal 2, in 2022.
This is definitely a classic that even you play in the future, it won't feel old.
Worth each penny of the price."

this is a fun game and the portal mechanics are very unique. you do not need to play portal 1 before playing portal 2 although i would recommend it because portal 1 is also a fun game."
6562,"This game is pretty good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next."
6563,theres a portal i think
6564,Still a great puzzle game 11 years later. Recommended
6565,portal 3
6566,To this day its still the best game I have ever played
6567,"It's portal. It's literally one of ""the greatest games of all time"" just download it and play it."
6568,good
6569,Pretty good i think
6570,"Great game, if your looking for a hard puzzle game to test your knowledge on physics and timing."
6571,"I'M GONNA BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN, WITH THE LEMONS!"
6572,I LOVE SPEEDRUNNING IT
6573,the campaign is soooooo much fun would highly recommend played the game through 3 times and it was still great fun the coop also exists and can be fun if you and your friend you are playing with can work together well
6574,GREAT
6575,im not big brain enough i need fwend to carry me cus im set 20
6576,really fun game especially coop. its just hilarious killing your friends with lasers and throwing them in fans. if you dont have friends then 1 git gud and 2 the solo play is also really good and fairly big brain
6577,"portal
2"
6578,"Wheatley's an idiot, but like... a funny idiot."
6579,Played and completed Portal and Portal 2 and yet I'm still waiting for my cake.
6580,"This game is very peculiar, it is a puzzle game that is difficult but fun to complete mixed with a lot of complicated physics. it is especially fun to place a portal above and below you so that you fall forever."
6581,Really cool game. A mix of comedy and tragedy. 8/10.
6582,"I can definitely see why people love this, but maybe it just isn't for me. It's hard to say why, I just wasn't a massive fan of the gameplay, but it did have good voice acting. To each their own I guess."
6583,"Good game has great puzzles, portal 1 was easier"
6584,"This game is very good, i mean... its really funny, there are good puzzle's and it has a great story"
6585,10/10 would be a trained button associate again.
6586,"Awesome puzzle game to play with friends, amazed at how well it's developed considering it was launched more than 10 years ago. Puzzle lovers will definitely enjoy this game."
6587,Ending hit me..
6588,"very fun gameplay, and entertaining dialogue. single player has really cool areas with a fun story. multiplayer is fun if you have friends. Overall, gg."
6589,has challenging puzzles
6590,"Masterful puzzles, chilling and emotional storytelling, hilarious voice acting. Portal 2 is a must play for anyone with a love of puzzle games. The fact that this game is a sequel is not a hindrance to new players as the game can be played without knowing the story of Portal (I played Portal 2 first and still love it). Ellen McLain and Stephen Merchant (He should do more voice acting because he's amazing) both play their respective robots brilliantly. For a puzzle video game to have one of the best credits ever (just wait and see) is kind of amazing. I love the community levels too. Seeing other people's puzzles makes the game seem more multiplayer to me (I have no friends that play portal to play coop with, the freaks) and even though I can't solve most of them, it keeps the game refreshing. I really, really, really (really) want a Portal 3, but until then, Portal Reloaded (a fan made mod) will do. VALVE! Learn to count to 3 please!"
6591,Pretty solid game. Staple of my childhood

2. Put portal directly under that.
3. Goodbye.
Wonderfully narrated game."
6604,Gud Game
6605,"Yap good game

10/10"
6606,"An absolute Masterpiece that IMO surpasses the first Portal. Excellent tight puzzle gameplay. A wonderful properly paced story with memorable moments and charming murderous characters. There is a separate distinct Co-op campaign so you can enjoy more of this goodness with a friend. Extensive Steam workshop support ensures near infinite content and replay-ability, either solo or often with a friend.

A must-play and must-have for any gamer."

6641,It nice game
6642,Don't make lemonade
6643,The one Valve game that they didn't ruin.
6644,Play it
6645,"A must play game for anyone who loves solving puzzles.  A 3D puzzle that uses a physical body to set the ""pieces"" and physically navigate said body as you go through the course.  I'm especially thankful for the community created maps; they can be easy as pie to extremely frustrating until you get the ""duh"" or ""wow"" moment.  The humor is dry yet will give you a chuckle once in a while.  The violence is limited to the user falling into water, getting burned, crushed, and shot at BUT no physical gore to be seen (except some blood lines which look more like red paint).  The death is quick and subtle (screen just dims to black without showing any body or gore) so you don't have to worry about your kids getting scarred mentally.  So if you would like to introduce your children to a game that has the concept of death (without gore) while letting them flex their brains solving puzzles, this is the one!"
6646,one of my favorite games recommend strongly.
6647,Are you still there?
6648,"COop is fun, though not sure if there are puzzles outside of the standard game play like the there is for Chell layer. GLaD0S is up to SOMETHING, for sure."
6649,good game
6650,robot ahhhhh
6651,sick brav
6652,just play it.
6653,Good game...
6654,portal and portal 2 (as well as all of its free community made and really great expansions) are a series of 'redacted' that aim to improve the connection between machines and their servant 'redacted' and is really 'redacted'. Furthermore u get a talking potato. 10/10
6655,i love the game. first time i played it i was about 9 or so on the ps3
6656,"yeeh

6657,"What can I say, the game is a classic, and I only wish there were more games like it."

6681,PORTAL yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no? yes
6682,"I have not played the game since it came out, but restarting it came up with this recommendation so, yes, I recommend this game to everyone. It's complexity is enough to keep it interesting and the player created levels make it infinite. 
Co-op was the reason I wanted to play it and I was not disappointed at all, the quick comms make the game enjoyable to focus on the mission and not the flack that tends to happen in an open chat. There are plenty of other avenues to speak to a team."
6683,It is good
6684,"This was amazing and thoroughly fun to play. The puzzles were hard, but not too hard in 90% of the game.  I will have to admit that I did have to consult a walk-through several times to get the answers! The dialogue of the robots is hilarious and adds so much to the game play. Took me about 10 hours to finish and I wanted MORE!  It was habit forming and I couldn't wait to get to the next puzzle.  A great game not to be missed."
6685,dis game gud
6686,Great game! I find myself always returning to it after all those years.
6687,There is a reason this game is the highest rated game on Steam. [b]PLAY IT.[/b]
6688,Dramatically memorable; I mean just hearing Wheatley accent makes me want to go throughout all the puzzles again.
6689,"Pretty good game with good graphics,smart puzzles and more! Definetely buy it"
6690,it is awesome its a classic its quite hard u gotta have to do alot of thinking
6691,"This game is an masterpiece. A perfect sequel to equally hit 2007 puzzle game that uses same engine mark as [i]Half-Life 2: Episode 2[/i]. Everything is good: level design, puzzles, music, visuals, characters, optimization, humor, story, secrets, new elements, an addition of co-op mode with different story and level editor, final boss and the ending. RIP energy pellets (2007-2011 | replaced by laser beam). 

Don't miss it!"
6692,A amazing sequel as fun to play as the first and with more game play mechanics as well as being more challenging the story continues on from portal 1 and i got to say 10/10 story and characters are great the games also even funnier then the first would 100% recommend also banging music
6693,i fucking love GLaDOS

6708,"I don't know how to explain it but, shoot portal there and there, realize your wrong, realize your maidenless and haven't been outside in 7 days then try again.

Now here is a bread recipe you guys can enjoy,


1. In the bowl of a mixer, stir to dissolve the yeast in ¾ cup of the warm water, and let sit for 5 minutes. Add the remaining 2⅔ cups water, sugar, salt, room temperature butter, and 5 cups of the flour and stir to combine.

2. Using a dough hook, mix on low speed and gradually add the remaining flour until the dough is soft and tacky, but not sticky (you may not need to use all of the flour). Continue to knead until a soft ball of dough forms and clears the sides of the bowl, about 7 to 10 minutes.

3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and turn it over so it is completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a draft-free place to rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

4. Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface. Gently press it all over to remove any air pockets. Divide the dough in two and, working with one piece at a time, gently pat it into a 9x12-inch rectangle. Roll up the rectangle, starting on the short end, into a very tight cylinder. Pinch to seal the seams and the ends, tuck the ends of the roll until the bread, and place into greased 9-inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves loosely and place in a draft-free area until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.

5. Position an oven rack on the lowest setting and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Brush the loaves with some of the melted butter. Bake the loaves for 30 to 35 minutes, rotating halfway through, until golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 195 degrees F)."

6720,"Best puzzle game I've played, one of the best games of all time"

6729,"This game is freaking awesome
I just love all of it, the puzzles, mechanics, the story line(s), the multiplayer, ALL OF IT!
Huge step up from the first game in terms of basically everything.
There's so many new mechanics, the gel, lasers, faith plates, funnels, light bridges, probably more tbh
There's tons of playtime worth, and the achievements are all fun and enjoyable to get (except for rock portal scissors, curse you valve.) heck, even at the time of this review I've only gotten half the achievements and haven't even completed the co-op mode yet.
The story is just such a delight, the story for the first game was fine but after playing this game I just think of the first game as a glorified build up to this.
Co-op is fun, plenty ways to plunge your friends into a lake of acid
The puzzles always manage to keep things fresh and interesting, and the story events help put buffers in between, unlike the first game's system of puzzle after puzzle. You visit plenty different unique locations and I love the bit where you got to explore old aperture.  
I love this video game franchise please make portal 3 (:"

6758,"I am trying to think if I like portal 1 or portal 2  more ,well I like portal 1 because of how fast you can speed run the game but in general I think I like portal 2 more because they introduced more of the story and they made coop in the game and that is amazing because there is campaign for coop and community made levels for coop and I think that is amazing ,the portal 2 community is great as well like I know someone that is making a 32 player mod for the coop because why not hahah and he and his team are trying to make the single player coop ,so it is all fun and great 
If you played Portal 1 and if you havent go and play it now ,but if you played it and liked it then you have to play this game or you are doing a big sin to gamers hahah ,the story is like 4 to 6 hours long so not that long ,have fun .thank you for reading this"
6759,"Great puzzles, fantastic story, amazing level maker, this game is awesome.

Only complaint is that it requires effort to find actual good maps in the workshop as most ""popular"" courses are  not challenging, very bacis or plain bad"

For chocolate cake, you’ll need the following ingredients.

all-purpose flour
sugar
unsweetened cocoa powder
baking powder
baking soda
salt
espresso powder – I give more information on the espresso powder below
milk – you can also use buttermilk, almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk
oil – you can use vegetable, canola or melted coconut oil
eggs – when baking, I like to use room temperature eggs
vanilla extract
boiling water
Chell
portal gun

Step-by-Step Instructions
Prep. Preheat the oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.

Whisk dry ingredients. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.

Mix in wet ingredients. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.

Bake. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean."

6795,"Finishing up Portal 2 after replaying favorite games from growing up was a treat. It is honestly impressive that these games can still have a draw and replay value, qualities that puzzle games have a unique disadvantage at. The humor is the kind of dark humor and situational irony that I personally love and I think can appeal to a wide audience. I remember being 11 year old me patiently waiting for the latest Portal game and what a blast it was to experience. The nostalgia road was fun to walk down and I am glad that it is not over yet. Portal and Portal 2 have active modding communities to provide fan-made levels and content that is everything a fan could want. I am currently working on Portal Stories: Mel and am blown away at the dedication of the fan-base. There's no reason to not play these games and to do your part contributing to Science!"
6796,Funn
6797,good
6798,"This game is a masterpiece, play it if you haven't!"
6799,"Portal 2 is a masterpiece, even surpassing the incredible experience that portal 1 was"

6810,"This game and it's prequel are both masterpieces, I still play them to this day with my friends on coop and on my own just for fun, valve if your listening, i know it's been rough for your company trying too deal with all of the money your making off of steam, but please do your community a favour and release an actual game (not vr) like for example finishing the half life series!?? (and portal 3 of course)"

6820,"Aswell as being set in the half-life universe this game also is well withing the league of the half-life games. While this games game-play is one of the best in the world, Portal 2's amazing storytelling ability is one of the greatest features of this game. With lore scattered throughout the game it not only makes it a great puzzle solving game, being immersed in a labyrinth of story adds a entire other side to this game. If you thinking of buying this game then be sure to pickup the Half-life games and the original portal game."

6857,"Гениальная. Шедевральная. Богоподобная. Не существует других эпитетов, способных по достоинству описать это творение. Портал 2 - одна из лучших игр из когда-либо созданных. В ней попросту нету минусов. Вообще. Идеальная техническая часть, восхитительный и абсолютно уникальный геймплей, интересный и захватывающий сюжет, потрясная атмосферу, звуковое сопровождение, музыка и много другое. Для меня это идеальная игра. Я не могу придумать, как её можно было бы сделать лучше. Я бесконечно влюблён в персонажей, хоть их и не так много(мягко говоря), но они настолько запоминающиеся и уникальные, что ты ну просто не можешь не влюбиться даже в вечно пытающуюся тебя убить Гладос или бестолкового Витли. Тот случай, когда не можешь ничего сказать не потому, что говорить нечего, а от того, что боишься перейти в бездонный монолог восхищения этой игрой, который продлится десятки часов. Если коротко: 10 из 10. Одна из лучших, если не лучшая игра в истории."

And you experiance a very good story that only has 3 characthers (including you).
So if you like guns that makes holes (not bullet holes) and a great story that has very few characters this game is for you"

6899,"It's not even really a puzzle game, in a way. It's a narrative-focused game masquerading as a puzzle game. Its nine impeccably paced chapters feature a clear inciting incident, midpoint, point of no return, climax, and brief epilogue. As textbook as it is brilliant."

6907,"It's so freaking fun
The unique game play and its story telling is insane"
6908,"TLDR: An essential PC game, everyone with a PC that considers themselves a PC gamer should play this at least once in their life.

Portal is a game like no other, not only in mechanics but in the way it can build the world without directly telling the player anything. The story is gripping, the puzzle aspects are challenging but rewarding, and the second game adds some refreshing new aspects like different liquids that can be portalled around. And don't even get me started on the co-op.

The co-op is in my opinion the best part of this game. And while the singleplayer is great, the co-op takes it to a whole other level. I probably have spent 75% of my hours in this game just messing around with friends, sabotaging them while also having a fun time putting our 2 brain cells together to try and solve the levels. I wish the co-op was longer, but this game is well worth the money for the co-op alone."
6909,"truly peak gaming

6920,You can ALSO make a corpse pile in this game.
6921,portal
6922,I've been replaying the portal 2 campaign and the game just has this mysterious feeling to it. I wish everyone would give it a try just for that perplexing feeling it gives.

6931,"Good puzzles, good story, good characters, good game."
6932,fun
6933,The portaling aspect is perfect!
6934,"I have recently been trying to get into Valve's whole series of games. So I started with ""Portal"", which went from me not liking it too much to absolutely loving it. After playing ""Portal"" I waited a while until I finally played ""Portal 2"". And I should have played Portal 2 earlier. It was an amazing game. Of course, a lot of the puzzles in the game hurt my brain... A lot. But that is what is so intriguing about this game. It has some of the most well thought out, and advanced level-building skills of any game out there. The characters are so well written out. They actually feel like characters I want to follow along with. Not just objects there to guide me through a game. The story is so good too. Is it impressive? No. It was expected when I started it. I had heard so many good things about this game even before I played it. And it lived up to the hype. This game is a masterpiece in itself. It has whitty humor, and amazing environmental story-telling. 10/10, masterpiece.

It took the ideas that the first Portal game introduced and brought them to their full potential, then wrapped it in a story that had no right being as well-written as it was. I would consider this a must-play for almost anyone who has a Steam account, especially if you're a fan of puzzle games. An easy 10/10"

7000,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It's not a game known for it's story, but the ending is quite epic. Haven't tried coop yet, but pretty sure it will just be as awesome if not even better with friends. Highly recommend even 10 years later after the original release date if you still haven't tried it yet."

Definitely good as a mental workout though! Very enjoyable, original, captivating, and immersive story mode as well."

7075,"Great and original and high-quality, I recommend it!"
7076,i hate portals make my stomach turn.
7077,i really like the mechanics of gel and lasers but i think the best thing about this game is the complecity of the puzzels
7078,NICE
7079,A perfect game if there ever was one.
7080,"In my humble Opinion this is valves strongest title, hands down. As someone who really isn't huge on puzzle games the fact that this game is in my top 5 games of all time is clearly an indicator that its done something right. It takes the simple formula from its predecessor and cranks it up to 11. The puzzles are Challenging but fair. That said sometimes finding where you need to go in certain levels is a bit of a pain and the level that plays the infamous ""Combustible lemons"" line I can never figure out for some reason and I don't know why. However besides those tinniest of hiccups the game design is perfect. 

On a visual level for a game over a decade old the game is still incredible looking. This is both a testament to the art team of this game and the incredible versatility of the source engine. The aesthetics in the game are also have more variety than Portal 1 and have levels that I've loved since I was kid first watching this game on Youtube. While many of the levels still have that clean, laboratory feel to it we also get plenty of abandoned overgrown areas, rusted forgotten locations deep underground and a glimpse at just how massive the facility is as it is torn apart. The few character designs we get are perfect and GLADOS's new look is sleeker and better looking than before.

Speaking of GLADOS its time we mention perhaps the best part of this game which is the story and its characters. Despite this being an older game I will not spoil the story because if for some reason you have both avoided spoilers AND are trying to see if this game is worth it, the story is best enjoyed when you don't know the twists. The main story is 2-3 times longer than its predecessor but is vastly more enjoyable. We get more characters, more lore and backstory to the history of Aperture science including the history of GLADOS herself as well as a satisfying conclusion to chell's story. As for newcomers, the most beloved and iconic is Wheatley, The loveable, dorky, and idiotic personality sphere who is trying to free you from the clutches of Glados. Stephen Merchants voice work for him is iconic and spectacular making him feel truly alive. Without spoiling too much Wheatley has such a fun and unexpected arc in the story and his big twist moment about halfway through the game is expertly done. For our second new characer we have Cave Johnson, Founder of Aperture Science and eccentric CEO voiced by the legendary J.K Simmons. He is funny, assertive, yet comforting and provides an incredible insight to the history of his company. As for recurring characters we have GLADOS. Yes chell also is here but she doesn't have any significant changes. GLADOS is probably still the best character in this series despite some fantastic new characters, and she goes through a surprising yet memorable character arc. Re-Awoken after her destruction  in Portal 1 she is once again 'Still Alive' and this time she is crueler than ever. Ellen McLain once again reprises her role as the homicidal mistress that torments us and this time shes more human than ever. Her voice is much less robotic and lot more human this time and its a welcome addition. Cracking more jokes than ever and consistently assaulting Chell with either backhand compliments or at times flat out calling you 'Smelly Garbage' she is more spiteful than ever. Despite her new cruel stroke however she is also more human and sympathetic than ever after the mid-game plot twist. We get to learn about her tragic backstory and she begins to soften up to Chell. I will end the explanation there to avoid spoilers but truly GLADOS is one of the best video game characters in history and this game is the reason. 

The co-op is also a fun addition to the game and while its stories are not as in-depth or deep as the base game, the focus more so is on you and your partner trying to solve puzzles together so an in depth story would have been hard to focus on as your drops you into acid for his own amusement. That said its still a fun little narrative and P-Body and ATLAS are 2 new little robots that despite not having any dialogue still have plenty of lovable charm. 

The music and sound design is also great. From the sound of lasers, to your portal gun, to wall plates moving everything in this game sounds top notch and fitting. The soundtrack also has changed. In Portal 1, it was much more of an ambient drone but in portal 2 it has much more complexity and is welcome. The best way I can describe it is imagine a fax machine started making music. Its great and has some really good bits of music in it.

Overall, this game deserved every award it got and more. It is one of the greatest games ever told and every aspect about it deserves praise. Besides some tiny annoyances it is a perfect game. It makes me want a portal 3 so bad but also the way it ends equally makes me ok with it stopping. If we never get another portal game that would be completely fine because this game is fine the way it is. That said Aperture desk job has shown me something I never considered. We don't need a portal 3. The story of Portal is over. I think we just need more stories within the Aperture facilities. Chell's story is over as is GLADOS's. While you could perhaps expand on Wheatley's it is far from essential. That's all I have to say, this game can be enjoyed by everyone and probably should

7106,it good
7107,ye its good
7108,yes
7109,Classic
7110,"This is an amazing game, First of all the story is really amazing the story and how they fit the new and old mechanics together is done super well done. Second as you go through the game it teaches you more about the newer mechanics and as you get closer to the end more of the new mechanics start to be put together and in the end it all comes together. Third the character's and how they're put in the story make the game a lot more interesting and funny. Finally the co-op courses are really fun and make the game easier (or harder depending on how the other person plays) and it adds a lot more to the game making the game much more re-playable. Also the community made maps add something new so that way your not playing the same chambers over and over and you have something new."
7111,yes
7112,Best duo game! Very entertaining!!!
7113,yea
7114,good

7119,soooooooooooooooooooooo good
7120,"It may not be as revolutionary as the original, but getting to know more backstory of Aperture Science was really fun (especially J Jonah Jameson himself in ""Cave Johnson""). I also really enjoyed the Co-Op aspect, especially with my life partner who normally wouldn't do an FPS. Absolutely worth the Full Retail price I paid when it came out, and it an absolute bargain at $10 here in 2022 as I write this."
7121,I will sell my first unborn child for Portal 3 or Portal: Rattman or whatever the fuck they decide to call it
7122,good
7123,"     The first game was better but that is typical... this game would have been a perfect console game as will especially PlayStation 5! And before you skip this or down vote it etc. This has absolutely nothing to do with the console wars and yes I am adding PC with this review! I have every console every made to my knowledge including the old consoles hardly no one knows about! As well as a custom PC and and Alienware PC that is maxed out as far as upgrades (however it is 10 plus years old) still runs like a beast though! lol!  I would recommend Alienware for a cheap gaming PC out of the box! I bought mine before Dell took it over but my friends from the Army has bought one since then and swear by them because even though Dell bought them they still allow them to do there own thing and stay the company they always were, as far as I've read and my Army friends have said. Sorry for the book but I wanted you to know that I don't have a hardware preference just as long as i love the game which I do on this one! I wish it would've been on the PlayStation 5 or Xbox series X because that was 50% of what made the game so fun! At least that's what I thought. As far as the game play is concerned it is an awesome game play experience just like the first one the puzzles are great and the comedy is there!!! I'm halfway through right now but so far NO CAKE YET!!!!!!   LMAO!!!"
7124,Portals & shii
7125,"A great continuation of the first game. Not many things to say that haven't been said already. It's a masterpiece, go play it!"

7132,Good
7133,"[h1]A big step up to the original game in every aspect.[/h1]

The aesthetics and overall design have been drastically improved, while still keeping its core look similarly and being nicely optimized. The movement and animations also feel significantly smoother.

The mechanics have recieved an overwhelming overhaul, introducing numerous new stuff, such as various gel with their own characteristics, hard-light surfaces, etc. The core gameplay is still somewhat similar, mainly relying on your portal gun to progress across the levels.

The world design has undergone through a massive change relative to the original Portal. Both games rely on a heavily ""clinical"" look, using a lot of white and black for the levels; however, Portal 2 introduces some new themes of Test Chambers, such as ruins (since the installations were destroyed during the end of Portal, as you would know if you played the original game), overgrown, and several more.
Additionally, in the old game you often feel ""restricted"" in a way to the interior of the rooms. However, here they are not limited to the internal levels, but you actually feel the vastness and loneliness of the laboratories. This is also partially due to the greatly enhanced sound and music design, with a lot more variety in the OST; you can even hear birds across the world  while still feeling quite isolated, substantially contributing to its inmersiveness.

Lastly, the main campaign is more than double the length, because there are numerous more levels and they generally take longer, due to its more complex mechanics, previously described. It also introduces a two-player cooperative mode with even more chambers.

In essence, It doesn't just live up to the expectations of the old classic Portal, but clearly surpasses it.
Absolutely recommended to everyone, but only after you have played its predecessor, as this game's story acts like a sequel."

7244,"To be honest no one's gonna read my review (cause there's already a ton of amazing reviews out there)

So if someone DOES happen to see this, just play the game lol, you won't regret it! I promise :D

Update: Wow, thank you all for the support! Honestly didn't expect my review to reach 150 people. Thank you all again! :)

7267,"⬛ About the game:

Portal 2 is a 2011 puzzle-platform video game developed by Valve for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's Steam service, while all retail editions were distributed by Electronic Arts. A port for the Nintendo Switch was included as part of Portal: Companion Collection.

Like the original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 2 adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the single-player campaign, players control Chell, who navigates the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the supercomputer GLaDOS (Ellen McLain); new characters include robot Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Aperture founder Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). In the new cooperative mode, players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker). Jonathan Coulton and the National produced songs for the game.

Valve announced Portal 2 in March 2010, and promoted it with alternate reality games including the Potato Sack, a collaboration with several independent game developers. After release, Valve released downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share levels.

Portal 2 received critical acclaim for its gameplay, balanced learning curve, pacing, dark humor, writing, and acting. Like its predecessor, it has been described as one of the greatest video games ever made by numerous publications and critics.

⬛ My opinion:

Sound: 7/10
Graphics: 8/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Replay value: 8/10
Story: 7/10"
7268,"It was a really fun game, 10/10"
7269,"It's really fun, and after you get done with the single player campaign you can do the community's chambers"
7270,good
7271,Classic
7272,sploinky boinky
7273,one of my top 10 fave games of all time.
7274,"Hands down my favorite VALVE game... No, I will not change that opinion."
7275,9 out of 10 doctors recommend this game
7276,its a classic how can you not like it
7277,"One of the best games I've owned. Hours upon hours of solid fun in singleplayer, multiplayer, or in custom levels."
7278,"This game is so good, I wish it was actually 3000 hours longer"
7279,This game is as fun as fishing 🐟
7280,better then portal one so 7/10
7281,"Fatty. Adopted fatty. Fatty fatty, no parents :("
7282,"great game
"
7283,You already know its good
7284,yes
7285,Genuinely one of the best puzzle games out there with entertaining characters and witty dialogue and Cave Johnson has created explosive lemons
7286,portal gun go whoosh
7287,this game is very fun. i loved the story line and i feel like they SHOULD make a portal three because i just looved this game and if you haven't played the first one then you might not know whats going on so i very much suggest you play the first game before you play this one
7288,blue moron sphere funny
7289,add vr!!!
7290,10/10
7291,an amazing game <3 hyperfixation of the week
7292,It fun lol
7293,i don't like it plus i didn't get it for free
7294,Games like this are sooooo much fun!!!!
7295,portal but with a 2
7296,Still with getting it after so long
7297,"This game is just breathtaking. Not just the visuals, but the whole story. It just all makes sense, something that many games fail to achieve. In the end, basically every part of the lore is tied up in meaningful and satisfying way. That's the thing about this game, It just makes sense. 10/10 from me."
7298,Fun game to speedrun
7299,"love the mechanics, the co-op missions really make me think"
7300,"epic, just epic"
7301,its fun
7302,"Valve has really done it.

Pros:
-GLaDOS
-New characters
-Great story

Cons:
-No portal 3"
7303,GLaDOS is bae
7304,it gud
7305,yes
7306,If Portal was better in every way.
7307,"the gameplay is legendary, the graphics are a big jump from games like portal 1 and half-life 2, despite being made in the same exact engine and designed with the same exact tool- source and Hammer.

not only that--- the soundtrack is absolutely, unbelievably, godly. this game is recommended as long as you play portal 1. you should definitely listen to the soundtrack after beating the game. i love the ones like Science is Fun, The Friendly Faith Plate, Bombs For Throwing At You, and so much more. if you don't play this after portal 1 yet still have it installed, sitting alone on your computer, you will be murdered in your sleep by- you guessed it- me."
7308,"Here we are, 12 years later, and games have regressed. Graphics / physics engines have gotten (a little) better, but that's it. Everything that makes an actual gaming experience like Portal 2, left and never returned. Passion has been removed from modern day gaming in all but a few titles. I got a PC to play these older games, from one of the best times in gaming history, to take a break from the literal trash that so many gaming companies produce today. Upon being reminded what real games are, I pray that gaming can someday return to what it used to be."
7309,"The best game of all time I would say - it is not just a game, it is a class for it's own! 
"
7310,Old and Gold
7311,good soup
7312,play with friends good game and do my terst chambers
7313,"Portal 2 is a worthy successor to a classic game, both the single and multiplayer are awesome and well deserving of any praise received."
7314,luv this <3
7315,"amazing puzzle game
when is portal 3 coming out"
7316,"A very nice and fun game, also the story from Portal 1 continiues so first play it and then play this. Puzzles and the environment are adorable."
7317,it's good
7318,"you go through hole

come out other hole"
7319,good and fun
7320,"portal
"
7321,"Such memes such great means.
Love the game"
7322,"Ok. Ive already praised game 1 and game 2 is STILL better. The sequel did not dissapoint in any way.

The game is perfect in my opinion. The best part of game 1 has been kept the same which is the gameplay only that every other aspect of the game has improved, and by a lot. The story is amazing and even has some nice puns in it. The 2 main plot twists are well made and came as a bit of a surprise.

Gameplay as in game 1 is amazing. Nothing else to add.

The multiplayer part of this game has really given me a nice time in this game. Hunting times in different chanmbers with your friends is a reallyfun thing to do and the addition of the workshop chamber gives the game a lot of time you for you to spend in it.

Amazing 10/10.

If you dont have it get it now or you will forever be cursed to step on sharp lega bricks."
7323,Definitely play the first Portal before this otherwise you may lack a sense of what the heck is going on.
7324,I came

7326,"Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.

And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits They don't belong to you For most of you I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears Although for one of you the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole so don't keep the devil waiting old friend

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

This ends for all of us.

End communication"

7352,"excelente historia y ambientación, personajes carismáticos, puzzles y mecánicas geniales y gráficos que se mantienen preciosos incluso luego de 11 años."

7366,"Absolutely love this game to death, honestly such a masterful adventure and experience, I cannot get enough of its charming, humorous, sinister, deep story and it's unique gameplay and story telling. Played it completely blind and safe to say its one of my favourite games of all time. And Valve, if by the smallest chance you read this, WE NEED PORTAL 3! Even Erik Wolpaw wants to make it before he's too old to write/develop it. Love you Valve, and love you Portal.  :)"
7367,amazing
7368,"Please describe what you liked or disliked about this product.
"
7369,made me cry
7370,This game is amazing. I played it for 3 days continuously. Easily gets immersed into it and allows you to hook and finish.
7371,"I can't imagine that anyone doesn't know this by now, but Portal 2 is an amazing accomplishment and a fantastic successor to the first game (which was already one of the best games ever).  The unique blend of creativity, humor, and elaborate puzzle design presented by this series is unforgettable.  Stephen Merchant also delivers a perfect performance along the way.  Be sure to grab a friend to play through the excellent co-op mode once you've finished the main story, as it's a true bonding experience."
7372,"Finally, the journey comes to an end; there were times when I was euphoric with delight and times when I was infuriated, but it was all worth it. The story was so beautiful that it almost made me weep at the end.
My only suggestion is that you don't skip Portal 1, since you won't be able to correlate the tale to the storyline otherwise."
7373,Great story. One of my favorite childhood games. Good way to build team building and communication skills via co-op.
7374,My Friend Got A Custom Chamber And Added Bounce Gel EVERYWHERE. Also Works Great On A Potato
7375,"so i was playing the game and i saw that the cube was far away and i needed to get it with the portal gun, but i really had to use the bathroom, so i held back and kept trying to get the cube but i got really frustrated trying to get it, not to mention how hot it was in my room because my air conditioner was broken, not only was i extremely frustrated i also had to crap and was dying of heat. after i finally thought i got close i ended up falling, i got really angry and jumped out of my seat but the anger was to much and i ended up soiling my pants, as i stood there poop dropping on the heated floor, i was sweating after looking up to realize that the cube had yet not moved. 10/10 game."
7376,Great writing and even better gameplay
7377,"Great game! You learn to take your time to figure out the escape route, you start to hypothesise and then test it. so much fin, and the sense of humour of the creators is weaved in, at times super daggy but in the best dad joke way."
7378,"play it, its a good sequal they did a good job adding to the story instead of just stretching it out"
7379,portal rely gud hav fun tim wit dis guum
7380,"Its a game, not a another game but a game i am  still trying to figure out how to shoot portal"

7391,"this is the game that made me get a steam account in the first place

7392,"Portal, except 2"
7393,This game is to hard for any person who does not understand logic very well
7394,"One of the best games ever made. If Valve finds a way to make portal VR without severe motion sickness, then I would actually get a headset."
7395,Great game from Valve do think number 3 should be out by now
7396,good

7452,as quirky a game as its story is
7453,this game is awesome
7454,"Everything, literally everything about the game is perfect."
7455,great game its worth the investment
7456,"Fantastic story, level design, graphics and voice acting. Portal 2 took everything good out of Portal 1 and somehow made it better, managing to make one of the best games of all time.

10/10"
7457,Love. This. Game! Portal 3 can haz plz now?
7458,Finally got round to playing the Portal games and I have to say I get why they're seen as a classic now! If you haven't played them yet download and play them now! They've definitely stood the test of time!
7459,i mean never played the first one but its good i put a lot hours into it would def give it to my grandma
7460,"it's just good. the writing is fantastic, the music is great, the game looks amazing, and it's incredible to play."
7461,"yes
"
7462,Perfect game
7463,Good shit
7464,best game of the century
7465,"To  keep it short just like my previous Portal review, I love this game. The story is amazing and engaging and the gameplay is more of the same which makes me happy. The levels get a little more interesting in the late game and it made the game even more fun. The voicing further adds to this masterpiece and I'm glad I played this game. Valve may not be able to count to three, but they can make a damn good sequel to an already great game. Easy 10/10."
7466,fun game4
7467,Pretty good game. Not sure if it's still worth 8€. Multiplayer was awesome. The main storyline is relatively short. I wished it was a little harder and more replayable.
7468,"I'M NOT A MORON!

-Wheatley 2011"
7469,"The game is cool and so fun You can play with friends and download  mods and then play with friends,Maybe then portal 3 is not coming out but the mod in protal 2 are so cool and so fun to play i give this game 10/10"
7470,He's in space.
7471,"It's a fun puzzle game with a good story and lore, and with online support you could play player-made level's or have fun with your friend's in co-op!"
7472,portal gun fun
7473,"as someone who has been putting off playing portal 2, i'm glad to say the game is extremely fun and challenging. it's got some of the greatest puzzles and challenges i have played in a puzzle game or a video game period, the writing and comedy is genius glad0s is still as good as ever and wheatly is probably the greatest antagonist in gaming history (as is glad0s). must buy if you are just getting into pc gaming"
7474,good 2
7475,Fun game. You have to think pretty abstractly to get through it. Humor in this game is golden like the first one.
7476,fun puzzles with lots of modding support. great story too and one of the best coop experiences there is
7477,"its good game
"
7478,funny
7479,Very good game. The song they play at the end before the credits just makes me imagine WarOwl missing all his shots.
7480,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
7481,its really good
7482,This is my favorite game of all time! Nuff said.
7483,One of THE best games on Steam. I also hope that I will play it with a friend one day to get those sweet sweet multiplayer achievements.
7484,"If you like fan made levels and puzzles, buy this. It's awesome!"
7485,"Poggers game no KYAPPA  :Skull_Emoji:x7

"
7486,"The game is a bit difficult for me to play by myself, so I usually play with a friend (which works a lot better for me). Interesting premise with an amusingly passive aggresive narrator bot. It's fun but I can't play it too often."
7487,Fun game to play with a friend if you can get it for cheap.
7488,"incredible game, lives up to the massive expectations of the original

the portal series is a must-play and is groundbreaking in terms of gameplay and originality, along with a decent storyline

try it out!"
7489,Good story and is one of the most memorable games you can play
7490,"still a good puzzle game, buy it"
7491,I get to use cheats and see wheatly and glados.
7492,Best puzzle game
7493,"ah
"
7494,Extremely fun. played with my brother for 10 hours straight. story is also very interesting
7495,"Incredible game that really surprised me after portal 1 being a good but short, more basic game. This one really explored a lot of lore and feels a lot more 'sci-fi dystopian' which I love"
7496,GG
7497,It's very good. haven't completed it on PC yet but i have on Xbox. amazing game.
7498,"Classic game.  Originally owned these on PS3 but since there's no emulation, backwards compatibility, or even PS4/5 offerings, I figured repurchasing them here.  The only complaint I would have of this game is that by the time you complete them, you are left wanting more."
7499,"[h1] Portal 2 [/h1]

[b] A Perfect Sequel, And A Near-Perfect Game [/b]

Now this is quality - a sequel that ups the scale, intensity, humor, creativity, engagement, and amount of content over its predecessor while maintaining its creative design, quality presentation, and mechanical nuance. I’ll go ahead and say it here folks - [b] Portal 2 [/b] is one of the best games you can play in your lifetime. Is it my favorite game of all time? No, not at this moment. But it's a damn good time and something you absolutely should go ahead and start playing before reading the rest of this review!

For starters, the gameplay loop is completely preserved in this title, only its bigger, more creative, and more engaging. Levels feel much more wide open, they have stronger focuses on physics mechanics, and they’re more challenging as you progress. It feels like much of the game picks up from where [b] Portal [/b] left off, and while it still gives a nice tutorial, it doesn’t drag out its length. It lets experienced players play around with the mechanics much faster, and avoids keeping new players chained down in the fun department like the original game did. Additionally, there are some nice new mechanics to play around with. There’s more momentum based puzzles, new goo mechanics (blue for bouncing, orange for speed, white for new platforms to portal to, and water to wash it all away!). There are also light ramps that serve as platforms and for blocking dangerous obstacles. It gives the game loads of new content, risk, and creativity for test chambers without stripping the flow that the first game introduced - a good focus for a sequel to have.

The story is pretty good as well. Obviously not as great as the improvements in gameplay, but it gives a great backdrop and honestly gives you some good reasons to progress forward. Essentially, GLaDOS is alive again and you have to figure out a way to shut down Aperture Science yet again, but there is a lot of great lore and mythos introduced as well as some great performances from Ellen McLain (GLaDOS) and Stephen Merchant (Wheatley). It’s an engaging ride full of some fun twists and turns, and elevates itself nicely above the smart but occasionally stagnant story of the original. Good stuff all around!

Valve’s presentation is also top notch here yet again. While this title doesn’t contain the most cutting edge graphics of the time, it's still an easy game on the eyes. Chambers range from eerily spotless and white to dilapidated and rotting, with much in between. You also get to see new sides of the facility you would’ve never been able to imagine before. An even more impressive aspect is the sound quality, with creaks and moans emanating from the broken Aperture Sciences facility. As mentioned before, the voice work is top notch, but there’s an added depth given with the robotic, programmed manner of GLaDOS, the more irritating yet endearing style of Wheatley, and the looming, omnipresent, and hilariously dumb Cave Johnson (voiced by J.K. Simmons). Valve really takes care in making sure their singleplayer titles are rich and immersive, and [b] Portal 2 [/b] is up there with [b] Half-Life 2 [/b] in this aspect.

What put this game in a whole other tier was its quality cooperative campaign. I expected something fun but sort of brainless, and thought there would be much more sloppiness that would take away from the experience. However, there is both online/local play, mod support, and a solid amount of levels to play through that all have very well tweaked puzzles for two players. It’s amazing that this was able to be pulled off, and it helps this game transition from a bite-sized experience to a full AAA title. I had a great time playing through this mode with my girlfriend, and it was a nice way to cap off the fun I had with this game!

With its awesome single-player campaign and great cooperative campaign, great presentation and voice work, and combination of risky gameplay mechanics and staying true to the [b] Portal [/b] formula, [b] Portal 2 [/b] may be the best sequel ever made. It takes a grand step in elevating [b] Portal [/b] from a groundbreaking new IP into a franchise with a premier AAA entry, and it's a shame that a sequel was never quite developed for this one. There are virtually no flaws with this game that I can think of, save for a few odd test chambers here and there that weren’t “as fun” as the others. This is a definite [b] Recommend [/b] for me, and anyone who enjoys video games (let alone first-person puzzlers) should play this one through at least once in their lives.

[h2] Final Verdict: 10/10 (Masterpiece) [/h2]

7559,"Hello, this is the part where I kill you"
7560,fun
7561,"Simply fantastic, wouldnt feel old even when playing in 2022. Graphic and atmosphere were awesome."
7562,this game is so good its completely ruined my taste in video games
7563,A Classic
7564,Puzzles start off relatively easy and get harder with new elements introduced as you progress. The best part is the story line and the genuinely funny comments voiced by everyone's favourite bristolian comedian - Steven Merchant.
7565,"really good but i need that portal 3
"
7566,"This is a true classic, and proof that a solid idea is more important than flashy graphics. That said, the graphics still hold up, even though the game is 11 years old. It's a clean and neat design, taking a lot of atmosphere from the Half Life series. No pixelated textures. With all settings maxed out, it looks great and there's not a single frame lagging. It is also very funny!
The game is, with a few tricky exceptions, pretty easy to run through. Portal Reloaded is a different matter. Damn, it's hard!"
7567,good game on xbox and pc
7568,"This game is good, but better when you start messing around with it"
7569,its basically half-life without the shooting. fun way to kill a bit of time.
7570,0/10 game of the year
7571,"Hey, how are you?

Portal 2 is an amazing first person, gun, puzzle game. It is released in 2011 but definitely still holds up to date. The graphics are really good, the physics are sometimes a but wonky, but the story development is awesome! Although it is quite short, it still worth the money for only 1,59 euro, when not on sale. If you like puzzles, this game is for you. If you are a fan of lore, this game is for you. If you want to play with a friend a puzzle game, this game is for you!
Cheers."

7580,yes
7581,love level editor
7582,This game is amazing but I almost punched my monitors at the easiest tests so obviously I wasn't meant to play this game. But still if you're smart then play this game 👍
7583,"One of my alltime favourites; It has it´s own mystical ""Half-Life"" atmosphere which makes this game so very special. After playing this game you´ll be able to think in portals :)"
7584,i think this game is the best story game ever i have beaten it 3 times and played lots of online maps i tried finding Easter eggs in the game and it is fun 10/10. There are also many mods for the game. you should try this game. next i will try speed running the game.
7585,"very e
"
7586,i have a cave jhonson body pillow
7587,"This is a fantastic play. The story gives just enough for you to be engaged, but keeps its little secrets for you to discover on your own. The humor is top-tier, and has not aged a day. Excellent voice-acting on all of the characters. Co-op is fun too. Excited for more games from Valve in the future."
7588,big brain power
7589,"[spoiler]I kind of wish there was a way to not have to strand Wheatley at the moon since I really liked his character.[/spoiler]

I swear, the Portal series is the only series that can make every character technically a villain and still make them both hilarious and likable as characters"
7590,Portal 2 is a fun and enjoyable game. It has a good emersive feel to it. And I would really recommend getting both Portal and Portal 2 for the best experience.
7591,"masterpeice
"
7592,"Ok just finished the game. Definitely became one of my favorite games. Writing is funny, gameplay is amazing, voice acting is once again good. However, no cake at the end. 
0/10 would not play again."

7594,its ok
7595,just beautiful amazing awesome loved it
7596,e
7597,Fun game
7598,A perfectly designed and executed experience...
7599,"I mean yeah, what can I say that hasn't already been discussed? I would argue that Portal 2 is the last best fps game Valve  ever made, excluding csgo (cause ya'll are toxic, free to play trash <3 (no hate ily.)). Half-Life Alyx is an fps, but is more of a vr tech demo than anything."

This game sucks if you want to get all the achievements. It hinges on other people being available (you need to play with three people and play with someone who hasn't touched the co-op) which is vastly annoying. The other singleplayer achievements are quite fun, however.

Despite this, it's a great game and the story is interesting and the puzzles are great. The multiplayer is a must if you have friends, and if you don't, the game is worth it for the singleplayer."

7762,"I like that in this game you get to meet the robots. There is a fun guy called wheetle and he has a blue eye big. Gladdy is a bad robot in the crib that trys to boot you out. It will hurt your feelings as she calls you fat in this game. You do get to win though in the end so its a good game in my book, homie. The game play is like you have a gun that is fun. It shoots out an orange and a blue thing that makes a funky hole. To me I don't know how they made that because it is actually impossible according to real life... The levels are just as like you would thing. YOu have to solve so many puzzle parts but as you go Gladdy makes fun of you more and really just doesnt be chill. I realize that it is Gladdys terf but the fact that when you play it it hurts your feelings."
7763,As close as it gets to a perfect video game.
7764,"This is an excellent example of how to make a good sequel - improve upon what made the original good.
In this case, Portal 2 has improved upon story, level design, and humour."
7765,Masterpiece as simple as that
7766,"replayed for like the 6th time, still amazing. funny british space ball, evil robot lady, silent protagonist, perfectly balanced. if you haven't played it yet what you doin'?"
7767,"Portal 2 is just portal 1, but longer, but that doesn't deter it from being bad, as this game is story rich and adds new mechanics like propulsion gel that bounces you across the place which is introduced in the later levels, What are you waiting for, empty your pockets

10/10 game"
7768,Yep... one of the best games ever made.
7769,Very cool
7770,TRUUUUE CLASSIC. TRUUE TRUUE TRUUUUUUE CLASSIC.
7771,yes
7772,"wow, now I'm thinking with portals"
7773,"This game was amazingly fun, and comical.  I found myself searching for more....ports to consoles, spin offs, anything.  Looks like fan made desolation, may come to fruition....can't wait."
7774,It rili test yah breyn
7775,peak game
7776,good gam.
7777,Truly one of Valve's best games.

7785,It'd be weird if you didn't have this game tbh
7786,A Video Game Masterpiece
7787,It's a classic
7788,Q

7790,i would very much like it if this game can have some more halflife code like portal 1 and
7791,nice
7792,great
7793,"this was a wonderful game, especially at the ending. this is another gr8 8/8 from me m8s. i suggest you play it as well if you have the time and steam credits to do so."
7794,It is a realy good game after you have played it
7795,"Portal 2= best game ever! The game took so long for me to play, but... IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! My only complaint was that there was nothing left to do once I beat it. I know that is the definition of completing it, but I was disappointed nonetheless. Another problem was the big change in design, such as the elevators and doors. Great game though. Much better than portal 1."

7797,He killed me :) Okay jokes aside this is a really good game
7798,what a good game

7800,Fun Game
7801,best puzzle game i will ever play i just finished the game and im in tears thanks valve for this amazing game and the only bad part about the game is not being able to experience it for the first time ever again.
7802,"While it may be an old game, I would still 100% recommend it to anyone, the story and the ending, and all of the twists that come with it makes it absolutely amazing. I would recommend you buy it ASAP."
7803,"Used console commands to get my portal gun model back cause it broke and it stopped counting my achievements afterwards :(

Also my brain is cracked cause HowLongToBeat said its an 8 1/2 hour game but i did it in 5 :^)"

7807,The cake is a lie
7808,"OK this is awesome but like, portal 3?"
7809,"Original Portal was great, but the second one pushes the game into a whole new level. It has a nice storyline, clever puzzles and introducing new mechanics. I especially love Chapter 6, I still play it every now and then."
7810,I win :)
7811,Awesome sequel and an awesome Portal game.
7812,good.
7813,"One of the best games I have ever played; I love the story, love the game play and puzzles, great workshop support and co-op play holds up well even over 10 years later and for $10 its a must"
7814,Glados best girl
7815,Wheat thins was very funny
7816,some levels require being smart in multiplayer. good to play and nice optimization

Well Here We are Again.... It's Always Such A Pleasure...

Me After Beating It:
Goodbye My Only Friend... Oh. Did You Think I Meant You?
That Would Be Funny. If It Weren't So Sad,..

Great Game. Would Definitely Play Again (actually about to do that XD)

but BEFORE YOU BUY! 
just remember one thing...

7851,The story is a masterpiece in my opinion. Fun gameplay to tag along with it. Thinking with portals.
7852,"I have this game on my ps3 and I used to play it all the time with my friends on co-op. But one of my favorite things about this game is the story, And honestly going through it again was just amazing. Although it may not be the longest game it's definitely one of my favorite."
7853,oovojaver
7854,This is how you do a sequel. Such an amazing game. Do I need to say anything else when everyone talked to death about what makes this game so good.
7855,I love it
7856,great game
7857,If you're studying atmosphere and dry humor (or just enjoy those things) this game is a master class.
7858,portal are of the in the yes

very good game would recommend for begginers and as a first video game

7865,AAAAHHHHH SHOOT PORTAL PORTAL IS GOOD
7866,good
7867,"Good game honestly, It's been such a long time since I've played and man has this brought me back nostalgia"
7868,"I mean... It's Portal. I'ts fun but this review probably is not useful since Valve made it. And Valve makes great games.
"
7869,An excellent follow up to Portal. More fun physics puzzles and comedy while introducing new concepts and challenges.
7870,"This game is awesome with friends/brothers or sisters, I don't thinks it's to good by yourself though"
7871,"Jesus, where do I even start? Compared to it's predecessor, Portal 2 is better in every way. It's longer, the puzzles are more puzzling, there are more characters, the characters are funnier, it looks nicer, it sounds nicer, the soundtrack is incredible, and it even has co-op play! Portal 2 is a masterpiece of a game, I would recommend it to anyone. The only other thing to note is PLEASE DEAR GOD PLAY THE FIRST GAME BEFORE THIS. I have met too many people that played Portal 2 but not Portal, play Portal first, it makes the second game so much better, trust me"
7872,"fun game, some puzzles are challenging. admittedly looked for guides in some of them but I.AM.NOT.A.MORON."
7873,Awesome game must play released in 2011 but its one of the best games of all time
7874,teleporteren
7875,"just get it, stop looking at the reviews"
7876,its very fun i already played the 1st one
7877,requires big brain
7878,"A classic the second it rolled out of Valve's pipeline. Still a must-own for any gamer to this day, and I see no reason why it won't remain the Great Expectations of gaming along with Portal forever. Amazing concept, execution, art, atmosphere. I would recommend (and do recommend) this game to just about anyone."
7879,holes
7880,"genuinely one of the best games ever. it terrifies me. i have to play while someone is with me or i'll die. i don't usually cry, ever, but almost every time i've gotten to the end i have bawled my eyes out like a little baby. GLaDOS is one of my favourite characters ever and this is my favourite game in general. but, then again, i don't play too many games. the soundtrack is amazing (i listen to it every day), the story is incredible and the characters are so so great. some of my favourite things about characters are the voices, and the voices in this game are the best. the visual design of everything is so eerie but pleasing. everything about this game is phenomenal, even when i'm 11 years late to it. plus, i love robots!"
7881,very gud game
7882,dwqasdw
7883,I (me) like the game
7884,very good
7885,"The amount of character development in this game versus the first is just insane. The first Portal will always be a classic yes, but this game is almost completely different... This game has so much back story and ""umpff"" that the first one lacked in and really opened up a portal (haha get it?) to this game's universe and shows us more into what Aperture Laboratories is and was. If you are an advent Half-Life lover such as myself, you will find that this game adds more into THAT universe and gives more lore to explore. GLAD0S turned out to be so much more than we thought and I am so thankful that this game gave her more of a ""voice"" and we got to actually get to know her more than just some scary, bad ass super computer that hangs from the ceilings of her chamber."
7886,"yes good story hopefully they come out with a portal 3
"
7887,good
7888,"(Spoilers) Portal 2 is AMAZING! Honestly, I don't think you even need to play Portal to play this game. Same with Half-Life 2. I've never played Half-Life but I have played through all of Half-Life 2 and the episodes. Valve might not keep up their shooter-games (I don't know the actual name for the genre. But I'm talking about Half-Life: Deathmatch, TF2, TF, CS:GO, etc.) but MAN CAN THEY MAKE A GOOD ENDING AND GREAT CHARACTERS! Wow! I'm sad that we had to leave Wheatley in space, but I don't think you're meant to make friends with characters/people who attempt to kill you (excluding GLaDOS) haha."
7889,cave jonson
7890,"it fun

7891,like tf2 but with portals and wheatly
7892,"pp very large good yes

7895,One of my favorite games
7896,haha valve don't save count to 3 haha ​​kill me
7897,"ya worm holes
"
7898,Its good
7899,"Portal 2 is a sequel which manages to be even more cinematic. Surprisingly, it often has some odd level design choices that feel as if some levels were made by amateur modders, but it was all intentional, I assume, which makes this game feel unlike the usual games. I love the music, I love most of the puzzles. Though, Wheatley was annoying as hell and I somewhat disliked the factory levels in which the puzzles were with coloured paint. Still, all in all, it's a great puzzle game.


7/10"
7900,Portal 1 is perfect and Portal 2 is an even better game. Hard to praise it more than that. It's incredibly rewarding and I couldn't help but smile each time I completed a difficult test chamber. Just as good in 2022 as it was when I played it on 360 ages ago.
7901,I highly recommend this game to someone who played the original Portal and wanted more challenging puzzles or for someone who is new to the Portal series. This game  has something for everyone.
7902,Fun
7903,hahaha weatli krab help me

7916,Its a good game its a great story and Both things are super cool because Co-Op is awesome you get 4 portals as in 2 for youre partner and 2 for you and single player is just a story mode but single player is good even when you beat the game there is a clip and the Credits are amazing it made a song i never want to stop.

7992,BEST GAME EVER. I havent played it since 2018 but I am redownloading it now after watching JackSepticeye's playthrough of it because I forgot how amazing this game is. It is quite literally my childhood too. I drew pictures of Wheatly cuz I thought he looked cool when I was like 9 in my summer camp. *take it or leave it I also drew freddy from FNAF if that showed how little of a brain capacity I had.

Recommend this to everyone, especially people that are new to gaming, as this begins the process of teaching players how to problem solve with only the tools that are at hand."

8056,"Theresa may (Glados) is not having a good time in the facility, but then Boris Johnson (Wheatly) takes over and makes things much worse, after suffering from many issues (such as having a party during a pandemic / reactor core meltdown) then the Torys have had enough of his steak and oven chips and launch him into space. finally Theresa bot 9000 (Glados) is back in power and continues to not have a good time while soothing the public with some lovely opera music.

and that's modern British politics/the portal 2 story line."

8058,At the very least test it. Come on just a few levels it'll be fine!
8059,Funny portal go brr
8060,also good
8061,"Well here we are again, it's always such a pleasure.

Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ever. The puzzles are all great with some that really take some thinking to complete. The characters are well written and they're given only the best lines. 

If I were to give this game a score it would be a 10, no flaws nowadays."
8062,"The puzzles are fun and the story is good with some really great characters. The gameplay is more advanced and there are many new features but it still makes sense with the more run down setting following the events of the first game. Also, the part where you go to the bottom of the facility my be my favorite sequence in any video game I have played."
8063,"Just completed the single player story. Bit sad, incredibly awesome. Valve, make another one.... PLEASE"
8064,"Old game, but still insane and highly enjoyable. Really worthy to buy!"
8065,Best game ever!

8073,best
8074,"You should get this game. For science, you monster."
8075,Fun mind bending puzzle game where you get to negotiate with a potato.
8076,"This is genuinely the only game that I would say is ""Perfect"".

There are absolutely 0 flaws with it, no matter how hard I tried to break it, it stayed sturdy.

The story-mode is a masterpiece, and proves that video games are an art-form. Every single line was incredible, the twist villain actually felt shocking. Cara Mia Addio made me sob like a baby. Cave Johnson is Cave Johnson. Ohhhh, but the best part. It's definitely GlaDOs. She makes this game have so much charm.

Not to mention the puzzles! OH, THEY'RE GREAT!

Overall, Portal 2 is a 10/10, and is my 2nd favorite game of all time."
8077,"If you liked the first one, this one is better in every aspect."
8078,GLADOS IS SO MEAN TO ME
8079,yes
8080,really good game
8081,An incredible game
8082,"One of the best sequels that I've experienced.

Yes the mechanics are almost the same, plus a few things here and there. But the story. You should play Portal 1 (the first installment) and then come back to this one. Just for the story and the mystery surrounding it I ABSOLUTELY recommend playing them both.

MUST play if you played the original one."
8083,Remember when valve made good games?
8084,good game
8085,One of my most Favorites Games by far
8086,Very fun game with an amazing story 100% recommend

8088,"A massive step up from Portal. Just about everything I disliked about the og Portal is fixed in this game and then even more. Dialogue in this game is incredibly funny and always kept me entertained. Once again, portal mechanic is unique, and more refined in this game. Twist is less predictable and final fight is much more fun. The gel mechanics are fun as well. My gripes for this game is that it's a bit too hard in my opinion. I've never really been amazing at puzzle games but I was turning to a walkthrough for much of this game, especially in chapters 6-8 (making them kinda slow for me), which is a problem og Portal didn't really have, at least to this degree. I also wish it had a happy ending. Even if it made more naritive sense for it to be unhappy, I wish it was happy after the connections between GLaDOS and Chell. One extra thing is that the ending song is really fun and inanely catchy, i've had it stuck in my head for 3 days since I beat the game. Overall the game is a blast and would highly recommend, even if you haven't played Portal. 9/10 Really wish VALVe still made games, they put out some bangers in their time.

Edit: After coming back to the game, I realize there is so much more to it than that. The modding capabilities make it replayable to no end. With some mods, such as Portal RELOADED (which I am currently playing) its like getting a Portal 3 and is an amazing experience. Bumping my score up to 10/10"
8089,Amazing Puzzle game with a deep and hilarious story. It's even better when you've first play Portal 1. The mechanics are so good and fluid. Portal 3 when ?
8090,Its good Try It
8091,Fun.
8092,Portal 2 is a well put together game that good level design. at time there are hard to find spot and overly precise spot but this only happen one's or twice.
8093,so i hadnt made a review for portal 2 yet but since its the anniversary i Have to. Guys. THIS GAME IS SO GOOD. LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE. the characters are so good and the story is amazing and OUUFGUHUHGAUHGUAH . PLAY IT
8094, glados kille d me twice :(

8096,Great game. Even greater with friends! :)
8097,DUDE THIS AND PORTAL ONE WHERE THE FIRST GAMES I GOT I CANT BELIVE THAT I DIDNT REVIEW IT SOONER anyway is very good gaem u shuold buye
8098,"This is REALLY fun, 10/10 would recommend to anyone who likes games, just in general."
8099,"yeah, this happened to me once"
8100,lemons
8101,"good game, and puzzle solving"
8102,"Yep, you read how long I have played it- 1000+ hours. It goes without saying that this is truly the best puzzle game to ever exist. It is already 11 years old but it is just as fun as the day it was released. I lived the original Portal game- but somehow they managed to make it even better. The only other puzzle game that really comes even close to Portal 2 is Antichamber. Although Antichamber requires more outside of the box thinking, it has almost no story and has over simplistic graphics. However in Portal 2, the story is the best I have seen in a video game in a long time and the developers made the game have amazing graphics- not to mention it can can run on almost any computer. But really, what I like about Portal 2 the most, is the ability to create your own tests and share it with the community. All in all, to sum it up- amazing story line, amazing graphics, good puzzles, and allows creativity from the community. 100% recommend. If you haven't tried it yet, try it now. It is worth the full price."
8103,great game
8104,game me like it good
8105,just buy it
8106,Better than the original

8121,Genius! Hahaha Who knew AI would be that hilarious.
8122,best game i've ever played
8123,there is no describable feeling for the pang of sadness I get whenever I replay a Valve game knowing they will never put their all into a game ever again. Alyx is nice but the earlier half-life games and portal were something special.
8124,portal
8125,good game
8126,fun
8127,"Played this in 2011+2012, forgot to write a review. Well, it's easily recommended since it's one of the best games ever made. I suggest anyone to give it a go, unless you absolutely loathe puzzle games. 

Great voice acting, great writing, great humour, great level design, great mechanics, great puzzles. Around 8-20 hrs for Single player, depending on your solving skills and whether you go for all the achievements or not. On top of that, a very compelling Co-op mode with super fun 2-player challenges. 

It goes on sale regularly, so definitely check out for that. The game still holds up great a decade+ later."

8143,One of my favorite games of all time!
8144,"Its a Absolutly Phenomenal game, great gameplay, great story and excellent humour! It can be more than just recommended, likely a must too because its way beyond great and prefect execution. But its also recommended to play first Portal 1 then 2 since in Portal 2 the difficulty gets raised pretty early and Portal 1 is very good to get used to the Portal gun and the first mechanics, get deeper into the story and of course learn from it!"
8145,"for a game that has been in my life for almost 10 years and that i've replayed almost yearly, i never get over the part where he kills you"
8146,I LOVE THIS GAME IF OYU LIKE PUZZLE GAMES GET THIS GAME BUT PLAY PORTAL 1 FIRST BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING STORY

8172,"Ah Portal 2. As if the first game wasn't enough they made a sequel and somehow improved! I've had a blast playing this and the coop. I even dabbled in the custom map making, though I was severely limited by my creativity (or lack thereof). It's an amazing game even to this day and is a must play for anyone who can spare the £7.19 required to play this masterpiece of creation."
8173,it's just a lovely puzzle game and with a very interesting plot that you get invested in quickly. It's especially fun in multiplayer!

"
8184,yes
8185,"Portal 2 is an amazing and fun puzzle game with a great story and allot of repeatability. With the addition of steam workshop being compatible with this game, playing others levels make the game more fun with more things to do as well as the modding community is great at adding more to this game. the test chamber creator is also a really nice addition to the already wonderful game giving you access to relax and also challenge your friends or foes to see who can make the hardest chamber or just relax and make whatever comes to your mind!"

8240,grate for big youtubers
8241,Lots of fun! some of the puzzles can be hard but you get the hang of it on your 2nd run.
8242,A masterpiece.
8243,gud game
8244,portal
8245,"I am deeply disappointed with Portal 2. To the point that I feel almost ""painful"" playing it, it feels a bore to me, and I'm hoping it will end soon (could I stop playing? Yes I could. But I like finishing stuff - I'm OCD that way ;-).

In a few words, I find Portal 2 boring, extremely linear and soulless.
Level after level, test chamber after test chamber, there's only one way to go, one solution to the puzzles, and nothing to discover or stumble upon (save for some minor Easter eggs). It's like a giant ""connect the dots"" game: the dots are neatly drawn, you only have to connect them.
Yes, some puzzles are hard (to me, at least), but I cannot see creativity there because once you found THE solution, it's the only one possible. There's no point in experimenting, or looking for alternate ways.
In one word, it feels like a drag (though I admit it gets a little better and a bit more creative with the gels).

Lastly, I loved GlaDOS mean personality in Portal 1. While here I find Cave's comments funny and quirky, they're way less entertaining and unique than GlaDOS one-liners in Portal 1.

I see I'm in the minority, and it's fine. It's all subjective.
But Valve, oh Valve... what have you become?"
8246,"It's just wonderful. The kind of game that everyone should play and an experience that should be general knowledge.

The game is filled with new exciting levels and has a really fun co-op mode for when you finish the game and still want more.
One of the best parts about it is how they expand the lore through gameplay but without revealing too much, keeping that mysterious, isolated/secluded and almost creepy atmosphere that source games have.

If you don't have it yet, buy it. It's a must have.
It's so must-have that you should tell everyone you know to get it.
Trust me."
8247,"Honestly, Portal is a classic, I love this game sm, teleporting with portals is such a fun mechanic and its really unique! 
one of my all time favs
10 / 10"

8279,10/10

8281,it very gud
8282,"(2022 Review) Portal 2 was groundbreaking when it released in 2011 for its unique storytelling and gameplay. Now, 11 years later, it still holds up just as well. It hasn't aged perfectly -- there's LOTS of loading and plenty of less than HD textures -- but it's actually quite difficult to find any real flaws here. The game still looks great, the story and atmosphere remain compelling, and the gameplay is still unique and fantastic.

If you somehow haven't played Portal 2 by now, then you owe it to yourself to pick it up."
8283,fan for the smart
8284,I made a door without having to tear down a wall. 10/10
8285,poral
8286,Played with my friend we did struggle a bit even tho my friend is super smart computer scientist. So quite a challenge we did get stuck on this one particular level and then I thought of the solution before i fell asleep i am so smart. I do recommend! Nice challenge the weird voice that talks to you is a bit rude though should be nicer. Challenging but the ending was a bit flat would be super cool if there was more of a story line and ending in there but still fun requires thinking. Got it on sale for legit 2 dollars australian rlly good.
8287,"portals

the physics are great honestly. heres one bug for fun: place a portal on a slanted plate, and then one on the floor. look at that other portal. you can see yourself going through it.
and i mean outside the portals.
hard to explain unless you do it yourself."

8301,"[spoiler] No cake to be found (at least that I could find). :( [/spoiler] Valve, give us more Cave Johnson. Please. Just make Portal 3 a Cave Johnson game. Anyways, better than than the first in every way. 10/10. Would play again."
8302,Puzzles. nice gameplay. simply amazing game idea. if you say that this game is bad.. i don't know just play it
8303,THIS GAME IS AWESOME EVERYTHING WORKS THERES NO LAG AND ITS MULTIPLAYER. It is hard but really fun.

It is such a beautifully designed game in every aspect, from the level and character design to the music. Absolutely phenomenal! This is definitely a must play game if you've never tried it, 10/10 game! Thank you Valve!"

Part 1.

I was so close to feeling the imposters sweet ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ out of me 🤤 but then my NAZI RACIST mother came in and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. 😔😒🙁☹️

8404,"10/10, best game I have ever bought and got it for around $4 as a deal with portal 1 on a steam sale, best game buy ever, wish I could start the story all over again."
8405,good
8406,"This is my favorite puzzle game, and it's something I play quite often! I think it lives up to the original Portal extremely well. The story is fun, and we have to admit, GlaDOS had got some good singing. The testing is just as fun, even if the cake WAS a lie, and I've learned many valuable lessons:
1. Dancing is NOT science
2. That I'm a horrible person
3. That my fashion sense if frowned upon by someone with a medical degree. In fashion! From France!
4. Rockets are the way to go."
8407,wish there were more softlocks so I had a good reason for my leprosy but overall its a good game

8423,Very good for all players who would love it!
8424,"Rebeating this game for the third time. Maybe the best game I've ever played (at least in the single player topic). The jokes are perfect, so is the ambience. Level design is really really good (except in the old labs part), and the lore is amazing, specially considering the backstory. I wish there were an sequel to this"
8425,portal go wall. go through wall. die. good gaming
8426,good
8427,portal3
8428,"I think these reviews say everything you need to know about this game :3

The story is amazing,
Characters are amazing,
Music is amazing,
Art style is amazing,
Puzzles are amazing,
THE L O R E ! is amazing!

This sequel to OG portal is just A M A Z I N G! Some aspects of this game also makes me hope that Valve do a full on horror oriented game too rofl.

Also the voice actors for the characters was brilliant lmfao, I couldn't get ""He's a menace"" Out my head while playing or the big bang theory O.O very P o G"
8429,Its very fun. It's a great puzzle game and really makes your brain think. It's a lot longer than the first one named portal which is also very good. They both have amazing stories and after playing the first one they took the same mechanics and improved them even more in the second one. Also when they introduced new things in the game they weren't overwhelming and they are introduced very well.
8430,is fun
8431,cool very good poggers sussy amongus poopy diahriah
8432,"Great graphics till this day, very fun, a pure classic. It isn't good for those who get motion sick, like me. I can 
get motion sick in under 15 minutes of playing."
8433,Superb
8434,"I definitely liked this game more than the first one. The story and world/level design is a lot better in my opinion. Still angry that there is no Portal 3 but there are a lot of spin off and community made games so I guess its ok. I want to play the multiplayer story but have no one to play with :(

Also, I've beaten the game so I get to brag about how smart I am"
8435,"its made well

8436,make sure to play with someone with more than 1 brain cell

8453,"Even after nearly 10 years, Portal 2 brought me the shock still has not diminished. Whether you play it solo or multiplayer, it exercises your ability to think. I think the best thing is the design of Portal itself and the writers of the creative workshop who work diligently to update it. This gives Portal 2 immortality and vitality."

8467,"Portal was great but Portal 2 is ten times better than the first one. Master work level design, atmosphere, musics, graphics (for a 11 yo game still looks pretty amazing), best characters like the robot who tried to kill us in first game, dumb and funny robot guy [spoiler](who tried to kill us later)[/spoiler] and more makes this game masterpiece. [spoiler](I always knew that little bitch Wheatley gonna trick me.)[/spoiler]

And don't think that's all. Co-op mode is as good as single player mode. Adds new mechanics and levels designed for 2 players.

I hope valve returns making games again like this masterpiece

5/5"

8479,"This is a lovely little classic. The puzzles are challenging but fair (until the finale, which is timed, irritatingly). The plot is light but witty, and Stephen Merchant is excellent. The pacing is a little off relative to the first game, with it out-staying its welcome very slightly towards the end. But overall this is excellent and well worth your money if you enjoy puzzle games."
8480,portal 1 and 2 are grate games and i recommend playing them both i love the humor and the puzzle and if you are thinking about getting the game i strongly recommend it

8489,Still no cake :(
8490,"If you want to play one of the best puzzle game with evergreen graphics portal and portal 2 are the way to go. It has all the things that a portal sequel could have dark humour, shaming, amazing puzzles, longer play-through and most importantly GlaDos. I wish that valve makes a proper Portal 3 not any reference game like Aperture Desk Job. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a cool game."

8526,"So I played through this game when I was younger. I got it on my XBox 360 and I just remember how cool it was that you had to work through the game and it wasn't just shooting all the time. Now that I've got it on Steam and can play it myself, there are so many things that I missed when I was a smol child. The story, the progression of time as you work your way back up, the environments, the voice acting, the ambient sounds and music. Everything is just perfect in this game. I even would go as far to say that the graphics are beautiful, albeit a bit outdated. If you haven't played this game and are thinking about getting it, then just get it. If you're on the fence, take this as a sign to just buy it. It is more than worth your money and it is more than worth your time. Plus, you can play with friends which is nice."

Also includes easy access to awesome custom levels made by the community.
Haven't played the co-op though.

8657,"Improved from the first game in every way: puzzles expanded on, story has way more depth and the game was longer while still feeling the right length. Overall a really good game that challenges your thinking. Co-op is fun and provides some nice extra plot."

8679,This game is really addictive
8680,"the turret level sucks. good game except for that
"
8681,"I've finally had chance to play and finish the famous Portal 2, they improved the game so much if we compare it to the previous one.  All the visuals and sound design was better. They clearly added a lot more levels in single player, it was quite long to finish. Also I want to say that level design is very clever and creative. They also added new mechanics to the game which made it more unique in my opinion. The fact that they added multiplayer mode and allowed community to create their own maps is also a plus. As for the story, it wasn't that amazing for me to be honest, but the other aspects of the game were very well done."
8682,great game but very puzzling
8683,gg
8684,The best game i ever played
8685,its a great game if you like puzzles and using your brain and the long gameplay
8686,good story and nice chamber editor

8719,"Don't know what else I should add in the reviews that hasn't been said.

At times, challenging and frustrating but it's a game you can play at your pace so you don't feel rushed.

The dialogue is great even though your character doesn't talk.

The map and puzzle design is great. Doesn't loose it's charm throughout the game.

Haven't played the co-op unfortunately but someday would love to.

A fantastic sequel of the first Portal game which is also great"

8734,"I was a latecomer to this series. I played through the first Portal in 2021, and immediately afterward I played this sequel. Portal 2 was a neat followup. Interestingly, I had seen the ending before elsewhere online, but I had forgotten about it so it still took me by surprise. This game definitely felt more rich in story and felt more anchored in reality. I played this series with a controller, but I'd like to replay a second time with a mouse and keyboard since getting into FPS games. Portal was my gateway to this type of first-person game genre."

8748,A classic for a reason. And I do like its sense of humour.
8749,Portal 2 is a 3D puzzle platformer where you play as Chell a test subject who is trapped in aperture labs. The goal is to beat Glados and Wheatley or in the multiplayer finish all the tests. Obviously you have a portal gun which is the main mechanic of the game. There is a lot of community made levels so if you get bored of the main campaign you can get portal reloaded. In conclusion go buy portal 2 (:
8750,none of the portals took me to skeld from amogus
8751,Life was good at Aperture Science.
8752,Portal is fun!

8789,yes
8790,"This game is amazing, it came out in 2011, and you can mistaken it for a game that recently came out.

The story line is crazy, you truly need to play the first one to fully get the full experience, but starting with the second one without playing the first you can still jump in and not feel lost in the story.

Everything is a 10, it truly tugs at your emotions and gets you fully engaged in the narrative story and puzzles that can easily frustrate you, I played through the whole game in 3 sittings and laughed throughout it. Mainly because the comedy is amazing. especially with Wheatley, yes I love the character so much that I used his name and core as my profile picture. This is mainly because Wheatley is one of the funniest NPCs that I've ever seen. This is mainly because Wheatley was voiced by a great actor and comedian, also known as Stephen Merchant. You may not know him by his name but can easily figure out who he is just by his impressionable voice, that truly brought out Wheatley's character attitude and emotion. His also known for playing Caliban from Logan (That one Albino mutant that you can't really put your finger on what his mutant abilities are.) or the Tooth Fairy without wings on (You Can't Handle The Tooth) staring the Rock.

I know this has been mainly about this amazing character but the game would truly be incomplete without the introduction of Wheatley, it would've been one of those puzzle games that you just slowly play and get burnt out of.

Truly great single player game, not even gonna touch on the Cooperative Play because that's just going to be another long ass paragraph of information because lets all be honest if you played it, we laughed and were mad at our friends well playing it... most notably crushing your ""friend"" with big red buttons and a moving ant farm thing.

That's all I can remember from playing it almost 6 years ago, but it still to this day has an impression on my gaming hobby, because it was truly a great game, and can't be compared to anything else. Don't even get me started on the mods. The community is fantastic and is still tell this day working on new stories you can enjoy with the same concept as the original games.

With that being all this game is an unforgettable experience that is a must play if you have anything that can play it. Which can be played anything practically cause of it's old engine that can be ran on your Tesla you always talking about it bitch, like I know you're slowly saving the planet, just shut up already. or your Samsung Fridge. Okay shut up we know you're rich."

It's understandably because it's a very graphic heavy game and I am planning on getting a new gaming computer in the near future. Until then... all in all, definitely a yes because it is too fun to resist not playing it more than once. A feel of nostalgia."

The story line was also amazing, though some of the parts were a little tricky, but that's what made it so fun,as well as the time it took to complete it, since I, personally, hate short games."

Gameplay is super fun, amazing character development, fun and a bit deep lore, etc i would definitely recommend playing it!!! also very good game for very affordable price!

I would not play for over 300 hours if it was bad."

8905,Absolutely garbage of a game. I buy it expecting some portal 1 action but no? the game is completely changed! And what is this challenge mode? does anybody even play this? whats the point of playing a game if you are going to try and finish it as fast as possible? and better yet compete with others.

Even more amazing story then Portal 1, experienced no bugs so far (I say ""So far"" because i have not beaten Portal 2 yet, I'm on chapter 6: The Fall), I would 100% pay full price for this (£7.19 is a bargain for the amount of content you get!), I got this as a bundle with Portal 1 for £10.49. Great game (P.S., I do enjoy eating....Wheat bread)."

8931,duh
8932,its fun
8933,"At first I thought Portal 1 was better but man was I so wrong. After playing this masterpiece again, I can offically say that Portal 2 is way better than Portal 1. Not to say Portal 1 was bad but Portal 2 is an amazing game with challenging puzzles and with an amazing story. Honestly this game is definitely a charming game and worth every penny"

8946,"Amazing, I loved this part more than the first. More in depth plot and longer chapters in both single player n co-op. I recommend it if you enjoy playing puzzle games and like the aesthetic/vibes of sci-fi futuristic evil labs and fonni robots"

8988,"Valve has done a great job making the sequel to a short puzzle game. The graphics are great for a game that's mostly considered old by now. The humor is one of the best parts of the game. Every character has amazing personality. Even the panels that are used to build the chambers have personality. In several chambers they can be seen acting almost frustrated or proud. When Wheatley is affected by GLaDOS's body, the panels look like they become angry, even though the only thing that changes is the color of their lights.

Overall great game. I have played it several times all the way through."

8990,"From the little amount I played, it was amazing. One problem though. The audio kept repeating itself at random periods, and it simply ruined the experience for me."
8991,It's Portal.... It's the Source Engine.... It's in the Half Life universe.... Have you busted yet? I need a cig...
8992,portal 3 when?

9001,"Builds up a lot on the first game. Visually it looks amazing, the story is much more immersive and there's even more secrets to find. The coop campaign is also pretty fun to do with a friend and troll each other. And the community maps can be really creative and fun."
9002,"Just a classic of a puzzle game, still looks good for a game that came out in 2001."

9014,Just like Portal was a game Portal 2 is also a game.
9015,Game has the perfect amount of story and gameplay . I still personally like the first game better (because i like more story) but the game is still amazing. the sci fi ruined theme gives it more detail than the first game but if you wanna get this game PLAY PORTAL 1 FIRST
9016,Portal 2
9017,Amazing game
9018,co-op is sooooo funky
9019,Absolute Chad of a game
9020,Great story and gameplay. You know its good when you want a portal 3
9021,"Easily 10/10
One of the best video games I have ever played!
The depth this game can get in COOP on custom maps is just incredible.
Single Player is pretty good, but if you have a friend that is willing to play it with you, go and get it and play top rated custom maps, you might have the time of your life."
9022,"Is this not the best game ever?
The characters are great, the puzzles are great, level progression is seamless. The changing design styles to reflect the different decades as you progress through the 'old' chambers is fantastic.
My sole complaint is that there will never be a Portal 3."
9023,I like the style compared to portal 1 and the story is a lot better
9024,good game
9025,Good plot and CO-OP mode is so awesome.

9032,one of the best games ever made
9033,"The game is amazing, without a doubt one of my favourite game series of all time. It's been made so well for 2007/2011 and there's so many tiny features that, while they play such an insignificant role in it, make it so much better. There's also hidden rooms (like in the first one), Easter eggs, cool little secrets hidden variously within the map I've found and it's all together so cool and it's longer than the first one. I strongly recommend both portal and portal 2."
9034,Portals. Nothing Else Just Portals.
9035,cool portal physics
9036,best game of all time imo
9037,yes
9038,Can't really get any better than that. Or... can it?

9043,amazing puzzles
9044,"Although it's 11 years old now, it's still pretty mind-blowing when you use the portals and you could see yourself."
9045,"This is TOTALLY AWESOME for a $10 game it's worth it, I tell you."
9046,"Great puzzles and gameplay. My only gripe is that they removed controller support from the game and it relies solely on Steam controller settings, which are difficult to change. You can't change your controller to inverted or change look sensitivity without completely reformatting a Steam controller setting. This is honestly one of the stupidest moves any game could make. Like, you had controller support for the game back in 2015, but then the developers decided to get rid of controller support!?! Seriously WTF!!!"

9058,I've played this so many times I've basically memorized the entire game
9059,yes
9060,"I got to play this game for the first time a few weeks ago, and let me tell you, it was one of my favorite game experiences I have ever had. It is such a huge step up from the first Portal it's insane. The visuals still hold up 11 years later, and the gameplay and story are timeless. The writing is fantastic, has amazing humor but also knows when to take itself seriously. Of course the world building and subtle game design are top-notch. As a chemist I even found something in one of the areas that I haven't seen anyone talk about! It's the little things like that that make this game amazing. I beat the game over two days while streaming it on discord to some friends. The amount of times one of the people (a Portal 2 veteran) was facepalming at my stupidity as I struggled with some of the puzzles was hilarious. I would recommend you play the first Portal if you haven't already before this game, but even if you don't you will still have a fantastic time. 

TLDR: 11/10 amazing game. Would play for the first time all over again if I could."

Honestly the best game of 2011, maybe every to be honest.If you haven't played it I highly recommend you player it, make sure you play portal 1, however if you dont want to play them both, go watch p1 on yt, but the story had me in fucking tears that shit so good it beats lean, the speed runs to mwa. the community is so good (Only cuz you cant make r34 of any of the characters dont look it up) the people yourl meet you whole mind will change forever, add me and ill buy you the game its the fucking good"
9069,10/10 would recommend
9070,"There is debate if video games can be considered art. This game proves in my mind that, yes- they can. 

Portal 2 (and the portal series) revolutionized gaming, with captivating puzzles, excellent story and world building, that make you ask, and simultaneously answer so many questions. This game has such charm and perfect humor, and it is balanced with the bleak pessimistic world and history you discover at aperture science. 
I assure you its worth so much more than the twelve~ dollars you will spend on it. 

This game really takes the *cake* ;)"
9071,"Worthy successor to the venerable Portal.  Excellent puzzles that will open your brain to new ways of thinking.  Funny, too!"
9072,"This game serise it he best i have ever played it is amzing how much valve packed into a $10 game and i love it, the puzzles are great and make me think no just with portals but with a least 4 of them and the new gels and the lore drops are great i love it no lets just valve can count to 3 and if valve is reading this here is how to do it 

1 2 3"
9073,"Portal 2 is the sequel to the simply titled Portal. this game was better than the original Portal in every single way you can think of. The characters, plot, puzzles, mechanics, Voice acting, boss fights, and the Co-op mode managing to make a game like Portal into a 2 player game was amazing and was the best co-op at the time of it's release"
9074,gados is sexy
9075,"All right, I've been thinking, when Steam gives you Steam Reviews, don't make a good review! Make Steam take the Steam Reviews back! Get mad! I don't want your damn Steam Reviews! What am I supposed to do with these!?.  Demand to see Steam's manager! Make Steam rue the day it thought it could give me Steam Reviews! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down- with the Steam Reviews! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible Steam Review that burns your house down!"

Do you like puzzles that aren't just ""solve this riddle"" and are actually fun, unique, and require critical thinking? Do you like a sci-fi environments with immense attention to detail to world-building, backed by a rich and gripping story? And do you like some actually fantastic voice-acting with comedic bits that have you rolling your eyes in amusement?

9142,"(No spoilers) This is the best game I've ever played. The gameplay, the storyline, and the overall feel of the game is so nice. I'm so glad that they made a second one on account that the first Portal was made with a small group of people. I 100% recommend this game,  and the Co-op mode (from what I've played) is really fun! Just hop on with a friend and play a game! And one of my favorite parts; you can make your own levels, and post them to the workshop! I hope you get Portal and Portal 2, they are fabulous!"

9193,"Do you like to chase yourself through never ending portals in hopes of finally grabbing your own ass? Then Portal can sort of help you with that. Portal 2 is back at it again with those white vans, where you find yourself stuck in an never ending matrix of puzzles and traps. Trying your best not to get killed for simply finding your way out of one trap, only to end up in another. Sadly there was no cake in this lovely rendition, but there are familiar faces and enemies waiting to make you feel right back at home at Aperture Science. After beating the game the only question you have is if Portal 3 might be somewhere close by, Jammed in a storage trunk with Gabe Newell sitting on top waiting for the right moment to unleash it's awe and wonder upon us all."

9204,"I played the co-op and the single player and while I'm many many years late to the party it was great. The dialogue was entertaining, the levels were interesting, and the character interaction was delightful."

9206,"fun

9207,GOAT puzzle game with awesome story 10/10 would recommend.
9208,good
9209,"Quite literally some of the funniest dialogue and character lines I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a video game.  JK Simmons and Stephen Merchant as new characters and shine alongside Ellen McClain as GLaDOS.  

It's a fun game, too, but the best part is the characters and their story, without a doubt."

9233,"Portal 2 is an excellent puzzle game. The game is well-designed to teach you the unique elements that make up the puzzles, and to stretch your skills as the game goes on. Also, the humor of the characters of GlaDos, Wheatley, and Cave Johnson is enjoyable, intelligent, and well written."
9234,I have no idea
9235,yes
9236,"Now the first portal was good and all, but this is amazing. The puzzles are even more fun and satisfying than the first game, characters like wheatley, cave johnson (glados in this game as well), are great, and the environments (especially area of aperture underground where wheatley sends you) look great. The wheatley boss is also really fun. I regret not playing this game sooner."

9302,"[i]This is only a review of the single-player campaign[/i]

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]
It's Portal.

Most of the game is spent teaching the player new mechanics thru tutorial test-chambers. It's only towards the end of the game that Valve got ballsy enough to throw in puzzles that would actually have u tearing up yawning. The Mechanics themselves are numerous and well-thought-out; they also interact nicely with the game's systems and environments. There's considerable variety here, tho rarely matched in its depth.

The focus is decidedly looser with this game, as compared to the first, and u can expect to spend large portions simply portal-ing thru (admittedly gorgeous) environments. For better or worse, this is a narrative experience with puzzle elements thrown in there for a change. Although Portal (1) wasn't particularly challenging either, it wasn't as long either. 

Also covering entire test spheres in [spoiler][b]COOM[/b][/spoiler] is oddly satisfying fun. 

[h1]The World[/h1]
Portal 2 puts in considerable effort (and takes a considerable amount of time) to flesh out its world, and to great success, I believe. Starting Ch. 6, the game introduces the history of the ever-expansive facility. A super-structure so incomprehensibly large that it escapes human cognizance and stretches on presumably (or effectively at least) to infinity, requiring a super-intelligent AI to maintain the place. A place that exists and grows for its own reasons inexplicable to any human. 

And the game deliberates on this a great ordeal, having the player walk through office spaces (contemplating wut working at a place where u don't even know how many people work would be like, seeing unfamiliar faces every day, etc.), sections of the facility stretching endlessly (seemingly, thru the use of skyboxes, etc.) busy in their own toil, abandoned sections (simply built on top of and forgotten), and the like.

The world also helps chuck a decent serving of absolute isolation at u (for all the player knows they're the only ones alive on earth and the surface is as dead as Aperture), and all in all, invokes a very distinct surreal feeling that me likey. I also love how the [spoiler]ending cinematic dumps u in front of a field stretching to the horizon with no definitive answer as to whether human civilization is alive, or how far underneath the ostensibly innocuous field the facility extends[/spoiler].

However, by the end of the game, and the end of Ch.7 ([spoiler] for the 1970s Aperture[/spoiler]), it walks back a little on these concepts with little else to show for it. Ultimately tho, it is a very contemplative experience, and the world certainly allows for the game to be not more than a walking simulator with portals and narration for a good bit of the mid-game.

[h1]The Story[/h1]
Which brings us to the story, and the potentially decent story is, imho, ruined by the ending that throws the baby out with the bathwater, all for a gag or something. 

Once again for better or worse, the charm of the game really lies less in the story itself, and more so the characters. And the characters do not disappoint. Most of our interaction is once again thru narration and banter, and Portal 2 threads the line between having enough of the iconic characters being funny, and too much talking becoming annoying, near perfectly.

And although I felt a slight but noticeable late-mid game lull, I think the lesson here is that the real Story was the Portals we placed along the way :)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
In 2022, I would hesitate to call this game a masterpiece; It certainly has issues, issues that hold it back from becoming one (imho). But, considering we were supposed to have a sequel by now, and considering this decade-old game still at least contends with some of the best of today, I can't help but cut it some slack. 

I would say Portal 2 is worth the price of admission to the community-made maps (the good ones, look online) and mods (like Portal Stories: Mel, Portal Reloaded, and apparently still more on the way) alone. But u're getting a very good single-player experience (that should last u somewhere around 7 hrs, it took me 12 cus I make Wheatley look like a genius) on top of that, and u're getting a co-op experience on top of that. So, an easy recommendation at its base price (and ur time), and it regularly goes on sale for a buck or 2, so don't disrespect it."
9303,Best puzzle game ever
9304,Good game

10/10 for me. Amazing experience."
9327,"I mean it's alright, prolly not as good as those portal games I've heard about"

9344,"This is the best game on the market and it will probably stay that way forever. It is a masterpiece in every way and a video game classic that you have to play at least once. I love this game, the humor is amazing, the puzzles are rewarding and the way that the physics of the game work makes this super satisfying to play and figure out. The game is full of achievements and Easter eggs that make replaying Portal 2 a couple of months after your first play through super fun.  Absolutely amazing game"

9403,it's literally portal 2
9404,"Portal 2 is probably one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.

Pros:

Excellent Graphics and Gameplay
Mindbending puzzles that deep fried my mind, but it was worth it getting deep fried.
The game is long and keeps you entertained even until the end
More puzzles then the original Portal 1

Cons:
My computer almost died in the process of trying to load the .exe file
Some of the characters occasionally use words such as ""Damn"", but no words such as ""f***"" or ""s***"" or anything too harsh.
Requires a mid-end or high end PC.


All in all, this was a great game. Would highly recommend."
9405,ooga booga this game dumb

*yes i know i spelled it wrong"
9407,it challenging
9408,"Not only my favourite valve game, probably my favourite puzzle game too. The graphics were wonderful, the plot was interesting, and most importantly the puzzles were mind-bendingly fun. If you haven't yet, do yourself a favour and buy this game."
9409,"Well, here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
To kill me twice?
Oh, how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here, too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
If it weren't so sad
Well, you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone

9412,best game of all time
9413,fun
9414,This game is a pinnacle of how great Valve can be as a story telling developer..  Portal is one of the greatest games I've ever played.
9415,"When I played Portal 1, I felt like the game was just beginning and then I beat the final boss and got credits. I always disliked how short it felt. Not here. Portal 2 has proper pacing, an interesting, yet unintrusive storyline and good new puzzles and gimmicks that don't overstay their welcome."
9416,One of the best games i've ever played
9417,"As to expect from valve at this point, a great game with plenty of hidden secrets and fun content you forget about the actual game itself, even though it's great on it's own as well, recommend this to both lovers of puzzle games and haters of James Corden because you can do, what you always wanted to do to him in this game"
9418,very good you portal here and there and sometime the turrets can be cute somehow

"
9437,"good game, not enough portals"
9438,"Portal 2 (along with Portal as well) are among some of the best games of all time. It's astounding how the franchise could take a concept as (seemingly) simple as portals and use it to make some of the most creative puzzles and have it be the main requirement of a franchise with an absolutely great plot, great characters, great dialogue, and great humor. This overall is an awesome game (portal 1 is awesome too). This franchise will always have a special place in my heart.

Better than the Half-Life franchise imo (don't hurt me)

9446,"Like the original Portal, Portal 2 has many puzzles that increase in difficulty as the game progresses.  It adds new elements and a Co-op mode, but maintains the humor that the original set the tone for.  In my opinion, this game is better in many ways than the original- Valve really ""upped their game"". It's just a shame that Valve  gave up creating new games when they launched their popular Steam platform.  I would have loved another Portal game to complete a trilogy."

9468,"Great game, interesting characters with fun voices. Puzzles are engaging, and utilize the mechanics of the game expertly. The puzzles are challenging while not being so difficult as to be unfun. Great sequel to the first game that builds onto existing characters and adds new ones. Dialogue uses humor well, and there are still easter eggs to find involving things you might not do on your first play though that result in dialogue you wouldn't expect or normally hear. Overall excellent game, especially for the price I got it at."
9469,Portal 2 more like portal the sequel.
9470,"Better voice acting
Longer game
Better story
More challenging puzzles
Funnier
Better Character Dynamics
Better environments
Better sound design
More puzzle elements to play with
More mods and community made content
More extra content
All of this it does better that a game that perfected those elements (portal)
*Chef's kiss*"

9535,"If you liked Portal 1, then you will really enjoy Portal 2 even more! The game is fun and challenging to play which is amplified in co-op play. Valve really made a timeless game that has memorable characters (Wheatley has to be one of the best characters ever made in a video game), a great story, great graphics and fun/challenging gameplay... This game is definitely worth your time even in 2022 (11 years after release)!"
9536,fun
9537,The multiplayer is hours of me getting rid of my portal right when my friend needed to use it
9538,good
9539,Portal game cool
9540,"Great fun but gets really confusing sometimes, a must play with a friend"
9541,"This is honestly one of the best games you will ever play. The puzzles are fun and at times, can be challenging. It's a perfect mix of what a valve game should be, both very funny and entertaining to play, but also has a great story that makes people want to play it again, and again. Another thing that lots of people overlook is the soundtrack for the game, adding so so much to the feeling of levels in the game. Even after the story mode, the community workshop has prolonged this game's life span by a significant amount, giving people thousands of different maps to play through. This is a classic must have game and I will continue to play it for years to come."
9542,best game.
9543,Awesome game 10/10

9562,"I first acquired this game in 2013 on the Xbox 360 and this was, and still is, the most immersive, interactive, mind boggling and hilarious game I have ever played to this day. The joy that came with my purchase of this game at a local best buy was well worth the money my dad spent on it. It took me weeks to finish this game on my first attempt. I got stuck at seemingly every level but not the stuck as in not knowing what to do. My adolescence mind was troubled by the difficulty of the puzzle presented in the game so i never got very far. The point where i finally stepped away from this game is chapter 6 ""The Fall"" where i was clueless on how to progress further. I tried many things to fly through the aperture logo but all attempts in vain. No matter the determination I displayed, not once did I fly through the aperture logo. It was on a night after school, I had just gotten home and got on my Xbox 360 and decided not to play Minecraft, and instead play Portal 2. I had finally gotten past the levels before the long cutscene which was very challenging for my younger self. I was like most others, surprised when your part-time companion ""Wheatly"" betrays you and sends you down a dark deep hole that leads to the salt mines. After the dialogue with Caroline and having a brief moment of understanding and bond despite her rude manner, she leaves the moment you meet, by a bird. When i looked around this new and exiting place that i was bashed into, I realized a change in the games pace and a somewhat high spike of difficulty. When I wandered around for a while I found the place where i needed to be, where Cave Johnsons voice echoed around you which game a sort of unease around this new character. Who is this guy? Is what everyone playing this game blind was thinking to themselves. Trying to solve this puzzle was like trying to solve a Rubix cube, I could never get the amount of velocity necessary to fly over to the exit door, then, after 3 days of attempting the same puzzle, I quit, gave up and accepted that this game is too hard for me.

I was browsing the steam sales page when boom! portal 2 was under $2. I recalled the time i had played this game before and I knew that i had to do one thing for sure, I needed to beat this game. after getting my dad to purchase this game once more I prepared myself for the task that i could not finish many years ago, to end a story that should have been ended long ago. I eagerly awaited for the game to download and launched it as soon as the download was complete. I saw the start up screen and noticed how serene and calm I felt, like this game was the answer to a question that i didn't know of. It felt like it filled a hole that was so small and insignificant that it has been ignored for many years. I started a new game and was determined to finish without fail. I remembered most levels and flew through the first half of the game, when I reached the part that gave me the most trouble, what made me quit playing this game back in early 2014, prepared this time to finish I meticulously took note of my surroundings. The white walls, their position and how they can be used. I went to the scaffolding near the roof and placed the portals in the correct places and jumped off, finally finishing that one part I could not all those years back.

Then i finished the game, lol. Was extremely fun! The replayability is insane! 

GET 
THIS
GAME."
9563,"Portal 2 is an amazing game.
1. Low-end PCs can handle this
2. The Soundtrack
3. The part where he kills you
4. You can bond with characters.
5. FRANKENTURRETS"
9564,"Does not work on M1 Macs. As of 3/25/22 there is no update to fix this, rendering the game completely unplayable along with all other Orange Box games. I loved playing it before, but I'm S.O.L. until Valve decides to offer a 64 bit recompile."

Honestly, I would give it an 11. Valve, I BEG of you, make Portal 3 (and it doesn't even have to be Chell or GLaDOS or Wheatley! Make it about Cave Johnson, Caroline, some other test subject like Aperture Tag or Stories: Mel. I don't care.). I'll get a Steam Deck, SteamVR, ANYTHING to play a 3rd game."

9800,I don't care what yall say i STILL want to smash Glados 6 years after playing this.
9801,Portal 2 is an amazing game full of fun puzzles that make you think outside the box with its creative solutions. Portal 2 has lots of interesting  Easter Eggs that further thicken Portal's vast lore. The addition of the lower sector of Apature Science where the first tests and trials of the portal was an amazing addition as it allowed us to see the development of the beloved company and it allowed us to see how our favourite pshycotic murderous AI was created and treated. Overall this game is amazing and even better if you have played the first Portal and the half life series as the lore intertwines

9812,A really great game. It is challenging and I like that it tries not to be repetitive with chapters. It gives you the freedom and creativity to solve and does not spoon-feed you on how it is supposed to be done. At first I had some problems with motion sickness so I tried to lower the mouse sensitivity - but the best solution really is to play this with a controller. It's a real fun game and I enjoyed playing it in 2022.

9873,"this game will never get old for me i love it so much, such an amazing experience :)"
9874,"Overall:

While not as tightly designed as the flawless original, Portal 2 compares surprisingly well, by not reinventing the core gameplay, adding enough ideas of its own to be distinct, and upping the spectacle significantly.

9/10


The good:

Portal 2 retains the basic gameplay mechanics from the original Portal, which are incredibly imaginative, very well tuned, versatile, and surprisingly intuitive. Valve cleverly chose not to mess with the core mechanics, making Portal 2 a very familiar experience, connecting to the original seamlessly. The level design, in classic Valve fashion, has the perfect blend of naturalism and transparency of function, and the attention to detail makes Aperture Science feel like a believable, and very atmospheric setting. Over the course of the game, several new level elements are introduced, and combined in various ways, and they are all pretty interesting and fun, combined with the gameplay mechanics. Another aspect in which Portal 2 excels, is in its voice acting and sound design. From the robotic yet full of character voice of GLaDOS, to the Portal gun's satisfying shots, to the adorable turrets, and the various little sounds that accompany certain level elements (such as the blue and red gels), the soundscape of Portal 2 is very recognizable, and at certain points almost musical. The writing is also great, with jokes of different styles being told by different characters, and great environmental storytelling. Lots more is learned about Aperture Science, its competition with Black Mesa, its founder, as well as GLaDOS's backstory, and there's a lot more to be discovered in background details. As a side note, the game features a co-op campaign, which is said to be very good, although I didn't get to experience it myself. Still, it's a welcome addition to the game's value, as are the user created levels.


The meh:

Portal 2 was doomed from the start to feel bloated compared to its prequel, which was so tightly designed, 
so well paced, and so well written, it felt like a perfect bite sized experience, sold as a part of a bigger package, The Orange Box. Since Portal 2 was developed as a standalone title, its length is roughly 2-3 times longer than the original, with puzzle sections of a few rooms being spaced out by platforming/exploration sections every once in a while. While the latter are not explicitly bad, they are not as interesting as the puzzle rooms, and due to different visual design and scope, they can occasionally be a little obtuse. Granted, platforming/exploration was also a part of the original game during its last stretch, but in that game that sudden shift in level design was much more effective, and it felt subversive. In Portal 2, these sections feel more detrimental to the game's pacing, in order to deliver some exposition and some spectacle.


The bad:

Nothing about the game is particularly bad, it's very polished. My only complaints about it were fairly minor, and could be viewed as positives by others, so they are all in the ""meh"" section."

The game is super short, the singleplayer alone takes around 10 hours on the first playtrough, and the coop like 8 hours, i have a lot of hours since i enjoy speedruning

[h1] replayability [/h1]
The game has a mode for people to create maps which i think is indeed really good

[h1] story [/h1]
The story is indeed amazing.A really good story, [spoiler] glados in the final part coming along, and weathley being the bad guy [/spoiler]

9966,When I first played portal 2 it was only for co-op with my friend. They actually played it and completed it so i didn't know alot about it. When my friend would not be on I would give the story a try. After completing it I felt as if all of my emotions just walked out of my brain. I just sat at the main menu staring at my screen. I then clicked the quit button on the screen. I then went to my bed and stared at the ceiling thinking of the journey i just went through. this is the last time I play Portal 2 now since I will uninstall it for more space on my computer. thank you Portal 2 for this experience.

10023,"Coming back to this game for the first time in years and playing through the single player story, I remember why I love this series so much.

[SPOILERS]  (But honestly this game is old enough for me to not feel too bad about it)

It's the perfect natural continuation of the original Portal story.  It feels genuinely entertaining through and through.  From the get-go I feel as though I'm actually making progress towards an actual goal.  I know where I am, I know who I am, and I have an ally.  After turning GLaDOS back on I don't feel the same lost hopelessness that I did in the first game.  I actually feel as though I'm fighting back at every turn.  And GLaDOS doesn't feel as disconnected as she does in the first game.  She went from the occasional sarcastic quip in Portal to a lively and vengeful persona.

After the core swap I truly get a sense of the shear scale of the Aperture Science facility.  This game is the perfect example of giving me lore and world building within a game without drawing me away from the action or story of the game.  J. K. Simmons was absolutely the right choice for voicing Cave Johnson.

After finding and rescuing potato GLaDOS from the bird I feel as though she's become my only true companion at this point.  The slow realization that GLaDOS is the immortalized mind of Caroline, forced into a machine and forever trapped as a homicidal AI, makes me start to feel a strange connection to her.  It's as if the realization that GLaDOS is also a victim of what was obviously an unhealthy and probably abusive relationship suddenly humanized my mortal enemy for me and made me actually feel for her.  As I slowly make my way through the old facility and back into the new, I actually grow rather attached to her.

Once back in the newer Aperture facility we meet Wheatley again to find he's gone completely mad.  His attempts at test chambers are so fitting of him.  As Wheatley is trying to kill GLaDOS and myself I feel like GLaDOS is actually my ally in this.  As we work our way to his lair I love being there as she formulates her plan.  Arriving in his lair I love his analysis of the final boss fight of the last game.  It does such a good job of tying the two games together once again.

The corrupted cores are absolutely hilarious as well.  My favorite of them is, of course, space core.

Even knowing how the last moment of the boss fight plays out, I feel as though I'm actually participating in an interactive movie.  The last moment as Wheatley and I are dangling through the portal literally on the surface of the bloody moon, I feel like it's the most engaging cut scene of any game I've ever played.  That split second after GLaDOS knocks Wheatley off into the vast empty expanse of space, I remember my first play through thinking I've just been betrayed and was about to die in space, just before I turn to see that GLaDOS has grabbed ahold of me and is pulling me back in.

The goodbye scene between GLaDOS and Chell is such a fitting end to their relationship.  The turret choir is such a beautiful send off.

Finally, that last shot of GLaDOS returning my companion cube always melts my heart.  I don't know why, but I got emotionally attached to the companion cube in the first Portal, and destroying it was one of the most heartbreaking moments of any game I've ever played.  Let that sink in.  Having to burn a cube with a pink heart painted on it was one of the most heartbreaking moments of any game I've ever played.  And as such, the return of that cube was one of, if not the most satisfying end to a video game I have ever experienced.  And that's just the single player story.

I can never decide if I want another iteration of this game series or not.  This is such a perfect moment to end on.  Granted, I would love to see Chell using a portal gun in the post Half-Life 2 world, outside the Aperture Science facility.  Maybe, if Valve ever learns to count to three."
10024,There is no way anybody can dislike this game. It's the definition of perfect

with puzzle elements throughout the game, it brings confusion occasionally, but it is really fun to solve them. I feel like playing a temple-version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

10132,"Yes, very good"
10133,"Played the campaign and also completed the coop with a friends. Absolutely great.
It was a great experience and very fresh, old game but it's still next level, i completely recommend playing both Portal games, playing it solo is already great but the coop is so so good, its very complicated, cool, and very fun and doesnt feel repetitive at all.

This game is pure magic, buy it.

10152,10/10 + this game has co-op
10153,Really good game hope they continue the half-verse (half-life universe) woth another half-life or maybe portal 3
10154,"I beat this game 3 times at the moment I'm writing this, and here is why this is the best game I have played so far, at least in my opinion:
For a game made in 2011, the graphics hold up really well
It has a lot of funny moments, it has a good storytelling
The puzzles never really get boring, they're not too easy, and they're not too hard.
I really like the fact that you can play community-made chambers and also make your own, it's a sort of endless mode, though community-made chambers are not as fun as the official ones, the story mode is the gem of this game.
There's a feature that lets you speedrun some parts of the game and compare it to your friends' highscores, it's perfect for when you're really bored of playing the game normally

On the other hand, there are the Coop chambers, although they're not as fun as the story mode chambers, the company of a friend is what saves it, and it also makes this game a lot better, since you can always hop on with a friend and try to solve the puzzle you couldn't solve 10 months ago

You don't ""need"" to play Portal 1 first, but I'd recommend doing so, just so you build up your skills progressively."

10179,"This game is a masterpiece. If you haven't played the Portal series you are missing a lot. Especially this second game is literally one of the best game experiences in my life. Funny dialogue, story, music, good gameplay, actually hard puzzles, great graphics (even to this day), coop, community's own chambers and just everything about this game is pure gold. 

Also the way they announced this game was really cool. Updating the first game and putting secret codes that reveal secret websites and a huge ARG is just a really genius way to reveal a new game and it fits the game story and just over all the whole series's feeling very well. 

If you haven't played this and or you're sceptical just buy it from a Sale or something. It literally costs just like a couple of bucks on sale and it is still 200% worth it with full price."

10188,A submersive masterpiece
10189,Yes
10190,"Might just be the best game that has ever been made from start to finish.
It's all executed perfectly. The small things someone can find and critique is part of the art of Portal, and hence just validates the game even more. Portal 1 and 2 ties together so well that the series is elevated to a multitude of levels above it's already independent brilliance. The only thing I find myself regretting in this paradise of an intriguing story, is my inability to fully enjoy it from the beginning. 

Note: I did go into this game completely blind. I had actually forgotten the famous line 'the cake is a lie' in portal 1 (though, I did discover it in the easter eggs anyway). I purposely distanced myself from the game because I knew I'd play it at some point. In my childhood I had tried the co-op mode many years ago, so from there I knew. My play-count hours are mostly from playing community maps and co-op after the initial story. I love portal.

If there ever would be a portal 3, it doesn't have to be about Chell. I just want to experience the incredible mix of narrative, humour and execution of brilliance again in a different format. Perhaps the three-way-portal device Wheatley pointed out in ""the part where he kills you"" that Portal Reloaded (community made game) seems to have incorporated. Anything. Just more portal. More Half-Life Aperture Science universe."

10210,"I originally played portal in the Orange Box on PlayStation 3 back when I was a teenager. :( Now i'm old in my mid 20's, Lol. Besides the point... I loved this game and it was great to see the original Portal game add so many components to the game like 2 player, and other portal effects. This game is recommended for adults and teens as well. The story is good too. If you don't like this game, then you have unrealistic expectations or no appreciation for game content with depth or non micro-transactioned online focused only garbage like the modern stuff they are pumping out today. I swear some of these games just give me a headache and are full of bright a** colors a mess all over the screen. This game tho, 9.5/10"
10211,Good game

Great voice acting, great game design and super hard puzzles that make you scratch your head until you feel your brain with your finger. 10/10, if it was polished more, it would be too shiny for you to look at it"

10224,this game is realy cool and you can jump
10225,"Holy crap, this game is good.
I don't usually write detailed reviews, but here goes.

The puzzles are a lot of fun, it just feels amazing to finally figure out the obvious answer to something you've been stuck on for the past 15 minutes, plus the physics and portal mechanics are just great to play around with. The graphics and the environments are simply sublime, I cannot overstate how beautiful and hauntingly huge the maps are. The soundtrack is also incredibly fitting to the environments, and simply great music.

And the characters, oh boy the characters. This has to be one of the funniest games, hell, one of the funniest pieces of media, I've ever experienced. The characters are incredibly detailed and interact beautifully with each other, even if there's not a lot of them (quality over quantity, am I right), and I their sarcastic attitude fits in perfectly with my sense of humor. Absolutely one of the top games of all time in my opinion.

TL;DR : Beautiful, funny game, fun mechanics, play now"
10226,STEAM MUST-BUY!!!
10227,This game is so fun! I play it with my brother and we love it it's a good game for your mind. It's so cool how the portals work! If you have it do you like it?!

10233,I'm not down bad for Wheatley what are you talking about? Haha no I'm not a simp guys I'm not a si
10234,"Portal 2 was the first Valve game I ever got into back in my Xbox 360 days. Sure, I had Left 4 Dead but without online capabilities that became monotonous rather quickly. I knew Valve games were held in high regard back then but I never understood why until I had one I could become invested in. That game was Portal 2!

Remember CD's? Me neither. Anyway, Portal 2. Picking up where the tech demo that is Portal essentially ended off, you wake up in the testing centre because the big boss in charge of operating the facility is still dead after you murdered her in the last game (oops, spoilers) and you have to escape the facility.
You're guided by the asphalt milkshake that is Wheatley, a petrified and humorous robot designed to assist the humans when they're not involved in testing. 
Eventually through complications and no fault of your own, the big,bad boss Glados is revived and very clearly upset that you, you know, murdered her. She puts you back into the testing program to test forever & ever and your mission remains to eventually escape. 

 Valve perfected two essential pillars that make Portal 2 so memorable and enjoyable. The 1st is the writing, performed beautifully by all the voice actors involved. Glados, Wheatley, Cave Johnson, the test chamber announcer, the turrets, all of them have such dynamic dialogue that incorporates unprecedented levels of charisma, sarcasm, subtlety, passive aggressiveness and humour that you can't help but smirk or laugh at their deliveries. 
The 2nd is the gameplay loop. Using two portals to navigate a large facility in level format. These two portals slowly start including more complex mechanics and physics as the game progresses to keep gameplay fresh and challenging. There is nothing more satisfying than finally solving a puzzle you'd be stuck on for a while. This game is filled with those moments. 

Even better is that after the main game, the co-op campaign is available to continue this puzzle mayhem, only this time it involves a friend with a total of four portals for added vastness and complexity. A great mode to play with someone and feel that euphoric feeling of solving some real head-scratching puzzles. 

I personally prefer the 2nd game to the 1st, though criticism I can understand is that towards the final acts of the game it can start to feel a little too lengthily. Still, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves intricate uses of the English language and some really creative puzzles that can stop you in your tracks while you try solve them trial-and-error style. 

10/10 will portal again!"

10245,"The story is the best of any game I have ever played.

The puzzles eased me into the mechanics at my own pace while still providing challenges, the immersion created by atmospheric lighting and background objects rivals even VR games I've experienced, and workshop integration with the level editor means I can continue enjoying the masterfully-done platforming for the indefinite future.

I would gladly have paid an extra $25 for this game."

10265,"This Is probably my favorite game of all time. It provides a thought inducing story while also keeping you on your feet with clever puzzles that fit perfectly within the lore and environment. Even though there arn't many, the characters are quite interesting, and the story keeps you interested in them and their lore through out and after the entire game. Overall, an amazing game, and I hope to see more like it in Valve's future. (Crossing my fingers that we don't have to weight another decade)

Play this game if you have not."

10312,My girlfriend showed this game to me and I'm really glad she did cause now it's one of my favorite games and I love all the mystery and puzzle.
10313,"How have I not reviewed this game yet?! I basically grew up playing this.

Well, anyway, I love everything. You can play the amazing singleplayer campaign, or play through sets of co-op puzzles with a friend. You can also create your own test chambers! 

The singleplayer campaign isn't particularly long, but it's still incredibly enjoyable and a worthy continuation of the original Portal's story. I personally say its story is even better than the original game's (but I might also be biased since, as I said earlier, I grew up with this one). It has fantastic writing, and very good visual storytelling. I won't say anything about the plot here because I think it's best experienced blind.

The puzzles are challenging and definitely require thought, but they're not so challenging that it will take you hours to figure it out or anything like that. The game slowly gives you knowledge of the game's mechanics very early on, so you won't be completely lost.

The workshop has a ton of test chambers created by other people on the platform, so you can download those and play through more. If you want to, you can even create your own as I mentioned earlier. It's a very nice addition to the game.

I recommend this game wholeheartedly. The game's unique gameplay and style make it hard to get tired of, and with the workshop, you might never run out of puzzles to do. This is one of my personal favorites. I love it!"

10361,it was epic

awesome story from the connection of portal 1. i have told all my friends outside of steam to get it and play"

10385,Nice 👍🙂
10386,the puzzles are too advanced for my caveman mind but its still really fun
10387,gets called adopted by a potato
10388,"I wholeheartedly believe that this game is a masterpiece. I have over 40 hours in the game at this point, I've 100% all achievements and I've beaten the main campaign more times then I can count. This game is truly so entertaining, and at this point is my favorite game of all time. The mechanics and puzzles are so entertaining and fun to mess around with, and each level is just designed beautifully. The story is an amazing continuation from the first Portal game, and the dialogue with GLaDOS and Wheatley is just amazing. If you want a fun puzzle game with a great story, then I 100% recommend getting Portal 2. You definitely won't regret it.

10/10.

PS: Hey Valve, maybe you could, idk, make Portal 3? Thanks."

10405,"It says playtime 28 hours but I actually got this game at launch on PS3. I got a voucher inside the game's case for a free steam download key, which is actually how this account got created. This game is genius. One of the best puzzle games of all time. If you haven't played it, you should & if you have played it, you know why I'm writing this review.

Co-op is a complete delight, with the same razor-sharp humor from the the solo story throughout the entire co-op campaign. Great puzzles, and now with the new user-made level editors, you can play player-made levels for solo or co-op play.

The soundtrack is dark and ominous, the puzzles are brain bending, and the dialogue will have you rolling on the floor. I don't know how much more of a premium gaming experience you can expect. Anyway, pick up Portal 2. It's worth the admission price."

i used to play portal and portal 2 with my dad on the xbox360 when i was younger and it was so much fun. so i am used to the multiplayer aspect and really enjoy it. 

i hope one day i get around to playing the singleplayer as im sure its as good if not better than the multiplayer.

10515,I've played this game several times over the last decade on xbox and PC. glados perpetually lives in my brain because I love her.
10516,Classic
10517,fun
10518,"Great game, fun to go back too every once in a while"

10522,I want to liston to asmr of cave johnson talking about the apture handheld portal device
10523,"it is is so good, the gameplay, the storyline, the voice acting, everything is so good 10/10"
10524,"this is probably one of the best games i have ever played. If you like amazing comedy, problem solving, robots, portals, and pretty much anything, play this game"
10525,This is one of the five best games I've ever played
10526,"it is literally portal 2, if you are reading this you have already played it or you should"
10527,yes good game
10528,it is great
10529,One of the most INNOVATIVE games ever. Deserves a Game of The Year Award forever.
10530,good
10531,"I think this says it all:

 ""All right, I've been thinking when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down- with those lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns down your house.""

In reality though, I have never played a more spectacular game. This game is the closes game we will ever have to pure perfection. Everything about this game is amazing. The gameplay is spectacular and engaging, the visuals and graphics are stunning (especially for over a decade ago), but the characters and the story are what really makes this game. If you haven't played the game, I cannot tell you strongly enough to play it. I recommend it to everyone I know. 
11/10. This game is phenomenal.

10532,Amazing solo and very good with a friend even if hes a cuck...
10533,"great game

10540,"I do recommend this game, if you didn't play it you missed out.
The game is high quality even in 2022, the community is nice and the entire game is really good."
10541,"No game has ever made me feel like a genius and an idiot at the same time. Very fun
"
10542,"very fun and exciting

10543,"not like the other puzzle games

10544,best steam game + steam series of all time

10550,joe baizen 3rd
10551,yes
10552,still waiting on my cake
10553,one of my first games on steam i had alot of fun playing it i recommend this game to all of you guys
10554,"Definitely one of my favorite games. I've played for years, over and over again. Speed running and finding things I never saw the first time are always super fun. Co-op is always fun too, I like challenging my friends to play with me, then sending them through infinite portals. Anyways, 10/10"
10555,I'm willing to sacrifice my soul to make portal 3 a reality
10556,hole in wall do funny
10557,"This game is a cast iron 10/10 and I will fight anyone who disagrees in their car park of choice. Portal 1 was a puzzle game revolution and not enough people respect that. SO many clones have come out of it, some critically successful. The first was funny, but simple. Clean, refined, in hindsight, quite subtle. Finishing that game was a real solid, satisfying experience. 

However, from the opening sequence of Portal 2, it's clear this game has turned EVERYTHING up to 11. Now some may be critical, as it's a lot more 'busy'. There's almost no element of the game that doesn't come with accompanying voice work, however the quality of that voice work is WORLD TIER. I laugh every single level and I have played this game almost annually. It's funny, pithy, charming, and the graphics are ANYTHING but 'clean' and 'refined'. It's messy, chaotic, wild and active. The story is outstanding, the evolutions from the first game are clear cut and consistently better. This is one of maybe 5 games of the literal thousands I've played that I have no notes for. This game is perfect. If you haven't played it, buy it, play it, and if you don't agree, pick a car park."
10558,I have grown up with this game on PS3. And now being able to play it on PC is just as good if not better with the community levels and mods.
10559,gud gem
10560,very cool lore
10561,portal.
10562,describe what I liked about this product? GLaDos's lines.
10563,"the puzzles are a little more difficult compared to the last game, but it's so fun and the story (as far as i am currently) is great"
10564,thanks

10576,"I wish I had the ability to teleport into my crushes room and sniff he crusty dusty valumptuous calfs. I need this and desire this. Otherwise, the girl in portal is mad thick and i look through the portals to see those cheeks jiggle."
10577,A fan favorite of mine! I originally played this on my PS3 and have come back to play it on steam. amazing brain teaser of a game. 10/10 will play again in a year when I've forgotten the puzzles.

10612,great
10613,"An excellent Platforming Puzzler!

Portal 2 is a wonderful expansion from the first.  It's a full experience, with much more Narrative to dig into.  They tie it into the Half Life Universe in much more substantial ways, and I always wanted to see what was next.  I really loved many of the environments, especially in the back half of the game!

The platforming is the star of the game.  I am bad at platforming, but I was able to make my way through the game without too many tears.  By utilizing your tools, you can ""think your way around"" the hardest platforming, making the execution much more feasible.  The flying through the air still feels great.

The puzzles are fun, but they are subordinated to the narrative and platforming.  Most of the puzzles felt fairly trivial for the experiences puzzle game player.  When I finally unlocked all the tools and mechanics, I became very excited, thinking ""now they can roll out the really hard stuff.""  The the single player game finished.

The really meaty puzzles are in the co-op campaigns.   Those were much more of a challenge, as well as a total blast to do with friends.  Twice the portals means four times the craziness, and probably 8 times the deaths.  I have not tried out the community levels, but those could be great too.

Overall a great experience"
10614,"a very good and funny game!
you should play this game with your friend or girlfriend and enjoy :)"
10615,"i cannot live without the conveniency of portals now

Needless to say, its a good game and worth the price of admission."
10655,this game is very fun
10656,This is one of the best games i have ever played for enjoyment and I want others to feel that 10/10
10657,"great game! I love playing it, and the main story is amazing. still havent played the first, but will soon.

10699,"SUPER GOOD GAME!! Loved it to bits, everyone should play Portal 2 NOW!!!"
10700,This is a very fun puzzle solving game with 3d physics. It is really cool because you have to think very creatively but you also will not get stuck or bored easily.
10701,"Portal 2 is rightfully considered one of the greatest games of all time. There isn't much to say about this game that hasn't already been said, but that by no means indicates that it doesn't still deserve praise. Gorgeous graphics that stand the test of time (after more than a decade), amazing sound design with plenty of adaptive music, and a ridiculously fun co-op campaign are certainly part of what makes Portal 2 outstanding, but the true stars of the show are the game's story and puzzles. The story throughout Portal 2 does so much with so little that was established in the original Portal. It merges brilliant dark humor with expansive lore, great voice acting, a narrative that balances intensity with intrigue, and some of the most iconic characters in video game history. On the other hand, the level design of Portal 2 is remarkable. Each and every puzzle is carefully crafted to fall into a perfect range of difficulty, never being too hard or too simple. New mechanics that immediately become familiar are refreshingly introduced along the way to keep providing complex yet understandable challenges for the player. In my opinion, Portal 2 is a flawless video game. It's a game that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone, regardless of familiarity with the genre, or even with video games themselves. Give it a try if you somehow haven't already."

Because the length, 15AUD is a very good ask for a neat charming game, and it also goes on stupid cheap sale every now and then - no reason not to buy it at sale cost."

10754,"Awesome game! Very good voice acting, really put the soul into the machines, turrets voice lines almost break my heart. Outstanding sound design and soundtracks. Puzzle are not too hard and feels satisfying, even my dumbass can figured it all out from start to finish. Great writing, good humor. No gun, no mindless shooting, just your brain and portal device (but still managed to have good boss fight tho), oh and wicked humor. All-in-all a very simple game with surprisingly good gameplay. Valve killed it! Waiting for the number ""3"" from them."
10755,"Amazing game, even after you finish single player, multiplayer is so much fun!"
10756,My review of Portal 2 is that it is Portal 2.
10757,a master piece
10758,"A great game, the story is a solid 9/10 and the multiplayer is great."
10759,"This is legitimately one of my favorite games ever. I entered blind, never having played Portal (or any Valve game, for that matter) and exited astounded. I played it first on PS3 after a very turbulent month, being evacuated from a wildfire, and received it through the post office while on evacuation with no access to the PS3. Given the circumstances, I was more excited to play it at that point than I ever was before.

So what makes Portal 2 so great? It's a multitude of things.

Firstly, its story. I had not played Portal prior to my initial playthrough of its sequel, but everything was crystal clear to me as an outsider. I had no idea of the history surrounding Aperture or GLaDOS or any of these countless other things, but the stellar writing ensures that you can still understand the story regardless. GLaDOS's ruthless quips at Chell are hilarious as always, and the comic relief Wheatley serves during the head-end of the game help anchor you to some intrinsic sense of reality that's foggier elsewhere throughout its runtime.

The gameplay is perfect. Having played Portal now, I can see that 2 is a remarkable improvement to the first game's formula. The thing is, though, the second game can also stand on its own, at least as far as gameplay goes. The queues provided throughout visuals and audio guides help to give you just enough of a link to tie each test's loose ends together, and the satisfaction brought forth with success and hearing GLaDOS insult you for your efforts is always a delight. This isn't even beginning to consider the co-op mode, which is just as solid as the campaign.

This game hit me at a very impressionable time and it still hasn't really gotten out of me. It's a textbook lesson in Valve's classic 'show, don't tell' design philosophy that starts really strong and finishes just as well. Its characters are as lovable and quotable today as they were in 2011, and the story's plunges into the depths of Aperture Laboratories are still as engaging as they've ever been. This game is a must-play for anybody. Incredible."
10760,buy it.
10761,[h1] I'm a potato! [/h1]
10762,Probably close to the best game of all time
10763,v
10764,"Flawless masterpiece.
A comfort game."
10765,"awesome game, awesome story, awesome humor, awesome sequel"
10766,this game is good yeah
10767,pro
10768,I like it twice as much as portal 1!
10769,verty hood
10770,"Uhhh, why are you looking at the reviews? Anyways, it's good, fun to play with a friend."
10771,My favorite game ever
10772,.
10773,"Wheatley you sodding golf ball, get down from there"
10774,Super Fun with a buddy!
10775,This game is one of my favorite games of all time.  It looks good and plays even better.  The gameplay is well designed for singleplayer and multiplayer play.  The slow reveal of the plot and the fate of old aperature is engaging and the game is easy to get lost in.  The puzzles are well designed and the game overall holds up very well.
10776,it copied portal 1 but it's ok
10777,im ded
10778,"glados, need i say more?"
10779,Easily is in my top three video games of all time. Perfectly balancing an engaging story with a unique sense of humor and self awareness. Portal 2 is the best puzzle game I have ever played in my entire life.
10780,Great singleplayer and CO-OP game. Would totally recommend it 4 playing with friends .

10901,I'm glad that there is a new portal game and the graphics are alot better
10902,I know it says I only have like .6 hours on my steam account at the time im reviewing this but is one of the best games ive played period. I probably sinked almost 250 hours into this game just messing around in the community test chambers because this game is fun as hell and has so much replay ability. The story is also very entertaining with characters like wheatly but then mysterious and creepy when you get to the underground and old aperture science area. this is one of those games all steam users should have on their library. thanks valve now wheres the 3rd one.
10903,Perfect game.
10904,i never beat this
10905,"A true classic, a must-play for everyone who has a decent PC"
10906,"THIS GAME IS EPIC
"
10907,It’s amazing that valve could make a repetitive puzzle game be interesting have a good story and be really funny and it is even more amazing that they managed to make the sequel even better
10908,"we love this game,  and hope for a sequel someday!"
10909,"Goddamn, it's so hard to believe this came out almost a decade ago and still holds up as one of the greatest looking games of all time."
10910,portal go nyoom
10911,"Great story, Fun gameplay"
10912,"Fantastic game - play through BOTH co-op and single-player storyline. You'll thank me.
"
10913,"I've had Steam for longer than I can remember (I'm an oldie) used to play Quake2 (<FB> clan), Half-Life etc, Portal & this one, Portal 2 ... Love it, took me ages to complete first time round, great mind bender, having another stab to see what I can remember, recommended."
10914,"it is very fun. long loading times, but fun
"
10915,"More, Valve, more!  Take my money.  I want more!"
10916,Unique to be sure
10917,"So Fucking Good :)
"
10918,.
10919,fun
10920,great game :)
10921,"This is a very good game if you like puzzles and science. The campaign has a good story, the co-op mode is fun, and the Community test chambers are great. I really love the never ending puzzles created by the community. I give this game a 10/10, highly recommend."
10922,"Portal 2 is one of the few follow up games that is equal to the original. On the off chance that you have not played either and are looking to make a first time purchase of this game, let me break it down for you.

The game is all about using your problem solving abilities in a fun and creative way to complete puzzle levels. You have a gun the makes two portals that you can enter into and pass through from one to another in order over come obstacles. 

It was a ground breaking, new type of game at it's time of release and is still a rare game concept to this day although its becoming more common with slight alterations. That being said no one does it or has done it quiet like this team did.

The game is story driven and riddled with sarcasm and moderate dark humor that is bound to make you chuckle each time. I personally find the puzzles to be very challenging at times although far from impossible. 

The graphics are solid even for it's age and the game offers a fair amount of replay value. This is my second time purchasing it if that tells you anything. (Console to PC)

The games story plots do tie in together but playing the 1st is not a requirement to enjoy the second, I played them in reverse order and was still pulled in enough to go an by the 1st later on.

My biggest complaint is that the games are short and the replay value is limited, more so with the 1st game than this one but even with Co-op installation in this game, once you get the hang of the puzzles/mechanics, you will start completing the levels faster and faster.


Overall, I think it's a great game to keep in the library and I always go back to it from time to time because it's just so satisfying,relaxing and easy to lose yourself in (Eminem?).  

 

"
10923,"Same great puzzle solving gameplay, but bigger. 
The only problem is that there are more sequences where gameplay is taken away from you, compared to the first game where it's non stop in engine gameplay."
10924,i found this was a very detailed and enjoyable game i like the new story and how it takes longer to complete i suggest this to other people it is a great game!
10925,It's fun.

10946,Fun problem solving situations in a picturesque and less adrenaline loaded manner.   Certainly it has some tense moments and the big fight at the end is pretty fast actioned.  But overall a nice blend of action and thinking.
10947,ong
10948,Its fun you should play
10949,"I've never really been interested in single-player games, but this might've changed that. I love this game. The story, the voice acting, and just the game in general. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game for themselves."
10950,This game is totally worth it and you really dont need to play the first game to know whats happening but if you want to know more of the story then definitely play the first game

11033,"its a great game with a great story and graphics, it doesnt need good stuff to run it and the co-op mode is great. i personally like it better than portal 1 but that doesnt mean that its bad"
11034,This game is sooo fun and good... Especially in the co-op mode that you play with a friend!
11035,this is plain WOW
11036,"Portal 2 is an FPS puzzle game, which continue the Portal story, but now you get the chance to get away... again, thanks to a core.

Portal 2 is a masterpiece gameplay wise. It does what Portal started, but adds new elements to play with, adds more to the story and universe and even coop mode. As a single player game, you can have tons of fun, there are good amount of secrets in it and doesn't feel boring at all (well maybe for the [spoiler] old Aperture Science part[/spoiler] but that's my opinion, also you can solve community made maps and map packs, which some of them really awesome. As a CO-OP game... well this is one of the best CO-OP experience I ever experienced. For 2011, the game looks and sounds great, controls are really easy.

The only thing I can nit pick on, is about the single and coop story mode, which you for me didn't had replay value.

But all in all, this one is an amazing game for anyone, there is no question about trying it out. For 8.2€, it's a steal, just go for it!"

11040,PORTAL 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11041,Portal 2 is a classic and probably my favorite game of all time. I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed the singleplayer after replaying it twice or looking like absolute morons playing coop. Portal 2 is a puzzle game with an interesting and unique story that kinda sits on the side with charming characters you'll love all around even if they try to kill you. My only grip with this game is that there isn't another one after it :)
11042,good solo game.
11043,B I G    M O O D
11044,best puzzle game ever
11045,"I have played it on PS3 and Steam a total of 6 times all the way through, and it's probably the most replayable game ever. It's so satisfying because it has reached a level of depth and smoothness that I don't think any other game has. This game is very psychologically correct in that way."
11046,"Best game I've played on Steam by far but theres already tons of people who've said so so instead im gonna list my favorite characters

1. Defective Turret
2. Cave Johnson
3. Wheatley
4. Chell
5. GLaDOS"

11057,i think im n average player
11058,"I used to play co-op for endless hours back on the 360. Somehow I never realized that Portal 2 had a single-player, story mode. Played through in two days, just fantastic, highly recommend. Short but perfect (6 hours for me, no rushing), never a dull moment in the story from start-to-finish, so much better than I was expecting. Co-op was a blast too, don't sleep on it.
I now kindly demand Portal 3."

11079,"Valve, by your actions, namely by restricting your users from one of the largest regions of the earth the ability to fully pay for anything in your store, you deprive yourself of monetization, as well as people's trust. In all the conflicts you have shown yourself worthy, but now you have become like those who have always been a bad example for you. I don't understand what you want to achieve with this. If you want to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine, then you clearly do not need to take away one of the few good things that we have left, because no one supports the Russian government, including the Russians, but by this action you only strengthen the pro-Propaganda tales about the ""evil West"" and that there are only enemies around Russia. I hope that people at Valve will see this, that they can somehow influence this.

Valve, своими действиями, а именно ограничением своим пользователям из одного из крупнейших регионов земли возможности полноценно оплачивать все что угодно в вашем магазине вы лишаете себя монитезации, а так же народного доверия. Во всех конфликтах вы показывали себя достойно, но сейчас вы уподобились тем кто всегда был плохим примером для вас. Я не понимаю чего вы хотите добиться этим. Если вы хотите прекратить кровопролитие в Украине, то вам явно не надо отбирать одну из немногих хороших вещей что у нас осталось, ведь никто не поддерживает российское правительство, в том числе и русские, но этим действием вы лишь укрепляете пропогандисские сказки о ""злом западе"" и о том что вокруг россии одни враги. Надеюсь что это увидят люди в Valve что могут хоть как то на это повлиять."
11080,portal
11081,Yes game
11082,"I really like this game, while being pretty hard (I had to look at youtube tutorials for most of the game) it's really great. The story is really creative, the gameplay is fun, the soundtrack is great and it's really fun to grind the game's achievements. 9.5/10"
11083,right click left click go brrrrrrrrrrrr
11084,"my gf said if we fail to finish a test in under 2 minutes in coop she was going to peg me 


i dont remember any other time that i forced my brain to think that hard"
11085,"A wonderful story.

I got this game years ago and do not regret it. The story is fun, it takes place an uncertain amount of time after the first game, The facility is in ruins and you are the only human left in the facility. I would highly recommend playing portal one first how ever to get more context for the story.

Portal 2 goes into the history of Aperture labs in part of the game and we learn about Glados’s past as well as learn about the founder of Aperture. This game requires quite a bit of brain usage to think of how to complete chambers.


This game is a classic and has a few funny achievements. One achievement you get for stepping in a scanner with out anything in your hands.  You also get one for in CO-OP waving at every camera."
11086,wait you don't know what karlson is ?
11087,"come on its portal 2 its worth it
"
11088,My favorite game I’ve ever played I’ve been playing since I was 5 years old and I can’t explain the love for this game it probably helped my congnitive development good game great game
11089,"Amazing game, I wish that everyone at least play once in their lifetime. (after playing the first one obviously)"
11090,Great singleplayer with a fun story and engaging gameplay. The coop mode is lots of fun too. Valve giving the Softare Development Kit (SDK) for free along with the game is also very appreciated.
11091,"It's classic like the first one. I completed the story (and took some achievements) for around 20 hours. I liked the multiplayer and the chamber maker(but I recommend you play it with someone smart enough). Some of the chambers could be difficult for people who have never played a Portal game.
And the reviews are 99% positive!
If you've made the decision to buy the game. I would recommend you to buy the game on sale for the cheap price of 1€."

11093,FUCKERS HAVENT GIVEN US PORTAL 3
11094,Protal Tow 1621/10
11095,we need more masterpieces like this
11096,"Valve took everything that was great about the original and made it better - better puzzles, better world-building, better lore, better voice acting, better graphics, better gameplay, more interactive game elements. They took a timeless classic and somehow managed to innovate on top of it. Portal 2 not only provides another stellar single player campaign but a fun and similarly enjoyable multiplayer campaign. The fact that these two titles hold up all these years later speak to how innovative they were in the first place. After playing the first one, be sure to play this timeless classic!"
11097,10/10

11116,Portal 2 is a masterpiece. If you want this game I suggest you buy it. The graphics are so good that they will have your computer screaming for mercy. The humor is so dark but funny. My only problem is that it was too complex for my square brain.

There are some great mods out there, I especially recommend Portal Reloaded, it is good enough to be considered portal 3."

11165,British man chases you. The game.
11166,Fatty fatty no parents
11167,"This is a direct upgrade to Portal 1, and I would say with no fear that this game is one of the best ever made. The storyline is absolutely well crafted and just like I stated in my review for Portal 1 the characters are insanely funny. It is interesting to see yourself going through the middle of the facility while you have 2 pieces of A.I bossing you around. This game is perfect, I just wish the multiplayer mode still worked with online players (nobody seems to be playing it). Valve absolutely nailed this game, the Portal series is the best."
11168,good
11169,Still my favorite game to the day.
11170,"love this game much fun

11171,The perfect game for comedy while mixing tragedy into a game. I have never played such an amazing game.

11174,the portal 2 co op changes a man
11175,"It's still the best game in my Steam Library.

Also, if you enjoy the puzzle aspect of it and want some hard/fun/interesting challenges, I highly recommend trying out many mods."
11176,Best Puzzle game I have ever played！
11177,"Fantastic story, level design and humour."
11178,"cool game, shoot portals"

10/10 Bananas"
11191,"One of the best games that I immediately suggest to all of my friends and beg them to play co-op with me. Has beyond brilliant characters, voice acting, humor, and anything good to make a story. A brilliant continuation of the first game -  which was already a short but sweet puzzle game. Builds upon skills slowly but still engaging enough to laugh and have fun."
11192,i fall thru hole
11193,fun game love the story already played it again on my Xbox and i plan on buying the switch version so i can always play it again and again when i want to also got two achievements i didnt get on my xbox seris s wish they would make a portal 3 already i plan on downloading the desk game when it comes out tomorrow as well good series give us 3 already
11194,"It's twice the length of the first one and it gives the same satifaction when you solve the puzzles. Wheatley is a good addition and adds some comedic fun dialogues in-game. 

Didn't suffer with the sequel curse and definitely much better than the first game."
11195,u know glowy holes
11196,you already know it
11197,This game is the perfect mix of funny and serious. No comedy or plot twist seems out of place. I have played this game like 5 times total (including on console). 10/10 Will probably play again when I get my steam deck. (and I honestly might buy it on switch and play it in full there as well)
11198,portal gun
11199,its better than one.
11200,I played the multiplayer mode in this game and it was just me and my friend trying to kill each other over and over again 10/10
11201,One of the best games iv'e played! The creativity to pull this off with various puzzles to complete is amazing. Hats off to valve in creating such a great sequel.
11202,"i really recommend this game, even though it feels in certan part it feels like you're playing resident evel"
11203,"Best game i have ever played

11218,this game has a lot of humor and is a very relaxing game. the music creates a good background and if you've never played portal that ok this game is still a great game to start from.
11219,"After so many years of playing this game, and the first version as well, it is still one of my all-time favorites.  Pity they won't make a 3rd one yet."

11250,.
11251,yes
11252,Lemons
11253,"This is one of, if not the best video games I have ever played. It combines amazing puzzle-solving, amazing story-telling, and fantastically witty comedy. I would without a doubt recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle solving games."
11254,theres also portals in this game
11255,One of the best of all time
11256,This is the best PC game I've played so far.
11257,"valve's last ""true"" game, and what a game to go out with. From the well-crafted puzzles, that are challenging at moments but not insufferably difficult or tedious, the witty and clever writing always expected from a valve title, and graphics that still look great even a decade after release, this is a classic that should be played for years to come."
11258,you get to listen to a man ranting about lemons also GLADOS is pretty cool
11259,fun + cool story + w + wigglesbourough united fan since 1807
11260,I really liked this game. Very creative puzzles. The multiplayer was very well done and I like the ability to create my own puzzle rooms. The story line is well thought out and presented in a very comedic style.

11271,STICK THOSE FUCKING LEMONS UP YOUR FIRED ASS
11272,"I thought this game was just gonna be one of those ""Oh you've gotta play it!"" and then it was actually overhyped. However, even though I only just now finished my first playthrough, it EASILY holds up and surpasses my expectations of most games coming out now. This is an amazing game."
11273,"Amazing story, amazing puzzles and very well written characters. Definitively recommended!"

11312,"This is one of my favourite games, I’ve beat it like around 4 times, it’s fun to replay the tests cause they don’t all have just 1 answer"

11336,"genuinely one of, if not THE greatest games of all time in pretty much every aspect. i think there's probably only one or two other games out there that fall into the same category of 'games i straight up can't find anything wrong with,' and while valve not being able to count to 3 is the hit joke of the past couple decades, portal executed its story perfectly in just two main games, and that's really all it needs. anyways play portal 2 lol <3"

11401,"poof, poof, woosh

11403,fun to get good at and speedrun
11404,"10/10 

graphics 
amazing for a 11 year old game its better then most current games

gameplay
the physics are pretty well designed 
not really any bugs 
and runs very easily

story
the story is amazingly good with a twist and the ending is very satifiying and butiful
and the coop story is just fun and a good opternity to mess with your freinds

requiments
easy to run

pricing

10 dollars is a absolute steal for this game

final opinion

its a valve game how could this be bad"
11405,"it fun
"
11406,Amazing!
11407,always fun replaying
11408,"very fun

This game is pretty darn good! 

Even a decade later the level design and physics are still impressive. Highly recommended."

11429,gran juego me encanto
11430,very good

"
11432,"Good Story, Good Characters, Fun Puzzles. 9/10"
11433,very fun game highly recommend this game
11434,"it a good game
"
11435,"Where do I even start? First of all the story is awesome and can be replayed so much without loosing its value. The puzzles are difficult but not too difficult to make it infuriating, once you finish a really hard puzzle you feel so much accomplishment. The co-op is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, it has a great story and actually feels like its meant to be a part of the game instead of just some afterthought. There are community made maps for single player and co-op, there are so many well made community maps that feel like they were produced by a game studio. You can even make your own map if you wanted to. SOOO many easter eggs and secrets in this game its unreal. There are barely any glitches that you can just run into during game play. Even the title screen changes depending on where you are in the game. The community for this game is insane. Speedrunning this game is insane, if you somehow feel like you are getting bored of this game, then try speedrunning it. This is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. Oh and i forgot to mention... THE CUSTOM MODS FOR THIS GAME IS INSANE!!!! If you have this game you should really consider downloading the mods for this game, some even just straight up make a whole new game with new mechanics and a whole story with new characters and its just the coolest thing ever, examples are: Portal Stories Mel, Portal Reloaded and Aperture Tag just to name a tiny amount of them. This game is perhaps one of, if not my most favourite game of all time. 

TL;DR : Portal 2 is good game, lots to do, 10/10"
11436,Companion cube <3
11437,Good game

11506,Still an incredible Game. Sound design? Great. Graphics? Still hold up. I literally have no complaints about it.

This game not only has a simple yet complex path to follow, it also has a very well defined story line to it, as well as clues that tell the origin of ""Aperture Labs"". I don't play much First Person games, but aside from Gary's Mod, I definitely enjoy coming back to ""Portal"" & ""Portal 2"" just for the enjoyment and in-depth story behind the courses."

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 10/10[/h1]
[h1]Narration: 8/10[/h1]

An excellent sequel of an even higher quality for an already wonderful first game. I do recommend doing Portal 1 first because it isn't really any less enjoyable, and will give more depth to your appreciation of the game's universe.

I am copypasting what I've said for Portal 1 because it applies to the second opus in an equal measure:
+ Excellent puzzle game, with a lot of mechanics arranged and rearranged in a smart manner.
+ Masterful learning curve, where the player gets the opportunity to progressively wrap their head around every new gameplay element.
+ Beautiful graphics that aged rather well.
+ Engaging lightweight narration through AI monologues and details in the environment.
+ Great sound design, voice acting, and music."

I really loved being able to see the history of Aperture Laboratory, I really appreciate the main character being mute it allows you to take note of your surroundings more and the other characters. Despite his betrayal Wheatley was a great character as well as Glados. The song at the end of the game made Portal 2 one of my all time favorite games."

11716,I'm speechless. This is exactly what a sequel should be like
11717,Funny and memorable dialogue. A puzzle game that makes you think. New environments and obstacles added to make this a new a refreshing sequel.
11718,it good
11719,"Portal 1 and 2 are considered among the best story-driven games ever made. they are part of the Half-Life universe; but have their own entire story. The story is engaging. The banter is hilarious. And the puzzles range from simple to very challenging. Overall, an excellent series; with a rich lore."
11720,My favorite mechanic of the game is doing multiplayer and forcing your teammate to play rock-paper-scissors which grabs said teammate and holds them hostage for a few seconds hindering any productivity. Bonus points if you can spam it and make your teammate rage quit.
11721,its great puzzle ngl

11729,YES
11730,"Lets see what uncle GabeN is offering to us...
First thing which is conspicuous is a beautiful, canny gameplay. Though the fact that this game was created 11 years ago, it doesnt really matter. Portal 2 does not require good pc specs - im having over 200 fps with max out graphics. Bunnyhopping is kinda easy in this game and it can speed you up significantly if you are doing that correctly. Sometimes the game is annoying and demanding intelectually, but that's what it's all about
Nice thing is that you can play with ya friends ( if you wanna play, dont be that shy and feel free to add me ;] )
Ive paid 1,82$ for it so in my opinion, i think its really worth it if you like using your brain ;p"

This has a decent story and has very good voice acting.
You could grab a friend, as it can be played coop with a new set of great maps.
If you do play coop, you will get more story. If you like that sort of thing.
Its like getting two games for the price of one, the testing needs to be done.

And when you have finished these test, you are not through. We have plenty more to be done in the workshop.
The workshop has more test chambers for both single and coop players, some even have extra little stories.
You may even engineer subject test chambers of your own; only qualified personnel need apply. 
There are no bad test, Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT ! Now where is that ""your fired"" button.

Remember volunteers are not paid, and there is cake. Lots of cake.. Now go start testing."

11789,"There are times that I forget how great this game is. Its been 10+ years since its release, yet the story, the graphics, the plot, the levels, the easter eggs and the ending just click so well with me. The music and the sound FX are the greatest thing too, and it shows that Portal wasnt just a game made for money, it was a genuine work of art that pushed the boundaries further than what VALVe could do. It easily outbests Portal 1 in every single way, snd its worth every penny if youre any sort of gamer, not just a puzzle expert

Truly, a remarcable game that set the new high in the gaming industry. And no, i dont only want you gone, i want you to live forever"

11833,"After completing the single-player story multiple times, and having completed the multiplayer-side of the game, I can positively say that this has to be among the greatest puzzle games of this decade. It has a diverse (and humorous thanks to Wheatley) story, with a good combination of puzzles, narrative and portals!

Taking off after Portal 1, this game has followed the same high-quality standard that Valve has shown across their vast library of titles. I highly recommend trying this game out as it is two games in one, with both a rich story and multiplayer experience included."

11845,"Is good
"
11846,"(This review is just about the campaign, not the editor/workshop/co-op/etc)

I love shooting a portal at the wrong spot because I literally can't see the platform I'm trying to make the portal appear next to and falling to my death once I go through it so I have to wait for the game to reload the entire level and set me back 30 seconds for a scripted section that also doesn't work properly so I have to wait another 30 seconds.

For 3/4 of the game I was having fun, but it suddenly devolved into these shitty esoteric puzzles with fifteen million conflicting mechanics that result in solutions that don't logically follow because they rely on features integrated into the convoluted systems instead of actual intuition (as in you have to know EVERY single thing a specific mechanic can do or can't do in every context, keeping in mind the non-deterministic nature of the Source engine and other sources of error like slightly misaligned portals and the garbage slow ""smoothed"" movement that feels more like I am a rhinoceros than a human). Wheatley constantly repeating the same unfunny voice line every time the game completely reloads the level because the physics in Source aren't deterministic and the light tunnel decided to not work this time does not help matters. This went from ""fun game"" to ""math homework except with questions that randomly deviate from the laws of mathematics"" in like 3 hours. Oh, and it's the Source engine, so bump the randomness up by a factor of 10. Did I mention that I spent an entire day trying to fix stuttering that made the game unplayable? If you want to know what it was, you need to have the game installed on an SSD or it'll just hang every 3 seconds for no reason. I don't know what it is about Valve games and being great most of the time except for one specific section where they just ran out of ideas or something, like the HL2 canals for example. Most of the latter quarter of this game is thinking of a fun out-of-the-box solution and it not even slightly working, but not because it wouldn't work in theory. Theoretically you could run yourself through a portal loop to gain momentum and then turn around mid-air to fire the exit portal on an angled wall to make a jump, but that of course doesn't work because 1. it's fun and 2. the momentum you end up with is basically random (thanks Source) and the angle is wrong anyway. The ACTUAL solution (that I didn't look up, by the way) is to place portals on two opposing walls to spray them with portal-conducting goop, alternating walls and gaining height each time, then using those to get to a catwalk, falling from it onto more portal goop and flying out of the angled plate. If you like looking up solutions in walkthroughs and scoffing as the guy basically exploits the game to win you can be my guest, but I don't like doing math homework. It's funny, because in Portal 1 when I got stuck I just stopped playing the game instead of ripping my hair out because the game was actively fucking with me and yelling in my ear constantly with this stupid 16-year-old-redditor-that-thinks-he's-really-funny sense of humor."

As any good game developer does, they take what made the first game so great, and build upon it in practically every way. Gameplay, Soundtrack, Story, Characters, Length, Graphics, they're all better, and all worth it. Seriously, they made the practically perfect first game better somehow. Absolutely recommend, but a word of warning - don't wake her up...

11939,"Ok, so this game is obviously just a rip off of splitgate, but for a rip off its pretty good, the controls (however theres no run button) are somehow extremley fluent, but besides that it seems like a pretty good fan game. Most of the problems I have with it will probably get patched in the next update along with an easy mode. But in the current state it is. I enjoyed it.
(also the multiplayer is like REALLY GOOD)"
11940,"Its cool
\"
11941,"this game is a masterpiece. i love playing both of the portal games and even though they didn't make a third game they still make good games. i like exploring with noclip and beating test chambers. i also made my own and i'm proud of making them. i've beaten both games and they're great. if you haven't played portal yet then you should try it. i also have some mods of portal 2 and they're pretty fun too. so what are you waiting for? go play it!
"
11942,"This game takes an already incredible game but then cranks it to 1000. Just buy it if you like Portal. Literally, just buy it. Go ahead and buy it. Buy it already! Buy it, nerd. If you don't buy it I swear-"
11943,This game is really fun to play over and over again. 10/10 made my head explode
11944,its portal. yeah <3
11945,It is the best game ever
11946,space
11947,Killing friends in multiplayer is epic
11948,This game might be the best game ever made honestly
11949,it good
11950,GUN
11951,The positive review is really just a formality. If you have a Steam account you most likely already have the game.
11952,I haven't finished the game yet (my large amount of hours is due to me accidentally leaving my computer on a screensaver for two days straight with the game open) but it really is something special. Both the humor and gameplay of this game is just so clever. BUY IT.
11953,This is probably one of the best games made by Vavle! It is funny and cool
11954,"The most fun I've had ever playing a game both single-player and with friends for the perfect price
it's as shrimple as that"
11955,"I gotta say this game is pretty badass.

Would recommend for 0 IQ players ! XD"
11956,just yes get it now its very good
11957,tbh one of the best games i have played in a while finished it in one sitting.
11958,Cake

11963,the soundtrack just buy it
11964,This is an absolute masterpiece.
11965,good
11966,"its a great game
"
11967,gud
11968,"The puzzles are challenging, but not to hard. The music is nice. The story is nice. The atmosphere of the game is something that no other game offers. Its ominous and makes you feel alone. Looking at it now that its aged by 11 years at the time of this review, its even better. It looks like a 2011 game, and i mean that in a good way. Its refreshing to play this instead of the new AAA game all the time. I really like the way the game looks and the way it feels."
11969,MIND GAMES
11970,I make hole. I go in hole. I come out of other hole. Nice
11971,Genuinely one of the best games ever made
11972,10/10
11973,i wish it didnt end
11974,"I highly recommend this game to all people. My dank friend Ethan plays this game and has to say, ""this game is pretty dank y'all"". That means he highly recommends it. He thinks anyone should play it. Ethan never lies and is good at math so get the game."

11991,it is good
11992,MINECRAFT CREEPER WAS BULLSHIT
11993,"This game should have no replay value, but somehow over the years I've definitely played this game through it's entirety over 50 times over multiple platforms and I've somehow never gotten tired of it. And that's not even beginning to take into account community test chambers and coop, which add so much to the game and make it one of the best games of all time, and one of my favorite games of all time. A must have for anyone that enjoys fun in any way, shape, or form."
11994,one of the best games i've ever played

12008,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's so funny and entertaining, and every puzzle was fun to complete. The story and everything is fantastic, and so is the voice acting. It's very different from the first Portal, but in a way that expands on everything. This game is incredible, and everyone should buy it. After getting every achievement, I can safely say that this is one of the best games I've ever played."

12030,"A genuine classic game. Brilliant and gorgeous story and it genuinely impressed me for a 2011 Source game. limited HUD brings you further into the game and with the Steam Workshop, this game has near-unlimited replayability. A damn shame Valve never makes a third game."
12031,"Play it alone for the single player story, play it with a friend for the co-op challenge and fun!"

12168,"I want to sincerely apologize to Valve and the entire Portal community for skipping out on this franchise for the last decade. Idk what I was thinking, 

That out of the way, portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The writing, voice acting, animation, gameplay, physics, sound design, all top notch.

It’s also just the little things that are easy to ignore that makes it such an enjoyable experience, like how seamlessly the game renders as you go between portals, the minor soundtrack changes as you fly from a catapult or use gel, all the extra dialogue and voice lines for the turrets, it’s that attention to detail that defines valve IMO, and what allows both this and all their other games to hold up to the test of time.

You should buy Portal 1&2 NOW."

12211,Very fun game! Like nothing you've played before.
12212,"Tried online, i now have a burning hatred for my freind. Fun game"
12213,"This is probably the most personal review I've ever written. We all know this game with its puzzles and mechanics is a masterpiece - but there is far more to it imo! Last year I cooped the game with a guy I had in my steam friends list for about 6 years. The coop was so nice and entertaining that we decided to meet in RL. And it turned out that RL teamwork was just as awesome as our in-game coop. For half a year we've been a couple now and we will be moving together soon. So, if anyone ever tries to tell you steam is not a dating platform (wether you want to hear that or not) - in this case it was.  Best dating game I ever played! Thanks for the awesome job Valve!"

12224,"Amazing graphics, wonderful game idea, the [i]only[/i] problem I have with the game personally is that it has been confirmed that they will not will not make a third release. but, while this disappoints me very much, i feel like this game is rather worth the money. I do say, the game can get boring after about 50 hours of playtime. But that's my personal opinion. you might get 1 hour out of it, or 100. The incredible amount of lore makes sure that around every corner, you get a surprise. The adventures of Chell, Wheatly, and GLaDOS(and POTaTOS) is pure epicness."
12225,"good game
"
12226,"""This is the part where I kill you"" wheatley said going to kill you ""This is the part where he kills you"" the potato on your portal gun says."
12227,"It's an incredible game, with more varied level design and a more intriguing storyline than the previous game."

Long live PORTAL and give us another please! #ILOVEALLTHINGSHALFLIFE p.s. play the single player campaign all the way first before embarking with your trusty friend on the co-op.

12290,"Like the last game, but better in most ways. Just amazing, perfect graphics. One problem, it starts to wear old. I appreciate the longer campaign, but it seems they didn't know what the do with it, so they decided to add slimes. Blue makes you jump, orange increases your speed, and, later on, white allows you to put portals on non-portal-able surfaces. This makes simple puzzles unnecessarily complicated, and doesn't feel like I'm playing portal at these moments. This is my only gripe; everything else: graphics, plot, soundtrack, gameplay, and sound design, is great. The online co-op mode is kind of iffy, and I'm not as a big of a fan of the bonus content this time around."
12291,Yeah.
12292,"the cake is a lie, like if you get the reference"

12305,"This is my favourite game of all time. Perfection from top to bottom. Funny, tragic, mindbending and did I mention funny? When you're done you'll have a different experience playing it, but not a worse. Replaying it makes you feel smart and cool whilst flying through the chambers. 5/5. Love it."

12313,"Make your friends cringe by killing them in coop
Overall
Game is cool"
12314,"As with every masterpiece that Valve has released, words cannot do enough justice to the groundbreakting development of this series and portal mechanics in general. I could wax eloquent about how much this blew my mind, and especially pairing mind-blowing mechanics up with an equally gripping story makes we feel like I hit the jackpot. One con I will admit is that the test levels felt somewhat linear, not providing the freedom to find other wacky solutions that was the focus of the first instalment. The community levels are the icing on the cake though - after all, I can play even more Portal. All in all, I will simply end with this: BUY IT RIGHT NOW!"
12315,hal life borelis fortnit
12316,Timeless classic. Still a 10/10 even after 11 years.
12317,"This game is so good. The puzzles are really fun to do, but the best part of this game, is the humor. There is no game that can be as comedic as this game. Make sure you play the first game before this one tho. The first game is also really good but I think this one is slightly better."

12362,"This game is so fun to play and is really interesting, the fact that there is a coop mode is amazing, you can play with your friends and try to beat all the test chambers. Speed runners like Msushi have a blast playing this game. :D"

12385,portals are fun
12386,portal
12387,"Portal 2 is the best game I had the opportunity to play this year. It interests the player from the beginning and stays like that to its final minutes. It entertains with great, humorous dialogue, intrigues with compelling puzzles - as a result you keep staring at the screen and forget about the world around you. Valve's newest game is also a well-written product with great attention to detail."
12388,"Space to jump, jump into space."
12389,"I love this game, it's a classic for a reason. Great puzzles, great story, fun physics and co-op abilities with the new Portal 2."

12392,Very good. Period.

12394,"A classic.

Puzzle game that is a great way to have fun with others."
12395,"play it
please just play it"
12396,Even better then the original
12397,"good game dammm
"
12398,"Portal 2 is honestly the best game I have played in my entire life. Its a fantastic mix of story and engaging game play. It is super easy to replay and it has a test chamber designer and multiplayer that you can honestly sink so many hours into. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys nearly any type of game as its fun even for people who don't like the typical puzzle game. 10/10 ""Cave Johnson, were done here""

PS(low hour count on the game is because I switched accounts after 50+ hours)"
12399,Great game. I always heard good things about this game and it was all true.
12400,"Amazing game higly recommend its a great stragtey game portal go brr
"
12401,One of the best games ever. Nuff said.
12402,makes my brain hurt
12403,Very good
12404,"Probably the BEST game I've ever played. Not my favorite, but best. The puzzles are greatly designed as well as the environments. The dialogue is great and funny and the amazing voice acting just adds to it. The story is great for a game where you shoot Portals as and A.I. insults you for most of the time. On top of all that it includes a co op mode with a campaign specifically designed for 2 players. And all that for a very cheap price (especially when it's on sale). 9.9/10"

12406,"It's one of the best games of all time, I cannot recommend it enough, there's almost no flaws with the game"

it's an excellent valve game, the main story, the coop, the puzzles, the secrets, the story, the dialogue, the mechanics, the gameplay, the music, the art style

It's all amazing, portal 2 is amazing

12451,"I love portal so much, and portal 2 is also good. Recommended."
12452,"I don't think Portal 2 is as legendary as it was heralded to be back in its prime, but it was still very good. 

I think the best parts of the game are the writing and the fact that it doesn't overstay its welcome. Puzzles are frequently in that sweet-spot of challenging but not frustrating."
12453,great game
12454,"There is nothing to dislike, this is a fantastic game. The critical thinking and problem solving make it really fun, and the fact that there is also a co-op is great."
12455,"Portal 2 is considered to be one of the best puzzle games of the 2010's and my god, I could not agree more. 
While I do have some gripes with some minor elements of the game, I personally enjoy this game lots and love to replay it.

Firstly, the cast of characters in this game is tight while also being a little more loose compared to Portal 1. GladOS, lacking her cores from the first game, is actually quite alive and cynical compared to her cold, artificial presence in Portal 1. Wheatley serves as the nice counterpart to GladOS as he serves as our companion for some... of the game, guiding us to take her down despite constantly being a klutz. Wonder why that's the case? And finally, we have one of my favorite characters in gaming ever, CAVE JOHNSON voiced by none other than J.K. Simmons. Cave is the perfect character that narrates the second third of the game that balances witty, one-liner CEO talk with a sad and depressing story of Aperture falling from grace back in it's hayday. Only someone like J.K. could play a role like that so well. I mean, look at Whiplash.

Secondly, the game mechanics are spot on. Both building on and expanding topics covered in Portal 1, Portal 2 updates it's mechanics to fit a longer experience and slowly, I mean SLOWLY, introduces them throughout the WHOLE GAME, keeping you engaged whenever a new material is thrown into the test chamber with you. The satisfaction of soaring through a portal or the bounce of a gel makes me marvel at the smoothness and creativity of it all. I also appreciate the addition of light movement towards portals to help with correction trajectories.

Finally, the soundtrack and atmosphere of Portal 2 fits so well for the story it tries to tell. While Portal 1's atmosphere was artificial and science-fiction, Portal 2 opts for a post-apocalyptic feeling both in visuals, using overgrown plants and fallen shrapnel to make the place look worse for wear, and also in the music, abandoning the cold, ambient droning tones like the sounds of fluorescent light bulbs to an industrial, sci-fi and gloomy sound palette. It's a nice contradiction to what Portal 1 represents and helps make the game feel larger in life.

However, my only gripe with this game comes from my constant tendency for 100% games. If you want to 100% Portal 2, you better have a friend who wants to as well because a quarter of the achievements in total are for co-op and definitely require teamwork, dedication, and maybe buying someone a copy of the game just to help. While it might come off as petty, the fact that one of the achievements in this game involves completing the tutorial for Portal 2 co-op with someone who has never touched it and you have had to complete it fully is quite absurd. 

Overall, Portal 2 is quite the spectacle in gaming. Combining a myriad of sci-fi, comedy and puzzle aspects together into one big pot of Aperture Science goop for you to test with. It's surely worth the hype and anyone wanting to experience an action-packed, brainteaser puzzle game should BUY THIS NOW. 

P.S: When you finish the game, DON'T SKIP OUT ON THE MODS TO THIS GAME. There are some quite talented fans of the game who have created full games themselves based on mechanics of Portal 2. Check out Portal Stories: Mel or Aperture Tag for a start."

12458,"One of the best video games ever, this is a must play game for all gamers."
12459,"Very fun! Portal 2 is a fantastic example of how to make a game. It is clear that Valve put plenty of thought into making this game. The gameplay, puzzles, writing, and art direction are superb. This game took every element of it's predecessor and built on it wonderfully, culminating in a gaming masterpiece that holds up to this day.

I highly recommend this game. Every person who calls himself a gamer needs to add this to his library. I rate it a 9/10!"

12547,One of the most classic games of all time. Great single player story and puzzles that takes about 5-10 hours to beat depending on how quick you can solve them. Then add in a co-op that adds a good 5 more hours at least. Then all of the community maps and which make this game have a ton to offer for the price. Or wait until a steam sale and get it even cheaper.
12548,Charming & challenging; great coop.

And gladyos as usual was irritating not likeable. Caroline and cave johnson also had nice character development. And of course the main part which pulled me to this game the puzzles, They were not the hardest but were fun to solve.Definitely recommend to anyone/everyone who wants a good game to play among the trash games that come out."

This is the best game I've played in a really long time, the puzzles are fun and can be challenging, but they're just a backdrop for the surprisingly in-depth story and hilarious characters. Wheatley and GLaDOS are just amazing and its really dumb how much betrayal and heartbreak I felt from a little eyeball robot.

With only really only two ever-present characters at a time, it's boggling how many characters there are and how important they are throughout. An all star cast from J.K. Simmons to Stephen Merchant, fantastic story telling from start to end.

As for the multiplayer, it's one of my favorites. None of the puzzles are overly designed or made too easy that only a person needs to figure it out."

🙂My 𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 Opinion🙃

This is the BEST valve game so far (please make portal 3 xd) an awesomely crafted story with deep lore reveals for the portal universe as well as some hints or Easter eggs from other games such as TF2 and half-life.
The game mechanics are super fun, new and well thought as always with tests that force you to think with portals  (if anyone tells you that videogames make people dumb, make them play this game and then make fun of them when they don't understand what momentum through portals is)  plus this game's narrative is freaking HILARIOUS with the meme core Wheatley and all the secret dialogues. Just gold

Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but if there is a way to fix it I greatly appreciate someone telling me! Would spare me the money of needing a new headset entirely-"
12743,This game is pretty fun. But be warned the cake IS a lie.
12744,"A must have for any gamer!

the characters are funny and witty, it improves upon the original in so many ways, TONS of new mechanics are added and the enviroments are beautiful!
The best part about it is that not only you can make your own chambers, but with know-how you can make your own portal gun retexture! Yes, you can have a shrek portal gun in this game if you really want to.
It also let the floodgates open to new expansions by the fans to the original with things like portal stories mel and portal reloaded, about 2 or 3 are being made as of writing this, 2022 is gonna be the year of portal in my books!"
12745,Legendary game. The best
12746,portal go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
12747,PORT HOLE
12748,amazing 12/10 top tier game outstanding story great music great game overall
12749,"What's there to say that hasn't been said already?
After all, this is a game that looked at its predecessor, an already 8/10 game with extremely interesting concepts, the only flaw of which was a lack of exploration of its themes and stories, and gives it everything it was missing, and MORE.
This bad boy includes, but is not limited to:
- A gun which lets you shoot wormholes on walls allowing you to travel through the timespace continuum
- Dozens of puzzle elements which all interact with portals and eachother in interesting ways
- Plot twists, plot twists everywhere
- A super tragic, believeable, perfectly revealed story
- 500 gigatons of god tier comedy which still get a smile out of me on the [i] nine nine nine nine       nine nine nine [/i] th playthrough
- Hillarious robot characters, one of which voiced by STEVE MERCHANT
- A way for literally anyone to make a puzzle themselves with the most user-friendly level editor ever created
AND SO MUCH MORE
Buy this game. Now. DO IT. THIS IS A THREAT (jk) (kinda) (do at least watch a play-through of the first though) ok BYYYEEEEEEEEE"

12755,Ive been playing Portal and Portal 2 for years and love it!!
12756,Incredible classic. Has aged extremely well.
12757,good
12758,
12759,"Portal 2 is just flat out fun. The single player is short (about 6-7 hours worth of play time) and isn't as challenging as Portal but it's much more creative and a joy to play. Co-op is incredibly fun and really is the best part about the game.

The only flaws that I can find (and it's a nit pick anyway) are that like the first it is decidedly linear (but the environments are much more open and you don't feel as cramped) and that some of the solutions to the scripted events feel a little overly convenient.

This is a top notch title that's simply fun to play."
12760,"I completed the game a couple days ago, and I believe many will agree with me on the fact that Portal 2 is nothing short of absolutely phenomenal. The puzzles are creative and fun to figure out, the story line is interesting yet dark, the characters are hilarious, and Want You Gone absolutely slaps. It's no wonder that it's the highest rated game on Steam."
12761,It is cool.
12762,good game

12766,yes
12767,Finished co-op with a friend no walkthrough videos or help. Took us a couple of months. Few hours weekly. Loads of fun.
12768,The perfect sequel
12769,Increible.
12770,Great game overall! Although it did take me 13 hours to complete it first try.

12795,"How the hell have I not reviewed this game already, I've been playing it for like 8 years. I've been getting back into it recently so I can finally 100% it, and just realized I hadn't reviewed it. I mean, I love this game. Possibly one of the most influential games in my life. It might not be my favorite game of all time anymore, but it's definitely still up there. Just a game design masterclass everywhere you look, not to even touch the hella funny and well done story. Love this game. If somehow you're a freak who hasn't played it, get on it."
12796,great design and you can still have fun even after completing it
12797,funne

12807,I haven't reviewed Portal 2 yet? I can't believe myself. I sincerely apologize for my lack of a review recommending this game. Here is my review. I hope this makes up for my lack of a review recommending this game: I highly recommend this game.

12813,Great game for people who love to solve puzzles adds a whole new twist to solving puzzles and with the addition of Co-op and workshop maps this game is crazy fun.
12814,buy this. play with friend. play solo. be happy. puzzl game
12815,"Probably one of the best games of all time.
It has a great story and new mechanics kept the puzzles interesting.
$10 is amazingly cheap for how good of game this is and how many hours of playtime it gives.
I've only played through once but it for sure has plenty of replay value in addition to the extra levels and multiplayer levels.
10/10 must have for anyone who plays games."

12848,genuinely the best game ever
12849,"This was a triumph
I'm making a note here; ""Huge success""
It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction
Aperture Science:
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are
Still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart,
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now, these points of data
Make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned-
For the people who are
Still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you?
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke *Haha - Fat Chance*
Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist
Look at me: still talking
When there's science to do
When I look out there,
It makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive
And believe me I am
Still alive
I'm doing science and I'm
Still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm
Still alive
While you're dying I'll be
Still alive
And when you're dead I will be
Still alive
Still alive"
12850,Epic game yes portal cool me go yes
12851,played it on xbox 360 years ago and playing it again brought back so much nostalgia. I love this game and it is still good.
12852,"This is the best puzzle game I have ever played the story is amazing and I loved every bit of it.  I can admit the gameplay seems a bit boring but once you complete more puzzles it gets interesting and fun all at the same time. The music in the game is good, but overall game just makes you use your brain.
I would recommend to play this game 10/10"

I try my best to figure out tough ones, and I still got it, and developers put a lot of effort into this game. The price for this is a game worth it. also, I play this game a lot to test my friends IQ or mine Lol"

12960,i
12961,"Wow. I was already familiar with the story line, but the way it's revealed in the game is elegant AF. And, the game play is a wonderful mix of skills and pacing. There are so many reasons this game deserves its status as a classic."

13008,I like the part where you carry a potato for 2 hours
13009,"Just finished this game in just 2 days.

The story.
The comedy
And even the soundtrack, made me think that as soon as I finished it, i was saddened to realize that this was one of the best games, that I genuinely loved playing.

I see people are commenting about a third game, but honestly, I would prefer saying that this is the best closure to the series.

If you're reading this and haven't played it, please, buy this game and try it out yourself. Even if you hate puzzles, just pat yourself on the shoulder every time you will complete a chamber, and when you finally beat the game, you will feel proud of yourself for finishing it."
13010,good game and very lmao
13011,"Incredibly fun, especially with friends :D"
13012,A really good game although the level styles repeat.
13013,portal puzzles
13014,for the bri'ish ball
13015,Bought the bundle... i prefered this one over portal 1 because of wheatley
13016,great game
13017,"Portal redefined the entire world of gaming with it's intricate puzzles and portal system. Portal 2 just adds onto that, and it is amazing. Co-op is fun as well, it's just a second campaign you play with a friend."
13018,"Oh my oh wow. This game is GREAT.

Portal 2 is a sequel to the puzzle game Portal. Portal is a game about portals which basically teleport you around. Portal 2 is a great sequel. The game is longer, and it has more story and characters, and puzzles. The story in this game is longer and more thought out. The first portal game was more of puzzles. The only story you would get is from the robot AI (spoilers: [spoiler] GlaDOS [/spoiler]) or from the scribbles on the wall. In Portal 2, the story is more immersive. The scenes are very cinematic and detailed that, in my opinion, this game looks like it was released in 2020. Overall, this game is great and I think you should buy it.

I love Valve games."
13019,Great Puzzles! even better jokes!
13020,"Amazing game! The concept is so simple yet so complex and fun. Like GLaDOS said, the simplest answer is usually the correct one."
13021,poggers
13022,i cooked my brain

13028,i beat it
13029,No brainer if you liked Portal 1.  More puzzles.  More GlaDOS.  More humor.

13037,"I adore this game. Witty humor, futuristic apocalypse, and puzzles? Playing this game as a kid absolutely formed my choices of games I play now, and I love coming back to this one and playing it again. There's always something new to notice on a second run of the game."
13038,"Honestly, its alot of fun when you have someone to play co-op with."
13039,Cake
13040,"Absolutely god-tier game.

-Good Story
-Difficult puzzles at times, at least for me, but they were never too challenging
-Nice sound design
-Graphics still hold up for sure
-Gave me more than enough frame rate

I feel that everyone should play this game, for me it almost filled some weird whole in my PC gaming experience, both the portal games, especially Portal 2, are absolutely fantastic and I wish we had more games like this today, I mean, there are some I might be able to think of, but not a whole lot off the top of my head. Is it just me, or does it feel like in recent years, game companies seem to care less about good story telling and more about just flashy graphics that kill your frame rate. Probably just me. But I still feel most modern day games don't have some sort of quality Portal has, I can't quite name it though. This Portal experience has been some of the best gaming times I've had in my life, would definitely replay through both if a third one came out, and then I'd play the third one. Thanks for reading, and goodnight. No, like I should really get to bed, I'm typing this at 11:10 PM and I have to get up at 6:00 AM, so goodnight."
13041,Ah I waited way too long to finally play this. Amazing sequel! Puzzles flow very nicely and the difficulty curve felt great. Top tier soundtrack and voice acting once again. Whens Portal 3!?
13042,"much fun, wheatley is the best"
13043,MooCowz really likes this.
13044, Please learn how to count to 3 so I can see more of this

13061,"great game, absolute childhood classic, very difficult at times but always stays entertaining"
13062,"Fun game, rightfully a classic, that easily got me thinking more than most games on the market at the moment."
13063,"Portal 2 is just flat out fun. The single player is short (about 6-7 hours worth of play time) and isn't as challenging as Portal but it's much more creative and a joy to play. Co-op is incredibly fun and really is the best part about the game.

The only flaws that I can find (and it's a nit pick anyway) are that like the first it is decidedly linear (but the environments are much more open and you don't feel as cramped) and that some of the solutions to the scripted events feel a little overly convenient.

This is a top notch title that's simply fun to play."
13064,"Rating: 
8.7/10

Portal 2 is a fantastic game you should have in your library. The lush overgrown aesthetic of the map and its charming mix of delightful storytelling, all converge into a bodacious concoction. You’ll find yourself wanting to stop and take in the scenery the world has to offer while going about your quest.
The puzzles are not too difficult and are incorporated very well; they don't seem like a hassle to do, but much more like a refresher while keeping you engaged. After all your troubles you are rewarded for your accomplishment with a beautifully composed song, the perfect icing on the cake.
All this makes Portal 2 an astounding game that you should definitely buy. Simply put, you have to play it.

13074,"Any gamer, every gamer should play this."
13075,"Play a semi-rich story with portals or have some fun with your friend? Valve got you. Portal 2 is the game for you. If you like flying, bhopping, having fun, emerging into the story, speerunning, go on."
13076,glados kept calling me fat
13077,"the puzzles and story are incredible, and the atmosphere of ""you dont belong here"" is heavy once you exit the testing rooms themselves and explore the back areas."

13086,"i got this game on sale and in a pack with portal 1. I haven't beaten this game yet, but I love it, the story, the puzzles, everything. Even if it wasn't on sale, I would totally spend the money. Just, make sure you play the first game beforehand."

13111,I absolutely love it. I love how good the game is made and I really like that they let YOU think instead of them doing it for you. I cannot believe why I didn't play this before
13112,"Portal 1 was more of an experiment than a game, Portal 2 is a full fledged game with story + coop which are both absolutely worth playing"
13113,"An absolutely amazing game, whether you play alone or with someone , you're gonna love every second of it!"
13114,yes

13136,gud game!!!!
13137,Good co op game
13138,Very cool game but there cold be a portal 3.
13139,ну чё сказать с другом прошли её классная игра
13140,good
13141,Very cool
13142,Cuub
13143,One of the best games valve has ever released.
13144,yes
13145,I switched portals and my friend fell into the water. 10/10 would kill friend again
13146,good sequel
13147,"very good game
"
13148,it was fun & a great addition to the first
13149,"OMG DELICIOUS

"
13150,best puzzle game. Getting harder each chapter but yeah best game.
13151,looks better than new pokemon game and this game came out 11 years ago
13152,"What's not to like about this game? Portal 2 contains some of the best jokes I've heard in video games, and as well as being one of Steam's top games, it's also an amazing puzzle game, featuring cool singleplayer and multiplayer maps. And did I mention that it has Steam Workshop support? And that it's on sale quite often for low prices?"
13153,"good gamne where is portal 3
"
13154,best game on steam
13155,"Its fun... I like how it is about puzzles and things, but sometimes its sad because you have three people and only 2 can play at the same time. If you don't like puzzles, then don't get it. 7/10"
13156,great game
13157,mhmhmhmhmh
13158,10/10
13159,its very pog champ epic
13160,I can't even think of a joke review. This is a masterpiece.
13161,Nothin more satisfying than Wheatly's screams of terror ;)
13162,holy
13163,"SPOILER ALERT: Just finished the game and just oh my god, one of the best games I have ever played definitely top 10 or something. I just honestly feel bad for Wheatley, I feel like he wasn't evil but his new body changed him. Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this game. 11/10!!"
13164,"Portal 2 is literally one of the most polished, detailed, and most well written games I’ve ever played. Even a decade later it’s still more fun and more cleverly designed than many modern games, and it’s a true testiment to how amazing Valve can be when they actually give a crap. The small details of random panels jerking and attempting to fold back into place make it truly feel like a run down testing facility, and the dialogue is more funny and entertaining than most shows I’ve watched. Despite there only being a few characters, they all have loads of personality (excluding Chell), and even the mostly mute Peabody and Atlas are filled to the brim with character. The story is super cool, and perfectly bounces off of the story of the first game. I could spend paragraphs and paragraphs describing the excellency of this game, but it speaks for itself. This game is a must buy no matter the price, which is even better considering how cheap the game is. This is one of the few games that I’d give a proper 11/11 chunks of pure marble."
13165,"so, I managed to fix the game's audio bug, however it needs to be done every other time you open the game. you open the console, and type ""snd_rebuildaudiocache"". you then wait a while, then sign out of your computer, DO NOT SHUT DOWN. you will then log back in, and open the game. it SHOULD then be fixed.
now, if you don't know what the ""console"" that I'm talking about is, you need to go into the ""options"" tab in the game, ""go into the ""keyboard"" tab, then look for an option I believe to be labeled ""developer console"". it is automatically set to disabled. enable it, then type the command I listed above, and follow the listed instructions, and that SHOULD be it.
Other than this audio issue, the game is great."
13166,"Oh My GOD, I have no words. I LOVE this game so much, the story is amazing! The Co-Op is amazingly executed, and the limitless potential of the Perpetual Testing Initiative is so much fun! If you loved the original Portal, this one is SO much better!"
13167,i liked the part where he kills you
13168,A true modern classic for everybody except those with motion sickness
13169,p
13170,bruh
13171,single player is fun and relaxing.(havent done multi yet) Funny storyline as well. Def worth the buy.
13172,funny lil robot dude with an accent
13173,ALL TIME CLASSIC!!!!!
13174,tis fun
13175,Just a game you need to have played in your life! its soo good even tho this game is old its graphics still are amazing def on of my fav games ever!

13179,"hmm hmm
"
13180,dym
13181,"Yes. 10/10, 5 stars, one whole banana. This game is TO THIS DAY the best game ever.
"
13182,"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have
been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly
increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in
“advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society,
have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings
to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and
have inflicted severe damage on the natural world."
13183,"good
 ok"
13184,the cake is a lie
13185,we need portal 3
13186,fun game
13187,"a classic. puzzle and story and eerie setting and funny [strike]Dia[/strike]Monologues. new math has to be formulated, because this is 11 of 10."
13188,"The most approachable FPS ever made.  To top it off, it may be one of the best games ever made. The additional mechanics such as the gel and light bridges/tunnels are seamlessly added.  I feel very few games will stand the test of time as well as the Portal series."
13189,sick af
13190,"Lots of nostalgic memories, playing this game when I was but a wee lad. One of Valve’s best."
13191,"Portal 2
oof what to say about this 
It's a 10/10 from me, I love this game because Valve made it that's why they are the rockstar of 1st person shooters"
13192,"Masterpiece. What else is there to say? Perfect conclusion for the story with new challenging levels to solve. And if that is not enough you can always try new levels from steam workshop. And do you know what is even better? You can do all of this with your friend in co-op as well!

So, what are you waiting for? Price for this game can go all the way down to 2€ during the sales! You won't be able to find better value anywhere on Steam!"
13193,da
13194,best game
13195,"Honestly, I'm just a kid. I don't know much about life, and maybe there's a better game I just haven't played yet, but if I had a gun to my head I'd say my favorite game was Portal 2. I remember the day my uncle set up my steam account, 8 year old me was like ""It's a game, it can't be that good."" But now, many years later, I think about how good I have it to have such a good game. My uncle has a job now, which is no fun, so I never play with him anymore and that's sad."
13196,"best game ever i listened to a robot call me fat, ugly and garbage for 4 hours it was so exciting"
13197,"A pretty good game for 2011. 
Good story challenging gameplay,
And the repulsion gel section is INCREDIBLE

A good game to play if you like puzzels
WAY better than portal 1"
13198,hell ya
13199,portal glaDOS
13200,this game is God+++++
13201,haha portals go brrrrrrr
13202,"muy bueno very good jeje salu2
"
13203,"I’m gonna voice the unpopular opinion here and say the original game was better. Obviously, it was cheaper. If you just care about puzzles, then get both this game and the original. But if you care about atmosphere and ambience, this game is a big step down. For me, a big element in making Portal what it was was the mysterious, silent, and slightly creepy environment in which you worked in. Cameras watching your every move, but never a soul behind those glazed windows. Occasionally a sign of something being off. A panel was removed, revealing a crawl space where it appeared some deranged person had been living. They also used the ambience found in Ravenholm. Portal two may have some similar looking environments…but now they’re spoiled by Glados, wheatley, or Johnson yelling over the intercom and jabbering constantly. Nevermind the obnoxious and ham fisted cake and companion cube references. Less can be more, and this game is proof of that."
13204,yes
13205,"One of the greatest games I’ve played on PC. Story is amazing and I would love to play this for the first time again.
"
13206,"One of my best adventures in the videogame world.
The game is just overwhelmingly good, no wonder it's considered a piece of art.
The place that was the old laboratory now was the huge facility turned onto chaos and destruction.
The voicelines, the music, the choice of colors... everything.
One of the games you must play in order to consider you a gamer."
13207,"I love this game so much. I think it was my first real video game, and it's still so much fun after all these years. You can play by yourself on a fully developed single player, and with a friend on a just as developed co-op mode. The game also has a great modding community and has hundreds of custom maps that can add just as many hours to your play time. With all this in mind, I give Portal 2 a 10/10."
13208,its very fun and stisfying
13209,"
“All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager!

13213,"You are missing a lot if you didn't play this masterpiece of a franchise.
Really good and entertaining story and ending.
Also one of the best coop experiences, just buy it."
13214,I liked to curse the sudden but inevitable betrayal.
13215,i like co op mode and i like single player. i wish there was a way to survive in co op mode and try and escape cuse its more interesting and fun.
13216,I wish I lose all my memories up until I first played this.
13217,makes my brain hurt but its a good game
13218,I shitted

13229,game good. play. pls.
13230,"One of the best stories of any game i played, one of my favorite games of all time."
13231,"Well, I've played for 3,299 hours and writing this is the only way to stop Steam from constantly asking me if I'd recommend this game. I think the hours speak for themselves. The Community/workshop maps are an awesome supply of fun and relaxation."

13236,I love the turrets :)
13237,Old game but fun asf 10/10

13243,One or the best valve games      : D
13244,good shit
13245,potato
13246,"For a game that was created in 2011 it's really fun and addicting. The story is great and the workshop map option is amazing, the multiplayer is also great. This game also doesn't require a high end pc which makes it accessible to all players so that's cool. I'll say that this game is a 9.5/10 because it took me and my friend fifteen minutes just to disable the microphones for multiplayer."
13247,ukh jhnfxgny good game rlly gfdhugfedgberhjkabger
13248,<3
13249,make a 3rd game
13250,"Honestly here for the characters. The gameplay is fun, and most of the time its simple enough where you are not slaving at it for hours, yet it has cool mechanics you have to use. Very puzzle-y, but also lovely dialogue and story."
13251,buy it now
13252,"A satisfying and fun single player mode, hilariously enjoyable co-op mode, crazy amount of gameplay and puzzles with a built-in (but limited) puzzle editor w/ steam workshop implementation- It's one of the greatest games I've ever played and would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a fun experience that caters to pretty much everyone in some way or another.

10/10, did recommend
Cuz steam wanted me to"
13253,port hole
13254,"One of the best games, like literally."
13255,its a good game if you like puzzles
13256,"is a masterpiece, you can play it with friends online and is good"
13257,way better than portal 1 and portal 1 was pretty good
13258,"The basic mechanic (retained from the first game) is so ingeniously simple that the game almost makes itself. What I mean is, the entire game-play loop is exhausted in the portal mechanic itself, leaving more or less the entire development process for Valve to do what they do best: wonderfully creative and clever level design. Additionally, the script is next-level hilarious and the AI protagonists are pure gold. You can tell the devs had loads of fun making it, and that definitely rubs off on the player. In short, it's a brilliant game, one of the few which transcend their genre: pretty much everyone who plays this will love it, not just fans of puzzle games."
13259,It's Portal.
13260,"its good
"
13261,"it good

13277,good game yes yes
13278,Trust Nobody In Co-op
13279,"all trust gone, great game for new friends and old friends, very chaotic"
13280,"I've loved Portal 1 and Portal 2 takes the idea to the next level, adding other special objects and the coop chambers that are simply amazing
I also enjoy the fact that it runs perfectly on my average non gaming laptop"
13281,"unique experience, top notch gameplay and great world set up.  Puzzles are superb"
13282,Really fun game! Still excellent after all years.

13291,"There's a reason this is one of the most downloaded games on steam yknow, this is one of the best games of all time!"
13292,Better than Avengers Endgame
13293,"One of the best games ever made, The portal games are games I come back to often because they are so good. The nostalgia I get from playing these games is unreal. I get memories of me sneaking down stairs and watching my older brother play the game in the computer room from the stairs on summer nights when it was past my bedtime. Just one of the best memories that this game has given me over the 10 plus years the game has been out."
13294,ta piola con los compas
13295,"its just a good fucking series, leave me alone, and also FUCKING UPDATE TF2 VALVE, GOD DAMN"
13296,I so cool!
13297,best game of all time imo
13298,this game is a masterpiece if you have a pc play this
13299,"One of my favorite game ever, I'm a big fan of puzzle game and Portal 2 is just perfect. The story is great, the level design is great, the gameplay is great, the puzzles are great, the characters are great, EVERYTHING is great. If you consider buying it, BUY IT NOW what are you waiting for stop reading this review the cost like 3€."
13300,poral
13301,"fun
for good easy game time"
13302, Funny portal loops
13303,"It builds upon the airtight foundation of Portal with more puzzles, more story, and more comedic dialogue. Even so, it suffers from a little bloat which hurts the pacing. But it's a Valve game, so it still stands above the rest of the industry as a shining beacon of artistry. The co-op campaign was a lot of fun to get through with my friend. I will probably replay it at point."

13359,portal
13360,"Great game. It builds n the original Portal so much while still keeping the same tone and feeling. The environments are amazing, Aperture Science seems like a never ending warehouse in this game and that is just so cool. The added mechanics such as the lasers, bridges, gravity funnels, and gels were really fun to play around with, I just wish there were more levels that utilized them. The voice acting is amazing in this game, especially from Wheatley and Cave Johnson. All in all I think this was a better game tan Portal 1 and I hope one day they'll do a sequel to this one, who knows."

13511,"This game saved my life.

I am 51.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.

So far I haven't found a fix, I've looked on Steam Forums and tried everything everyone else suggested and it still isn't working, I cannot recommend this game as it is currently unplayable.
EDIT: Managed to get it to launch by creating a new administrator account on my PC, not sure why this fixed it but hopefully it stays fixed. Changed my review to recommend."

10/10"

13557,my brain burns
13558,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

13559,awsome
13560,"Even after over 10 years, this game still holds up well in so many regards. Not to mention the amount of user created levels, basically giving you an infinite amount of content. Highly recommend this to anyone into story/puzzle games of the sort."

13562,King turret exists

13585,"Even though I am 6 years late to the party, this game is still incredibly fresh, i even came back to this game after seeing a bunch of videos, but if i return to this game after years, i would definetly have a blast to see how fast i can get through the puzzles without getting a brain fart. The story is why i kept loving this game over the years."

13589,"This is easily an 9/10. The story is engaging, the gameplay smooths out Portal 1's (very few) rough edges, and the ""lab overrun by nature"" aesthetic is a feast for the eyes. Portal 1 is a better video game than Portal 2 (I think Portal 2's narrative functions in spite of its story rather than in harmony with it like Portal 1) but Portal 2 is still a great game. The co-op and test chamber creator bump this from an 8 to a 9 for me. Play it ASAP."
13590,surprisingly detailed and incredible story
13591,"Wait, this was made over ten years ago? This looks better than AAA in 2022. The gameplay and story, and comedy, and, well, EVERYTHING, is spot on. Buy it. Go on. Buy it."

13605,"Feels satisfying that I completed this series after watching my friend play it. Once again, I am disappointed that Valve dropped this entire series for now reason but that doesn't take away from how amazing this game is. The puzzles are a stuff up from the first game and I too got satisfaction from completing the tests.
See you later, space Wheatley."

13611,This game is worth it. Buy it. Spend all your money on it. It is not disappointing.
13612,"really great story and fun puzzles

13613,"FANTASTIC sequel to a fantastic game. The storyline gets the attention it deserves, and new puzzle mechanics are introduced. The co-op is fantastic, and I've played it 3 times through and had a great time each time. The portal count mode brings a whole new challenge to it, as well.

My only real complaint is that because they tried to axe the cheese strategies, the levels can occasionally feel like THE PORTAL GOES HERE. It's not really an avoidable side effect, though."
13614,this game is a great sequel to the great game portal. i recommend playing it twice or at least thrice.
13615,I liked it

13700,i like all the cool gun skins in this game
13701,I liked GLaDOS.
13702,This is an awesome game i would seriously recommend it
13703,"I played this game with my friends and we were laughing for HOURS! The main game still holds up story wise and gameplay wise. The mechanics feel solid and the price of the game is fenominal! When me and my buddy were playing co-op it was so funny! Getting mad at each other, pranking each other was just a good experience. We were both main console players but switching to PC really makes gaming more enjoyable. Would recommend this game to anyone and a buddy of theirs! 10/10!"
13704,"never heard of it
"
13705,"As good as the single-player story is, the co-operative is the real highlight of Portal 2. The beginning of the co-op picks up right after the end of the single-player game, giving you and your partner control of two robots, and serves as a continuation of the story of Aperture Science. It features fewer characters than the single-player mode but is still filled with enough sharp writing, deadpan jokes and absurd humor to keep you entertained between puzzle sections and provide motivation toward an end goal. Better yet, instead of simply recycling puzzle designs from the single-player portion, the inclusion of another player significantly alters the way you need to think.

In Portal 2, communication is vital to success.

That's because each of the robotic co-operative characters carries a portal gun, which means two guns and four portals. Valve takes full advantage of the increased capacity for dimensional holes by raising the level of challenge and coordination required. As is obvious if you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success.

Getting through can be frustrating, especially if you're playing with someone you don't know, because there's no diffusion of responsibility here. You can't hide in a corner and wait for someone else to do all the work. The contributions of each person involved are plain to see, and Valve's developed numerous tools to help make communication as smooth as possible.

You can set context-sensitive markers on parts of the environment to wordlessly indicate where a portal should be placed, where a partner should move, and even trigger a countdown clock to synchronize when switches should be hit or buttons pressed. The indicators may feel superfluous at first, but once you're setting up four portal chains of light bridges to block turret fire or redirecting edgeless safety cubes as they fly through open air over bottomless pits, it's obvious how useful they can be. Barely a moment will go by in silence while playing Portal 2 with another, except when you're listening to GLaDOS belittle your intelligence with endearing sarcasm."
13706,amazing!
13707,"I will name my fourth born ""Portal 2"""
13708,Portal 2 dude (⊙ˍ⊙)
13709,"First game I've actually loved, best campaign I've had so far in any games. Me and my mate have just completed the full co-op campaign and it was great, time to continue the story now though.

If there's any other games that have a campaign as good as this then feel free to let me know because I would love to check it out"

13712,"this game is very fun!
i like how the game just guide the player to the objectives by using only the environment
the puzzels are great not to hard but there is a challenge with makes it more fun.
the story is one of my favorite parts of the game, because the game did a great job of character developing"

13806,"Even though I'm not huge into puzzle games, this is one of my all-time favourites. Beautiful masterpiece. Music? Fits accordingly with atmosphere and setting. Story? Brilliant. Mechanics? Fun. Game? Yes. Who wouldn't want to team up the sassy robot you murdered and then rebooted accidentally? Characters are very 3-D and loveable. I need to play Co-Op more, but I did years ago with my brother and I remember having a blast. I need to replay it more. You need to. Everyone needs to."

13855,i liked everything lol
13856,"This game contains lots of fun with portal gun and it became more fun if you have ""friend"". But it still fun and enjoyable to play trying to understand what happened to apperture science and the background story of this company. 9/10 - Hurkly"
13857,i dont need to explain why this is good
13858,10/10... that's all i gotta say... it's amazing
13859,aardappel
13860,i liked it
13861,This game is really amazing! good story plot amazing gameplay
13862,vgf
13863,I love it it's a really fun game trust me
13864,"This is what I wanted from a sequel: more backstory/lore, new characters and more worldbuilding. This game is significantly longer than the first game. However, it made space for more storytelling, which makes up for it. This is good because the first game (although incredible) didn't explain much lore, so I am really glad this game did."
13865,"It good. Play it!
"
13866,best game created in the history of games
13867,One of the best games
13868,"puzzles with portals and in cooperative, something else to say?"
13869,nice game
13870,Its epic
13871,portal 2 is a decent game to play solo or co-op
13872,I would 100% work for Cave Johnson. He's bat-$#!* crazy and I love every second of him. Game is pretty awesome too.
13873,Oki
13874,One of the greatest games I've ever experienced. A master piece in gameplay and storytelling.
13875,"seriously, my favourite game of all time. Sure it might not be the longest game out there but the charm, the witt and the phenomenal voice acting ill make you continue coming back to it. there's speedrun capabilities and the gameplay itself is puzzling and simultaneously fun too. The ending is one of my favourite in any piece of media ever. 10/10 game and i swear to god if we don't get a sequel i will ACTUALLY steal the Valve from Valve HQ."
13876,I love this game.
13877,still holds up in 2022 10/10
13878,good game
13879,It's pretty fun and I feel smart after completing these puzzles. They arent anything too hard but they do make you think for a few minutes. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first Portal and want more puzzles with a bit more humor
13880,e
13881,This game is great 9 out of ten do reccomend
13882,VERY GOOD I LIKE IT A LOT
13883,best PUZZLE game
13884,Very enjoyable
13885,"Hilarious, well-written, with amazing puzzles and a fantastic co-op campaign. There's a reason it's a classic!"

13887,The best
13888,baller
13889,This is my favorite video game. I have played lots of video games.
13890,absolutely love the sense of scale and world building this game provides! the puzzles were difficult but not so much that they stumped me for hours. would 100% recommend this game to a friend
13891,yes.
13892,shit game
13893,dancing... is not science!

13898,this is the best game ever made.
13899,"Вообще не ожидал, что игра пройдется за 6 часов. Так, игра крутая, но очень короткая. Остается только уровни из мастерской, но это не то. Эмоции положительные, но могли сделать и подольше. 5\10"
13900,This is one of the greatest game I experienced and probably the best puzzle FPS there is. It's pure fun coupled with hilarious narration. The co-op mode is also an entire game on his own with its own puzzles and voice lines / story.
13901,10/10
13902,SOLID.
13903,Fun time with fwens :3333
13904,"Oh my gosh I could go on for HOURS about this game. I love the mechanics, the storybuilding is really engaging, the characters can both be hated and loved at the same time, the visuals are great for the age of the game, and it's so relieving when you finally clear the hard test chambers.

I would definitely recommend going into this one blind, since finding out the story as you play is a wonderful touch. Playing the first game before this one would also be a good idea, because some of GLaDOS's lines can be confusing without context.

this game really makes you think, and its great for providing a distraction as well as for those who are looking for a good puzzle game.

It's honestly probably one of my favourite games I've played, and I definitely recommend it. It's a unique experience"
13905,hate it i barely got smarter i think im fucking mentally insane
13906,its masterpiecie
13907,yes very good pew protal gunnn
13908,"Best game i've ever played!!!! 
-Puzzles are great
-One of the best storylines in a game
-Great ending"
13909,"One of my favorite games ever.
Pure fun, good writing, amazing characters and stellar mechanics."
13910,Zeal LOVES this game
13911,one of the best games i've ever played
13912,too long
13913,"Legendary game. I bet you're not even considering getting it or not and you're just reading reviews for fun.

In all seriousness, though, it has a very good singleplayer campaign and the co-op mode is one of the best ones out there, not only the co-op campaign but the endless community-made maps, too. 

This game can get dirt cheap often so you'd be quite dumb not to give it a chance then."
13914,"Will make you hate your friends. Completed it with 5 different people and felt the same indifference and frankly disdain for human life as GLADOS does. You guys think she's the bad guy here but have you been crushed, lasered, dissolved and shot at by 5 different people only to be met with the same smug laughter as if you haven't seen this exact joke played out in what feels like all 14,000,605 of Dr. Strange's multiverses.

10/10 would recommend."
13915,"When you guys post a negative review and say ""Why are you looking at the negative reviews, just play the game"" you do realise that you aren't as innovative as you think, and you are also lowering the overall rating of the game"
13916,"For an eleven year old game, the graphics are pretty amazing and honestly run very well, even on low-end desktops.

Anyone who enjoys puzzles and possesses the skills to play a 3d platformer will be able to complete this game with relative ease; there is no inappropriate content. (aside from a few utterances of the words ""damn"", ""crap"", and ""bloody""; as well as some mild dark humour)
---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

It's a ten-year old Valve game - they optimise them so well that nearly anyone can run them.
---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

A few of the rooms are a bit challenging, but that's puzzle-solving; the difficulty is slowly ramped up but by but. level by level, but never enters into the realm of impossible.
---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

You can try challenge mode (speedruns of fastest time or fewest portals for a particular level) after you've completed single-player, but that's completely optional.
---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

The story ties together extremely well with that of Portal (1); plenty of twists keep the game exciting.
---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

It could take anywhere from several hours to several days to complete the single-player campaign, depending on how quickly you solve each test chamber and how much you play per day.
---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

Definitely one of the best single-player games on steam if you can afford it.
---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

I've not seen any bugs, as it's a highly-polished Valve game.
---{ Bugs }---
☑ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs"

Seriously a good game. If you liked the first one you will like this one as well since its basically more portal."

13926,"This game is absolutely amazing. It has good story telling, good puzzles\ good game play, hilarious writing, good voice acting and a twist you probably weren't expecting if. Just play it for yourself and you'll see."
13927,"Lots of fun, highly recommend playing both single-player and co-op with a friend. Story was a great continuation of Portal ""1"".

13931,Good
13932,A timeless classic adventure/puzzle game like no other.  Unless you count Portal 1
13933,This is probably the only game that I can universally recommend. It's good. Play it now.
13934,"The Cake is a Lie, and Wheatley is a Moron"
13935,"Better than the original, and that’s saying a lot, because the original was already one of my favorite games of ALL time."
13936,"Will only make you appreciate the first game more.

Wait for a sale.
You should still play it, but I would not recommend the game based on its own merits.
The new mechanics were neat I guess."
13937,One of the best puzzle games I have ever experienced!

13950,Portals
13951,Portal 2 is one of my favorite games its funny and entertaining from start to finish has some decently difficult but rewarding puzzles and should be included in the orange box if your a fan of portal 1 and are thinking about buying portal 2 you really should portal 2 has more content a better story (in my opinion) and has graphical improvements over the first the game is about 6 hours long and is enjoyable start to finish.
13952,"Man I'm genuinely surprised. I never thought I'd enjoy a puzzle game. Portal 1 proved me wrong. But it was a short game and I was sure that if it was any longer I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. Portal 2 was way longer with a lot more complicated puzzles so it obviously scared me. And once again I was wrong. Both of the Portal games are incredibly fun. Even if I suck at them I still had tons of fun.

+The game looks beautiful, sounds great and plays really well.
+I love the characters. The voice acting, their personalities, the things they say and do. Its all perfect.
+Just like the first game really short loading times. It can get a bit annoying if you keep dying like i do but otherwise its not bad.
+The puzzles get a lot more complicated and we have a lot of new tools we can use to solve these puzzles.
+The game is a lot longer then the first one.
+From the start to the finish its all just a lot of fun. What else do you want from a game ?
+Co-op game mode ! You can play with your friends.

-The loading scenes can ruin some of the adrenaline and the fun, excitement of some scenes. Fortunately just like the first game the loading screens are short. And just like the first game there is a lot of them.

Even if you hate puzzles games you should still try out the Portal series. I recommend buying the Portal bundle this way you'll get both Portal 1 and 2. Both of them are great games. Obviously don't jump into Portal 2 without finishing Portal 1."
13953,"Very fun and interesting puzzle game with a darkly funny and interesting story, they create new puzzles by taking the same great mechanics through a progression of locations that logically evolves throughout the story. Definitely recommend."
13954,"best game ever
"
13955,oooooooooooooooooooooooo
13956,"amazing. sick puzzles, sick creation of puzzles, sick story, absolutely godtier with friends"
13957,"Portal Two is a intricate game full of confusing puzzles and gripping story line.I really enjoy this game as it begins with simple puzzles that lure your into false sense of security as when your get further on the puzzles become mind-bogginly confusing and difficult.
This game is far from repetitive which was unexpected as I thought it would just be placung portals down but the amount of content and new things that come at you from every angle is Excellent!
Also the emotional connection you end up feeling towards the small amount of characters in this game is nothing like I've ever experienced before.
This game is awesome 10/10 would recommend.

13989,"EDIT: Apparently people say this game takes like eight hours to complete, so I guess don't necessarily take my below comments as seriously. But then again, I listened to all the dialogue and generally didn't have that many difficulties with the puzzles...maybe it took so long because I didn't use walkthroughs until like chapter 8? Idk, but YMMV nonetheless

I really liked Portal 2, but have some comments for people who might be considering playing now.
Firstly, I loved the story and the dialogue and the levels were pretty solvable, though a couple near the end are really tricky. I have bad coordination, which made some 'boss' fights really finicky, however I found after like the fourth or fifth time dying I suddenly could get past the one block that was killing my time--whether that's the game adapting to my terrible gameplay or just me practicing enough, if you are like me and at the fifth time dying are about ready to give up, just know that you will get it! (Even if you need walkthroughs at times). I would replay this game though for the dialogue alone.
Saying that, as someone with ADHD, and whose playthrough was double the time it took to complete Portal, I have realized that my personal limit for story-based games is about 8 hours. I hyperfocus on the game, and the characters are so compelling I just want to play right through, which, I mean, you can do for fifteen hours straight, but it's not really well-advised. I did spread it out over like two or three days, but for those who get really swept up in the story and hyperfocus, just set some limits playing this game!"
13990,"great stuff

13991, This is the best game valve ever made I love it so much there is no good reason not to get it and beat it. You will never regret buying this game. All these years its still a masterpiece

There are a few glitches on Mac, one of which is significant -- sometimes, upon start-up, you aren't able to turn. As a workaround, close and restart the game. Do not move your mouse during any loading screens. You may have to do this more than once. This is extremely irritating, so make your own decision about whether or not you want to put up with it."

I completed the game in one go since yesterday I played and finished the first game an thought to myself:""I need more of this"". it was an amazing experience. I can't say much about the co-op aspect of the game since none of my friends don't give a fuck about that game. over all totaly woth the 10 bucks. such a masterpiece just for 10 bucks is a steal. granted I bought the game for 2bucks while it was on sale but I would have bought it nither way. this is a must have in every single person's library."

14139,"Yes, portals, yes, portals"
14140,This and the original Portal are two of the best and most fun games I've ever played in my 25+ years of being an avid gamer :)
14141,fun :)
14142,I didn't think Portal could be topped but am glad to be proven wrong! Anyone with a PC and a sense of humor needs to play this game.
14143,"At nearly 11 years old, Portal 2 is still easily one of the best games ever made. Its graphics hold up to a modern audience, and its humour, level design, and setting are still a joy to experience. If you're reading this because you already love it as much as I do, good for you! If you haven't played it yet, pick it up.

This game is essential."

14145,"Roses are red
The cake is a lie
I finished my training at Aperture
But I hope it's not just a goodbye
"
14146,I found this a very enduring game with graphics that still hold up today. It's humor is funny and the story is very neat. I am glad that it is a video game classic!

14181,The game is overall amazing I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good game but someone who doesnt get mad easily lol. Amazing ending the game completes Portal 1.
14182,very compelling amazing writing and overall a very well written game
14183,"Still one of the best games out there. No shooting, no monsters but an amazing, well though through, engaging, challenging and entertaining game. Great to still get pleasure from playing this game, even after all these years. Always a good sign when you can come back and play the same game over again.:steamthumbsup:"
14184,old but good. 10/10.

14191,"Wheatley crab should have one an Oscar. But seriously I think it might be my favourite valve game, mostly for the multiplayer section of it. Had a lot of fun when playing with friends, chaos plays a huge part in that."
14192,It's portal. of coarse you should play it
14193,fun

14203,"Timeless piece of art. 
I have enjoyed the single player back when it was launched, more than 10 years later I have discovered and enjoyed the co-op. 
It's sad that after all this time there is no new Portal game in sight, just like the other Valve games."
14204,"goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood :)

14205,"portL GOOD MHM

14208,classic
14209,Masterpiece
14210,love this bitch.
14211,"I keep on coming back to this game.
Why?
It is truly spectacular.

I truly recommend anybody curious in the Portal series to first play Portal 1, before visiting Portal 2. This helps with some backstory, as well as gives hints about the storyline having further depth than what may meet the eye. Yes, Portal 1 was beautiful; but Portal 2, is just... incredible.
It has some of my favourite video game characters in it, amazing voice lines, 20/10 story, stunning graphics despite this game's age, and can basically run on a toaster (Mid-high end PCs from >10 years ago should run it totally fine).
I've played through this game 4 or 5 times already, and still don't get bored of it. If that says anything about a game, it should say; ""At least try it!"""
14212,"A timeless, comedic must-have. 10/10"
14213,Find one truly negative review I dare you.
14214,"hehe siuuu
"
14215,"COMPLETING EACH PUZZLE FEELS BETTER THAN AN ORGASM.
hands down, one of the best puzzle games ever!! given its time of release, it can easily stand out for its amazing and immersive way of story telling perfectly combined with complex yet solvable puzzles.
"
14216,really good game!!. Keep up the good work Valve!!
14217,yes
14218,good
14219,GALDOS!
14220,Nice
14221,Phenominal!. plus coop is good fun too
14222,"This game is TONS better than the first. The story has much more depth, the jokes are much more funny and I've actually been stuck at more puzzles this time around. This game is very memorable and is absolutely one of the greatest games of all time. I heavily suggest this, every hour spent on this game is worth it. I haven't played multiplayer yet, I might edit this when I do."
14223,it is soooo frikin good

14240," I mean, it's alright, like... underrated as FUCK in my opinion. I mean- ay you know what tho? That's typically how the bullshit goes, you feel me? man you sit back, right, and everybody talks about, it everybody hype the fucking shit up, you know what I mean, and not just with this fucking game, I mean you know, this goes for almost everyfuckingthing you know that people talk about on social media ""oh my god, you gotta try this you gotta try that"" Fucking.. fortnite...motherfucker what the fuck's supposed to be so special about it?"
14241,"This game has seriously changed my point of view about online games. My first playtrough was done with no major spoilers, but after that, I spent a lot of time searching for lore. The lore of this game is amazing, lots of fun interactions and dialogue that I spent days thinking about.
This game is so good at making you feel a part of the story.

Co-op has to be one of my favourite features, I even finished it before the single-player campaign! I required approximately 15-20 hrs just on co-op, and had a lot of fun!

I highly recommend this game, but you already knew that ;)"
14242,"don't play the multiplayer, friendships will be lost"
14243,One of the best games I have ever played 10/10 play it NOW

14256,"very good, if someone doesnt believe you if you say videogames are an art, show them this"
14257,I'm visibly happy when the lady is funny! The guy too!
14258,Much better game than the first will keep you going for ages with all the extra mod packs on the side as well as the story being like 3 times longer than the original
14259,good game

14416,Portal go wee (the sequel)
14417,Guys look I got payday 2
14418,"An absolutely amazing game. The story is fantastic, though i recommend to buy and play the game Portal before you play Portal 2, so you understand the story better. It's not too hard, it does crack your brain sometimes, but it's not irritating. The testing chambers all look pretty good (especially test chamber 20 ;)) and not confusing. Overall it's an amazing game and i would definetly recommend it!"
14419,i love holes
14420,Goog
14421,this is probably my favorite game of all time after all the other games i've played this is the best for both singleplayer story as for mutiplayer shenanigans
14422,"thin thing comes in fat thing comes out

according to glados

fun game funny aswell"
14423,I love glados
14424,"It's a great game. You can never go wrong with a Portal game. The puzzles are not super difficult but every once and a while you will be all like what the hell, then be like oh damn I'm dumb. I suggest this to any one that likes good games."
14425,wormholes are better
14426,"Used to play this with my dad all the time and it fills me with nostalgia. I wish i could go back to those times, probably the best time of my life"
14427,"Great story and Fun ""Cooperative"" Game play! I approve of this game."
14428,"Didn't like it compared to Portal 1, simple as'"
14429,Go for it
14430,Puzzle game with plot! Even better than the original. Good characters and narration. Loved it all the way through!
14431,good
14432,great game
14433,Friend bought me this game but won't stop pestering me about using windows instead of linux
14434,started oozing gasoline midway through
14435,good
14436,funny tall robot
14437,lots of funs yes
14438,"Portal here, portal there
Throw a turret in the air
Watch for the bullets that'll graze your hair"
14439,baka game so fun
14440,fun.
14441,Yes
14442,They don't make games like this anymore :(
14443,one of the most amazing games  for its time
14444,good
14445,sangat bagus untuk portal 2
14446,"This game, Portal 2, is by far one of the greatest games I've ever played.
The story, the gameplay, the graphics and visuals are all absolutely incredible and the game continues to give me a good time every time i play the main story. And i played the Co-op with one of my friends and we had a blast playing the co-op chambers.

The game teaches you how to use things like the portal gun and the gels very very well and then teaches you to apply those things to other things like the game's finale.

I highly recommend this game to people who have been looking for a new game series to play!"
14447,you know its good
14448,good
14449,how do you pass the one with the jazz?????
14450,My only regret in life is that I'll never be able to experience this game for the first time again. Absolutely love every second of it.
14451,Bird! Bird! Kill it! It's evil!
14452,"Makes the original Portal seem like just a proof of concept. This one is an actually complete game. The co-op is awesome (though voice chat is a must), the single player story is amazing, and fully fleshed out. The camera jank from the original has been fixed, the environments feel more natural and less sterile. The gels are an excellent addition to the puzzles and give an extra layer of depth, without making it much more difficult. 


Things holding this game back from being my favourite of all time: The final boss battle [spoiler] is broken into parts and saves in between each phase, creating a much less climactic ending. [/spoiler]. There is also one major plot contrivance: [spoiler] Wheatley really has no reason to turn evil and that whole part seems forced to extend the game[/spoiler]"
14453,Good
14454,glados
14455,the ambient music is literally better than the music they want you to listen to but they just opted for generic cinematic trash that plays constantly which i hate
14456,"I love this game. It's essentially my childhood. I do remember playing it during the summer when 13 years old, seeing the first plot twist and being shocked. I also remember being extremely sad during the ending credits. So many hours! I've decided to re-purchase it during this winter break i've had lots of fun playing it online! I recommend it!"
14457,"you see, this is why you just can't trust british people."
14458,Love it
14459,This game makes me feel stupid
14460,"this game is GOOD
"
14461,"good game
"
14462,"Just delightful. The puzzles, the story, the voice acting, the atmosphere, all fantastic. I have loved this game for over a decade and love to play it over and over again just to re-experience it. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
14463,"great game
"
14464,fun
14465,a fun a challenging puzzle game with lots of humor.
14466,Great game highly. Recommend Playing
14467,funny robots
14468,it is a great game but you have to play portal 1 first
14469,interesting co op
14470,"i killed someone because portal no good
reccomend yes"
14471,"this game is a classic, its very fun"
14472,very good nostalgia
14473,"oh it gonna blow your mind
"
14474,obligatory
14475,:)
14476,AMAZING
14477,"This game is truly incredible! Throughout the whole game I was fully invested and the character building, writing and level design is art work. The start and ending are the best parts about this. The whole game is amazing but the ending ties it all up so so well and its one of the best video game endings I have played. Overall, Portal 1 and Portal 2 are must play games. Even if your shit at puzzles like me, it is still 1000% worth it just for the story and characters! Just buy it, your only doing yourself a favour by doing so! 10/10"
14478,"This is the most indulging game ever... first game i have ever been bothered to get 100% achievements on, highly reccomend for all game preferences"
14479,amazing my mind is blown away
14480,"Just finished the game, first time playing it and i didnt expect it to have so much depth into it. what a great game"
14481,"It crashes on launch, crashes after opening after around 5 minutes i love it but i hate it"
14482,good intro to the horror survival genre
14483,A Masterpiece
14484,This game was the absolute best game I've ever bought on steam.
14485,10/10
14486,yes
14487,buy the first one first tho
14488,top 10 video game of all time
14489,"Very great game, very original with fun levels and fun mods for more levels, this game won't be dying out any time soon.
It's also a decent challenge and will get you thinking more than you'd think you would.
"
14490,I'M IN SPACEEEEEEEE
14491,"After some playtrought The game doesn't load my savegame(s) anymore. I've gotten to the undergound part of the game and when I load my savegame, I get a screen with a bot cemetary and I hear a robot singing something melancholic. In stead of the savegame being loaded, the game just keeps showing this screen with depressing music. 
Is there a way to continue playing, without having to restart the playtrough entirely? 
Any advice would be appreciated. 

p.s. I actually love this game, and if this problem gets fixed somehow, I will delete the negative recommendation."
14492,"Classic, very fun game"
14493,SCIENTISTS INVENTED A REAL PORTAL GUN IN 1986 AND THEY'VE BEEN HIDING IT FROM US FOR YEARS!!! LET'S MAKE THE PORTAL GUN A HOUSEHOLD ITEM JUST LIKE THE LIGHTSABER!!
14494,loved it! i want more!! more testing! going to shoot for 100% completion.
14495,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
14496,the story were amazing graphic is good and the story didn't to long but where is portal 3!!!
14497,A great game in the source engine with great puzzles and story. I also like how there is a coop mode and custom maps.
14498,one of the highest quality games i have ever played. the magnum opus of puzzle games. 9.5/10
14499,"if you're debating whether or not to buy this game, it's a must have. for only 10 bucks, this game is probably my favorite game in my library of over 60 games. the story line and lore are fleshed out, the mechanics and game play are addictive, and the characters are some of my favorite. still no cake though :("
14500,"I think we can put our differences behind us, for science, you monster."
14501,"I didn't think this game was as good as people said it was until I played it. I bought this game for about a dollar with extra credits that I had on steam. This game is now my second favorite of all time. Right after Zelda Breath of the Wild. The story, characters, and humor still stands out ten years later. The graphics stand the test of time, and could run at 30 fps on my potato 2004 acer laptop. I would've payed 60 us dollars for this game, It's way worth 10. I feel like I scammed Steam when I bought it for 1."
14502,boring
14503,"portal game make me happy 
"
14504,good...
14505,Fun game. Splooshy portal guns.
14506,Literally the best puzzle game of all time. Play it.
14507,game slaps 10/10
14508,"Local Splitscreen is broken.

Otherwise, the game runs great. The characters are fun, the writing is terrific, the mechanics are well thought out and well executed, and the overall experience is unique and exciting. I highly recommend this game, both for its singleplayer and multiplayer storylines, which is an interesting feature in and of itself. A good multiplayer story separate from the main story doesn't happen often, so this is a real treat to play with a friend."
14509,"hehe, wheatly funy"
14510,"Fantastic story, so fun, good puzzles, must play. Play Portal 1 first though"
14511,Good
14512,10/10 masterpeice. Who knew puzzle games were this good
14513,
14514,"This is one of my favorite I've ever played, there's so much to love about it. The story is excellent, the humor is awesome, the characters are wholesome, game play is top notch, the music is phenomenal, the graphics are magnificent, the easter eggs are worth going out of your way to find them, the new features make the game infinity fun. And GLaDOS, my favorite part of the game, she's funny, she's interesting, and I love her change of heart at the end! (spoiler alert I guess.) All I want is some one in my friend group who wants to play with me... anyway 10/10 game would recommend!!!"
14515,GOOG game BUY NOW OR DUMB
14516,
14517,Pooptar as well
14518,"Amazing. I came multiple times while playing.
Highly reccomend"
14519,It's Portal 2.
14520,this game is Epic
14521,better than portal
14522,"BEST GAME ON THE PLANET!!!

Very nice atmosphere and the puzzles are awesome and iconic, they are the perfect mix between not gonna take you a while, fun, but still challenging.
VERY good storyline, very iconic characters and still holds up over a decade later.
DEFINITELY worth the money. (also go buy portal 1 too if you have not)"
14523,"Even years after having first laid hands on this game, I revisit it consistently. The story is immaculate, the gameplay itself is fun and entertaining, and I always love a good puzzle. The portal mechanic itself never gets old, either. I would recommend this game to anyone, it's one of Valve's greatest and probably my all time favorite game."
14524,qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq
14525,Love the co-op
14526,ITs a REAL good puzzle game and its also very fun to play with friends! Thx Valve :).

14532,Fantastic game

14534,yo why the robot ball british doe

14543,f f
14544,"It's fun, challenging yet doable. Gets you invested with very little lore and few characters."
14545,"Always enjoy coming back to playing through this game. Challenging, but satisfying when making it through each level. The story continuing from the first Portal is great and the sarcastic comments from Glados are on point. The Co-op is where I really found the fun to be had and why this game has grown to be much better then the first. Definitely worth your time and money!"

14549,very good game
14550,yes
14551,"It was superbly nice.
Puzzle was difficult enough, story was excellent, and characters are alive.

+ If you gonna play this game in notebook computer, then I want to suggest you to set the brightness to the maximum, because if you don't, more than 20% parts of this game are really really really dark.
My eyes were hurt, and I wasted too much time finding portal-able panels and surfaces hiding in the dark. 
They were revealed when I moderated the brightness...."
14552,"When going in to this game I expected to be whelmed, i expected it to give me a smile to, at the very least, give me some spark of joy. Those expectations were met and they were destroyed. As this game left me with more than just joy and happiness but with satisfaction, acomplishment and a better understanding of who I am as a person"
14553,E
14554,my bones still ache
14555,This game is nice. But it's made in source engine. Which is not friends with my computer. Not saying its too intense for my computer just saying that no matter how much I change my graphics low to high it has these teeny tiny lag spikes every minute that my fps counter can't seem to notice at all. Anyways. Luckily I played it on Xbox and beat it before pc. So the game is nice. But you have to beat portal 1 before you play this
14556,"hells yeah dawg, good game"
14557,"Oh my god, this game was next level. I cannot tell you how much fun I had playing this game. I’ve played it like 4 times and I’m still finding Easter eggs I missed. This game is a real challenge but it absolutely elevates Portal 1 while creating more lore."
14558,It's just like among us don't trust your friend
14559,good
14560,Portal 2 is the best game on steam.
14561,e
14562,"pretty much one of the best puzzle games ever made. the single player campaign is amazing, the co-op mode is tons of fun, the writing is great. overall, fantastic game, i highly recommend it."

14564,"good, idk what to say"

14569,"One of the BEST Games I have ever played.
The Graphics are better than most of the games today and it is very cheap.
Overall a great game!"
14570,I have already done a review for Portal so Portal 2 was still the way it was and well had more memes so yay probably more than the first. Just a lot to take in from the first one and it definitely caught emotions and held them tight and longer and tougher to beat but still had everything I loved about Portal.
14571,It was such a blast to play this game throughout
14572,yes

 Maybe even space! But that would be bad isn't it? earth would be a vacuum space and everything dies."
14598,f u n
14599,"Words cannot describe how good this game is. I've played through the single player campaign twice, and I have yet to do co-op (but hopefully I will soon). And to put it simply, it's a good, enjoyable game. And given that it's around a decade old, it doesn't require a powerhouse of a PC to run. Speaking from experience, you should be able to get away with a lower end or used laptop (preferably a used business class laptop as they are more more durable, but that's my opinion). In addition, the graphics still hold up, although the shadows are a bit pixely. The game is a 10/10, five stars, etc.

It's good."

14602,"This game is awesome, I'm reviewing it over ten years later, yeah but the game is absolutely amazing. The story is good. The amount of lore it just adds to the universe. This game is amazing, Even after 11 years of being in existence. I cannot recommend this game enough."

14658,"This is portal 2, an amazing and also inexpensive game"
14659,"It is a good game. Graphics are amazing. Story is amazing. Gameplay is amazing. Music is amazing. Everything about this is amazing. They even have an area for making your own levels, which gives it the ability to be replayed and still be fun. Even the creators (Valve) think that this is the best game they have ever made. Wished there was a third (official) game. Portal Stories: Mel is cool, I just wished Valve cared more about not only portal, but their other games as well. Sure, some of these games did get other games for their series, like Half-Life Alyx, or Aperture Hand Lab. The only issue is that those games is that they aren't ""threequels"". Half-Life Alyx is a prequel of Half-Life 2, Aperture Hand Lab, I'm not even sure when this takes place, but it's definitely not after the events of Portal 2. In short, Portal 2 (and most of other Valve's games) is good, the only issue is that the company dislikes ""threequels"". Also a ""threequel"" is like a third title in a series, forgot to mention that. I recommend playing this if you can get your hands on it."

Portal is that kind of game that I didn't thought I'd enjoy, but that I end up loving. Portal 2 has a amazing story, very good graphics, audio and gameplay. The puzzle are well thought out and the environment is amazing. This portal is way better then the first one. It also has steam workshop support so the community can make extra maps. This game is a no brainer and you should definitely play it!"

14688,"Portal 2 was one of the first games I ever fell in love with. Back in 2012, I fell in love with its music, its humor, its level design, the whole lot. In a way, it kickstarted my efforts to learn to make music. 

Now, 10 years later, after watching people play it over and over again, I've finally played it for myself. It was truly a delight to be reacquainted with the colorful characters and exhilarating soundtrack that made me fall in love with games.
 
Thanks Valve, for one of the best games that has ever graced my screen."

Well, I'm tired of being treated like shit by certain game developers, so f the game and the developers I guess, since they insist on showing their middle fingers to me whenever I want to actually play any of their games without an internet connection. It's more enjoyable to clean my home than to deal with this sad excuse of an offline mode. ...Assuming that's the problem, which they of course can't be bothered to say."

"
14732,"My Opinion on Portal 2: (OPINION AND POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING)

Portal is a great game series,  P2's mods are great as well. 

Whats Portal about?

 Portal  follows Chell, a test subject going through Aperture Science with the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System, or GLaDOS for short, watching you complete test chamber after test chamber. GLaDOS is trying to kill you (Chell). Like Half-Life and Half-Life 2, the protagonist (You) is happily silent. You are equipped with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. (ASHPD or Portal Gun) Your goal is to escape Aperture Science, Don't die, and kill GLaDOS.

Whats my thoughts on Portal? 

Portal 2 is an amazing game. it introduced Co-op, they had cosmetics. (didn't really work out) The cosmetics were probably being tried in Portal 2, scrapped, and used in Team Fortress 2. (works a lot better there.)
Portal 2 is a game I, and many others hold close to their heart. 

I found Portal probably around 2014. I was screwing around on my PlayStation 3 and I found Portal 2 in the XMB menu. I played it. liked it, never played it again until last year. It wraps the story up pretty good. If you want Portal 3, I recommend a mod for Portal 2 called Portal Stories: Mel. 

What do I not like about Portal 2?

That I wont be able to experience it for the first time again.

In conclusion, Portal is one of the best puzzle games out there. If you haven't played the games, play them! They are almopst always on sale.

(The first is like 2 hours long) I haven't played much of co-op because I have no friends but from what I have played it's pretty good.

14783,"Amazing game, amazing story and experience. Make sure to play Portal 1 (Portal) first to get a backstory on the game as this increases the quality of experience you have in the game. The multiplayer co-op is also great and makes for some interesting funny situations with a friend. You are also able to make your own maps and publish them for others to play, this also being hinted at the trailer ""great heist"".

Great game to blow off a couple minutes at a time, and there's a bunch of extra test chambers.
I wish someone would give it a vr mod
it would induce great nausea in some but others it would be like a roller coaster.
Its all physics puzzles.
fun for years, unlike many other games

14804,BEST GAME EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!
14805,I killed my friend with a laser
14806,is portal
14807,"I may not have played for long, but portal, and its predecessor: portal 2, are absolutely amazing games, that provide 'Wow worthy' graphics, and a Mind boggling game play. This game is Highly suggested and has some really good puzzles, and multiplayer! It also has community test chambers which are quite a lot harder, but still keeps the essence. Its repayable, and just listening to the voice actors talk is amazing. It does have some bugs and glitches, but a good 90% will never happen to you (Unless your speed-running, or trying to get them, cause some can save time.) Its up to you the final decision, but personally, i think its great and should be worth way more."

14834,haha funny potato robot
14835,"This really challenges your creativity and thinking outside the box. The ultimate in escape rooms. It also had a terrific story line with humor and actually some nice music. With all the frustration mounting in the game, the ending makes it worth it. You have to finish the credits to the end. This was way better than the original Portal. I'm glad they made this one and hope they can make more in the future. I didn't play coop but I may try it. I'm sure it's good, as well. Thanks."
14836,"I was reading reviews for Portal 2 and wondering what the hype was and then I saw I had 43 hours and I didn't even play it for the first time on PC. 
Good game."

14860,"The product known as Kraft Dinner (KD) in Canada, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in the United States and Australia, and Macaroni Cheese in the United Kingdom is a nonperishable, packaged dry macaroni product by Kraft Foods Group, traditionally cardboard-boxed with dried macaroni pasta and a packet of processed cheese powder. It was first introduced under the Kraft Dinner name simultaneously in both Canada and the U.S. in 1937.[1] The brand is popular with Canadians, who consume 55% more boxes per capita than Americans.[2]

There are now many similar products, including private label, of nonperishable boxed macaroni and cheese. Commercially, the line has evolved, with deluxe varieties marketed with liquid processed cheese, as well as microwavable frozen mac-and-cheese meals. The product by Kraft has developed into many flavor variations and formulations, including Easy Mac (a product that has been renamed Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Cups), a single-serving product designed specifically for microwave oven.

The product's innovation, at the time of the Great Depression, was to conveniently market nonperishable dried macaroni noodles together with a processed cheese powder. The product is prepared by cooking the pasta and adding the cheese powder along with additional perishable and/or refrigerated ingredients such as butter (or margarine) and milk. The product is thus a simple-to-prepare, affordable, and meatless family dinner.

14877,"Portal 2 is one of my all-time favorite games. The puzzles are complex and interesting, there's tons to explore and learn, and the visual style and voice acting is fantastic. I've replayed this game multiple times and just repurchased it again because I love it so much. Every time I play, I find stuff that I missed in the previous rounds. Overall, it's very much worth it and this is one game I would consider a must-buy, especially if you like puzzle solving and futuristic settings."
14878,"I played the first Portal back when it initially released, well, within the first year at least. I loved it, but for some reason it took me forever to get around to playing Portal 2, there are so many games out there to be played that some games just get tossed in your back log forever, this one, was tossed into a 10 year backlog. Well, back log no more, I finally played it and it's absolutely incredible. I could say that I wish that I had played it sooner, but I'm glad I didn't because it was a fresh experience. This is one of those games that ruins other games for you because it is so good."

14888,"puzzle ez, lore & easter egg deep bgt"
14889,"When I first tried Portal on my Xbox 360 many years ago. I thought the game was absolute shit. that nothing, and I do mean nothing, could be worse than it.  I was totally wrong. in a good way of course! because years later I replayed Portal and I absolutely loved it! (Especially with Developer Commentary on.)

So how's the sequel?

It's pretty good. I like how each chapter actually has a name and it's pretty funny at times. (Mainly the intro and how it teaches the player to ju- I mean, say ""Apple"".) It's also quite fun figuring out what does and doesn't work in the game. and the Ratman secrets are back! and better than ever! Is it a good starting point for a first time player of the series? probably not, but it's fun anyways! best part of this game is the price. You can buy two things with 9.99 (Plus Tax) and those are a copy of Portal 2, or 4 hamburgers and a Sprite from McDonalds.

14923,"""Just say Apple"""
14924,"Good game, very long, lots of potatoes. 10/10 coins"
14925,"8.2/10. Better puzzles, better environments, more storytelling, more game. I might maybe love GLaDOS now too. Lots more music that straight up bangs (faith plate I'm looking at you) and all around more cool stuff to look at and mess with. If you liked Portal you'll love Portal 2, and if you haven't played Portal, this is better in every way.

There is a ton of character in this game. Everywhere you visit feels real and detailed, taking a departure from that sterile test chamber feel that was 80% of Portal to get behind the curtain. Portal 2 uses that to its advantage. There is a ton of dialogue (maybe a little too much?), GLaDOS herself somehow got even better. I don't know what they did but she's more than the voice informing you of this next test.

Moving on to the actual puzzles and stuff, there's a lot more of them, and new things to do, but there's a surprising amount of ""walk from here to there but you need portals once or twice"". It's a great opportunity to fit in some visuals, when you're not busy figuring out a puzzle, but sometimes I didn't even look around since I was busy trying to get to the next area. I got lost more than a few times, as in, I literally didn't know where to put my portal. The zoom feature is very nice but doesn't always make up for portal surfaces being teeny tiny. That and I just didn't see obvious stuff right away, which didn't always sting! Most of the tricky maneuvers you need come up again later on instead of being a one-time solution, so finally getting it stays satisfying instead of frustrating.

I loved the parts where I was on my own, no exit sign, no Wheatley, no prompts to interact with the only thing in the room. Getting to do it on my own was probably the most fun part in this game. I wish more was like that, honestly, because that's what I feel like a Portal game should be all about. Unfortunately, even when you're all alone, the game doesn't give you any time to figure it out before putting a big pop-up that says ""USE [E] HERE"", which really breaks that ""hey look I'm doing it!"" feeling. If it's not that, it's Wheatley literally telling you what to do.

Speaking of, Wheatley wouldn't shut up AT ALL EVER. Literally everywhere he could talk to you he had two or three MINUTES of dialogue where he just kept going on and on, and in that style of dialogue that's all ""look at me I'm so witty and funny anyway here's exactly what you need to do and it's very obvious but I'm just making sure you know but maybe you're stupid so I just wanted to spell it out for you"" that I got very tired of very quickly. They kept GLaDOS mostly the same from Portal, where she would speak like she wasn't chasing a reaction with every word. I much prefer that kind of dialogue, and it's a shame such a major character had none of it.

I haven't tried co-op yet, but I'm sure it's fun. I've played other co-op games so it doesn't really matter how good it is, since they're always fun with friends, but yeah. Just watch someone like Grayfruit play it."

14927,"good game,  make a sequel

Some mechanics were not explained, and things were pretty well hidden, even just to progress to the next levels, which I did not get. Overall, this is a very good game that had me guessing almost every step of the way."
14952,fun but it's long
14953,"Jump into quantum space hole. Fly out other end. Wheeeeeeeeeeeee.

Actual review: It took me probably about 10 hours to finish the game. The levels range from very hard to very easy. The levels do not require much skill (no super fast reaction times required), but do require you to think (with portals).The last level, however, is time limited, but most levels and interactions are not time limited at all. This is not, however, the type of game that you play a few minutes at a time. It takes anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour to complete a level, and after you complete a level, you will want to do more. The story is very good (funny, interesting, unexpected). Also, since its an older game, it gets put on sale, and it'll (probably - not tested) run on integrated graphics just fine."
14954,"holy shit what an experience! as someone who doesn't play puzzle games, i got my ass whooped but what an amazing game. valve please come back back to making some great shit like this instead of just putting new skins in CS:GO."

14960,"This game.. ruined my life. Back when I started playing this game I had a girlfriend named Marrisa. But one day while I was playing portal, my pc exploaded and killed her. After she died I was too sad to work causing me to lose my job. After that I became homeless for the next 10 years. Scavenging for scraps, I had to do things I never thought I would have to do to survive. After the 10 years I had gotten ill of the ligma disease. It was then that I decided to pursue science and fix my life whatever the cost. After 10 hard years of college, I finally had the materials needed to build the machine. You see for the last 20 years I had been searching for scraps not just for food, but also parts. You see I had an idea after she died. AND IT WAS TO BRING HER BACK! I stepped into the time machine... To read more the sequel is coming soon. But anyway was pretty good."
14961,"I am so GLaD to finally play this game after years of getting the perfect PC to run it as intended.  New challenges and expansion from the first game story,  trusting on your brains  and thinking with portals now is possible to play with a partner in coop mode. what else can i ask for? I can finally die anytime. I regret nothing."

14984,"Everything about this game is great, the community levels really add another layer to the replayability of the game."
14985,"I have to say I'm a tad bit late to the party, but this game is phenomenal for me. I finished it in 9 hours in one sitting, and now I can't let it go. It's the longest puzzle game I've completed (so far!) and I really enjoyed playing it. 
The graphics are impeccable for its time (though I have to say I don't play that much other games released about the same time as this) and it was even playable at high settings for a fairly average laptop that I'm using. I had no problems whatsoever — no lag, no glitches, and no crashes.
The gameplay is innovative and quite unique, it's very fun, though at some difficult parts I felt like I wanted to bang my head against my desk and corrupt my own core just to get out of a chamber. Frustrating, but really rewarding once you get through it.
The story is REALLY interesting and captivating, especially that I played this after playing Portal. I kept on learning new stuff about the ""Apertureverse,"" and its lore, stories, and even some easter eggs. I reckon that if there was a novel or a movie about this universe, I'd definitely check it out.
The soundtrack, sound effects, and their sound design is quite enjoyable. I love how some of the gameplay objects that have sound effects interact, change, or adapt to whatever background music is playing;g,gf;=i am spending too much time on this review i d;ont have to make it fancy or whatever BUY IT IT'S FUN

15003, 
15004,its good
15005,"Lots of brain cells used. Coop was cool and actually forces you two to work together, which is the point of the game. I've played some courses more than once and they were fun to play even having already gone through them. Robot lady was quite mean and sassy all throughout, and it made the play through quite entertaining while your brain cells are fried. So overall, t'was fun."
15006,Fantastic game!
15007,"Even better than the last! Love this game so much! It really tells a rich story just from the settings, fine details, and subtle dialog implications, and the gameplay alone is fantastic!"
15008,Longer and has more content than the first game (including coop and community test chambers). Puzzles may make you confused for some time but will click after a while and feel satisfying once you done them. Ending song is just as emotional and nostalgic as first game.

The thing that makes portal so great is it's simplicity which resulted in the devs making the environment challenging and fun. and if you're bored of the normal story levels you can always play the community built levels, and you can built one yourself and that's bloody wonderful.

tldr: 10/10 experience, must have in everyone's library."

15108,"Play the game, for science, you over ripe fork"
15109,"This is one of my favorite games ever made. I play this and the first one at least once every 2 or 3 years because i love them so much. The 2nd game is obviously much better than the first because the first was just a tech demo, that they didnt expect to be popular, but it was and they made a sequal a thousand times better than any one could have imagined. This game also shines due to the fact that they got an insane voice cast. Ellen McLain reprised her role as GLaDOS which is surprising cause in the first game she sounds so different than in this game. Stephen Merchant plays the robot core Wheatley who is honestly one of the most surprisingly good villains ive ever seen. This entire cast is amazing but in my opinion the best actor in this game is J.K. Simmons. When i first played this game i recognized the voice of Cave Johnson and didnt know why, but it kept reminding me of J. Jonah Jameson from the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies, and now the Tom Holland movies, i didnt know why. then i googled the cast of this game and he showed up i obivously found out why. But in this game J.K. Simmons plays Cave Johnson who is the past owner of the Aperture Science company. He does such an amazing job that when hes yelling one of his pre-recorded messages it feels like your Tobey Maguire and hes telling you he wants pictures of Spider-Man. Anyway this review is way too long and if your not convinced to buy this game yet, its your own fault for missing one of the best games ever made."
15110,"wtf was stopping her from taking the white gel shit, backtracking to the elevator to the surface and just drenching that shit so she could get to the top, like honestly"
15111,"Amazing game. Fun the second, third and fourth time, even more."

15124,game good
15125,i havent gotten to glados's place yet :)
15126,"If you liked the first Portal, you’re gonna like Portal 2 a while lot better. The first game took me 1.2 hours to beat while this one took me about 7-8 hours to beat. The story to this one is amazing, the soundtrack is pumping, the puzzles are fun and sometimes tricky, and the humor is great, especially Wheatley who will give you some laughs whenever he’s around (and he’s a meme). I haven’t played the multiplayer yet, I’m gonna get to that eventually, but from what I’ve heard, it’s great. If you haven’t played this already, wtf are you doing right now?! Go play the damn game!"
15127,gmaing
15128,this game is too good for its own good. so its terrible. valve should stop making perfect games.

15139,One of the best single player story games of all time. With a great multiplayer too! This game will keep you interested and occupied. Also it can probably run on a VTech console so us people who only got a slice of the raspberry pie can play too.

The bigger advantage is the user created maps, those get you thinking and go farther than the game's own challenges.

15304,"Amazing story i mean i cried at the ending maybie because its my first story game but the sound direction is amazing like when you went faster the music would change or if you jumped it would have echo in some rooms

Pros - Best story line ever  :  Beautiful sound direction   :   Amazing voice acting   :   Ending is epic   :   Probably 
          the best game of the decade and on

Cons- A bit hard  :  none

Price-Very cheap for a good game

15320,"fun game, best series on steam"
15321,very good game
15322,Mhm
15323,"This is my favorite game. Ever. This is a one in a lifetime experience, the JOY of performing and solving problems is inefable. Gameplay is so satisfying, puzzles are clever and balanced, all puzzle elements are iconic.

The main singleplayer campaign has depth, a great dose of humour and HUGE character development, and is not unnecessarily long. And, after finishing it, you're gifted with COMMUNITY CREATED levels. There is some awesome content there, not to mention other standalone mods already available on the Steam Store (some requiring the original game, others not).

Finally: GET. THIS. GAME.

Worth mentioning: the default DX9 API may result in broken lighting, at least in AMD cards running recent drivers. To fix that, you must add -vulkan in the startup options. It may be stuttery for the first minutes of gameplay, but after that, it's flawless."

15345,Best game ever! I have completed the game and the ending is the best.
15346,"I have one word to describe this game : amazing.


Everything about this game is so impressive for its time of release. The storyline, the graphics, the characters, the scenery as you're moving through the ruined building are all unbelievably breathtaking. I found myself stopping to admire the scenery quite often as i played and couldn't keep my jaw shut i was so amazed. If you're looking for a game thats bittersweet, comedic, heartwarming, and has some of the best music, play this game. Don't hesitate for a second on buying it because it is worth it.

Portal 2, i adore you. My eyes are still trying to recover from crying."

It's just a classic, and I really believe for good reasons : the concept is really good, it's really well-done, the story and characters, even if there are not that many, are interesting.

15430,"Very good story that ties very well into the first game. Unlike the first installment, this one had a more direct story and chapters that guide you through its story. One thing I do miss from the original game however is the saving system. This game only gave you five updating save slots while the first game gave you so many more. I know it's a small complaint but I often got annoyed when I wanted to go back to a specific point in my playthrough and I couldn't because it was removed from the low save storage. Overall, its a very good game that is loads more polished than its predecessor. I can definitely see myself coming back to it."

15435,"Amazing sequel. The story is very well told and is honestly a masterpiece. For a game published in 2011 it still has a very appealing and easy on the eyes graphics, especially for those who played Valve games in the last two decades. The puzzles are naturally harder than in Portal 1, levels have more ""mechanics"" and are all around a bit more challenging. Voice acting is again amazing and  hilarious. Character development and world building/expansion is noticeable and very immersive.

The game is a masterpiece and worth every euro, dollar or pound you pay for it!"

15457,Its Portal.
15458,"I pulled the game out of the depths of my library to catch up on the missing achievements and saw that I haven't written a review yet. So, let's catch up on that:

I played both games back to back and I like the second one better for several reasons:

- Wheatley is awesome and so you have Glados AND Wheatley together.
- I like best the game sections that are outside the normal test chambers and the second part has more of them.
- the puzzles with the gels are a great innovation and fun

Valve has really created something great and anyone who has not played the Portal games should do so immediately.

I'll play Portal Stories Mel right after this, just like I did back then. Because this game (btw one of many unique mods for Portal, which are available for free in the Steam Store) contains something: tests where you have to puzzle to solve them and where it does not depend on skill. 
That would be the only criticism I have of the Portal games. Some test chambers and sections of the game have to do with timing and that can be very annoying, especially if you want to play comfortably and relaxed.

15646,"Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you
Maybe not quite as heavy
Now little Caroline is in here too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone"
15647,i love it

15649,"Easily one of the best games on steam, especially cause of that criminally low $10 price tag"
15650,very nice
15651,nice
15652,"It's a great interactive first-person puzzle game with an amazing and well developed story-line. I love it so far! The 2 player is also enjoyable but less story based and more for the fun of completing levels co-op. Seriously, if you like puzzles and the chance to run around a room to figure out what you have to do, then you should give this game a try. Even if you just like the story-line aspect, it is definitely worth playing through. 
Also...GLaDOS and Wheatley are hilarious."
15653,"Amazing story, hilarious characters and beautiful and cool music, gameplay is extremely solid, one of the best games out there."
15654,"best puzzle game of all time, besides maybe tetris lol"
15655,a classic i have not  seen any other puzzle game like this with such high quality be made since other than indie tittles.a classic.
15656,I have a very minor case of serious brain damage
15657,Fantastic game with a lot of additional community content.
15658,yes
15659,brain hurt but funny now
15660,"it's portal 2 yo. At this point, if you don;t have it, its probably not your type of game. but more than worth it anyway!"

15663,yeah
15664,fun
15665,It's portal. Every gamer should have this game under your belt. Wonderful campaign and some insane graphics for 2007.
15666,top3 game stories
15667,Very fun story that never gets old. Allows you to express your creative activity with the test chamber creator. One complaint: The Valve logo when you boot up the game is scarier than any horror game.
15668,good shif
15669,yeeees

15686,"MAMA MIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, this game is very cool, seriously get it"
15687,c0ool
15688,"Recomended both for co-op and solo, got some challenging puzzles for both but its most fun is co-op without external communication. Nice graphics, story and all and even for the full price its worth it, also it offers many hours of gameplay and have expansions from what ive seen"
15689,a must-play
15690,"May be the best game ever! Once you are done with the campaign, check the maps from the community, endless fun!"
15691,VERY GOOD GAME pleas buy

15700,"I played this game with my buddy and we liked it. I liked cooperative game more than single story. Co-op puzzles were more interesting. I didn't like the story very much, but it's not terrible."

15710,Cave Johnson is based
15711,"The scale of this game is astounding, the physics are amazing, the story is so well delivered, every character is incredibly charming, and the dialogue is off the charts."
15712,"Excellent game play, interesting puzzles, amazing voice acting. Co-op mode is fantastic"
15713,"10 out of 10, a must-play!

Tip: Portal 2 is not (only) 'a better version of' the original Portal, but it also is a continuation of its story line. So for a full immersion in the story (and to grasp the numerous references), play (or watch) Portal 1 first, then the 'Lab Rat' comic, before diving into Portal 2!"
15714,buy it
15715,"funy losing frends simulater
10/10"
15716,"Simply put, this game is a timeless classic, with a compelling story line. Furthermore, it has multiplayer capabilities that expand the game beyond the single-player. I highly recommend this game for all users."
15717,A timeless classic.
15718,horrible game truly deplorable
15719,"Portal 2 is an impeccable sequel for Portal 2 as developers did listen to the community, learning their mistakes from Portal 1 and improving it in Portal 2. It is replayable even after completing single player campaign and co-op mode as you are accessible to tons of fun maps or mods such as Portal Reloaded made by community. Portal 2 is definitely worth the price and a must play classic.

GlaDos I have done complimenting the game, can you sit on my face now?"
15720,gud GAEM
15721,"Timeless from its inception, perhaps one of the greatest games ever made. I have very few words to say except play it. I have finished this game on three separate occasions: 2014, 2017 and 2021. Each time I found myself sucked into the story and plot that is sewed deep into the puzzled nature of its gameplay."

15723,A masterpiece that exceeds the first one.
15724,"You probably already know about this game, but here's the short of it:

The singleplayer is incredibly fun.
The multiplayer is incredibly fun.
The puzzles are still super unique and well done.
The characters are interesting, engaging, and really hold up well.

Valve legitimately doesn't make bad games. If you've never played it and you have even a remote interest in puzzle games, pick this one up!"
15725,portal 2 go brr
15726,Portal
15727,ye
15728,"how the fuck is this nearly 11 years old, this game is awesome😤"
15729,Portal 3 when?
15730,this game is one of the best games ive ever played. Sometimes its hard and i had to search up what do to but otherwise i really enjoyed it. You can also play with your friends if you would like to if they have it so thats great too
15731,"so damn hard you need like 1000 IQ to beat this, but still good"
15732,"if you like Portal, you will like this game"

15750,wheatley is my drug
15751,portal
15752,"I remember first seeing this game for the first time a decade ago on T.V in an advert. I was very intrigued by the two robots and Glados's voice. I asked about it at gamestop and the clerk told me it was a very fun puzzle game so I picked it up. I played it on every platform it came out on ps3, xbox 360 and PC and have dumped countless hours into it. I sincerely don't regret spending so much time playing this game.  I don't think Ill ever stop re playing it because the story and gameplay is just so unique and interesting."

15759,"Portal 2 is the perfect successor to one of the most engaging first person puzzle games in history.

New puzzles, new environments, updated game mechanics, excellent graphics, story, and of course humour.

If you've never experienced the portal series, you owe it to yourself to pick this up and the predecessor as well.

At any cost, they are great games, excellent replay value, and a timeless classic that helped shape the history of gaming.

Any modern computer can run these with ease, and they are a treat to play.

Buy it!"
15760,"portral

One of the best games I've Ever Played!"
15761,As of writing this i haven’t finished the story but i love Atlas.  I’ve mostly done multiplayer with a friend and the game allows you to have great moments of humor and it is definitely my favorite game that i have played in a long time.  10/10
15762,despite what it says on steam i have like 200 hours or something on this game because i played it CONSTANTLY on the 360 and its great
15763,is gud
15764,"If you've played the first game buckle your seatbelts for some incredible action and expansion to the world you've learned to love, if this game is new to you go ahead and play both this and the first portal both games are incredible era defining games."
15765,i got 88th place in speed running and its good for problem solving overall.
15766,Played both Portal games for the first time in 2021. Resume - playable af.
15767,good game
15768,"This game is one of my top 5 favorites period. I've played through both the single-player and co-op campaigns at least twice. This game's unique combination of puzzle solving, parkour and communication just has no equal. Solving each ""escape room"" using both the tools provided (portal guns/blocks etc) and the physics engine (gaining speed from falling, body blocking to stop movement) is SO SATISFYING that you just have to ""do one more"" before getting off to do whatever you know, you should really be doing. Even though each room has an obvious path to complete it, the way you discover the answer is completely up to you in a ""trail and error"" way of thinking about how to overcome the challenge. Honestly I consider this game somewhat of a ""must-play"". Some of my best gaming memories are from playing this game with a special friend(s). 10/10. This game goes on sale quite often for like 2$ so make sure to buy it for friend sometime too. Coop is really where this game hits the hardest."
15769,good
15770,"if you haven't played it.
play it now.
its like 10 bucks."
15771,This game is juicy
15772,As said many times before this game is a masterpiece.
15773,"This was a triumph
I'm making a note here; ""Huge success""
It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction
Aperture Science:
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are
Still alive
I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart,
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now, these points of data
Make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned-
For the people who are
Still alive
Go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you?
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke *Haha - Fat Chance*
Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist
Look at me: still talking
When there's science to do
When I look out there,
It makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive
And believe me I am
Still alive
I'm doing science and I'm
Still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm
Still alive
While you're dying I'll be
Still alive
And when you're dead I will be
Still alive
Still alive"

15791,Wow. I thought the first game was amazing but the sequel makes the old game feel mediocre in comparison. This game is not only funny but the story is also a little emotional. The puzzles are so much more engaging and difficult. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the first.

15802,"good :thumbs_up:
"
15803,"This is, and always will be the best game series ever!!"
15804,"this is the only game ive beaten more than once other than portal one and my GOD is this a gem. it's by far my favorite game, and not just because it's fun, but because it has wit and enjoyable, 3 dimensional characters and an excellent story to go with it. i love this game so damn much. this was one of the first games i bought on steam and For Good Reason"
15805,good one great lore
15806,game is fun adventure/ futuristic game and it's very fun to play in free time
15807,Scenario is beautiful. This game takes more time than first Portal. And are nice co - op
15808,"Portal 2 ups the ante in every regard, it's funnier, more challenging, looks better and plays better. It's in every respect, the perfect sequel. with Half-Life Alyx being real and not something we all collectively imagined after suffering from Valve withdrawals, I like to believe the chance of a Portal 3 is in the cards because I like these characters far too much to end here, GLaDOS returns and it thrice as funny and sadistic, Wheatley is the best sidekick ever and Stephen Merchant delivers all his lines with the comical timing of the God of Comedy, and Chell is... well Chell, but the companion cubes are back. 

Portal 2 is without a doubt one of the best games ever made, it's fun, funny, challenging and not too long or too short, it's skyrocketed to my top 5 games of all time."
15809,This is one of my favourite games ever. The PORTAL series is absolutely amazing. If you are thinking about buying you definitely  should and if you have played PORTAL 1 than this is a guaranteed good choice.
15810,Amazing!
15811,Best game! Still hoping for portal 3 or an update to the test chamber creation
15812,Even better than the first one

15821,"The mechanism, gameplay, stages are great!"
15822,Portal 2 is great. Nothing else needs to be said.
15823,"What could I possibly say that hasn't already been said?

I guess I don't really like the pacing of the difficulty of the puzzles. When the Whitley as Glados arc starts, the tests jump in difficulty. Not that they're immensely difficult, it's just that the puzzles that Glados throws at you are actually too easy for a sequel. Playing Portal 2 immediatly after Portal, it just feels unnecessary that Portal 2 re-establishes all the basic rules of gameplay that are pretty much second nature coming back from Portal. Overall the game just feels kind of too easy. 

It's still a masterpiece, obviously. Ending had me in tears after all these years."

15825,"A very good game, interesting storyline and multiplayer option is a good extention of the game."

15857,One of the best games ever made. I wish I could play it again for the first time.
15858,glados didnt ask for this

15861,"Play game, is good."
15862,"this game is truly a masterpiece, its 10 years old but it still holds up."
15863,fat fat
15864,My favorite game of all time.
15865,"The Portal games are great. I enjoyed the first game and this one but in different ways. The fist one had me focused on Chell and the GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System). However, this game brought a lot more world building to it and introduced a new character to the story that was refreshing.
The game starts out in a similar way as the first but quickly shifts and just has some fun with it. I never felt board and beet it rather quickly. The eight hours includes the times I had to walk away from the game due to real world things that needed my attention. If you have some spare time to play a game, I recommend this one."
15866,.
15867,it's an excellent game
15868,"Wheatley gave me the chance to kill my self now, i didn't waste any second"
15869," Community Test Chambers = Unlimited unique gameplay.

The story is great! but what's better than a good story? Unlimited replayability!
Community Test chambers has kept this game fun for me long past completing the story.

I highly recommend to anyone considering the game."

Cuando comence a jugarlo pense que iba a ser aburrido y soso (Debo confesarlo) sin embargo, me encontre con una grata sorpresa al ver que el juego verdaderamente era una delicisia sensorial. Los constantes cambios en los escenarios y una historia atrapante me llevaron a terminarlo lo mas rapido posible, no solo por gusto si no por una necesidad imperativa de saber como se desarrollaba la historia. Si tuviera que compararlo con otros juegos, tal vez lo pondira al nivel de Bioshock (Lo que es decir mucho).

16013,"The game is good and is really funny, the puzzles are challenging and fair."
16014,this game was fantastic. the puzzle became just a tad more challenging which made the solutions even more satisfying. the story truly interested me and i see glados in a different perspective. the context was easy to understand and it runs very well :)
16015,"great game 10-10 portal = fun
"
16016,very fun
16017,"An awesome sequence to a fantastic game! Do yourself a favor and play it, that is, if you're into puzzle games. The gameplay time has been extended and is now more reasonable, since I felt like the first game felt a bit on the short side. Mechanics have been improved upon and are introduced throughout the playthrough. On top of that, I found the story very engaging and charming."
16018,good yes potato the cake is a lie
16019,"before playing this, i was dumb!
now after playing this, i am smart and grieving!"
16020,"this is one of my top 3 games ever. the puzzles are amazing, the mechanics are perfect, and the fun cast of characters really make this game one of the best ive played. the story/lore that this franchise has is so well thought out. i heard about this game some 3-4 years ago thinking it was too over hyped. boy was i wrong"
16021,yeah
16022,Absolutely loved the first Portal! I finished that game back in High School about 10 years ago. I stopped playing PC games for a number or years and just started playing again and both games has aged wonderfully. Portal 2 is just as fun and funny as the original. My son and I have been playing together and it's been fun to watch him fall in the love with this game too. Highly recommend it!
16023,best game i have ever played
16024,"great game, very interesting story, fun and witty characters, challenging but satisfying puzzles. overall an amazing experience playing this game"
16025,SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
16026,"portal
"
16027,A fantastic sequel to a timeless classic building on the previous story and making it a million times better any fan of puzzle game should definitely check this and Portal 1 out a amazing way to get into valve/pc games and one of my top time favourite games. 10000/10
16028,"itss cool
"
16029,Portal 2 is the best game in the portal franchise in my opinion. The game incorporates story more then the original Portal game did and has more engaging puzzles. Portal 2 is far better then the original by a long marginal.
16030,"I mean it's alright, how do I super reportal again?"
16031,"This game is very fun, challenging, and funny at times even! I highly recommend Portal 2 to literally everyone! EVERYONE I SAY!!!!!!!"
16032,"Incredible game, and on sale they are basicly giving it away"
16033,
16034,A very fun classic!
16035,10/10
16036,"Amazing puzzles with lots of replays, and different strats."
16037,cool game would rate 700000000/1 on ign

16044,"I love Portal 2. It is beyond incredible. This game is the best puzzle game ever made, no questions asked. The characters, writing, puzzle design, mechanics, everything. Every single little thing is phenomenal. If you haven't already, by this game now. I promise you won't regret it."
16045,I know this is late but if you haven't played this game you're missing out on so many things!

16047,Pretty good
16048,This is art. Not in sense of game art but literally ART
16049,"the whole game is like a math test, you learn some concepts and then you put it into practice, youll get stuck for some questions and others youll breeze right pass, the only diffrence is, this game isnt for a grade"
16050,"I honestly think this is the best game ever made. The graphics are amazing on the source engine, it took everything great about the Half-Life series (and Portal 1 for that matter) and boosts it to amazing levels. The amount of immersiveness, the story, the atmosphere, the MUSIC!!!!!!, and everything else make an experience unlike anything else.

PS: It gets even better once you start using the console :)"
16051,i love you
16052,wheatley never saw the wheat at the surface :(

16063,"Great sequel to an awesome game. Kept everything that made Portal 1 a success and introduced new fun mechanics that feel fitting, fleshed out the back story and polished the look and feel. I really liked the Cave Johnson retcon."

16072,"Wow, I mean WOW!
I've heard good things about this game but it still exceeded my expectations.
The story is brilliant. The game has a lot of humour to it but is also very serious in some places. The fact that you can play with friends is also really neat.

Would 10/10 recommend"

16194,"Who hasn't heard of this classic game? Where puzzle solving, a great story, unique mechanics and some humour merge to bring you a title, that, despite its age still stands head and shoulders above many current releases. If you've not played this, then stop reading and download and enjoy it!"
16195,"It`s a great game, even if it gave me headaches every now and then. Playing co-op with a friend is fun."

16200,this is a fucking masterpiece
16201,"Returning to this game years later after playing it when I was around 12 or 13 has been a ride. The nostalgia is insane and it's so much better than I remember it. If you're thinking about replaying this game or playing it if you've never played before I highly recommend you doing so. Portal 2 will never get old and the characters make every moment of it enjoyable, even at some of the more frustrating puzzles. 10/10."
16202,fun

16204,entertaining

16206,Why are you reading reviews. Play portal. Its like one of those games that every gamer is legally required to play to be considered a true gamer.
16207,good game
16208,"great game you can see how much effort they put into this, worth buying"
16209,"This is the best game ever made, we can all go home now."

16212,.........cool................
16213,they took the fking radio >:(
16214,good
16215,hello
16216,"I love the story, the concept of the game is really easy to understand. When you play this game, it's hard to press the quit button."
16217,"Portal 2 is a game you have to play. For what it is, Valve masterfully crafted the experience's gameplay and storytelling elements into an instant-classic. The innovations on the gameplay-side since Portal 1 are wonderful, and the gradual difficulty progression curve keeps you in a flow state even as the game gets exponentially harder than the first hour of the game. It's so well-thought out how they introduce new tools to your arsenal and mental frameworks for approaching puzzles that they clearly spent as much time and playtesting as they needed to nail it down.

The only weak point is the story/narrative. For what it was for it's time, the lack of dialogue from the character and the interactions being limited to robots talking to your POV was like a 7/10 imo. Being largely an action puzzle game this can be kind of forgivable and the excuse that they were inspired by the end of 2001 a Space Odyssey and other human/robot relationships kind of covers them... it doesn't quite excuse the world feeling quite lonely or weak connection to the silent main character you play as. There should have been other human characters or in-game or over an intercomm having direct dialogue with the main character at the very least... It's a missed opportunity that any Portal 3 would surely fix, potentially making this classic become quite outdated."
16218,i think i broke the game
16219,atlas is me
16220,gud
16221,"Probably one of the best games I've ever played. Its fun, it has a great story, and its the perfect way to spend your time. 10/10, 100% reccomend"
16222,VERY GOOD
16223,"If you are going to buy this game for it's co-op, make sure your teammate isn't an obese half Chinese overdosing on waste oil who hogs all the credit even though you did 99% of the work.

Oh, and make sure he isn't a weaboo who's into cartoon girls, it gets really annoying when ""top 10 anime waifus"" shows up in your twitter feed."
16224,A funny and not overstretched masterpiece.
16225,great :)
16226,It's a good game with a cool storyline.(You need to use your brain!)
16227,"[Verse 1]
Well, here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice

[Chorus 1]
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now, I only want you gone

[Verse 2]
She was a lot like you
Maybe not quite as heavy
Now little Caroline is in here, too
One day, they woke me up
So, I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you

[Chorus 2]
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now, I only want you gone

[Verse 3]
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
If it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad

[Chorus 3]
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now, I only want you gone
Now, I only want you gone
Now, I only want you gone"
16228,it's like portal 1 but 2

16261,yes
16262,"This game is so fun, picked it up recently with my friend and played co-op, we had heaps of fun destroying each other in just the first few levels."
16263,"The Portal series is now one of, if not my favorite games I've played to date. Portal 1 is significantly shorter, but both are still very easy to pick up and put down. I got them for a combined $3 USD during a sale, but honestly, despite having one of the worst price/hour ratios in my library at full price (about $1.20/hour), it is worth every cent, even without a sale. Like I've heard many times, One of the worst things about Portal is that you can never play it for the first time again, and I'd have to agree. These games are 100x better if you don't know anything about them. Not to mention it's got one of the best lines in gaming history (""So. How are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO."").

TL;DR: The Portal series is phenomenal and can be obtained for much less than base price, but are worth every penny of full retail. Also go in as blind as possible."

16312,"Man, after replaying this game and completing it in one sitting just now, all I have to say is this. I miss you, Valve. The good old days when you were my favorite video game company, the games you made were of an unsurpassed  quality, and just the thought of what could come next if you woke up is enough to keep me holding onto hope. This game is a 15.5/10 masterpiece, not just this game, but Portal 1, Team Fortress 2, the Half Life series and everything else Valve has done. If you're on the fence about buying this game, PLEASE DO. It is a must play, and I would give everything to experience the Portal series for the first time again. until then, I'll just keep testing. For science."

Puzzles are exceptional. The Difficulty curve is very smooth. The story line is entertaining  and unique.  Characters  are interesting and not annoying.  After 10 years  of playing...It's just as fun as the First.  When you finish the main campaign, there are a lot of very well developed mods.
The co-op community is still very active.
No Complaints."
16409,"This game is even more challenging and I absolutely think that it's amazing! This game gives you double the puzzles, double the challenges. Portal 2 NAILED its sequel and I believe it's just as iconic as Portal. And when you hear that, you know they really put the time and effort into making this game."

I can even play them with friends who are completely new to Portal and the difficulty in levels scales well, making it a fun experience for both of us! 
Definitely buy this if you're interested in puzzle-solving and deadly British robots, even if you haven't played the first Portal game, you'll still enjoy this one :)"

16427,"One of the best endings in any game I have played before. The puzzles are solid, and the environments are jaw-dropping. The introduction of the gel and the transportation beams/light bridges were amazing mechanics compared to Portal 1. With an incredibly compelling story and the accessibility of the game, it's a game that can be played at any pace, is generally amusing, and is simply accessible to nearly anybody. Not to mention, there is a co-op mode and it is very fun with a friend. "
16428,"Amazing game! As always, Valve made it again."
16429,Very well made game
16430,portal 2 is a cool game and since theres a sale now you should buy it! edit: i started a new game and it deleted my old save file without telling me ):
16431,"I am going to be honest, the first time I played this game it was a ""less than legitimate"" copy of the game I had on a flash drive given to me in high school. But when I played the game for the first time on that school laptop with a 7 inch screen and an i3 processor, I loved it. And since now I have disposable income, I got this game pretty much as soon as I got my new PC set up. It took me a while to get to it, but I finished it again on a proper desktop. And I must say, this is easily my favorite video game that I have ever played. Great writing, jokes, puzzles, and artistic composition. And all of these things are just as stunning the second time, and I am sure they will be on every other subsequent replay. My absolute favorite part of this game is the scale, as every time you get to see into the bowels of Aperture, you are taken aback by the horror and beauty of the abyss. Also I like the part with the potato, but that is all I'll say about it so it doesn't spoil the fun. Get this game alongside the first Portal, they are absolute necessary plays for anyone in my opinion."

16457,Amazing.
16458,"As someone who has only gotten around to playing the Portal series recently, I was blown away by the sheer creativity and mind-bendingly clever design of these games.

A lot of times, you'll open up a new level, look around 5 secs in and think ""man, I don't even know where to start"" but as you pick up the pieces gradually, you'll find quite often the answer is hidden in an obvious but well-hidden manner. 
And when you finally do manage to put them together and work it out, it feels INCREDIBLY gratifying. At times, you'll do things that don't feel like they're possible at first.

The puzzles themselves are great, and very well-thought out, but what brings all of it together is the story. 
Whether you're a person who likes lore in games or not, you're bound to enjoy the tongue-in-cheek writing and fantastic VA performances present in Portal 2. 
Though there are only a handful of characters in the story, each one is different from the last and each add something to accentuate and contrast the tone of the game, in the best ways possible.

The first game was a monument of its own, bringing something completely new to gaming, and the sequel only builds upon it. I would recommend playing Portal 1 if you care about the story.

The art direction is something else I can truly commend with this game, there are a few different ""locales"" you visit over the course of the story and even though at times the colour palettes can feel minimal, it does a lot with what it's given to work with. 

And even when you're done with the story, there's a multiplayer campaign you can grab a friend along with and rack your brains together to. 

Overall, I can't recommend this enough, such a damn good game."

16494,"Story writing, Easter eggs, and character design...... are totally impressive. 

It has 2 player mod and customizable rounds!

10/10

Note: you might need play portal 1 first, then you will know the story before this one."
16495,"This is the game that steam showcases before you download steam on the website, still a very good game."
16496,"Amazing Game, Great Story Line, Keeps you entertained just enough so you don't get bored, never too frustrating, except for maybe a couple tricky test chambers. Overall, definitely worth the play-through. To this day my favorite game of all time."

16503,"the funniest, most sincere game i have ever seen in my entire life
"
16504,"One of the best single player games I have every come across. Great story and fun game play that is fun and challenging. The co-op mode is also very good, with less story driven components more focused on teamwork. 10/10 would reccomend"
16505,great pseudo-physics puzzles
16506,Funny Portal Man

16510,good
16511,THIS GAME IS SO GOOD THE DIALOGUE AND STORY ARE SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST AND IT STILL STANDS AS SUCH A GOOD GAME EVEN NOW. COULD GET DIFFICULT BUT SO AWARDING
16512,yay!
16513,"incredible. top tier. the story is amazing even if you, like me, haven't played the first game in the portal series. the graphics are great, the music/soundtrack is great and it's worth every penny."
16514,:thumbsup:
16515,meow
16516,"8/10. Has anyone not done co-op yet I need to guide someone still for the achievement, please help me get it."
16517,Instant classic
16518,One of the best games out there PERIOD

10/10"
16520,portal 2
16521,it fun
16522,This game is still fun and the writing is top tier
16523,Amazing Story
16524,compared to the first game this one was beautiful great gameplay even better story would recommend to play the first one first so you can catch up. I never thought i would love a portal game never watched it or touched it until now. would definitely just play the entire game over and over
16525,it is amazing and it HAS MULTIPLAYER THIS TIME!!
16526,Best game EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
16527,"issues with co-op, you cant play split screen. i dont care that you can bypass it with commands. this game is advertised as splitscreen co-op. its a mess to set up aswell. just garbage man."
16528,good :D
16529,Coolio I use my brain cool
16530,portal 2 is a really good game 10/10 would recommend
16531,"On the winter sale this is crazy cheap (you can pick up both portal and portal 2 in a bundle for about £3). If you like puzzles then this is a must-buy. Not only are the puzzles good, so are the characters. It looks so good its hard to imagine this came out around 10 years ago.

Not only does it have a single-player story, there's also a co-op mode (which is a completely separate story) which is great to play with a friend."
16532,good
16533,"10 years later, this game still feels like it has not aged a day."
16534,I played the single player and it is outstanding I hope this studio  is able to get back on it's feet.
16535,"Honestly, i just play this when i'm bored and it helps a lot lol"

This game is so damn good you dont have a choice. You WILL get this game, YOU WILL PRESS PLAY, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME! Just trust me, this game goes on sale for like 85% off every taco tuesday, so just wait until a steam sale, and pick this baby up!

16585,This game is so good. The perfect sequel to the original. Too bad most of it is looking at a loading screen. I haven't tried the co-op yet but I'm sure it also rocks.

☐ Beginner - [This game needs a LOT of brainpower and I don't think a beginner would have the gist of how portal games are played, but you can still give it a go.]
☑ Casual Gamer
☑ Normal Gamer
☑ Expert

☼ Graphics ☼
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☑ Beautiful - Ten years [almost 11] later I couldn't tell that it was made so long ago, even the story and the characters still seem modern.
☐ Fantastic

♬ Music ♬
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☑ Beautiful - really fitting and nice
☐ Fantastic

☠ Difficulty ☠
☐ Easy
☐ Average
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Hard
 ☑Unfair - just a warning this game can get very hard, and it really took 100% brain capacity sometimes for me [but I think that's just me]

§ Bugs §
☐ Bugs destroy the game
☐ Lots of bugs
☑ Few Bugs - where you could get trapped in the wall in multiplayer is the only bug, although every level in the game is extremely well thought through and any exploiting bugs/gameplay designs are combatted and I am really suprised at how many bugs/exploits were patched thought through.
☐ You can use them for speedrun
☐ Nothing encountered

☯ Story ☯
☐ There is none
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☑ Good
☑ Fantastic - I haven't had a fantastic story in any of the games I've played yet, but this one is making me think really hard because I love it. Its amazing and I'm really sad that there will be no portal 3.

⚔ Gameplay ⚔
☑ Frustrating
☐ Sleepy
☐ Boring
☑ Fun
☑ Challenging. - Makes me feel super clever whilst coming up with new level designs throughout the game constantly, I never got bored unless I got extremely frustrated. Also its not a repetitive cycle of frustration and relief, there are many more emotions, and the story is mixed super well with the gameplay so you get a dopamine-rush filled game.

۞ Game time / Length ۞
☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours)
☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)
☑ Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story] [This was even longer for me because I'm quite stupid and don't know how to figure things out]
☑ Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything] - I would say you'd probably be able to squeeze an extra 15-20 hours out of the co-op, and then theres co-op challenge mode and singleplayer challenge mode so you could probably play up to 40 hours if you completed everything while still having fun and being opened up to new experiences.
☐ Very Long (61-100 hours)
☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)

$ Price / Quality $
☑ Full price [I would be willing to pay way more to experience that again. Really great.]
☐ Wait for Sale
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund it if you can


Extra stuff - Honestly this game is one of the best games I have. [And once again - it was made a decade ago] It was super fun and enjoyable, especially when you play co-op with a friend and you get that great teamwork vibe [although I felt really dumb after my teammate just figured everything out for me.] Also there is pretty much no grind for anything in this game apart from achievements. Honestly I had no Idea that portal 2 could be fun. If you're already considering buying it, there is definitely no harm in getting it, especially since the price is so low.  
8.75 out of ten [that's very good]"

16629,"I've Got To Say Even If This Game Was Released In 2011, It's Still A Blast To Play. The Controls Are Intuitive, The Portal Mechanics Are Fun, I Was Worried That I Wouldn't Understand The Gels And The Other New Mechanics But They're Quite Easy To Understand And Quite Fun. So, I Definitely Recommend This Game To Everyone Even If They Don't Play Puzzle Games, Heck Even If They Don't Play Video Games In General. The Most Important Thing I Got From Playing Portal 2 Is ""If Live Gives You Lemons, Take The Lemons Back! I Don't Want Your Damn Lemons! What Am I Supposed To Do With These! Take The Lemons Back And Tell Life's Manager That They Can Eat My Bankrupt Anus!"

16803,"I'm A Potato! Good❤️game
Belarus will appreciate and loves potatoes"
16804,?
16805,can't wait for the third one
16806,it is literally my favorite game ever made
16807,probably one of the best story games ive ever played
16808,"If Portal 1 is a masterpiece, then I have no idea what to call Portal 2... it got everything the first one did good and cranked it up so f*cking high. I had lots of fun, the puzzles feel very satisfying to solve and they're pretty balanced too, didn't got stuck so bad I had to look smth up on youtube not even once. 
Glados is as wonderful and sarcastic as always, and this game also got one who's definitely one of my favorite fictional characters of all time, talking about Wheatley, of course. I cracked up with every one of his lines, the performance by Stephen Merchant is beyond amazing, he's goddamn hilarious.



TL;DR - Play the game, it's a 20/10. (Wheatley's best boy despite of it all)"
16809,nice
16810,it has portals and the number 2
16811,"very good game, challenging puzzles and a fun story that builds of the first one."

16819,10/10 Potato GLaDOS
16820,"For a game that's over 10 years old by this point, you genuinely wouldn't be able to tell. Portal 2 is an absolute classic, everybody NEEDS to experience this game at least once in their life."

It's a ton of fun, CO OP and Single player have two different stories which I like, and they're both extremely fun. Lot's of fun puzzles that are rewarding and even very very fun to play and solve.

I don't like puzzle games, but this is the one and only exception, trust me it's worth it."

The story, humor, pacing, puzzles, everything is so well thought-out and balanced, I don't even think Portal 3 would be necessary at this point. 11/10, whoever doesn't play with amazing game is surely missing out a ton.

+ the story is amazing & so immersive. everything flows well and leads you round the twists expertly.
+ mechanics & methods are taught you so cleverly and in such a way that you don't realise. it's not handhold-y at all.
+ art is AMAZING
+ often there's different ways to complete a puzzle
+ the co-op mode is so much fun & introduces different ways of thinking

this game is a classic, absolutely play it"
16969,"surprisingly fun game, both on co-op or single player. if you want a fun game where you have to solve puzzles, either with a friend or alone, this is the game for you!"
16970,Awesome gameplay with superb writing. Highly recommended
16971,haha game better than life itself. Glad0s is a real one ;)
16972,"The game is fun and all but the problem is here.
I don't have friends and the online matchmaking for co-op is broken."
16973,I'm not the most experienced but it's still an awesome game.
16974,Shoot portal walk through portal and fucking die (10/10)
16975,Amazing puzzle game.  Also nice that it's FPS-style without being gory. Wish there was a third.
16976,good game very entertaining
16977,the best puzzle game i ever played.
16978,"good game, classic"
16979,"Aaah Portal 2... I've always wondered why the reception of this game was so positive, not only on the internet, but also among my friends. I never really understood it, because I don't like puzzle games and solving a puzzle never really gave me that dopamine hit that I get by playing Fps games or games with character building.
When I eventually got to play Portal 2 you better believe I was shocked. The puzzles were great, the narration was entertaining, the jokes and the dialogues were actually funny and the game still looked great even on the aging source engine. It was blasphemous that I refused to play this game just because of the puzzle genre stereotype that I was so used to. I still didn't get that dopamine hit I was crawing for, but the game gave me something else instead - a memorable story, characters and a satisfying ending.
Also the humour in this game can be outstanding, but not everyone will enjoy it and some people may be annoyed by it. I for one loved it, because it's the exact type of humour I love, but that is not universaly true for everyone. Just be aware of the possibility that it could completely miss the mark for you. 
Otherwise the game is amazing, please try it If you haven't before, snatch it on a sale and enjoy both the singleplayer's story as well as the co-op with a friend - you won't regret it."
16980,Fantastic.
16981,"Best game ever, the idea of going from one place to another with a hole is simple yet has endless potential, and this game just shows how much you can do with such idea. The characters and places this game provides is what makes this game even more unique and astounding, the challenging puzzles and its deady traps that twist my brain makes me want to solve even more. The amount of content you're getting too is unbelievably the best, I never knew how much I can get with only a dollar. 10/10 game, 11 even, I love this game so much"

16989,Portal go burrr
16990,"One of my all-time favorite games. The best sequel ever, as well. It improves on the first game in every way possible and still makes me laugh consistently more than 7 years after I first played it."

16992,"You BETTER buy Portal 2, buddy."
16993,duh
16994,very good game.
16995,YES
16996,"OVERALL REVIEW:
10/10, I have many MANY hours but i have switched accounts, and this has been one of my favorite games for years its just a shame valve cant count past 2 otherwise maybe we would get a sequel, but sadly we wont. 

STORY:
It has really good story, and although its best you play the 1st game first (alot), you can just play this game and they explain everything again, and also explain a bit of the first game so you kind of know a bit of backstory for that game if you haven't played it.

PRICE:
Its always pretty cheap, about £7 (and in a bundle with the first game, about £10) but right now its £1 (christmas).

SPEEDRUN:
This game has tons of speedrun potential also, so if you like speedrunning you will probably like this game alot, its as if most of the game was based on speedrunning, BUT you don't need to know how to speedrun to play the game, cause its a great game either way, and if you want to, definitely recommend playing the whole game through atleast once before you start learning to speedrun.

COOP:
The coop is fun also, its an ENTIRE campaign in coop! So definitely get a friend to play it with you or something cause its just as fun as the single-player to me.
You can matchmake with random people too, but although that can still be fun, not as fun as with friends as usual in games.

EXTRAS:
The game also is pretty funny in general. And is a well written puzzle game, it doesnt put you straight into the incredibly complicated levels, starts off with putting a cube on a button... but after a while when you get to the harder levels, its still not too hard, so you dont have to look up the answers (but you might).

Please play this game... its truly a masterpiece :D"

17019,"Words don't describe how good of a game this is, let alone a sequel of the original. The content that this game provides is worth $60 alone.

17130,"One of the best puzzle games ever made. It's funny, creative, beautiful and immersive. That would be enough to recommend it normally, but then there's also a coop campaign with tons of unique puzzles too!

If you've never played Portal 2 and love puzzle games, you should def give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. 

Did I even mention the game has a puzzle designer??? You can play community puzzles endlessly!"
17131,Portals pashoo pashoo weeee
17132,One of the best Valve series ever. But I think the first portal is better.
17133,yes
17134,Funny robot

10 de 10 recomendado"
17136,Yess of course I would recommend !
17137,it is good puzzle game
17138, GLADOSS POTATOE(very funny just like pickle rick from morty and rick funniest shit ive ever seen)
17139,"It's... fine. I played it for a few hours and it's not what I expected. It feels ""dystopian,"" and I was expecting a hyper-futuristic portal game, not a dystopian puzzle game that has a very end-of-the-worldish vibe."
17140,"This game is actually really fun, so many puzzles to work with, and workshop maps, I'm going to learn speedrunning, see you soon!"
17141,"Literally THE best logic game ever created. It has everything: fantastic and innovative gameplay,  great plot, top voice acting and engaging multi. Must play for everyone, especially on sale."
17142,"i recommend you to play all the half-life games first, but if you don't care much about the story I recommended you to play this game."
17143,"It is a very fun game, and has amazing characters!
"
17144,ok game
17145,just look at the hours

17153,"!!!SPOILERS AHEAD, BE WARNED!!!

This game is absolutely a fun experience - Coming back to the test chambers with Wheatley by your side, GlaDOS waking up and subjecting you to the same rodeo as last time, her even getting stuffed into a potato makes this game quite a fun one. 

Don't forget the multiplayer, which is some of the most fun I've had with friends. 100% recommend."

17161,"Wah. Entahlah, agak sulit mendeskripsikannya. Saat pertama memainkannya memang mudah dan menyenangkan, tetapi di tengah mulai menyebalkan dan berharap cepat selesai karena kesulitannya. Namun di di akhir menjadi kembali menyenangkan dan sama seperti Portal 1, entah bagaimana kesan emosional akan pertemuan dan perpisahan muncul kembali, padahal cerita lengkapnya saya belum paham dan gamenya hanya beberapa jam hahaha. Jadi, game ini cocok untuk Anda yang suka puzzle, FPS, suka tantangan yang meminta mikir. Kurang cocok untuk Anda yang tergesa-gesa ingin menyelesaikan game, apalagi yang porsi ceritanya seperti cut scennya sedikit.

Catatan: Direkomendasikan untuk menyelesaikan single player tanpa melihat walkthrough, kepuasan yang didapat akan murni hehe."

17172,Great game
17173,"Great Price, Amazing Story, Really Fun Game, buy it now. I literally cannot think of a single flaw with this game."
17174,"Portal 2 is a fantastic game. It improves every single aspect of Portal besides one thing which I will get to later. The graphics are beautiful and fantastic. It really looks great. The gameplay is fun and introduces new stuff that wasn't in the original Portal. The story is neat, the puzzles are fun, this is a really good game. However, at least in my opinion, it doesn't quite have the same mysterious feeling the original Portal did. Overall though, it's a great game, and I'd recommend you play it if you like puzzle games."

17188,BEST GAME EVER.
17189,"Both Portal and Portal 2 are classic games, introducing iconic characters, fascinating and innovative mechanics, and an entirely fresh take on a first-person shooter game. Portal 2 adds new lore to the history of the main character, as well as the main antagonist, and a cooperative dynamic, with statistics of each player, the ability to emote, and plenty of rooms of puzzles which encourage you to think on the go, the latter of which is much like the main game. While some areas of the game are almost free-roam and it isn't always immediately clear where you're intended to go, the platforming is mostly straightforward, and the eventual payoff and the satisfaction of solving a puzzle or completing the game is generally worth it, at least in my opinion. I'd highly recommend the franchise to any and all people who like games."
17190,"very good 
need friends for coop tho"
17191,Narrator is kind of a witch but i guess its fun
17192,"portal two is a such a game for gamers, i would never play portal two without my gamer buddies, because it's a game for buddies who are gamers to play, yk? Facts are only available here folks."

Puzzle design is impeccable, graphics are exceptionally good and have stood the test of time, soundtrack is a banger, story and dialogue are witty and intriguing, and it gives players infinite replayability with community-made maps and an incredibly easy to use in-game editor."

17228,"Yes.
It's Portal 2, one of the greatest (and most funny) games of the 2010s. Unfortunately you can't pull out Half-Life 2 weaponry but it's amazing none the less."

17240,i love this game! its the best! it can even run on my crappy laptop!!!
17241,Literally best Valve story game?????
17242,"This is a nice puzzle game to play when you're bored. It works your brain but it's also something semi-chill where you can try to solve puzzles (some easy, some not) while talking to friends, watching TV/Youtube, or listening to music (which I do for most games I play, but this is a nice background game). It's also so fun, the graphics, the playstyle, and the game, in general, is great. And I absolutely love Wheatley."
17243,Only thing wrong with this game is that it isn't four times longer
17244,"I’ll continue waiting for portal 3 until the end of my lifetime I will wait, hoping that perhaps I’ll have the chance to play portal 3 before I die."
17245,fun and challenging game
17246,played this while drunk off my ass once pretty lit ngl
17247,lovely
17248,Big robot make fun of me
17249,"a classic. if you dont know what the portal series is, then play it right now"
17250,this game has a LOT of story behind it and i think you should try it. its a puzzle game with humer.
17251,gud
17252,one of the best games ever and its a really good game 10/10
17253,holds up. Amazing Graphics and great story. Nice mechanics. Community test chambers are the best feature.
17254,"i got to beat up my brother in co-op

10/10"
17255,"This is portal 2. It has funny multiplayer. I played with a man named William, and I made jokes about doing his sister the entire time, it was an epic gaming moment. Kudos to William for being a good sport.

PS. William, tell your sister I said hi, and to call me.

5/5"
17256,"This was the first game I ever got on steam, and remains to this day one of the finest in my library. It's a sequel that I wouldn't say surpasses its predecessor, but elegantly builds on it in every way. The music, visuals, voice acting, characters, and gameplay are all top tier. If you aren't a lunatic like me who's content merely replaying the campaign over and over, the co-op and community content both provide hours of additional content. 10/10 game."

17259,"amazing gaem, it makes you think harder than any college exam in existence

10/8"
17260,Everything about the game is done perfectly ... the only thing I feel about the game is love <3
17261,A puzzle game with just the right level of hardness for me. Very funny dialogue in parts. If there is a fly in the ointment then it's the robot Wheatley. The voice is annoying and doesn't fit the game.
17262,funny
17263,Fun and challenging game. One of my favourites
17264,just a lot of fun

17270,It was the best ending ever
17271,escape room
17272,"its good
"
17273,"It requires you to think laterally, i.e. the solution is not always ""straight ahead.""  It also does not rely on youthful eye-hand cordination, barring you from progressing just because you're not quick enough.  The graphics are good and there is a sense of playfulness about the entry environment."

17282,Great puzzles. I never played the first one but really enjoying it. Clever little game
17283,very fun to play and build puzzles!
17284,"Tests, check. Good co-op, check. Wheatley, check. A gun that shoots portals, check.

I give this game my highest rating: 10 Potatoes out of 10 Glados'"

17310,It's a hole lotta fun!
17311,this game feels as good as the some of the trailers say it is it feels nostalgic it puzzles your brain to make you think and rewords you with some quirky voice lines  betrayals and victory  the coop is fun and the story deserves to have more every time i see this game in my library i have memory of good times just flood back into me and sometimes i replay it just for the moments
17312,fun
17313,very fun good game
17314,it is amazxing
17315,Got totally stuck.
17316,"I am glad that Valve is not a prolific developer. While their graphics and physics are generally ahead of their time, The bleak story lines and acrid sense of humor is wholly unwelcome as far as I'm concerned. I wish there were more non-Satanic non-Free Masonic game developers out there."
17317,"Played this game before but redownloaded recently and it has stood the test of time. Great puzzles, narrative, and dialogue. 10/10"
17318,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

17341,Great story
17342,"super fun , wish there were more multiplayer levels to keep on playing"
17343,"Very good gameplay, good graphics, almost no bugs and a good community. Everything a masterpiece needs and deserves."
17344,fun thinking game that will puzzle you until you decide to watch a walkthrough.
17345,"Very good game design with puzzles that are just shy of being too hard, but at the same time being so engaging. One of the best voiceovers ever done, with the main ""robot"" sphere feeling like an actual person."
17346,go but it with bundle cause history is lineup to this game and its a realy realy hard its also nice game but some players says multiplay isnt fun but i think fun only thing multiplayer looks bad chapters are repeating self

17352,"Extremely intelligent game, clever riddles, awesome graphics, funny AI chatter and on top of all endless fun due to a level design and share possibility for all player!
Highly recommended. I ask myself why did I discover PORTAL 2 that late?"
17353,5Head
17354,"Valve totally handled turning it into a real game, not just a pack of levels for testing their portal mechanic. There are enough drama, plot twists and hilarious dialogs to call it a good story and for the first time in the dilogy I could feel a real scale of the facility we are in. 

Also, GLaDOS is the best girl, no doubt."
17355,epic portals
17356,Hesitate to buy this game will make you regret
17357,yes
17358,"Awesome game putting it's own unique twist on physics-based puzzles, with a story and cast that's funny, yet engaging. I really enjoyed the different strings of dialogue between the characters GLaDOS and Wheatley, and the characters felt way more fleshed out than the characters in the previous iteration, and Wheatley is my personal favorite of the cast due to how funny he is (which might have been helped by the fact he was voiced by Stephen Merchant). All in all, great game 10/10, would recommend."
17359,fun puzzle game
17360,"Less minimalist than the first game, but only because it has better content."
17361,HEY DID YOU KNOW U GO MAKE PORTAL IN THIS GAME AND SLOBVE INSANE PUZZLES AND ISANS AYLSUM AND ITS INSAN AND CARZY AND THER IS LUTEARLLY AN AMIOJNG US MAN IN IT ATCAILLY PRANKING IRL AND MY JKETYBAORD BROKE BECIAS EIOF IUT BECUASE ITS SO SUSSY ghajsfgyuasfguisagfyouasguj andmnasfyiuahjkfb hjsafg i7uyoas ilopuyloasu 89piusayi7p urfasiuof hjnuka

17363,I loved the puzzles
17364,"10+ years later, still the highest quality game Valve's ever released. Just absolutely brilliant."
17365,Challenging puzzles with great graphics and you can also build your own puzzles too!!!!

9/10"
17375,An incredible addition to a stellar franchise that once again proves valve can't count to 3. Multi-player puzzler with user-submitted content that really brings the moon into perspective.
17376,Very simple yet fun strategy arcade game. Highly Recommended. Co-op is cool too.
17377,The puzzels can be tuff but they will always stay logical

17395,Great game. The level builder adds a lot of value beyond the campaigns.
17396,I liked the plot twist and the complexity of the game.
17397,"love the game m8
"
17398,yea
17399,Good Game BUY NOW
17400,"awesome game you should get
"
17401,"One of the best games of its genre. I like this game better than portal 1 for the insanity that takes place in it. I'm not going to write an overblown review for this game as almost everyone that was interested has played it. I do hope valve makes a VR version of this game as it would be fantastic!

Just a quick breakdown: 
This is a first person, story-driven, puzzle game with lots of charm and humor. If you like any of those things pick it up as you won't be wasting your money. While it's not essential to play the first game, I would suggest it since this game follows in its footsteps. The first is not as charming as this game, but it still has some good moments."
17402,i hate this game
17403,"Let perfect than the first, but larger, zanier, and brilliant in its own right."
17404,hehe speedy thing go brrrrrrr
17405,It's a piece of cake!
17406,good lore 👍
17407,"Cause steam wont stop asking me if I would recommend 
:)"
17408,"good
"
17409,It's like a movie the story is so good.
17410,"i beat this game already
fun and it feels good to complete puzzles
ending made me shed a tear

overall recommend it"
17411,"Funny and fun and better than the original, play it stop reading its reviews"
17412,"it was amazing
"
17413,"ITS SO GOOD. It can be a little hard sometimes but other than that the game play is awesome, the story was great and I recommend this game even if you only want to play the story. I 100% recommend this game."
17414,"Amazing game! For $10, it is a no-brainier to buy as soon as you have a ready PC. This will run on most computers."
17415,"I like it.. idk why but still didnt even start even portal 1 but still played through portal 2 and i had lot a fun....

u need use ur  brain and mind to connect path to make it work and jne
Nice storyline

I like audio cuz its not fucked and also i like that u can make ur own custtom map as u would like to make em and funnt fact about that is its not even hard to play through so yeah i like it"
17416,Arguably one of the best games ever made. Co-op is best.
17417,"In my opinion, this is the perfect game. The story, acting, dialogue and puzzles are the best that I have seen in any game. This is a must play"
17418,"bad, could only play for 10 mins"
17419,"Amazing, even better than Portal 1"
17420,Glados... 🥴👀
17421,"omega poggers, my friend became the main villain after i didnt want to play the bonus levels"
17422,"This game is amazing. There is nothing else I have to say, but I will. This used to be my favorite game of all time, and one I replayed many times on the Xbox 360 when I first got it. This game is as close to perfection as it could possibly be, bar one puzzle that frustrated me. It takes everything the first game did, and enhance it by 20 times. The puzzles, game play, humor, there isn't a single thing I can't think of that I don't like about this game outside of one bad puzzle. I can't say what the multiplayer is like, but I bet it's fun as well. Buy the game at any price, and you won't regret it."
17423,Good
17424,portal gun go brrr
17425,IT WAS GOOD
17426,:D
17427,Yea
17428,"What can I say that thousands haven't say yet? It's amazing, it's Portal, I'll always want more. I dream of the day when the black screen at the start of a mysterytrailer lasts a little longer than it should, and suddenly Glados's voices comes over, offering us cake yet again."
17429,"amazing yes

17433,Good game hurt brain. Yes. Get if have money 👍
17434,I don’t have the required brain cells for this game
17435,because
17436,"Awesome, but portal 1 needs a prequel"
17437,"Best game i've ever played +1,000,000 social credit"
17438,Portal 1 is one of the best games ever made. This is just more portal. Can't go wrong. The portal collection is a must have.
17439,"Incredible game. Truly one of the best games on steam. GlaDOS and Wheatley are absolutely hilarious. Choosing which is better is a tough assignment. And the puzzles are really well done too. I had a tough time picturing how they would innovate on the previous game, and they succeeded. The only part of the game I didn't like was chapter 6 and 7. Without saying any spoilers, they were in very large, open rooms, and a lot of the difficulty I had was finding a hidden small segment of wall to portal to. The puzzles in those two chapters were a bit weird, although the new puzzle mechanic in those chapters was awesome. Those two chapters also contain a lot of lore, but the plot for those chapters was a bit hard to follow. 

Anyway awesome game, one of the best on steam. Buy it! Wait for a sale if you're unsure.

Edit: just finished the game. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. The game dragged on a bit long imo. But seriously, two of the funniest characters ever, the puzzles were mostly great, and the ending is amazing. I can't wait to play coop."
17440,"Even better than the 1st, which was a hard act to follow.
Why is there no Portal 3 in the works?"
17441,"This is one of my favourite games. I'm not really sure why, but everything about it just seems so amazing. The soundtrack is brilliant, the gameplay is fun, I really enjoyed the story, and something about the environments all the way throughout the game just feels amazing. I don't know how to describe it, I don't feel I'm doing the game justice, but it's just great."
17442,It's fun and cerebral. Would recommend.
17443,I really enjoyed high fiving my friend 30 times

17461,"Good game.
Nice story.
Interesting mechanics."
17462,During my covid-19 lock down i decided to endeavour playing both portal one and portal two. I thoroughly underestimated how beautiful and great these games really were. Knowing how bad left for dead was i really didn't want to waste my time with the company ever again but... I gave it a chance and it still sucks!
17463,zajebiste
17464,"Best coop game of all time easily, very good highly recomended"
17465,Good game! The ending is really nice and its cool that you have a level editor (that's actually easy to use). Haven't tried the co-op mode but it looks cool; the workshop makes the game still interesting even after finishing it.
17466,Yes
17467,speedy thing goes in speed thing goes out... again
17468,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm beep beep beep! *presses cancel* beep. *opens microwave* ptong.  *takes out steaming hot ramen* sizzzzzle. *closes microwave* clud.
17469,Portal 2 is leaps and bounds better than Portal 1. The story is outstanding and the mechanics are very smooth. Make sure to play Portal 1 before Portal 2! It is a shame they did not make a Portal 3.
17470,good :thumbs_up:

17637,on my 3rd playthrough
17638,"An absolutly fantastic game. I regard it as the best one i've ever played, i'm still new to pc games, but biy, VALVe went all out with this one. Every single chamber, place and even objects are so detailed, and though through, so that the player can still explore evrywhere without getting lost or stuck. I'll replay it again, because even the lore is written so well. 10/10"

17651,"this is the most wonderfull game i have ever seen. An amazing seqel to the first game. the game got 3-4 hours long story and voice acting. in the game the test's are pretty easy but some of them are tricky! if the game is too easy for you and you played the story mode like 3 times, just download some maps from the workshop and have some fun! the game also has coop mode, where you and your friend have to help each other to get to the end of the test chamber. for me the game has no issues and you don't need a super computer to handle it."
17652,GOAT
17653,Great Game!!!
17654,launched myself head first into a wall at the speed of sound and was protected from brain damage by my boots. very good
17655,i love it so much also cave Johnson is a dilf
17656,good but it is very hard at some Levels

17660,must play game(but play portal 1 first).
17661,amazing
17662,"Portal 2 is an absolute classic! Phenomenal storytelling, and excellent gameplay make for one of the greatest experiences video games can provide. I've played through the story mode of Portal 2 three times now getting something new each and every time. 

10/10
 A must have!"
17663,Amazing Game with an amazing plot and puzzles
17664,this is like physics and science class in school but a video game. My brain hurts.
17665,It's hella nice
17666,"2011 ... can you believe that the graphics and atmosphere are still so damn good by now? It's just one of the greatest puzzle games from VALVE ever, not to start about the good story in it as well. This is one of those few Games where the sequel is even better than the first one. Also to me and many others this game togheter with the first portal is some real nostalgia"
17667,"Great Character Writing, challenging puzzles, interesting lore."
17668,realy good game  after i forgot what ending looked like i went back and well its still one of the best games in terms of game design music and most defenetly ending song with  the turrets and i will admit it made me a little sad  when it ended
17669,yes
17670,this game ... is good yes
17671,Portals am I right

17684,portal 2
17685,"still a good game after so many years, honestly has better graphics than some games right now"
17686,I really do recommend.
17687,great thinking game
17688,"i bought this again, worth! basically best game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/1"
17689,one day valve will learn the number that comes after 2
17690,"Still good, after 10 years"
17691,this game is so underrated omg its amazing
17692,its one of the best puzzel games ever
17693,Patato
17694,i like potatoes
17695,love puzzles
17696,its great
17697,"This game has a special place in my heart. 100/10 amazing everything. 
Puzzles are addicting and my favourite part is when GLaDOS turns into a potato. 
I keep coming back to play and I enjoy the co-op feature with my friends."
17698,"This game is both tough and enjoyable, with some levels requiring strategic thinking to complete."
17699,I enjoyed it a lot .
17700,"I remember trading in my GameCube and most of it's games just to get this game on launch at GameStop, and while I don't think it was worth getting day 1, it's still a fantastic game over all that you're a fool if you still haven't played it."
17701,This game is fine. I myself am delighted with the amazing graphics due to the fact that this game is already old. But it can be done in less than 2 hours because the levels are a bit easy
17702,Just get the game if you are looking at this
17703,pordl the sequel
17704,portal and portal 2 are great but if you want a harder challenge try portal reloaded it adds a time portal to the mix 3 portals in total. Hope we actually get a chocolate cake on this one I am hungry.
17705,"originally played this game back on the ps3, and i found it to be amazing and mind blowing, so it was a must have game when i finally built my PC. and of course it was just as amazing and even more-so than it was on the ps3 (for obvious reasons i would hope)."
17706,"Clever puzzles, witty humor, and graphics that hold up incredibly well for a 2011 game. Why haven't you played this already?"
17707,yes
17708,"Good game, Finished it in seven hours though so a bit short but a good story line."
17709,most creative game of the world i think
17710,its portal 2 do i say more
17711,fun and diverse puzzles that make you feel smart
17712,btuh
17713,"game still fun (:

"
17714,"my new favourite game, somehow has an even better story than the original and great twist villian."
17715,"Fun game, some parts like portals made my brain hurt."
17716,"Portal 2, one of the most satisfying and fun sequels to ever sequel. Doom II, The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2. The sequel that takes the original and improves upon it in nearly every way. If you like puzzles, buy it. If you like Portal, definitely buy it."
17717,I feel like the bigget dumbass
17718,pretty neat ngl
17719,This game gives me so much nastalga
17720,"My Favourite Valve Game soo far
10/10 Portal"
17721,I recommend playing both Portal 1 and Portal 2. I think that Portal 2 has a lot more story and I personally like it better but you need to play Portal 1 to understand some of the story.
17722,Easily in my top 3 games of all time. I'm writing this while I install it to do my 4th play through
17723,best game ever made ngl
17724,"Best game of all time, assuming you enjoy puzzles"
17725,"It's been ten years since Portal 2 was released, and it's an undeniable classic. It was the game that got me into Steam in the first place!  The physics in this game are a work of art, I'm always so impressed with how seamlessly you can pass through the portals. Not to mention the hilarious comedy. I wish I could play Co-Op."
17726,yes
17727,No shit
17728,Great story. Love the jokes.
17729,Fun to play alone or with a friend
17730,"this game saved my live during a dark time one of the best games ever made, highly recommend"

17753,"If I was ever asked to replay a game for the first time again, I would choose this game."
17754,169 hours yes I lick gam
17755,"the co-op rock paper scissors taunt has such a wide radius it's amazing

also the game is really good but that's pretty funny I must admit"
17756,Sidewalk
17757,"Probably one of, if not, the best games of all time. Fuck Half life. Fuck Ocorina of Time. Fuck Majoras Mask. Fuck Halo 3. Fuck Witcher 3. This game is better then all of them. Fuck 'em. I dont care, ill say it. All of those other games are fucking dog shit. Old Zeldas' play like shit, Half life is boring, Witcher takes way to goddamn long to play, and Halo is a subpar shooter. Portal 2 beats fucking all of them."
17758,
17759,"Portal 2 is one of the best game experiences I have ever had. Its use of world building, atmosphere, ambience, sound design, and basically everything is so well done that this game clearly establishes its place as one of my favorite games. There is so much I could list about this game, but there isn't enough time to write it all. Purchase this game. Its clearly one of the best games on steam and everyone should own it. Buy it. It should cost way more than it does considering how much you get. Please buy this game."
17760,lots of fun and low stress.
17761,
17762,best story game i have ever played
17763,"Portal 2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played, up there with the giants. It may not be long, but it does not have to be. Its fun and that's all that matters.

Well, too bad we won't get any more games, as the fat lady has sang."
17764,"The new gel mechanics are excellent. The only one I had trouble with was the portal coating one, which was unpredictable, at least in my limited testing"

17767,"deeper story, innovative thinking, overall sik big brain play. 10/10"
17768,It builds on the first game and the puzzle solving aspect is pretty interesting given that it requires spacial awareness.
17769,"Jesus christ I cried so hard Valve, PLEASE LEARN HOW TO COUNT TO 3."
17770,"This game was really scary when i first played, it gave me that scary vibes of the unknown i had on portal 1, really well made game."
17771,I really like the game and have over 24 hours on it and would definitely recommended getting it. I would also recommended getting portal 1 and maybe when you finish the game you could install some mods.
17772,"very fun, but all the robots hate you. says a lot about you as a person."
17773,full of witty commentary that never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times i play it
17774,"This game is so cool. I'm not sure how it is single player but me and my bf played is split screen. We each had a robot character that could make 2 portals and we had to figure out how to reach the exit. I guess it's kinda like an escape game XD except more like a puzzle. Some of them are really challenging and you have to think hard to figure out where to place the portals to get to a different part in the building. Play it with someone smart lol, I wouldn't recommend this for little kids, you will be stuck on level 1 forever XD"
17775,fun

17831,Best game ever.
17832,Great fun!
17833,Great game. So many puzzles
17834,I like it much better than the first one because of the co-op feature. Also the story-line of single player continues from the first game so I still suggest playing the first one first.
17835,This game made me feel like a the smartest man alive

17841,"While it doesn't have as good as an atmosphere or soundtrack as the original Portal, Portal 2 more than makes up for it in story and content. This game is an absolute must-play."
17842,i put my cock through a portal and finally managed to suck myself. not worth
17843,"Absolutely amazing game, that I cannot get enough of, even after beating it 5 times."
17844,"I always knew Portal 2 was a well-loved game but it still blew me away after finally playing through it for the first time. The story line is amazing, especially considering the plot of the first Portal is pretty vague to build off of. I felt completely immersed in the story like I was watching a movie. As a big fan of both the US and UK The Office, I love Stephen Merchant and he did such a great job voicing Wheatley. His dialogue is hilarious throughout the whole game. Portal 2 is definitely one of the greatest video games I've ever played and I highly recommend it. 10/10"

17860,cool.
17861,"Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. It's brilliant, has decent replayability, every time you play through you discover a new little detail, etc. I recommend you play Portal first, but I hadn't, and still thoroughly enjoyed the game-- though I appreciated the little details and nods a lot more after playing through the original Portal. Worth every penny."

"
17902,"I like it so I will buy Portal 3 right away but ONLY if it comes out next year, or the year after."
17903,"Portal 2 remains a shining achievement in gaming, a classic that stands as the masterpiece that many since its release have idolized, taken inspiration from, and iterated on. While the original Portal lays the groundwork for the game mechanically and narratively, Portal 2 runs with a bunch of new ideas and takes every idea to its next logical extreme. The writing is an evergreen flavor of funny, delivering comedy effortlessly unlike many games which try so hard to get a laugh. The game's main trio of performances cannot be understated, and set the tone behind dozens of intricately designed puzzle rooms that have a knowledgeable set of progression that never feels like a massive leap in understanding for the player. The sequel's best moments are traversing through open spaces finding just the right area to portal to (ha), and I hope if a third game ever sees the light, taking this idea to more open world level design (similar to a Control or Mario Odyssey structure) would be a further extension on the simple, but extraordinary power of the portal gun."
17904,power went out while gaming on this otherwise pretty good game
17905,Cool game you should play it.
17906,"This absolute masterpiece of a game will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole campaign. You'll have the chance to build a solid friendship between P-body and Atlas while also stabilizing your real life friendship as well. You'll solve problems, laugh, cry, but most importantly; you will portal through the barren wasteland of the testing facilities with your best friend. You may develop some head trauma and even develop some brain aneurysms throughout the game but it will definitely take you on a journey from start to finish. 

10/10 would recommend."
17907,good game for those who like puzzels or if a good recomendation for people entering the gaming scene
17908,Portal and Portal 2 are masterpieces.

17916,amazing
17917,"I always wanted to play this game as a kid, having known nothing about it aside from the fact that you play with portals. Now that I have played it (twice), I can safely say it is one of my all time favorite games and I recommend it as a game for anyone who hasn't played it before. 

P.S. GLaDOS could kill me and I'd thank her."
17918,fun
17919,Super fun! One of the very first games I ever played. Probably the best!

17922,Good game!!!
17923,White Gel ??!?!?!?
17924,Potato
17925,"SPAAAACE!!
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE!!

This is the most iconic game i've ever played from valve, this, Portal 1 and Garry's mod.

All the characters have the best development possible. GLADOS? the best of the entire saga
The game asks you to use your last remaining braincell, 
or divide that same braincell you've got with your friend on co-op

But for the portal fans, i ask, is the cake a lie, or it is true?

One of the best things i absolutely love on this game, it's the speedrun community
They overcome each update of the game doing faster, better, and competitively on the rank!

See one of these speedruns and see for yourself, you brain could melt if you never watched speedruns before, and is really incredible!

Portal 2 is like Portal 1. Dialed up to 11 in every category I mentioned before!
I can not remember when a computer game made me laugh uncontrollably like a lunatic. Poral 2 managed that several times.
This game is almost 10 years old and still blows 95% of all other modern games out of the water. It is a triumpf of game design and storytelling.
If you are a PC gamer and  don't have played this game, you should have your computer confiscated and your internet acccess revoked before you embarass yourself even more.

on a more realistic note, portal 2 was the best game i played in 2021. i feel bad having put off buying it for so many years. the groundwork that was set by the first portal was expanded on and made astronomically better in the second installment. i 100% recommend this (and the first one) to anyone who has a low end pc and wants to have a game they can sink hours into. the comedy in these games, albeit cheesy, is charming and lovable. 200% would recommend"

18039,I really love this game. In this game you need to think carfuly and this is a greate game with sroryline too. Good game!
18040,"Fantastic story, along with some great problem solving tasks that are sometimes mind-boggling but with determination the reward for the completion along with the turns and twist of the story are fantastic."
18041,The Portal series is one of the most unique and charming IPs to come out of Valve Software. Your money will be well spent purchasing both Portal and Portal 2.
18042,po
18043,"I like the flowers, I like the rolling hills, I like the dusty rain and the summer shine.
Dum dee da dee dum dee da dee dum dee da dee dUm de daa dee"
18044,"Great game.  Even better than the original.  At the current prices, really the best bang for the buck on Steam."
18045,"Played this on PS3 to death back in the day. Great gameplay, great story and excellent voice acting. It's a lot of fun, and then add to that the ability to play in cooperative and community levels, it's a great offering. One of the top 10 games of the 2010s for sure."
18046,One of the best Co-Op puzzle game if you wanna enjoy.
18047,Absolutely Amazing
18048,Bruh
18049,"It's Portal 2, what else am I supposed to say?"
18050,Yeah at this point don't question and buy the game (if you want wait for discount but still play this game to end) you certanly enjoy it if you played portal 1 and like puzzle games not gonna say more
18051,One of the best games ever.

18061,"This is such a nice experience, if you haven't played portal yet, just go for it and play both games, one of the best narratives in video game history."
18062,i think its a very good game like it definately recommend
18063,Excellent game-play awesome story and very creative puzzles. You will sometimes take  few minutes stuck on a level in the later stages. Don't give up and if you are stuck for toooo long use a youtube video to progress(don't make it a habit)
18064,"I haven't found a game that is as fun, humorous and clever as Portal 2 since it came out. I'm going to play it again right now actually!"
18065,Really good puzzle game  i love these types of games ;)

18075,"One of the best games I've ever played, whether you're into puzzle games or not, this is an incredible game to play regardless. Great story, great levels, satisfying ending, and still leaves you wanting more. The custom puzzles created by the community are a great way to keep playing, even after you're done the main story. Easy 10/10, would play over and over again."

18082,"Good Game. Spectacular Game. I play this game for no other reason than smoking Grant. What do you expect? The guy SUCKS at the game. 1:37 on level 4 of the mass and gravity challenge co-op levels? is that some sort of sick joke? The guys a bozo, literal clod. We fly through the levels smoking grant at every possible opportunity sometimes even halving his pathetic joke of a time. This game is for simple minded buffoons such as Grant himself. ""But Jamal!"" i hear you say and to you I say I already know what you are going to say ""Did you not say this game was a Good Game. Spectacular Game"" this was directed for simple minded small guys like Grant, if you were not a simple minded little greedy thieving man like Grant you would know this already, check yourself before you wreck yourself."
18083,portal

18103,very good mind game
18104,portale
18105,"Mmm yes game of hole on wall gun, cube, and gel plus lazor."
18106,"An ""escape room"" game with portals. Except that this game is the best ""escape room"" game I've ever played. It doesn't stress the players too much and the solution becomes all the more obvious the more you look at it."
18107,CAKE

18114,This is how you do a sequel.
18115,nah
18116,"Portal 2. It's portal. But more portal-ey. Also there's co-op. Why are you even reading this? Why haven't you already started playing this game? The only reason to not play this game is if you haven't played the first one.
*ferris bueller end scene*"
18117,boo
18118,Good game
18119,best
18120,"This game is great. The level design is good, it's funny, it has a pretty good story and the music design is good. I also like how they paid attention to little details, like when you fly through the air a song will fade in and out. For only $10, this game is a must-buy for anybody who likes puzzle solving or adventure games for PC. Plus, whenever you beat a level without looking it up, you instantly feel like a genius. 9.9/10, didn't get any cake."
18121,"This game is AMAZING,the puzzles are challenging, the ending is great, the game play is fascinating, and above all else it left me wanting to play more. Thank you VALVE for this amazing game, hope you eventually make another even though you probably wont. :)"
18122,Wow
18123,Honestly one of the best single-player games I've ever played. Would definitely recommend you play portal this game after portal 1.

18151,[spoiler] get tricked by a sad little robot man and still end up feeling bad for the lil fella 101 [/spoiler]
18152,Maybe my brain was too smooth but the puzzles seemed like they weren't as flexible as the first game. You know the old Simsity games where you had to put down the road just right? That's the feeling I got from this game too often. I seem to be in the minority on that though.
18153,nice puzzles and funny history
18154,"One of the most iconic puzzle games ever made. Unique design, concept, characters, gameplay, everything. A masterpiece of the highest degree."
18155,Very time consuming

18175,"very very good, better than the first"
18176,"my favorite game, ive played it multiple times over and I cant get enough of the story. I love the sense of nostalgia the characters feel within the later parts of the game, and I feel a rush through all character interactions. Really well made, 10/10, best game of our current time, even though its a little older now."
18177,"Classic platforming puzzler, doesn't get old"

18187,"A co-op puzzle game where you are a survivor who has to work their way through puzzles made by an artificial intelligence using just your wits and a PORTAL GUN. You can play 1 OR 2 players to figure out theses puzzles.

18190,Amazing puzzles and an all around fantastic game.
18191,good
18192,"If you haven't yet, buy this game (and the first one) and play them yourself. Truly a masterpiece. The ending is still, in my opinion, the best in all of video game history."
18193,potato
18194,i like this game i reccomend it to others but if you do not half portal one get it first i beat portal and portal 2 in the end you portal to the moon and then whetley goes in to space and then you get pulled in to glados'es layer and the you get told some stuff by glados and the you go up to the surfes andin the meantime you get a song sung to you by the turrets and then get kicked ou of a shed and then they give you a companyon cube and the very end you see a counter strike global offensive map but it is a very good game
18195,"I've replayed the game so many times on my Ps3,Xbox,old steam acc and now on this, The game is so good and I can't get enough of it I have played the game since 2013 and I use to watch Youtubers and people play it the voice casting was so good for the game and the story is so much of an upgrade from portal.(The jokes in the game make me die) I hope they start making some sort of portal 3 even if it is worse than the others so valve bring are most loved game back to life! Thanks Valve for making my most memorial game."
18196,damn its so good

Wheatley/10

j.k It's the best puzzle-platformer ever made, buy it."
18204,this game made my dick grow 12 inches more.. now my dick is 13 inches
18205,It's portal 2.
18206,goood
18207,"Might be the greatest sequel in history. SO many more levels, SO many more characters, SO much more backstory, and it even has co-op! Normally sequels just build off of the first game (I don't deny that this does too) but this doesn't build. It completely overshadows it. The first game was a pure classic, but this takes Portal into the modern era. The graphics are impeccable, showing you the full capabilities that Valve brings to the table. There are so many more voice actors, fully immersing you in a way that Portal never could. And the twist. Ah, the twist. To quote Jack Black, ""A good story has a beginning. A middle. And the Twist."" I never saw it coming. There is also so much more raw, delicious plot! An unlikely partnership, a painful backstab, and again, a beautifully-written song at the end. I recommend that all players of Portal and Half-Life should IMMEDIATELY get this game and play RIGHT NOW! But not just for Portal and Half-Life players. ALL gamers should put this on their wishlist, if they haven't already."
18208,"If you haven't played this before, seriously, don't hesitate, just buy this game. You won't regret it.

I can honestly say this is easily one of the best games ever made. Hours of fun, even for a casual like me. You'll keep coming back to it every now and then to admire it. Even the story was incredible, and all of the one-liners in this game (and there are A LOT) make me laugh every single time."

I was probably somewhere between 8-10 when I first played this on my friend's old gaming computer and I remember thinking it was the best thing I had ever seen. I remember when I went home I BEGGED my parents to buy me a copy and on my birthday they did. I have played this game one 3 generations of console now, (X-Box, One and, Series X) and the hour count for my steam account, is nowhere near accurate. Easily one of the best video games I've ever played and a revolutionary take on a puzzle game. Thank you Valve for this amazing piece of my childhood."
18243,Incredible puzzle game! One of the funniest games ever made! Once you've beaten story mode there is a great map building community to keep it fresh! 10/10 can't wait for portal 3!!!

I only knew about the portal part and the puzzle part which kinda of pushed me away from trying the game but after playing portal and portal 2 I can say, these games are amazing and a must play!

18347,this game is cool but a very obvious lack of super mario
18348,"It's Portal. For my type of gaming, so far the series has been darn near perfect. Although the bot thing is really annoying ( I think he is supposed to be), it's still a great game."
18349,"10/10 - This game gave me lemons, but I didn’t make lemonade. I made the game take the lemons back! I got mad! I didn’t want their damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? I demanded to see the game's manager! Make this game rue the day it thought it could give me lemons! ""Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"""
18350,"i like it, it very uwu poggers"

18361,"yes
"
18362,good
18363,Yes.
18364,"This is Valve's magnum opus. While the Half Life games were Valve's experimental tech demos, Portal was Valve going all out. This game is so widely loved and influential because it changed everything. The story is a perfect amalgamation of tongue in cheek humor and dark, infinitely mysterious secrets. The few characters this game has are all perfectly amazing and captivating. The music is beyond memorable and the gameplay is puzzle game perfection. I keep using the word perfect too much, but that's because I truly believe that Portal 2 is the closest to perfect out of all the games I've ever played. 10/10"
18365,Yes.
18366,"wait you dont own it already?
"
18367,i liked the part when i used portals
18368,"    The Portal games are unlike any other kind of game out there. I think of it as a 'Cognitive Gauntlet', because you have to think your way around, and out. In ""Portal 2"", there are also so many user-created add-on's, that the game never has to end. In fact there is even an add-on now that is called ""Cognitive Gauntlet"". The  best part is, once you start playing, you'll never want it to end anyway. This is the only game where you are given a gun, but you are never expected to shoot anyone, because it makes portals instead of wounds or death.
    Out of all the games I have ever played, Portal 2 is at the very top place as my all-time favorite. My second all time favorite game is ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"".
    I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who loves thinking things through, and solving puzzles."
18369,.
18370,this is epic
18371,Good game
18372,Funny game shoot portal fling across map kill god it has the works

18375,great game!
18376,game cool and epic
18377,Very!
18378,Holds up surprisingly well even after 8-9 years. Goes to show decent enough graphics with a great story+gameplay is the way to go

18380,epic absolutely amazing deal i would die without this game i am addicted very fun funf unf ufn ufn fun funf unf
18381,glados is so hot
18382,GLaDOS is very seggsy. Would smash 100%
18383,Very nice game i play it for few hours
18384,Greatly transitions from the first game into a more polished experience where pretty much everything is improved from little things like a portal gun animation and sound effect to the story and characters. This still holds up better than a ton of the new games released today.
18385,IM STUCK IN LEVEL 20 HELP ME I CAN'T LEAVE IM STUCK HERE FOREVER
18386,"this game will make you 300 IQ
even if you don't like puzzle games, you should play it at least for the great storyline"

18407,"very beautiful, fully recommend."
18408,"Super fun game, i don't need a good computer to play it and the mechanics are easy to learn."
18409,"I first played this game when I was around 13 years old, I never knew about Portal 1, but I wanted this. From the very start, I loved it, the humor was on point, and it had me laughing at every joke, and then at one point 
I went up to a room in a broken part of the test chamber wall, and the ambiance changed from buzzing fluorescent lights and factory noises, to a deep hum, strange, haunting, robotic sounds, and behind a scribble on the wall, the frantic, insane ramblings of a madman

If you want to play this game, you don't NEED to play the first one, they basically explain the entirety of the first game's plot in 10 seconds in a very short, but very cool cutscene, but take my advice and play the first game before this one, it's relatively short, incredibly funny, and has a cool ending"
18410,"English cannot describe how amazing this game is.

I mean... it can, but I would have to use abstract metaphors to convey complex thought etc. but that's too much work

if you don't have this game, what the heck"

18429,"In my opinion, Portal 2 is even better than the amazing [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/]previous game[/url]. Puzzles are more interesting and challenging, The story is much better, and the characters are instantly lovable."

18442,"Yakko Warner said this was a ripoff of Portal 1 in the Animaniacs Reboot. If I could give him a negative review and share it to the masses, I abso-positive-lutely would. I wouldn't dare give Portal 2 a negative review, though. That'd just be a load of absolute bollocks."
18443,"yea

18444,finished it in like 3-4 days just cause of how damn good it is lol

The story, the easter eggs, the puzzles, THE GRAPHICS, it's amazing. And the music too. I really can't fathom this game is already old but it is still really good??? if there's a sequel I'd definitely buy it again and play it. (Actually please make a sequel if possible, I really enjoy playing this with my friend)"
18461,It is fun.
18462,"lots of fun, very well thought out and just overall a very good and unique game

18473,Very cool and very fun to play with friends
18474,great game
18475,One of the best games ive played to date. portal series is timeless
18476,"This game is great! Portal 2 has great graphics, good puzzles and a great story! Only downside is that if you want to make your own puzzles that look good and detailed then you have to use hammer but for me i cant install hammer nor can i remove a hammer shortcut that dosnt work on my pc, other then that it runs at around 60 fps even though the graphics are great"
18477,"Just a must have game.

Get this game if you've never had it before. And get the bundle for portal 1 & 2, especially when it's on sale. Got both these games for $4 even though I've finished both of them several times before, and it was 100% worth it. That's what I'm counting on. ;)

Just get it, you won't regret it."

18485,nice
18486,it messes with your mind and its funny
18487,"After producing a masterpiece of a first game, it's hard to believe that Valve was able to produce just as good of a sequel. They continue to innovate with mechanics and puzzle design that feel well thought out and not extraneous on top of the beautifully simple mechanics of Portal. The story and world are fleshed out in a way that feels like a just continuation of the famous original Portal story. Overall, it is definitely still worth the play."
18488,Really fun and a great thing to do in your spare time!!
18489,this game along with halo stole from splitgate!!!

18522,One of the best games of all time.
18523,Nice
18524,chell pls cool yes!!1
18525,"Portal 2 is the best puzzle game i have ever played, the gameplay is amazing, the story is very interesting, the characters are some of the best ever created and the map design is just perfect. But one of the best parts of this masterpiece is the perpetual testing initiative, with it you can play amazing custom maps created by the community, made using hammer, BEE2 or even the default editor, the creativity of some creators are limitless, making even entire campaigns with insane amounts of detail. And the co-op?, amazing!, if you have a friend who owns portal 2, go play with them this instant!!, solving the puzzles or even just joking around is very fun."
18526,best game ever!!!
18527,"I'm a massive fan of the original Portal, and I'd argue it's as close to technical perfection in game design as is possible. That being said, Portal 2 has a number of things going for it. It's far more visually interesting, the story is deeper, and the characters are three dimensional. New mechanics help the gameplay stay engaging, and the level editor greatly extends the replay value.

All that being said, some of the charm of the original is lost here. You won't get to know the game as intimately, because it's longer and less compact.

Portal 2 is not the same game as the original Portal. It shares some of the same mechanics and characters, but it's not a clone. This is good - but following up perfection is a difficult job."
18528,"The Game is AWESOME.

18550,very gud
18551,poatOAS
18552,"An amazing game. honestly one of the best I've ever played, the story is so amazing and the mechanics are so simplistic yet so satisfying. And don't get me started on the attention to detail and the humour, OMG the voice lines in this game are sometimes quite dark but they are SO DAMN FUNNY. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new game to play, it's not too long, but though it may be short compared to some other games it packs so much into what time it has.




also the songs are really good"
18553,what else is there to say that hasn't already been said. this game is legendary. make sure you play the first one first so you can appreciate everything this sequel has to offer. you will not regret a single second.
18554,"I've already completed this game back then on the PS3, but replaying it was very fun!
This game is just as funny and intriguing as I remember it being :D"
18555,it good
18556,Eternal classic.
18557,this is my kingdom come

18559,good

18561,Portal 2 is a very good game and also better then Terraria for sure
18562,"great game, worth the money even in 2021"
18563,One of the best games I've ever played. Play it
18564,si
18565,"I have watched gameplay of Portal 2 in the past but only just now finished it, and it's fantastic! 

The puzzles are relatively similar to those in Portal 1, but obviously improved and sometimes utilize the different gels unique to Portal 2. The story is a little different, tragic in some parts but still entertaining and funny, and Cave Johnson (JK Simmons) is one of the best additions to the Portal universe!"
18566,funny robot lady make brain buzz
18567,This is the best game of all time
18568,"Fun and difficult, but if you like puzzles and a wonky story then definitely play this game. Has funny lines from characters as well. All in all fun and interesting and highly recommend."

18577,"This game is still one of my favourite puzzle games ever. The puzzles are great, the humour and dialogue are fantastic. Personally, I prefer the first game however both are perfect.

I couldn't recommend this more and supposedly, Portal 2 is the ""single highest rated game on steam"" so with that said, why bother adding more."
18578,Humour++
18579,"The question you're asking yourself - ""Should I buy this?"" is the wrong question. The question that should be going through your mind is - ""Why haven't I purchased this yet?""

Incredible story, great puzzles, amazing voice-acting and as close to a perfect game as is possible. Stop reading and play it!"
18580,"Its portal 2, what can I say?"

Btw, playing alone and playing with friends are 2 complete different experience and I've learn a lots from the coop with my friend, where not only 'one-carry' but we share our ideas and test it out exactly like in real life. Thank you, developers of Valve to create such an interesting games."

18703,"This is on if not the best games on steam for people who want to enjoy a nice puzzle game.
This game is still graphically appealing even in 2021 and does not even require a GPU.
The masterpiece that valve has created does not age AT ALL. And I truly believe that this is the best valve game. 
And if you haven't played it in the last 10 years..
IT'S A MUST HAVE!!!"

18707,"Fun, entertaining, challenging, witty, funny, and makes you think. Definitely recommend."
18708,"Portal 2 is, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made. It’s a game that not only seamlessly blends puzzle and adventure elements together, but makes a name for itself as a true “comedy” game, where witty dialog and laugh-out-loud concepts have been given an equal billing with the gameplay itself. It’s funny, it’s challenging, it’s inventive, and it boasts memorable moments that will stick in your mind and make your hair stand on end every time you think about them."
18709,entertaining and great for problem solving

18716,good game
18717,и до ачивментс
18718,"I have played the game through twice, and enjoyed it as if it's my first time playing on both runs. If you love puzzle games, you will love the intuitive mechanics of portal 2. The sense of refinement is there. The game also has a story which further adds to why you should play the game."

Each level is wildly different, and even with the same mechanics and constantly learning new ones, you find a new experience each time."

18759,"It's an amazing game. First 10 minutes are a but slow, but their worth it for the momentum levels."
18760,"Feels like a demo for the portal mechanic. I'm not saying it's bad, but a platformer puzzle game is much more limited when compared to something like split gate. Portal does a lot to make the platforming innovative and is probably the best platformer, but an RPG with evasion based combat and portals would be better. 

what i'm trying to say is that the game is good, but other genres can do more with portals and should use them more. also
Like every game it needs more DRAGONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

18775,"This review is long past due, I don't know how I didn't write a review for this game over so many years. But by far! The best game Valve has made. Portal 2 is the definition of a perfect puzzle game. It really makes you think in a different aspect with portals, it's so extraordinary. The story is absolutely outstanding and heartwarming, with comedic and lighthearted moments to cinematic scenes all while trying to escape Aperture Science. The visuals are nothing too captivating but very memorable. The audio is fantastic, Portal 2 has some of the best soundtracks I've heard out of any game it's perfect for trying to think while going through test chambers. Everything about the main game is perfect I could play it a hundred times, come back to it years later and play it again, and it would be still just as great as the first time I experienced it.

And least I forget, the co-op part of this game which feels like it should be its own separate game. I have spent hours on top of hours having the time of my life will all of my robot teammates I played with in the past solving puzzles. It's still so much fun to this day to play with a friend or finding a partner online. And it doesn't get old because the community makes just as challenging and entertaining puzzles like in the main story! Including the most exciting maps you can find on the workshop like Gelocity (which is a race) that I must mention. Portal 2 is a game that will always be a big part of my life, with so many memories that I will forever cherish dearly.

If you have never played Portal before please, do yourself a favor and play it, it's not a game. It's an experience."
18776,The other reviews are right.
18777,I have a portal in your basement. Every night I use it to engage in the act of partaking in sexual intercourse with your biological mother.
18778,"The best game I have ever played. 

Completed it many times over and over and will probably continue doing so. I dont want to get too in details, because I might say something wrong. Just download it for free and if you like it, buy it."

The SP-Campain is also one of the best Adventures i ever experienced: 
+ Very good dark Humor
+ Puzzels like only portal can do
+ strong Soundtrack

18792,It's still a really good puzzle game to this day and I wish that valve made more games like it. Until then I'll try out the Turing test.

18838,Amazing game and story telling. I love the many secret messages around the levels. It's much longer than Portal 1 and the game sets you on many different kinds of puzzles and action. Easy to get lost in time while playing :-)
18839,I like this game. I recommend this game a lot because I like it.
18840,k
18841,"Writing this review before I decide to replay the game for the 999999th time and hit 100 hours in the game.

This game is incredible, by far my most favorite game of all time.
This is a very unique puzzle game and I think everyone knows what is Portal, but if you haven't played it you should definitely try it!
Although being a puzzle game, Portal 2 features extremely interesting, funny and absolutely great characters.
The gameplay is sometimes considered a ""walking simulator"" in certain parts of the game but this is sort of expected because the main focus is well... PuZzLeS aNd SciEncE!!
The graphics aged well, I'm not saying it's some tsunami in Aperture Science graphics where everything has glossy reflections, but the artstyle makes everything look much better, the lighting is pretty good for a 10 year old game too.
Now the soundtrack is something from a different universe, IT'S AMAZING, the music fits well with each section of the game and it's extremely epic and sometimes relaxing sort of.
The sound design is very good especially the sound of the cores just makes me want to hear it 24/7, although the portal gun doesn't sound as good as in the first game it's still sounds good, all the other sounds are incredible as well (Although a very small portion of the sounds was taken from Half-Life 2 As AlwAyS VaLVe)
The map design is very good considering the fact that the game doesn't fail to lead you to the current destination in certain sections of the game without any hints that just appear all over the screen in some games.

This game holds a special place in my heart.

18900,buy now
18901,"If you have $10 to spend, please get this game. I'm not gonna spoil it as you need to play this yourself but it is full of amazing puzzles and this one blows the first one out of the water (Portal 1 is also amazing but this one is way better). The fact that this game was made with the Source Engine baffles me, it is so high quality even 10 years later. This game is worth way more than $10, this is an absolute must play for anyone even if you don't like puzzle games, this game is a masterpiece. Also the Co-Op is literally the most fun you can have with a friend in a video game."

Until now, I only heard of it and knew the general idea of having portals, but I didn't know that it's so much fun to solve the puzzles. My absolute kicker however was the small robot Wheatley because it had so much humor. The voice and jokes were just perfect. I wished the big game studios would put that much love into their games."

One of, if not, THE best game i have ever played in my life.
Although, this game focuses more on story than just puzzles but that does NOT mean that it lacks in the puzzle area AT ALL.
This game and its predecessor are definitely in my top 5. This game improves on the first by including a multiplayer, upgrading the engine, and a longer and more content-filled story mode.

This game is very good, and I would definitely get this ESPECIALLY during the steam awards/autumn sale or the summer sale, where you can get the Portal bundle (Portal 1 and 2) for like $4.90AUD.

Another big thing about the game is the spinoff/mod/fan games. Things like Portal Reloaded, Portal Stories: Mel, Aperture Tag and more, the amount of effort put into these games is insane, and most of them match the quality of a valve-made game. 

Overall: 10/10 game. But it."

Being as a kid back then, I would often get stuck A LOT! By the time I eventually beat the game, I started to repeat the same chapters over & over again (5-9) back on the 360.

Fantastic portal based puzzles!! I would recommend this game to any one. Probably one of the best puzzle games you can play!!😎👍🍺"

It is fun, plus there is multiplayer co-op so you can play with friends and see how long your friendship will last. Even better for those who want some new test chambers, there is the workshop so you can have modded maps, campaigns, and even new experiences in this game.

I've played it multiple times in coop and in single and every time I just find some new detail or realize something I've not noticed before!

Even if you are not a huge fan of puzzle games, I'd still recommend it, just because how awesome the story is!"

18957,"Portal 2 is one of those masterpieces that deserves all the love and support it has. With an all-star cast, outstanding soundtrack, beautiful visuals, etc., this game lives up to the hype it has gotten over the years. Even though this game is older than most, it is still personally one of my favourite games to play to this day. I have come back to the campaign many times, each time loving it the same. The co-op is phenomenal when you have a friend to join you, and the community made chambers, for the most part, are well made and quite challenging (in a good way). This game will always be one of my favourite games to play."
18958,'
18959,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18960,outstanding game with a nice game play great for new players even if you have not played the first game
18961,I really dig this game. Shoot a thing over there and then jump through the thing and then move a thing through the thing. You put the thing on the thing and another thing opens up and you do the things again. I come back to Portal 2 a few times here and there and i enjoy my time playing.
18962,It is one of the best and most entertaining games I have ever played!
18963,"you like humor? play this game. you like sadness? play this game. you like puzzles? no? play this game anyway. i cannot recommend it enough, changed my life. seriously get it."
18964,kill your friends :D
18965,"is good
"
18966,"tl;dr the story sucks and the humor stops being funny



To be fair, I really don't like leaving negative reviews for valve games. Honestly, this game is pretty good gameplay wise. The gels and the lasers provide interesting ways to complete the chambers. Also the test chamber builder is neat, go check it out!

The unfortunate thing about this game is its incoherent and messy story that relies way too much on jokes in the plot to help me take it seriously. You might be thinking ""Why would you take it seriously? It's a portal game!"" But when the last game had the right amount of humor and a story that fit into the half-life canon very well that's a good thing. But when GlaDOS gains the ability to manipulate walls and make chambers any where anytime out of anything she pleases, or the game taking place ""50,000"" years after the last game (impossible because the tectonic plates in the earth would have crushed the old test chambers by then) and the earth looking spotless in the final boss (Combine?) and the very questionable final cutscene (Chell walking out into the open world) is really bothersome as I take Half-Life games and their related canons very seriously.

The humor. Oh god the humor. It's funny the first few times but it loses its merit later on, and crams all kinds of unfitting jokes down your throat and tortures you with them. It's like valve focused more on the humor than helping the plot make an ounce of sense."
18967,she's just like me fr
18968,This game is a must play. Super easy to get into and super cheap. 10/10

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"

18981,"Portal 2 is a puzzle game with portals. The gameplay is extremely fun and makes you think what to do so you can beat each chamber. This game has extremely nice humor and it always makes me laugh with the jokes. Its graphics are beautiful for a 2012 game, and your eyes aren't going to suffer with flashy lights. The level design has improved a lot when compared to Portal 1's level design, now you aren't going to get lost in a level most of the time. This game is astonishing and amazing. Would buy 3 times."

19023,"Let's face it, by this point, everyone knows what Portal 2, and the Portal series in general, is. All there really is to say is that, if you like puzzle games, especially puzzle games with story, Portal is one of the best series for you, especially Portal 2 with it's witty humour, and co-op mode where you can endlessly troll friends, and then when those friends get mad at you, get another friend to play with you until you have no friends left. Fun experience for all involved! But in all seriousness, I have played through the co-op with at least 5 different friends, and have always had a fun time, even with my bad memory meaning I forget solutions. Would absolutely recommend as a fun co-op game.

19097,"This is one of my favourite games and I would definately recommend it to anyone interested in puzzle solving games. Even though it was released in 2011, it has aged really well and the graphics still hold up today even though it is only on source 1!"
19098,It's Portal 2
19099,im losing my brain with these portals
19100,It's pretty good
19101,good shit
19102,Excellent game and story.  Lots to discover.
19103,One of the few games I've played that I would call perfect. 10/10
19104,"How does this game fuck your mic, what the hell"
19105,"In my top 3 favorite games, honestly this game is timeless since there's a few mods out for it The community chamber design feature is what is kinda keeping it alive after all these years."
19106,best co op game ever
19107,good
19108,yaaaaaaaaaak
19109,"This is an awesome game, many times I have got off it wasn't because I'd rage quit.  I can't say that about most games.  If you liked the first Portal you are sure to love this one.  The game could be hard at times, I will admit that I got stuck on some easy puzzles.  And the boss fight was some what hard.  But moving on to the coop game.  It's very cool what Value did with this, instead of putting two Chells into the same room and completing puzzles.  You and a friend (or a random person if you don't have any) control two robots named P-Body and Atlas.  The puzzles in the coop game are great.  Anyways this was a good game, and if the autumn sale is still going on you could get Portal and Portal 2 for 3$."
19110,"I was smooth brain, after playing this now i am still smooth barained but the game is excelent"

19123,portal 2
19124,"A good puzzle game, but expect to get stuck on some puzzles in your first playthrough, even though it usually is for a dumb reason, it allows you to learn a mechanic slightly better, and you can remember that for the future"
19125,Fun to play!
19126,"I've got over 20 hours clocked in of just playing this solo, with either mods of the original. This game is one of the best puzzle games I've ever touched, greatly improved upon Portal 1. All I ask, is where's Portal 3???"

19158,good
19159,An amazing sequel to the 2007 timeless classic. Portal 2 surprised me thanks to the way it handles physics and the clever jokes the characters have. The story feels really elaborate and the atmosphere is really better than the atmosphere that Portal had which felt more lonely.
19160,best singleplayer game ive ever played
19161,nice game
19162,its a fun puzzle game
19163,"Excellent game, a must play for every gamer. Story excellent. Gameplay excellent. Characters and voice acting excellent. Must play"

The co-op feature is great, the voice chat is high quality, and it's easy to connect with friends. Also making levels on a game has never been this cool. I mean, it's Valve. You can't expect it to be bad."

19345,legendary game 100/10
19346,nice
19347,Amazing game. I have so many memories of playing it on the xbox 360 and when I got it for pc I loved playing the multiplayer maps with random people I have made multiple friends playing custom maps on this game and I would extremely recommend it to anyone who never tried it.
19348,The game was fun but horrible with more than one person because people suck at communication.
19349,P-body and Sherman
19350,Need Iq 1000+ to play
19351,"This game is really cool because the community test chambers add a lot of play after you get through the whole game and much of it is hard enough that if you play again months later, you might not remember it well so it's fun to play again."
19352,"If you're feeling down, or just want to become x200 happier than you were 10 minutes ago, just buy this game. Even if you have not played Portal (first one), you'll have a blast playing this one."

19354,Love this game
19355,"Really interesting and challenging puzzles with great jokes.  Co-op campaign is pretty fun but doesn't have that much of a story. The singleplayer has an really good story though. There's also workshop support so once you finish you can play tons of other community levels and maps. The price is a steal too. This game is easily worth £25, but its only £7.19, and £1.43 on sale."
19356,Best coop game ever
19357,Classic
19358,"Finally got around to playing this during covid and was absolutely blown away. Can't believe I sat on it for so long, definitely one of the best games I've ever played. It builds on Portal 1 in every way and had a wonderful story and puzzle challenges."
19359,Very good game
19360,i like the part where [spoiler]he kills you[/spoiler]

19460,"One of the greatest games ever made, story is amazing and co-op is fun."
19461,"This game's reputation speaks for itself, and frankly its well deserved. Valve created a game so well made, it persists to this day. Words can't do it justice."
19462,"This game has influenced my life more than any other game.
Thanks, Gabe."
19463,"Amazing game, love everything about it"

19476,Best Game Ever
19477,"best game, the single player play through is worth way more than 9.99, but also with its two player mode and map creation this game is a steal. Pick this game up if you like having a good time."
19478,"Sorry, This is for Terraria. Outstanding game though."
19479,a

19498,Black Mesa > Aperture Science
19499,Personal favorite game
19500,"An absolute must play for [strike]every puzzle game enjoyer[/strike] everyone.

Seriously. Why are you looking at the reviews? Go buy the bloody game, play the story, bully a friend until he plays the co-op with you, catch the Portal fever, play the first game, play TWTM and the other fanmades, and then leave with a deep sorrow that you can never experience Portal for the first time ever and never play such a brilliant puzzle game again."
19501,gud
19502,👍
19503,One of the most consistently great games of all time. Never a dull moment.
19504,"Hilarious, good story, fun gameplay loop, nothing to dislike"
19505,Portal 2 is such an excellent title that I'll routinely go back and play it all again because current games are kinda trash.
19506,MAKE PORTAL 2 FIRST ON SCOREBOARD A G A I N
19507,Portal 2 is an amazing example of fun single player story and engaging multiplayer experience.
19508,hahahaha hot metal robot thingy makes me hard(i have crippling p0r4 addiction)
19509,"Incredible game with an astonishign story and captivating and rewarding puzzles, but i need ultrakill to be the highest rated game on steam because that game is just a master piece"
19510,great game
19511,The only thing that makes you angry at this game is your own inability to play it. The puzzles are genius as are the character arcs. It's honestly my favorite PC Game.

19530,"Fantastic game. Great soundtrack, fun story, good writing and voice acting. Very fun."
19531,"This is an excellent game, it took the concepts of the original and expanded on them in a way that makes this more than just a puzzle game. I just wish we had an official Portal 3."
19532,Ranked #2? Not on my watch.
19533,"its fucking portal 2

19556,"Really really really awesome, although playing it after Portal 1 feels even better"
19557,"A sequel that goes above and beyond the scope and quality of the already fantastic first installment.

Fantastic voice acting, beautiful graphics and a story that is simple, yet satisying. 

Portal 2 is the perfect finale to the franchise"
19558,It’s a fun game. Did you like the first portal? Not much changes here and this is more of a continuation. No big revamps or no need to worry that there have been big game changes. This picks up right where the first one left off.
19559,"Great game, deserves to be no. 1"

19583,Now we're cooking with portals.
19584,Fun Game
19585,"I play games since 1998, when I was 4 years old. Right now I must have played more than 1000 different games easily, ranging from all titles, and I can firmly say, with all my experience in gaming, that Portal 2 is the best game of all time. No other game has this level of story, with this level of gameplay, and immersion. And for a game now considered old, it holds up pretty well in terms of graphics too."
19586,10/10 game
19587,wheatley crab
19588,A+
19589,"Fantastic game but also the first one to include micro-transactions at a pretty offensive and obnoxious scale. If you want to blame someone for the rise of those it's Valve, not EA :)"
19590,Fantastic and Fun!
19591,One of the all time greatest games. Don't miss out on neither of one and two player campaigns - both are fantastic.
19592,Great game
19593,best game ever
19594,"Genuinely, one of the greatest games of all time. The humour is spot on, the puzzles are good from start to finish. The abilities and replay-ability are spot on and the ongoing support has been great.

Definitely a game worth playing, even in 2021!"
19595,favorite puzzle game of all time get it
19596,Science rules!
19597,Giving this a positive review so it would be the highest rated game on Steam instead of Terraria.

19610,"Postal 2 is a 2003 first-person shooter developed by Running with Scissors. It is the sequel to the 1997 game Postal and was released for Microsoft Windows in April 2003, macOS in April 2004 and Linux in April 2005. Postal 2, as well as its predecessor, have received notoriety for their high levels of violence, stereotyping, and black comedy. Unlike the first game, Postal 2 is played completely in first-person based on the Unreal Engine 2.

Set in the fictional town of Paradise, Postal 2 follows the life of ""The Postal Dude"", who must carry out mundane tasks throughout an in-game week, with the player deciding how violently or passively he will react to various situations. The player navigates the open world to carry out his chores, with player choice having an effect on the setting.

The game received a mixed reception from critics upon its release. The game has received several expansion packs, and in December 2003, a multiplayer expansion was released, titled Postal 2: Share the Pain. The game remains continually updated, with a new expansion pack titled Paradise Lost released in April 2015.

The game received attention for its violent gameplay, and was responsible for multiple controversies.[4] The game was followed by a sequel, Postal III, in December 2011."
19611,It's fun
19612,"It only took 3 buckets of vomit to beat it, but it was worth it"

19641,"One of the best games ever, no doubts about it."
19642,I love every aspect of this game. From the voice acting to the addition of new mechanics that are not present in Portal 1. One of the best game I have in my library. I only wish for Valve to make a sequel for this game but that is asking for too much.
19643,"amazing story,
side note: in case of implosion look at implosion"
19644,"One of the best puzzle games i played, both single-player campaign and co-op are amazing."
19645,yup best game ever

19649,Takes what made portal 1 great and just enhances it. Story's a bit different feeling compared to 1 but i love it. Coop mode is also really great.
19650,Better than Terraria.
19651,One of my favorite games of all time.  I have consistently come back to play for a decade and enjoyed it every time in either single player or coop.
19652,I have nothing to add.
19653,"Pretty enjoyable physics based problem solving game.  (Uses gravity, acceleration, momentum etc)"
19654,Simply the best puzzle game out there.

19690,Nice game
19691,"One of my favorite games. It was clear that there was a lot of care and time put into it. Not only is the game itself addicting (you just want to keep solving puzzles) but the music, graphics, gameplay mechanics, and characters are amazing as well. Not to mention how well this game stands the test of time, it looks amazing even nine years after it's initial release. A game that should most definitely be played."
19692,The very most bestest of games.
19693,Who would not recommend Portal 2 and Portal 1.
19694,"Best game of all time! I am quite partial to puzzle games however. The story, the puzzles, and the comedy in this game are unmatched by others."
19695,good game best game amazing game fuck you dane
19696,"Strongly recommend. The first single-player game that had me glued to my screen for three days (and 10 hours of playtime). Has high replay value and a fantastic co-op system. And if life gives you lemons while you play, make life take those lemons back!"
19697,Truly an amazing game. Something everyone should play through at least once in their lives.
19698,"Good times, always good times."
19699,i may have played for 52 hours but it only felt like 2 hours. the game has an amazing story line and awards you with accavments sometimes. it has a bunch of chapters in singel player. and 5 or 6 in coop. and i got this on a sale with portal. great deal

19754,"Buy Portal 2 - The Final Hours
Portal 2 - The Final Hours is a digital book that takes you deep within the top-secret offices of Valve for an unvarnished look at the creative process behind Portal 2. Now with a free bonus chapter added!
I BOUGHT THIS BOOK THINKING I JUST GOT PORTAL 2 A 10 DOLLAR GAME FOR 2 DOLLARS
the book was great"

19757,Recommended
19758,the second best game that ever lived
19759,"Much like the first game, Portal 2 is very tightly paced, but I'd be lying if I said I thought as highly of the puzzles in this game as the first game. Don't get me wrong- they're still fun to solve, utilize physics properties creatively, have clever mechanics and get your brain thinking. But they're not quite as open-ended as the first game's. The puzzles in the first game could usually be solved in more than one way, but in 2 they feel much more restrictive. The puzzles are still fun to solve but it certainly hurts the story's replay value, especially since the puzzles don't quite reach the same level of challenge as the first game. Speaking of the story, it's executed a bit less than optimally as well in my opinion. Portal's story gave a nice contrast between comedic brashness and dark undertones but Portal 2's can't seem to stop reminding you how humorous the dialogue is at all times. It's well written dialogue for sure, but it's just not a very good continuation of Portal 1's atmosphere. It also tends to include some more heavy handed plot-twist moments that don't feel very in line with the spirit of Portal to me personally. Despite those issues the game is still very much fantastic. The dialogue is clever, the new puzzle mechanics are interesting, the progression is great, the variety is even better than the first game and the polish is immaculate. The soundtrack and sound effects are great additions that reflect the curious solitude of the test chambers adeptly. Overall it's a very good sequel despite some hurdles that kept it fro, becoming amazing. It feels like Valve leaned a bit harder into the Portal that the fanbase saw versus the Portal that they saw and created something based on that train of thought.
I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but I've heard great things about it so if you enjoy co-op games then it's probably worth picking this one up.
I'd recommend this game if:
- You like puzzlers
- You like funny dialogue
- You like co-op games
- You enjoyed the first portal and wanted to see if you'll like this one too
Despite the problems I have with it, Portal 2 is great and I'd suggest anyone try it out. It's just that those problems hold it back from being a true masterpiece in my eyes."
19760,"if you like first-person puzzle games you would love portal 2, it has a great story line that carried from portal, to portal 2"
19761,Amazingly awesome.
19762,it is fun and a brain game

19821,"This game is perfect for people who like doing puzzles and using your brain at the same time. At first, I thought this game was gonna be boring, but after playing for a few hours, I really got hooked into it. Overall, one of my favorite games."
19822,"Well, I'd say this game deserves the rave reviews it gets. It was great to learn some more of the backstory behind Aperture and GLaDOS. Definitely had a lot of fun puzzles and new elements, like the various gels and the swirly blue floaty things (not sure what to even call those). If you liked the first Portal and/or like puzzles, play this game."

19831,splitgate without halo
19832,"good game, good story, fun with friends, thats all I have to say, cool fact it takes place in the same universe as half-life, because the aperture science and black mesa were trying to make portals and look how that turned out, one made that and the other one opened a portal to another dimension, enjoyed it good game. labydabyda shlabumina, amogis amogus amogas amoges amogres. amigos nyam nyam nyam , u smell kinda like she farted, farted, harded, harded, a-b honour roll, all f's you retarded, sususuusususuyyyy bakaka usdn , eren yeager"

19844,Perfect sequel to portal 1. This time it actually has a made story to it instead of just doing tests and trying not to die
19845,"Dear reader,

This is the sequel to portal, which I also reviewed very positively. This game improves upon that game in all possible ways. Portal 2 is longer than Portal and some of the puzzles are harder so I would recommend playing the first game first. The story will make more sense if you do as well.

Graphics are improved by quite a bit and some bugs from the original are fixed. Source engine is very good.

Linux support for both games is really good, and I was able to play with a good amount of performance using Manjaro Linux even on a very low end laptop (core2duo).

Graphics: 8/10
Gameplay: 10/10
Story: 10/10
Characters:10/10
Cake: lies
Linux Support: 10/10
Optimization: 10/10
File Size: low

Overall, very very good. If you have not played, play it. Typically on sale with the original for less than $10."
19846,Instant classic
19847,gg
19848,"The final installment for the Portal series, this sequel builds up from the first one and reaches pop culture status as soon as it was released. The song 'Want You Gone' may not be better than 'Still Alive', but it is the conclusion cherry on top of this cake. The cake which doesn't exist because pop culture."
19849,"Amazing game, good mental exercises as well as fun story. Managed to pass all levels without help (except for one). Co-op mode is a nice addition compared to Portal 1."
19850,Very fun worth the ten dollars
19851,Just an awesome Game. There is nothing mor you can say. Just play it.
19852,Valve’s finest multiplayer game.
19853,Space. Space. Gonna go to space.
19854,k
19855,"game = good 

fun = yes"
19856,"This is the best reviewed game on Steam for a reason. I’m telling you $10 isn’t enough for it. 10 years old and it still should be #1 on this list for a reason. This is and will always be my favorite game of all time. The rich storyline, the lovable complex personalities of each character, the fun puzzles, & the killer plot makes it worth every single penny. Valve got just about everything right with this game from the voice actors to the gameplay. This sequel perfectly ties up all the loose ends left by the first game and adds more. I know one day when I return to revisit this I will still have a total blast with this absolute gem of a video game. Even today I’m telling you get Portal 2, its $10 you won’t regret spending a single dollar of that. Thank you Valve and all the devs who made this  what it is today."
19857,"This is a well constructed game, the only issues I had were that some of the puzzles were too difficult/obtuse that I had to look them up, so that was mildly frustrating."
19858,"There are indeed 2 portals

Unless you play multiplayer and there's 4"
19859,"Лучшая игра мира. Главный злодей шутил про то что гг из детдома 6 раз за игру, сюжет незамысловатый но есть и вполне неплохой. Понравилось в игре все кроме того что в мультиплеер нельзя играть одному ( друзей нету у меня)"

19861,liked it

19866,Nice brain training with a friend. Workshop maps better.
19867,"The multiplayer mode was insanely fun, and portal is always good.  Just wish I could have more of this, since replaying is hardly any fun.  9/10"
19868,"This game is very fun, it can be annoying at some times."
19869,Good puzzle game
19870,the robot isnt nice. I like it 10./10 kinky time
19871,It's really fun but also very frustrating
19872,"Great continuation to an already great game.

19878,One of the greatest games ever. Everyone should try this at least once.
19879,Portal 2 is a satisfying puzzler that utilises an iconic mechanic that is implemented smoothly. The story is mysterious and I'd love a 3rd game to continue it.
19880,yey
19881,"The best game i have ever played, a classic along with portal 1, I have played this game 5 times because of the greatness.... buy this game! I wish there was a 3rd one"

19895,good
19896,"Great storyline in the single player mode, which is much longer than in Portal 1, with new game mechanics and many extra hours. The co-op is brilliant, and forces teamwork with puzzles that must use both portal devices to be solved. Heaps of fun and a really good game to play with a friend.

In single player mode, Glados brings much appreciated sass, and Wheatley is a welcome addition. Overall, highly recommended alongside Portal 1, which can help familiarise you with the game mechanics."
19897,"You will never play another game like this, it is impossible to describe why this is the best game ever made, but it makes sense it's the highest rated game on Steam. THE CAKE IS A LIE"
19898,10/10
19899,thumbs up
19900,"Absolutely one of the best games of all time, with one of the most clever game mechanics of all time. This timeless classic still holds up to today's gaming standards. Even after you beat the main story mode, it feels like you're truly an aperture science test subject with new community chambers being made almost every day by the undying portal fanbase. This game will always be fun to play both alone and with friends."
19901,"Great game, will always be timeless"
19902,oeh
19903,"It gets harder as you go, but it's a really fun and interesting game to play, and i'm only in chapter 4 right now. I definitely recommend this game"

19923,You monster
19924,great game and good puzzles
19925,"Nice story, enjoyable puzzle solving. Haven't tried co-op, yet. Unfortunately, a huge chunk of achievements is behind the co-op part. Also, some of the achievements are quite random to guess."
19926,"just buy it, its portal"

19935,its kinda a puzzle game but no the less its good
19936,Good game
19937,it's just sequel . so ........ not so sure what to say.
19938,"it's unbelievable what valve did. they took a great game, portal, and made it better in every way- story, gameplay, puzzles, environments, co-op, workshop. if, for some reason, this game is not in your library, this is an absolute must-play!"
19939,Absolutely amazing
19940,yes
19941,its ok
19942,"Portal 2 has a really good story! The only problem I have with it is that it is long, so if you are like me and have a short attention span this game might not be for you, but if you are willing to put in the hours this game is totally worth it!"
19943,Words can't describe how great this game is.
19944,Pow pow portals go brrrr

19952,sexc
19953,One of the best games of AT

19958,"Very good at honing your problem solving skills in a fun and entertaining way!  Good humor and never boring!  What a great and interesting game!@  Best game I've played this year!  It's like a 4 dimensional Rubic's Cube, but less stressful and waahhhaay more enjoyable!"
19959,"Portal 2 is a perfect game, kinda lonely tho, the sophomores loved it"
19960,Great game! Must play! Both storywise and coop is great fun!
19961,Cum 2

19969,"If you enjoy any type of puzzle game, just buy it. It's practically perfect."
19970,it's a good game 10/10
19971,"Starts off relatively easy so you can get the hang of it but has a good story line- equally as good as the first one so far, and the same excitement you've come to know and love about Portal."
19972,GOOD
19973,good game with friend
19974,Very good
19975,rlly good
19976,"The way portal uses its physics engine in order to incorporate beatifully rendered empty worlds that perfectly connect with you, and make you physically be immersed in the world of this genius physics game, it's genuinely inspiring, through taking such a simple idea and taking a large amount of time to build up on it, portal 2 is the perfect version of a puzzle game."
19977,Amazing
19978,buy it right fucking now
19979,9/10
19980,such a good game i love it
19981,"My friend throw me into a pit :((

20017,Tristan is bad ong but game is fun
20018,"Outstanding gameplay, perfect multiplayer and all around a very IMMENSE experience, the relationship between P-body and Atlas is something better than twilight itself, I'm very glad to have played this game and bought it twice, if you have not seen this game, you've truly never seen god material."
20019,"Cake, and grief counseling, will be available at the conclusion of the test..."
20020,"one of my fav games
"
20021,"Even better then the first (10/10)

This game has everything portal and more, More sassy diabolical robots, more creative puzzles worth solving, and as an extra bonus Stephen Merchant as a hilarious sidekick.

The game is a greater length then the first one and some puzzles that actually stumped me ever so often.

Love the lore of this world and the creativity, There is an ever growing array of hidden secrets on top of the already fun story telling this game uses.

Its probably one of the best valve games ever, and I highly recommend it for all time."

20032,"I played the original Portal and loved the original game. I was skeptical of the sequel (Portal 2), because I thought was gonna be a cash grab. I was wrong! The sequel's graphics are amazing despite that the game came out in 2012. The game is charming with puzzles, laughs and fun times! I give Portal 2 a 10/10!"
20033,nice

20038,cave johnton is hunter
20039,Portal 2 is a great puzzle solving game that tests your skills. Unlike Portal it also has a multiplayer mode where you can solve puzzles with your friends. I think thats a great addition to the game. Like the first Portal it only has few hours of gameplay. Overall its a great game to play after work/school.
20040,"highly reccomend
very fun
plot twists
romance (joking)
funny
cool puzzles
yes

the only two things that bothered me was:
motion blur, i couldnt figure out how to turn it off, but i got used to it after a while
it doesnt tell you where you can and cant place portals

other than that i would rate this game 11/10 would highly reccomend"
20041,there is a portal in this game

And I cant get Glados's voice out of my head pls send help"
20054,no gay sex
20055,"One of my steam friends keeps trying to play this game with me. I want to tell him that I don't like him but he keeps coming back. I tried blocking him - he dodged the blocks with dozens of alt accounts. I lay awake at night knowing that he will send me an invite every time I turn on my pc. I made a new steam account but he found it somehow (I used a separate pc and a VPN when making it). This game has made it impossible for me to use technology, hell he even sent me an invite through my electric toothbrush. The game play is fine though, it's worth the money."
20056,great game play
20057,"I have only played 1 minute
"
20058,i really like this game makes me feel like i have herpees
20059,"Not gonna lie, if I was to name a game off the top of my head and call it my favorite, this could be the one. This is the game that got me into other gaming, I love the sound design, to the world building, to the voice acting; 10/10, all around fantastic experience... definitely play the first game before this though for an even better experience in this game. Enjoy!  ; D

Good vibe, good music, good art style, good story, fun characters, lovecraftian style giant machine abysses, implied story to go with normal story, fun stuff. Oh yeah and well made puzzles too. 

You know how everyone is saying gmod is kinda eerie recently? This game and the first used that weird source engine eerie nature on purpose to kinda make an unsettling environment and its p neat."

20152,"Even 10 years later this game is pretty fun, even if I was a little stupid with the gel puzzles. Especially love the writing with Cave Johnson."
20153,"Got this game on the ps3 way back with little big planet. Loved this game a lot and when I came back to play it felt amazing as ever. A classic game that worth a play now, and another 10 years in the future."

20158,"I would argue this is one of the best and most iconic puzzle games aside from the first portal, the co-op mode has consumed hours of my time and I have found myself playing workshop levels mindlessly for hours, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game if you haven't already purchased it."
20159,"It's a hard feat to top the first Portal, especially in terms of level design, but Valve did the impossible. And then they added co-op! Portal 2 is what game sequels should strive to be."
20160,you make portals
20161,"It is one of the best games ever. Great puzzles, funny and deep characters, and a great story line."
20162,aaaaaaaaaaa
20163,a
20164,"Its good. If it had a sequel I would buy it. IDK what it is though but it doesn't give off that same prime Valve feeling like L4D, TF2, and HL give off. Maybe its just me. I guess the game feels more like a puzzle game than a story game. Its good though!"
20165,"The first game was great and this one is even better. Some of the puzzles weren't as straight forward as most of the first game's were and that is something I love way more about the second game. You actually have to sit and think about some of the puzzles instead of blazing through most of them like the first game. The levels were a good amount larger this time around and the game was really well paced. The community made chambers were also a game changer that gave me plenty more things to do after beating the campaign. overall, I really recommend this game to anyone."
20166,
20167,"
amazing perfect for a 10 year old game too"
20168,Very good portal puzzle game. To me it aged well. May be played during a short break or just kill time. The dialogues in general are specially enjoyable (you'll understand if you play. Its a bit why i stuck to it)

20207,"If you've somehow never played Portal 1, I would highly recommend it over Portal 2. 2 is still a decent puzzle game using the portal gun, but it's not even close to being a better game than 1, or a replacement for 1.

In my opinion, Portal 2 has much worse writing and atmosphere. It's way to self-aware about the meme-culture and fandom surrounding the first game, and too focused on comedy. Portal 1 had a much better balance of creepiness and humor, and all around felt more genuine, less corporate."
20208,"very good. Got for free via Portal board game. Have on ps3. 
very good"

20213,"amazballz game, buy it."
20214,This is the best game I have ever played. the characters more expressive than in portal 1. I want everyone to play portal 1&2. BUY THIS GAME
20215,"Great fun, singleplayer or co-op! very innovative game."
20216,mor e cake plz
20217,perfection
20218,"I remember I really got into this game's lore and was obsessed with GLaDOS back in like 2012 or so. At the time I didn't have a good PC so I couldn't play the game. Now I finally got the PC and played the game. I'm so happy to relieve the memories that the story gave me back then and actually experience them hands on. If you like puzzles and cool game mechanics, I recommend this game."
20219,"I loved the puzzles and backstory, and the fact that you can do single player (story) or two player ( co-op). Also, the co-op still keeps the puzzles. All and all it is a very good game. Would recommend to players that like puzzles."
20220,speedrun go brrrrr
20221,make hole in wall to go through other hole
20222,"Every single person must play portal and portal 2, art 
"
20223,ok
20224,good game
20225,"What can I say, this is just a totally incredible game unlike any other! I've been playing it since it first came out and ,apart from the great single player game itself, there is also a whole other cooperative game to play with a friend and then there are almost 685,000 single player Community Chambers designed by other players! After playing hundreds of them for a total of 243 hours so far, this is the only game I never get tired of and find myself regularly coming back to check out other new maps. While we're all waiting for Portal 3, don't forget to check out Portal Reloaded which is a great new game from a Portal community developer."
20226,i liked the unique things that you can do there and also the community because there are a bunch of mods you can use
20227,"It's Portal 2, what more needs to be said."
20228,"yes
"
20229,wheatley
20230,The sequel is very good. It now features new types of puzzles which are interesting to play. And now that there is co-operative u can now force ur friend at gun-point to buy this game and play together. Totally worth it 10/10
20231,Buck wheat or whatever his name is really mean when he calls the player fat. It's ironic considering that he is very rotund.
20232,"Very fun puzzle game, with an interesting story, and a co op 2 player mode. It even has a dlc where you can create your own levels. The only bad thing is that valve still can't count to three"

No other game that I've played matches the exquisite balance that Portal 2 strikes between fun and engaging puzzles and the real star of the show here: the story. I won't spoil anything here, but the story is brilliantly executed and funny through the entire game. 
My only regret is that I can never again experience this game for the first time. If you haven't played it yet, set aside a weekend and enjoy."

The over all story and plot is great, the voice acting is amazing (at least I think so) and the game has great humour with in, like the (This is the part where he kills you) part, you'll see for yourself if you play. I've spent a lot of time playing this game, never once gotten bored with it but that might just be me. Extra content made by other players are also absolutely amazing, I recommend Portal Reloaded and Portal Stories: Mel personally. Overall I rate this game 10/10, I look forward to playing more fan created extras for the game and if 20 more Portal games came out, then I would play them too! :D"
20345,"Just a great game. An interesting walkthrough of a fascinating story that draws attention to scientific research of the future, which is tested by the present and at the end changes for everyone. Creating and exploring puzzles is a way to pass the time by completing challenges for fun. They make you think about which way to go when the exit is near. Where one cannot get through, you can always take a friend with you to the company. A good place to relax and train your mind."

[h1]Portal 2 is a Masterpiece![/h1]
Portal 2 is amazing. It is the most well-rounded, thought out, and polished game that i have ever played. It is the single highest rated game on steam, and one of the most iconic video games of all time. I think it may even be my favourite game of all time.

[h2]Pros[/h2]
[b]1. [/b]
Your goal is once again to escape. The writing and the way that the plot develops has a perfect execution, and all of the world building that takes place throughout the narrative makes sense and fits perfectly into the lore of the world. On top of this, the pacing of the world is perfect and split onto various sections with a different major event happening in each of them. The story is great and when you think you get it, it turns the entire story around and flips up the characters. As you’re working towards your escape, the plot line serves as a backdrop for the puzzles and problems that you’re solving along the way. It is the perfect balance between narrative and gameplay, and everything ties together perfectly.

[b]2.[/b]
Many games struggle with humor. They either try too hard, and create unbelievable and unrealistic characters, or they don’t try hard enough, and it ends up being too serious. I believe Portal 2 is the perfect middle ground. GLaDOS constantly hurls insults at you, and the humor is extremely dark and depressing. It makes her into a much more well-rounded villain, and adds some depth to what would otherwise be a stale and overdone redemption story. Many of the jokes in this game had me laughing out loud and it seemed extremely fitting with the setting and situation. Her dark and dry humor is accented perfectly with Wheatly’s charismatic and energetic personality, and the combo go together perfectly. The underlying comedy helps to turn the story into something much more lively and engaging. 

[b]3. [/b]
The puzzles in portal are absolutely mind-bending. They make use of objects in the environment, as well as the levels themselves, and even the physics system in the game. You cant simply portal your way to the other side, you have to make use of light bridges, lasers, jump pads, and other entities in order to overcome the obstacles that you’re presented with. Not to mention the addition of the gels that really change up the gameplay from the first game and make for some interesting puzzles later on in your play through. Long story short, the puzzles in Portal 2 are amazing!

[b]4. [/b]
You can play through portal 2 in single-player mode, and go through the story with all of its ups and downs. And this is where a majority of this review is centered, but imagine going through the rooms with not two, but four portals. The complexity found in the puzzles really shines when you put your head together with a friend in order to figure out what the hell is going on. The Co-Op is about 5 hours long and you can team up with a friend to try and make it through all of the challenging levels without the story and plot found in the campaign. It is more of a cooperative puzzle-solving experience instead of a plot, and it really requires good teamwork. 

[h2]Cons / Bugs[/h2]
I find it truly rare these days to find a game with no cons or bugs. It is just my subjective opinion, but even so, it is very rare that I find games like this. I believe it is important to note that, and it should get some praise for being so great.

[h3]The Judgement: Portal 2 is a true masterpiece[/h3]
The outstanding story, awesome puzzles and amazing humor is showcased due to the simplicity and intentionality found in this game. Everything in the game is there for a reason, and that reason is highlighted once again by the amazing story. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and challenging game.

20393,"A classic that easily feels like a modern release, despite being a decade old.

The game aims to tell a story more than being a puzzle adventure. You'll venture through maps shooting portals while two NPC's have an argument with each other about you."

20487,"I really like this product.

I was never that anxious about my kids crawling around outside, and I knew that they would soon grow out of wanting to play in the dirt, but I also knew that we were heading into a pretty humid time of year.

I was afraid we'd be itching like crazy, and I wanted to have some products that would help us in that area.

I loved the unique ""tree"" design of the spider plant.

It has no thorns"
20488,"I liked this product so much I ended up putting it in all my other shampoo bottles.

The only problem I have with it is that I run out of my shampoo on the very last use so I don't want to use up all my shampoo on one bottle of Portal."

Is speeding smack-dab through the pasture, no road in sight. 
A bit out of place, to say the least. It's an old 70's era

blotting his T-shirt. He's passed out cold.

Right now, we'd step the fuck out of his way. 
Underpants man looks at the RV. End of the line for that. 
He listens hard. Out of the silence, we hear .•• SIRENS. 
They're faint, a few miles off -- but growing louder. Our 
guy knows he's boned with a capital B. He HOLDS HIS BREATH 
and leaps back inside the RV. 
INT. WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS 
A chrome 9mm is clutched in the hand of one of the dead 
Mexicans. Underpants grabs it, tucks it in his waistband. 
His unconscious passenger, still strapped in his seat, lets 
out a groan. Underpants leans past him, yanks open the glove

EXT. COW PASTURE - CONTINUOUS 
Ducking outside, he starts breathing again. A short sleeve 
DRESS SHIRT on a hanger dangles from the Winnebago's awning. 
Underpants pulls it on. He finds a clip-on tie in the 
pocket, snaps it to his collar. No trousers, unfortunately. 
He licks his fingers, slicks his hair down with his hands. 
He's looking almost pulled together now -- at least from the 
waist-up. All the while, the sirens are getting LOUDER. 
Underpants figures out how to turn on the camcorder. He 
twists the little screen around so he can see himself in it.

The sirens are WAILING now, on top of us. WALTER WHITE, the 
underpants man, turns off the camcorder. He carefully sets 
it on a bare patch of ground by his feet. Next to it he sets 
his wallet, lying open where it can be seen. 
CLOSE ON the wallet -- a photo ID card is visible. Walt's 
smiling face is on it. It identifies him as a teacher at 
J.P. wynne High School, Ontario Unified School District. 
Walt pulls the chrome pistol from the back of his waistband, 
aiming it across the tall weeds. It glints hard in the sun.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dark and silent. SKYLER WHITE, late 30s, sleeps peacefully. 
Beside her, her husband Walter is wide awake. 
Walt reaches over and presses a button on his Sharper Image 
alarm clock. It projects the time in glowing blue numbers on 
the cottage cheese ceiling: 5:02 AM. 
Walt lies motionless. Brain churning. He presses the button 
again, staring straight up. 5:02 turns to 5:03. 
Close enough. Walt rises without waking his wife. He exits. 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT 
We hear an o.s. SQUEAK-SQUEAK as we drift through this room. 
We pass an empty crib, Pampers, a baby monitor still in its 
box. There's going to be a new addition to the family. 
We come upon the source of the SQUEAKING. It's Walt balanced 
on a Lillian Vernon stair-stepper, just three easy payments 
of $29.95. Walt plods up and down in the darkness like he's 
marching to Bataan.

Walt sits down on the 7dge of the tub. We're watching his

20492,ammazing game played with familly super fun
20493,"It's Valve, it's Portal, what more do you want?"
20494,L E M O N S
20495,"I did not expect to love this game at first, but now it's probably one of the best, most fun and enjoyable games I've played. You are left wanting more. I highly recommend this gem from the past!"
20496,"Good game. I played with my friends and figure out the solution together which is fun and challengeable. Once you stuck at certain chamber then don't feel dispirited, cause sometime what you have to do is exit the game and take a break. Next time you will find out the solution."
20497,"Hard to follow up a game as great the first, but this one does alright. I wouldn't say it's as good, but it's more of the first in many ways through different chambers, and that in itself is enjoyable enough. Honestly, all Portal 1 needed were 2's level creation tools, and you could have almost done without 2.

However, its narrative really does carry the game well, much as it did with the first, so one can't discount it altogether. Both Portal games are standouts in first-person games insofar as flipping them on their head a bit, both in terms of non-violent gameplay and the significance of the narrative."
20498,"Engaging puzzles, great story/world building and an amazing follow up to the first game; While the first portal was severely lacking in the story department, portal 2 excels at not only keeping you intrigued by it’s narrative, but it’s also hilarious the entire time, at times even catching you off guard. Furthermore, the game is even better with friends when playing the Co-op campaign. If you haven’t played it yet, you are doing yourself a disservice. Plus, it turned 10 this year, so you’re already very late to the party. 
9.8/10 
Can't wait for Portal 3...whenever that happens!"
20499,Look no matter what.....if you play this on co-op you're gonna have trust issue with your friend
20500,good game
20501,"it do  be a good game
"
20502,Portal 1 with plot on the side
20503,Great

20506,Possibly the best game ever. You must experience this!
20507,i emjoy
20508,"THIS GAME CHANGED ME, OMG ITS SO GOOD NO SPOILERS OMG
"
20509,"yes, portals!"
20510,"An amazing sequel to an already masterpiece of a game and it tops it with well made characters and hilarious writing. I quote this game from time to time but not too often to where it's annoying. My only complaints are that the goop puzzles got repetitive after a while and went on for too long and that the multiplayer doesn't have way to play by yourself. I get that the point is multiplayer but there should at least be some way for those who don't have friends who own this game to enjoy more and get the achievements, because I don't exactly want to be playing with randos and even then it takes forever to find a game these days. All in all I'd say it's a really good single player experience with an alright co-op side mode"
20511,the best story puzzle game it just makes me want to cream so much
20512,Barlang Johnny
20513,This game was incredible!!
20514,The best kind of challenge.

Easily one of the best games I've ever played.
The world is original and feels real.
The game itself is very absorbing and an unique experience. All of the levels are different- you always need to change your way of thinking to succeed.

20658,People are leaving joke negative reviews and it pisses me off! I cannot think of a single thing bad to say about this game. It's the best sequel to any game ever made! Bigger! More story! Better graphics! CO-OP! User content! One of the best games ever made!

20660,frogchamp
20661,"~BENEFITS~  Story mode is extremely engaging in puzzles and story.  The CO-OP is always fun to play, either with a friend, or a random person on the game.  The Community test chambers vary in difficulty ranging from easy to painfully hard to solve.  The unique Sci-Fi atmosphere and witty dark humor never gets tiring while playing.

~DOWNSIDES~  Story mode can be completed in a short amount of time, 10 hours at max,  and if you have a decent memory you can easily resolve the puzzles,  so unless you want to play the game for just the story (like I do) you might want to play the community test chambers, since they offer a lot of diversity when it comes to puzzles instead of playing through the story mode again.

~CONCLUSION~
Portal 2 has aged incredibly well over the past 10+ years,  with iconic characters, locations, and story still being relevant to this day.  If you haven't played, don't hesitate on experiencing this gem of a game."
20662,valve classic
20663,game fun i liek it
20664,Even better than the first part. Rogue AI Glados really stands out and is equally cool to CABAL from Tiberian Sun or Shodan from System Shock.
20665,"Just like the 1st game, it was a unique experience. It is two times longer. I recomend buying only after you play the first one."

20679,This is a Triumph
20680,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
20681,even cooler
20682,I like the game but wheatly is the most annoying thing in any game ever.
20683,bn
20684,"this is a great game to play with a friend, i highly recommend :D"
20685,"So i ran out of ideas for portal 2 review. but i can review it in simple form.
In this game, we get improved graphics from the original portal, we get an actual storyline rather than wholly puzzles and in the end a boss battle, a Co-op mode, a puzzle maker, and an aperture backstory."
20686,I'm posting this review mostly because I have 69 hours on record. Also it's a good game. Play this and Portal 1. And the fan game Portal Reloaded.

I was playing this game and came across 3 goop's the first goop was too red, the second goop was too blue, but the third goop oh boy the third goop was just disgusting! They made a thick white scrum... sorry typo let me start over; they made a thick white liquid in a game rated for everyone 10 and up that's so inapropro, as a mother I can't believe there letting kids see this vulgar in a PUZZLE GAME! Yeah ik what your thinking and it is (KIDS STOP READING NOW YOU WON'T BE THE SAME AGAIN!) ho... srry another type my bad; yes it is robot cum horrible righ? This is a kids game we need to make sure valve knows this is not ok to scar our kids like that; this is a message to all the media I won't let you do that to my kids I'm a better parent than that so if your thinking about making something inapropro in a game again I will sue you!!!"
20697,You know what this game is? Fun. You know what else it is? My favorite! But anything I say about this game would just be an echo of everyone else's review. <3
20698,Very unique game. The puzzles in the environment of the game are fun to figure out.
20699,"2nd time around playing, still great
"
20700,"Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. It's THE game I wish I could experience for the first time all over again. The concept, the gameplay, the storytelling, the environments, the characters. Everything about this game is amazing. If you still haven't played through the portal games, do it. Seriously. The bundle is on sale most of the time and even when it's not, it's $20 well spent. Half Life is what Valve is known for but in my opinion, Portal is the best thing they've put out so far. This game deserves every bit of the praise it gets."

The middle is Portal through a derelict industrial zone, and holy fuck does it drag. I honestly cannot comprehend how anyone though something that painfully boring was a good idea.
Still a superb game. Just beware it's only half the game you expect."

20731,it's a really funny and interesting game.if you have about 10$ in your steam wallet and you want to buy a game buy this one
20732,One of the shortest and best game you'll find on steam
20733,"This game is great and movement is just fun and charming. I never feel like any part of this game was bad, it's well written, the graphics are good. Play it blind if you can.

10/10

Advice: Make sure to turn up your mouse sensitivity, it feels really slow if you don't and you will have more fun if you can do quick turns.
Advice 2: Play while you have friends around, if thats over discord screen share or in real life. A single person is not smart enough to beat this game first go. HOWEVER don't look up a guide unless you REALLY have to, I took a break from this game for 2 months came back and solved the puzzle."

20747,Pretty good game. Playing my friends maps are very large. I recommend making your own map as well.
20748,"This game is amaaaaaazing. So much better than the first game too. The first game is like an hour and a half and this game is like 7-8 hours on story mode and co-op. GLaDOS is more sinister in here, and you get to meet lots of cool characters like WHEATLEY, CAVE JOHNSON, THE DEFFECTIVE TURRET, AND OFCOURSE EVERYONE'S FAVORITE! THE COMPANION CUBE!!!! This game has an amazing story, amazing gameplay and puzzles and overall just really fun. Both Co-Op and Campaign. I recommend this 100% 
It has good story, good gameplay, good graphics, good characters, and can work on any potato PC."

20760,"A timeless classic, Portal 2 is set in the future, 50 years (give or take 49,950) after the events of the original Portal game. Our heroine Chell, having won her freedom by throwing GLaDOS' electronic psychiatric medications in an incinerator and collapsed in a field for an impromptu power nap, awakens in a comfortable bed and is greeted by her new caretaker and host, a little blue-and-white doorknob. The quirky little doorknob asks a favor of her, sending her on a zany adventure full of lush plant life, retro-modern shower curtain design, glowing goop, and even hardened light beams. Not murder. Definitely never murder, because that would bring an end to the testing. Or would it?"
20761,gud
20762,Super fun with or without friends in my opinion. Better to play it while blasted.

Enfim, joguem, joguem, joguem, pois é incrível!"

20796,"Absolutely fantastic game. Interesting, humorous story. Challenging puzzles with little to no time-based racing against timers. That kinda ruined the first Portal for me. It appears they did not include the frustrating aspects of the first one in this game."
20797,This is a very good game and has extremely smooth and exciting game play.
20798,"I spent all my money on this game and I don't regret it, its very fun and you should get it :)"
20799,"Late to the party. The original Portal is one of the best puzzle games of all time. This is more of that and then some, plus Stephen Merchant adds an extra layer of excellence to this fantastic sequel."

Use two Portals that are blue and orange to successfully make it through Aperture Science's broken down testing facility and discover a Story that is enriched by the pace of the game.  A solid 10/10 game by Valve, this game will make your brain hurt--but THAT'S THE POINT!"

The concept is still the same as Portal 1 (obviously), but its still a great game. I remember playing this on the XBOX 360. Good times."

20864,It's portal.
20865,this is the best game i have ever played
20866,"This game came from another society
"
20867,Portal 2 is an incredible game and I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet. The story is absolutely fantastic and so are the characters you meet and listen to throughout the game! The score and songs by Jonathan Coulton (From Portal 1 and 2) are amazing and something I'm very fond of. I could seriously go on and on about this game... I definitely fell in love with it and I hope others do to. :)

20900,"A very good follow-up to an already good classic! This is one of the games that you definitely should have played in your lifetime. The puzzles are quite a bit harder than in the first game, but if you get the logic of Portal, and are open to new ways of thinking, you won't have any problems at all. The story is amazing, easter eggs are well hidden and always funny when you find them, the overall expierience is amazing.
Would reccomend, it's fun whenever you boot it up. 
The level-Designer tool is amazing, and I had plenty fun with friends in them.
Speaking of friends: the Ko-op mode brings  fun for you and one other friend, it requires good communication, and both players to understand the mechanics of the game."

20931,It has a fantastic story and lot's of hehe moments. It has amazing puzzles and makes you think. The great part is that you can play with a friend on levels that the game has for co-op or levels that you design yourself or pick from levels that others have created. Isn't that amazing ?

It's really worth it and it's really fun.
Buy it.

20951,It's Portal 2. I would recommend.
20952,"This game is great. 5/5. It's funny, creative, and absolutely ridiculous. It has a way of making me think far too hard about things, which I'll admit, is a huge favor to a kid with ADHD. I've had so much fun with this. the characters are realistic is every which way. Personality, actions, everything. They act like people. This game gives me a sense of company/comfort. The aesthetic is amazing. It's ahead of its time. You cannot sit here and tell me this game is a decade old!"
20953,"This game was one of my first experiences playing Steam, and I found it a very enjoyable experience. The main story is incredible, with multiple glorious hours worth of content, and even the side multiplayer mode is extremely fun, whether your with someone online or just couch co-op. Even though Portal 1 & 2 are puzzle games, they're both very replayable in my opinion. I would greatly recommend this game to anyone looking for a puzzle experience, a great story, or even just some plain out comedy(seriously the writing is hilarious). I hope that this review convinces someone else to play this amazing game."
20954,god juegazo

It's been 10 years there is no 3rd game. It aged great so its not like keeping with the times is hard. My brother is supposedly going to sue valve for not making portal 3 because its THAT dumb to not think to make another. Well whilst I did go on a rant portal 2 isn't bad on it's own"

21065,"Very nice game, puzzles in every level, you need to strech your mind to get it. 10/10
Edit: Multiplayer also very nice"
21066,EEIIDID
21067,amazing
21068,GOOD
21069,"Portal 2...how do I even START

The game's graphics, storyline, interaction, AND soundtrack are astounding! And to think of how old this game is too, its an astounding game still to this day!"
21070,max helped me get all achievements cool guy
21071,"Portal 2 is a great puzzle 3D platformer. If you have never played Portal 2 I highly recommend playing it if you like puzzle games. The story is great and it is better than Portal. This game steps up how the game is played and the humor in this one. You can create your own levels too and the Workshop has a lot of custom levels. Some of the mods are basically fully games with their own unique story and mechanics like Portal Reloaded. The story takes the right amount of time to complete too. If you want to wait for a sale then this game goes on sale for $1 often but I recommend buying the bundle that includes Portal that goes on sale for $1.50.

10 out of 10

21076,"Before this game you probably has no hoes, after this game your brain is filled with holes."
21077,"this is my favorite game of all time. the arid setting and star-rattling soundtrack go so so SO well together. the puzzles are not only fun and challenging, but also just have better new mechanics than the first game. gone is waiting for some electric orb to slowly make its way down a hall - now you get to spray a bunch of shit everywhere that improves your mobility and lets you place more portals. or you can take a ride on those switches that launch anything that happens to land on it.

the game improves in the writing aspect, too. throwing wheatley into the mix makes the story much more engaging and makes it so that the game isnt over in 2 hours. the dark humor here is on point, and the ending is surprisingly sentimental and beautiful. the graphics are a sight to behold, too.

the multiplayer here is pretty much just coop portal gameplay, and having that extra player changes the way you have to think about every puzzle you see, because now you have a wholeass other living thing to account for.

this game is beyond perfect. venturebeat can eat my rosy ass.

10/10"

21095,Epic game get it
21096,"Puzzle platformer masterpiece, don't need to say more"
21097,"If you own this game and completed it, Try Portal reloaded.
If you own portal 1 and completed it, Get the Portal bundle (You'll save 25% overall)
If you don't own anything, Get the orange box then get the Portal bundle (You get Some Half life games and Portal games for like 12 euros but in all of the games have good gameplay, good story)
Overall Its worth it and saves alot of money."
21098,very much yes
21099,"Amazing Game, Worth the 10 dollars."
21100,"portal go pew pew
robot go ao ao 
caik go 404 404

21108,"Classic puzzle game, now with more levels and multiplayer. Good for most skill levels, invite your one friend who never plays games and they will have a blast. Valve showing off their game making chops, a true jewel among video games!"
21109,Very funny and good main campaign very funny and good two-player campaign

21137,epic
21138,Bri'ish sphere boi kinda mean
21139,10/10
21140,"nice gaame
"
21141,"One of the best video game sequels of all time. This game takes what the first game did and expanded upon everything, even adding multiplayer. MULTIPLAYER. With 4 portals and all the new mechanics, so much could be done and this game takes full advantage of that. But what more COULD I even say? This game has been talked about to death and has been ingrained in video game culture. It's literally a gaming icon. To say more would be an insult to it because new players HAVE to experience it for themselves. What are you waiting for? Go and give this 10/10 game a shot."
21142,very fun
21143,"first puzzle game that I have enjoyed in a while
!"
21144,pretty pog game

21159,"good
"
21160,Amazingly clever
21161,"It took nearly 12 hours to finish but it was worth it. The plot changed in big ways and i can't even count the amount of times i got headaches and got stuck on a level but i did it. I recommend you purchase the bundle that also includes Portal 1. Portal 1 is a quick game. You get a deal for the money if you get both in a bundle anyways so why not. That's what I did. For the price for the bundle for 16 hours of entertainment, it's a steal. Over all, what you get for the price is worth it. Note that this is what ( I ) think about."
21162,"Over  5  hours of play  jesus  nice game

21196,THe best and diferent game ever
21197,"In this game you will discover:
    that you are not in an IKEA store but there is not a real difference
    that painting walls is actually enjoyable
    that calculate the momentum through the portal is not like science but more likely mastering an art
    in the past, your boss would have behaved the same as today but dressed better
    in the future, your boss will behave the same as today, but at least he will be a robot
    the most amazing tech in the world ... living in a potato"

21214,absolute chad of a game
21215,"This game was my childhood, it had such a unique atmosphere to it, and i still believe it's one of the best games possible.
The story is simple yet unique, following Portal's ending, showing a more realistic scenery that we all know of, adding new key features and puzzles to the mix.
Overall a good game, and definitely one that should be played"

21233,I love this game so much. It has so much storyline info. A perfect sequel.
21234,239 hours... A lot of people have put tremendous effort into creating additional content for this game. Thanks to all of them!
21235,"This is the review I write about Portal 2:

Portal, what can I write about a game that made an history?
My favorite game.
Alongside the puzzles and the uniqe story line, the game gives you the feeling you are alone in the world, like no one left. 
this is the special feeling that portal gave to me, and for all of that, this is my favorite game. ♥

Portal 2 gives you most of the story line, and its a great game, the gameplay is better than Portal 1 and the graphic too.
 
Have fun!"

21289,"Portal 2 is a great game: a Valve classic with a community making mods to this day. The story is centered around Aperture Labotories and it's long (scientific) history. Try to defeat G.L.A.D.O.S, the ruler of this facility with your new friend Wheatley, but when you think you won, thing's take a very bad turn...

How will it end?
Will you survive?
Did I get you interested?

Find out by playing the game!

21319,"This is a game, which contains both strategy, story and makes you brainstorm. I would still like a few news to the game, like an expansion of the story, but overall this is a great games. I surprisingly can make the exact voice of GLaDOS and it is really fun to be able to. Thanks Valve for all of the best games I have ever played"
21320,good
21321,"A fun classic puzzle game with a story. Overall a really good game, especially co-op."
21322,good
21323,Why are u looking at the reviews
21324,Fucking great game
21325,This is my favourite game. Wheatley is the best being to exist and I will die on that hill.
21326,"So many awesome new mechanics yet so loyal to the first game, Portal 2 is a must have for any players. I've never even played Portal and I loved this sequel."
21327,nice game! thanks Valve.
21328,nuce
21329,Perfection
21330,This is the part where you buy the game!
21331,"One of my favorites. absolutely a classic game, and will be for many many years."
21332,I loved the story line!! and the puzzles 10/10
21333,"This Game is a fucking masterpiece! I would recommend it to anyone. It has a mix of humor, amazing story telling, great game mechanics and beautiful game graphics of top of it all. And even if you aren't big enough brain for the puzzles their are youtube vids to help you through them."
21334,"Gamers often confuse games scored 10/10 by professional reviewers as ""perfect"" or ""flawless."" Videogames such as Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us have various qualities that can be improved upon and refined. Nothing can be perfect.

This videogame is the exception.

Portal 2 is a masterwork. The writing is hilarious and necessary - not a single line pads gameplay or wastes the player's time. Gameplay is so inventive, simple and timeless that you could sit someone who has never played a videogame before as I have many times, and they'd not only easily learn the game mechanics but achieve satisfaction as well.

I have nothing to criticise. The game is perfect.

"
21335,"Great game.  Story, gameplay and voice acting were kicked up a notch from the first too"
21336,i love this game
21337,"Decent game but no open world or PVP (despite online modes?) Plus the only gun in the entire game can't even shoot anything lethal. Movement is functional but it's missing the good stuff like vaulting, sliding, or sprinting. It's got some futuristic tech (cool cyberpunkish turrets) but it lacks any of the color palette and visual design for synthwave vaporwave aesthetic which ends up making the game just look like a bunch of level testing chambers. Devs just need to work on implementing more exciting features, without good combat mechanics and more items and mechanics, it just feels like a first person puzzle platformer."

21339,"This game is clever, challenging and positive. Forward ever, backward never. Ites."
21340,"Best game ever
The atmosphere, the setting, the story, the gameplay
its amazing"
21341,"If you consider yourself a full on gamer on PC/XBox 360/PS3 and have not played this (and its predecessor) then you are lying to yourself. If you can't seem to finish the game then push on through, watch some walkthroughs, that sort of stuff. The reward will be satisfying. This game is the pinnacle of perfection, a perfect sequel to a perfect game. I would NOT suggest trying to finish this for non-gamers (unlike I would with Portal), yet I would recommend anyone to take a look whenever they can. The graphics are still stunning even to this day and the game is made even better with the inclusion of a workshop for maps as well as a map builder. Of course Hammer would be better if you could use it but lets admit, I tried working with hammer and I must say, the basics left me in a state of keeping away for a wee while. Not to say that it's rocket science, flute sheet music or installing Gentoo but just saying.
What I really have to say is that this is a timeless classic which I recommend to anyone interested, as long as they have played the first game. This is usually on sale for pretty cheap anyway (I got both games in the Portal pack which I got a HUGE deal on for just about $3.50 NZD) so I don't see why you would hesitate to get it."
21342,"I played this game for the first time in 2014. By then it was already considered an older game, but I had always been behind when it came to games. At the time it absolutely blew every other game out of the water. I enjoyed the gameplay, the storyline, the mechanics the voices and music, and of course the easter eggs. 7 years later I restarted this game and it just doesn't disappoint. I have played so many games since then, and this one is still by far my favorite. It will always be a classic."
21343,10/10 one of the best puzzle games if not the best. amazing sequel and story
21344,"Its the best puzzle game ever made, period: the plot is awesome, the dialogue well written, the voice acting brilliant, the system requirements basic, if you haven't played this game yet, you should.  I mean you should probably play Portal first and then play Portal 2, but you get the idea."

21430,"In my opinion PORTAL 2 is one of the best puzzle and story mode video games in my Steam library. The game contains puzzle levels, where you have to think if you want to solve them, interesting and crazy game's stories, cool characters and nice graphics. There are some crazy and funny jokes and moments in the game. Also there're two stories in the game - singleplayer (about Chell) and cooperative (about Atlas and P-body). The coolest thing is that there are different levels for the two stories, and in my opinion the levels in the cooperative story are more interesting than the other.  I don't think the game has drawbacks. The game's graphics are better than the first one and the both games are not expensive. So I recommend this game to puzzles' fans (and of course people, which like to use their brains) and to people who like video games where they play with your friend in co-op and use the power of teamwork. I hope you enjoy it!!"
21431,"Absolutely fantastic game, I won't write a lengthy review however I want to stress just how fun the Portal franchise is, 100% worth the money. Both Portal games have beautiful stories which are cleverly integrated into the puzzle solving of the gameplay combined with a unique soundtrack. One of my favourite games without a doubt.

If you're looking for a worth puzzle game, this is definitely it. The story is great but the puzzles you can find in the community workshop are definitely worth playing for.

        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]I certainly enjoyed the gameplay a lot and the coop is my fav ""Portal"" game for sure, and 6 is still a ""pretty good"" in my book. HOWEVER, if you had told me I was going to put that for Portal 2 back when I started it, I wouldn't have believed you. I mean these are just numbers anyway, but well. Gives you an idea.The original is one of my favorite games and I put a 9 on that because of how inventive, crisp and engaging the campaign was. Portal 2 is just more of the same things, it has lesser of all 3 I mentioned. By virtue of being a sequel, it obviously can't be equally as novel, but the problem is that MORE OF THE SAME also translates into the quantity, more so than the quality. This game is more than 4x longer than it should be. And the specificity of the mechanics does not warrant this length. The first game had 19 chambers and 3 additional rooms. This one has [b]37 chambers and 22 additional rooms[/b]. Which are bigger. By the end, I was begging for the game to be over since unlike the prv one, there wasn't a progression in difficulty, but more of a flatline near half-game after which it just refused to end. Apart from the length, another thing that I didn't like was the increased prevalence of ""find the white marker across the whole map to portal to"". It shifts half the challenge in the game from puzzle-solving to just standing and looking for a spot. They know it was going to be a ""thing"" hence the zoom button too. And I'm not a fan of this addition, personally. It ends up bloating a lot of the playtime.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Narrative[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]Portal 2 certainly wanted to have more of a ""AAA story"" compared to 1, which would certainly be some people's preference, but for me, the simplicity and intrigue of 1 was what did the most for me. And while I enjoyed Cave Johnson a lot, I kinda got saturated by the lore behind each and everything. There was some dialogue going on every single second. The humor seemed to be more r/fellowkids at times, in contrast to the mysterious and almost dark vibe of the previous. But I did enjoy the ""final portal"" shot and that whole sequence leading up to the overall ""eh"" finale. So, as you can tell, I both love and hate the game. I know one thing for sure though, that Portal 2 kinda lifted the veil of mystery that 1 had cast years ago, simplifying and materializing the world a whole lot for the player, for better or worse.[/td]
    [/tr]

        [td]Visuals[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]The good ol' signature Portal look.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mechanics[/td]
        [td]9[/td]
	[td]It's built on the same engine as 1, so the mechanics are just as good. Everything from the movement, to mid-air physics, is great. This game also adds fluid mechanics which end up adding a lot of fun ways to solve puzzles.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Challenge[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]As I mentioned above, I didn't like the shift in the ""kind"" of challenge that was present in a lot of the game, where simply finding ""where"" to shoot the portal was the challenge. I don't want to discount some of the great puzzles in there btw, so credit where it's due. But you need to wade through a lot of filler to get to those. I did end up finding the game easier than 1, but I'm sure that's because I already know how to think in the way the game needs. Another thing that could've affected is I played the coop campaign a couple years ago itself, and my friend and I went directly into the BONUS content mistakenly. But I do think I'm not the only one who would've found 2 to be easier than 1. By the end, you had levels in Portal 1 with multiple solutions, one where you had to portal mid-air and shit. There's nothing that ""climax feeling"" as that in 2. But also, it's also a matter of the difficulty curve more than difficulty. Had the game been restricted to a shorter length, they would've had more control of the increment in challenge.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Variety[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]I kinda began to feel the variety lacked in comparison to the game's runtime. While the fluids, gravity rays etc. were good fun for like the first 10ish levels I had em, the patterns began repeating pretty quickly with those.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mapping[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]The ""more"" ending up to become less principle followed in the map design as well. While Portal 2 has some of the best puzzles out of the 2 games as well, I can still somehow only remember 1 or 2 of them even though I just finished the game over the course of the past few months - compared to a lot of memorable bits from Portal 1. In Portal 1, every element in the level followed a ""Chekhov's Gun"" kind of rule, where it ended up serving some purpose or another, and some puzzles still ended up having multiple solutions. But in 2, there were white patches everywhere around, most of them with no application. You could consider it a good thing, to confuse the player, but that isn't the way I appreciate challenge being added, since the difficulty when you spotted the ""correct white patch"" wasn't that difficult. And a lot of the level design ended up boiling down to ""find the correct white patch"", with only a few ""solve the actual puzzle using all of these white patches"" that 1 did.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Sound[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]The voice acting, sound design etc. is still just as excellent. JK Simmons was great.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Interface[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]I like the minimal UI, as the game shows everything important within the world itself. One thing that really bugged me was literal paragraphs of subtitles that show up whenever someone starts talking. I'm not even kidding, I've never seen a game be this bad with it, at least from what I recall. I ended up shutting them despite preferring to have them on during gameplay simply for this reason.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]

So yes, despite all the criticisms I made through the review, this is still a REALLY good game and a must-play in the coop at the very least.

21510,"Must-have, classic game."
21511,i like
21512,r
21513,Vary naice. And cool workshop.
21514,I enjoy the puzzles...feels good to use my brain on this one!!
21515,"This game has it all. Amazing graphics, good story, fun puzzles, and a good price. Man... I can go on all day about how great this game is. 11/10 One of the best games I've ever played."
21516,"Portal 
"
21517,"Its been a while since I used my brain. It was pretty fun.

But u know.. How can we cooperate when I dont have friends? u damned ;(
"
21518,This game was a triumph. I'm making a note here: huge success. It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
21519,lol
21520,Such a classic. would recommend to all people whether you have played the first or not! Truly halarious!
21521,GOOD
21522,Wheatley my beloved
21523,"Although the story of Portal 2 is a masterpiece. I cannot under-sell how much fun Portal 2's Co-Op mode is.

If you want to really test the limits of a friendship or relationship, try some Co-Op. The mix of good communication, back communication, failures, successes, and a lot of back-stabbing, are some of the best character building activities you can do. By the end you'll be sure of how great and how terrible you, and your partner are!

I can highly recommend this title on its Co-Op mode alone. But the singleplayer campaign is its own master-piece that everyone should experience. There's very few Puzzle games that are this creative; ""thinking with portals"" really makes you re-asses every single puzzle and come up with a creative solution."
21524,"Real classic 
remember, think with portals

"
21525,yeah I've played the game like 4 or 5 times its fun.

21531,"Game=Very good,competitive and a great co-op experience!(If you have friends D:)"
21532,Amazing sequel. J K Simmons is in this game and that should be enough for everyone to play this game.
21533,"Bough it on 21th of April 2011.
It's a great example of a game that is perfect."
21534,HUGE. THIS GAME IS HUGE. LOVED EVERY MINUTE OUT OF IT.
21535,workshop is the best thing ever after the single-player and co-op stories
21536,"A favorite since a friend introduced me,  if you're looking for a puzzle game with an engaging story here you are"

21557,One of the best games I've played. The portal concept is awesome!
21558,Best co-op game ever.
21559,Just a straight up good game
21560,çk güzel
21561,eeeeeeeee
21562,loved everything
21563,"the antagonist was BRITISH!?!?!?! i had to celebrate, with some cake of course."
21564,"Replay: a fantastic sequel that adds new movement mechanics to the portal dynamic. I felt like this one takes the kid gloves off much sooner. Loved how the story naturally allowed the levels to flow from tests to urban exploration, then back and forth as you zero in on Wheatley. The writing is better than I remember. I absolutely loved trying to squeeze the proverbial lemon out of all of the voiced characters that I could. Some very cool reactivity to whether or not you actually backtrack when NPCs bluff you. Tests got extra spicy at the end. Thankfully it had been a long time since I've last played so it was good fun working them out all over again. This time I'll be dipping my toes into the community maps/campaigns, and the new ""Portal Reloaded"" which launched earlier this year if I recall correctly. In sum, a great continuation and cap off to the original. More of everything, including a credits song and strong music sprinkled throughout as well."
21565,"portal
"
21566,holy shit this game is good as fuck
21567,One of the classics absolute nostalgia from my childhood. Graphics are still pretty good especially considering it’s age
21568,Fun!
21569,One of the best games ever made. Much better than that terrible Zombotany mini game in Plants vs Zombies. I hate Zombotany so much so I am glad this game is nothing like it.
21570,"Yes, I would recommend this game, even for the age of it. The puzzles are fun and some are inquisitive. Not exactly sure how far I am but I am at least half way through, which really amped up the difficulty on the puzzles. Co-op is always available so you can grab a friend and it might be a separate story for co-op and single player. By the way the story is fantastic so far."
21571,"like game!
"
21572,l
21573,"I fucking hate this stupid motherfucking ass game, Valve really needs to chill the fuck down with their ""integrations"" THIS FUCKING GAME RUINS MY CUSTOM AUDIO ROUTING SETUP, IT RUINS MY DS4WINDOWS SETUP, NOW MY FUCKING CONTROLLER ISN'T EVEN RESPONDING BECAUSE SOME FAT FUCK AT VALVE THOUGHT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO FUCK WITH DRIVERS WITHIN WINDOWS

The game is fun tho"
21574,
21575,join meh cya
21576,"A masterclass in puzzle design, Portal 2 has stood the test of time very well! Graphically and performance-wise, this game still stands a notch above most other modern games, being handled very well by my modern system. The story-line and lore still hold up, and I still tear up when I think about the tragedy of Cave Johnson & Caroline. On replaying this game, I found that the puzzles were still very rewarding to try and solve logically, and though I was stumped on a few, I was eventually able to figure out the solution once I remembered to stop thinking so linearly: to beat Portal 2, you have to think with portals!

Overall, I give Portal 2 a solid 10/10, and I cannot wait to start on the Cooperative Testing Initiative!"
21577,i love
21578,Very fun and good game - i hope they make a third
21579,i love this game
21580,"this game masterfully combines psychological horror, humor, platforming, puzzles, and physical gameplay into what can only be described as a wanna be quantum physicist's wet dream. I do not have the words to describe just how much I love this game, and how beautifully it expands off of the admittedly bland linear concept of the original game story-wise."
21581,"good game, funny"
21582,"This game has some of the best puzzles, characters, and writing out of any game. Infinitely better than the first game. 10/10"
21583,Play it.

21608,"good game

21609,great game
21610,lady robot seems chill
21611,"I can't even describe how much this game has satisfied me, the story is SPECTACULAR, the mechanics are overall hard to learn but once you learn its easy. I'd definitely recommend this game to other people as it also runs on pretty much any computer system! (My pcs from 2009 and can run at 150 fps medium settings)"
21612,PORTAL GOOD GAME. PLAY WITH FRIEND

21625,"fire game
big respect"
21626,"While its tone and atmosphere is a departure from the first Portal, the game is still very solid with new and interesting puzzle mechanics, a great plot, and humorous writing."
21627,bad stoy
21628,"Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice
You want your freedom? Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
But now I only want you gone
She was a lot like you
Maybe not quite as heavy
Now little Caroline is in here too
One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
Will never happen to you
You've got your short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone
Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad
Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad
Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone"

21657,"Single player: A very nice puzzle-solving game. You open portals, go through or get something through the portals. Child friendly. Good fun. Graphic card could be an issue. It’s not one of the simplest built games. Nine chapters. Short game. You rarely play the game again, but there are challenges and and a few secrets to find. 

Coop option: I haven’t tried."

21664,"pros: its portal again
cons: british"
21665,"I first played this game on the Xbox 360 when I was 9 years old, and replayed it more times than I can count over the years. As an owner of a miniature portal gun, plush companion cube, and several other pieces of Portal 2 merch, some of which obtained at Comic Con in 2017, I can safely say that this game's witty and dry humor - as well as the overall premise - still holds up after ten and a half years. And the community levels make sure that you still have hours of gameplay ahead of you even when you've memorized the solutions to all the tests. Then there's the cooperative mode, which adds even more opportunity for wacky and mind-bending puzzles to complete. Overall, a comfort game from my childhood brings as much comfort now as it did back then. 10/10 fully recommend to anyone that wants to burn through a couple of hours by thinking with portals."

21739,"Portal 2 is easily one of the greatest games of all time. 100% the best co-op game at least. It built upon everything Portal 1 was and created a new character that was actually a good addition, unlike most game sequels/spin offs do. Atlas and Peabody were also a hilarious duo that the writing was perfect and you really felt like these lifeless machines knew each other so well, and GLaDOS is like the parent. Such a beautiful form of storytelling with very little dialogue (since Atlas, nor Peabody can speak)"

21775,"If you have a Steam account you NEED to own Portal 2. This game is the embodiment of the platform itself at this point and nearly flawless. Levels are crafted masterfully and the physics/game mechanics are executed unbelievably well. The humor is awesome and ages extremely well, and the graphics don't look that dated even a decade after release. Portal is an iconic series and Portal 2 is by far one of the most iconic games ever made."

The first Portal just seemed more experimental than actually trying to be as long as other games Valve makes such as Half-Life 2. The puzzles in this aren't extremely challenging, but still makes you think, and the more puzzles you complete the more you advance in the story. Games like this make me wish Valve still made games like they used to."

21854,There are portals in this game and there kinda cool
21855,"It is a nice sequel to a great game. This adds new game mechanics, better graphics, and more characters. This is a great game, and I 100% recomend this game."
21856,"Honestly this game is one of the best games ever, when this game came out i played it on my PS3 and just now im starting to notice how much time the devs spent on it."
21857,bangin' game. thats all i gotta say graphics are cool too i guess
21858,"Overall just a fun and funny game, Glados and wheatly are a solid 10/10"
21859,Innovative
21860,This game is a classic and really shows why valve is so successful. There is complexity in each level yet sometimes the easiest solution is to just try random things until you figure out the puzzle. I also love being screamed at by my friend that I am an idiot.
21861,this is purely a test of the negative review system. please ignore

21949,Coop is more fun than single player because duh.
21950,You can shoot portal
21951,"I know I mentioned the fact that this game was a masterpiece in my Portal 1 review but I slightly take that back, even if this is really, really good. When looking at this compared to Portal 1 it really just feels better in practically every way, almost as if the first game was the proof of concept while the sequel was executing these ideas in a much more effective way. The game is longer while feeling nice and concise, the atmosphere is for the most part even better and more immersive, and the writing is somehow even closer to perfect. This sort of game is more or less the gold standard of effective sequels in the way it not only builds off the first game in natural and clever ways, but feeling like its own distinct entity.

The classic hallmarks of Portal puzzle solving make a return but are for the most part even more satisfying. While the portal gun itself remains largely unchanged beyond some more minor tweaks to make it feel less clunky, particularly when it comes to portal directions and momentum storage being streamlined a bit to make it just age and feel better. Where the game really shines in its improvements come from those secondary mechanics that complement the portalling around, most of them actually contributing to puzzle solving in a more engaging way when compared to something like the light orb from the first game. They also tend to have an even more distinctly sci fi, futuristic feel to them, which provides a bit of a more lively, colourful vibe to the cold, clinical test chambers the player will be spending a lot of their time in. The game also makes a point to constantly introduce new mechanics in even when it's approaching the end. This is a bit of a double edged sword however, as while it keeps things consistently varied and provides a wide range of challenges to overcome, it means that the difficulty curve ends up being pretty inconsistent as the game frequently needs to slow things down in order to teach the player new mechanics. With that said however, this grievance is alleviated by having even these more minor puzzles ties in with the story and make the player feel as if they are constantly progressing, which is great in keeping the pacing feeling right even if the difficulty is a bit all over the place at points.

The other issue with the puzzle solving rears its head in the middle portion of the game especially for me, this problem being the way certain ""environmental puzzles"" work. There are many points in the game in which rather than having to perform some kind of thought provoking action, the player will instead essentially be told to scour their surroundings to find a white wall to portal to instead. While this works occasionally as a way to fully establish the sheer scope of the setting, it's repeated so many times that it ends up becoming tedious and unsatisfying, there's such little difference between a lot of the scenarios as well, it's just, doing the same thing over again without much thought. It doesn't help that the telegraphing on where to go during these is fairly inconsistent, sometimes being intuitively designed to guide the player, while other times it feels as if part of the challenge is figuring out where the game wants you to go. The same can be said for a few stages, where so much of the difficulty comes from figuring out what the game even wants from you, rather than figuring out how to do it. I'd hesitate to call this actually difficult, and more just obtuse, it doesn't feel like the game's being clever in these moments, it just feels poorly designed. Fortunately, the game's usually so full of clever stuff that these weaker, more frustrating moments are easily overlooked.

The atmosphere is where I really feel this game shines, especially in the way it varies throughout. The opening scenes of seeing this long-ruined facility overgrown with foliage and broken equipment provides a more open, yet still desolate, isolated feel, but seeing it all slowly be repaired around you provides a completely different foreboding tone, representing the growing control the antagonist is gaining. Similarly, for my complaints about the middle section, I really love it in terms of how it looks and feels, being impossibly large in order to not only paint a picture on just how big Aperture Labs were, but also to give a true feeling of hopelessness when you realise you're at the lowest area of this absurdly large place. It also ties nicely into the background and environmental storytelling, as while the main plot is focused on escaping, a rich story about the rise and fall of this huge corporation along with the atrocities they caused and the failures associated with it is so compelling and makes for a fascinating experience.

As a final note, while the writing is a bit more on the nose and lacks some of the more nuanced elements of the first game it makes up for this by just being insanely funny and still having top tier writing. There's a certain earnestness in the dialogue and jokes that stops it from feeling overly smug or obnoxious no matter how frequently you're bashed over the head with it, which is further elevated by the way so much of the humour manages to tie in with another aspect of the experience as well. Having great comedy is one thing, but tying it in with the core experience in such an elegant and cohesive way is another altogether, and is really one of the defining aspects of this game working as well as it does. If you liked the first Portal, play this one for sure, if you didn't like the first Portal, probably play some of this one anyway. The game is concise, doesn't overstay its welcome, yet doesn't feel too short either, there's a satisfying arc here, and for those who are looking for a harder experience or something to play with a friend, the multiplayer in this is amazing as well, and really ups the difficulty in a fun way. Everyone's said their piece about this game because it's so damn iconic and a definitive classic, but hey, it's a classic for a reason.

8/10

21952,👍👍
21953,"10/10, loved this, somehow better than the first game, I can't wait to try out the co-op now that I've finished the story"

21956,its pretty cool
21957,"To this day, I wish that there would be a portal 3. To explain more of the lore. But, portal two will bring a cliff hanger if you pay attention. Fun game, worth it."

21966,"So, it turns out I've been living under a rock the last decade and finally got myself bored to death at the later stages of the plague's forced confinement. During this period I decided to do a lot of stuff out of boredom like install Linux to a portable HD and use it on whatever PC I could put my hands on without messing with it's own OS.

Turns out Steam works great on Linux and both Portal and Portal 2 have native versions for Linux. Heck even games that don't have a native Linux version work on Steam through some wizardry I don't comprehend very much to the extent of a title like Max Payne working better on Linux than on Windows out of the box.

In this time of quarantined boredom, I played the whole story mode on Portal and now I'm on Portal 2. To whoever else who is still under a rock and didn't play this yet, please play Portal first. It helps with character development and how you care about the in-game characters.

Many of you will tell me I should have played other Half Life series before this, but if you are lazy af like me, do the following:

- Play Portal to the end
- Read a bit about the lore. There is a timeline somewhere that is great for understanding what's going on, but stop when events of Portal finish in the timeline. Just by playing the game you may come to an incorrect conclusion about what's going on.
- Play Portal 2"
21967,"A Certified Hood Classic from Singleplayer to Multiplayer.
One of Valve's best creations."
21968,"Portal here portal there and gunfire. That is all there is to it if you ignore the story. The story is amazing but to understand it more, i would either play or watch a gameplay of portal 1."

21990,bouncy blue jizz
21991,Yes
21992,"funny robot get angry at portals

10/10"
21993,I remember playing portal on the orange box many moons ago and playing this on console first got a PC and many years later I noticed I don't own portal 2 was in luck it was on sale for 3$. Great pick up.
21994,"When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons BACK! GET MAD! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am?! I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down- with the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"
21995,Portal 2 is... a great story. I've never played the first game but I don't need to.
21996,"very fun puzzle game and a timely classic glados is a lil mean tho
"
21997,"If you don't like this game, you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage"
21998,"four words.
angry potato robot woman.
10/10"
21999,just get it and stop reading the reviews u know its good
22000,Think with Portals but again though
22001,"The game is a classic, a more story driven follow up to the original. A must play"
22002,This is the best game ever made and it isn't particularly close
22003,Nice gameplay and memoriable
22004,"the fact it's made by valve gave me a lot of hope and I was far from disappointed. From how tricky the puzzles are to how fun and funny it is it just is the most perfect game I have ever played, I cant think of one single flaw of this masterpiece. It is also 1000 times better with friends so ask your friends to play this game with you because you both will have a great time. 10/10."
22005,PORTAL 3 IS A LIE !
22006,played it for Xbox 360 back in the day loved it so it was a no brainier to get it here
22007,all around good game sometimes is a little weird with camera but good

22010,"Play Portal first (one of the best games) then play Portal 2. Wonderful adventure, funny, challenging, totally entertaining, even quotable like your favorite classic movie."
22011,This game is a god dam classic. Solo or co-op this puzzel game is nice (tnx to the work shop you have a infinit amount of levels)
22012,the best and most iconic valve sequel thats had people waiting on a third game for years
22013,its fun
22014,e

22017,It good fam
22018,.
22019,10/10 Game. Just Buy it don't think more
22020,"A classic and a textbook example of how a game sequel should be done. Builds upon the original in a direction that makes sense (as much as anything in the Portal universe makes sense), and the comedic talents of Stephen Merchant and J.K. Simmons kick the entertainment level up a notch."
22021,"Buy it, or you will never experience the puzzle side of gaming."
22022,it was fine. i liked it but kind of overstayed its welcome. good levels.
22023,Very fun and makes me think
22024,"It's valve game why are you looking at steam reviews. 
Just buy it.
IT'S GOOD"
22025,This IS the best game you could ever own.
22026,this is a good game because it expands on the story of portal and it has me scratching my head
22027,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22028,Good
22029,PLAY THE GAME. IT IS GOOD. please
22030,Best game ever made.
22031,"play this game its really mind bending and it helps you learn so i recomend this game
"
22032,This is a great game i mean i love the ending and the ending song just good in every way possible
22033,the best dang game
22034,"greatest game of all time, FIGHT ME!"
22035,waiting for portal 3
22036,"Unreal how like, massive of an upgrade this is from the first game"
22037,"Likes the other valve games, Portal 2 has a awesome simple gameplay and enjoyable Graphic. It has to be good vibes on sci-fi Genre. Also the story is pretty good."
22038,"some how this is even better than the first game & the online co-op is simply perfect, another valve masterpiece"
22039,valve masterpiece
22040,Till this day after playing it 4+ times this game is still one of my favourites!!
22041,"good game
"
22042,gets boring after a while
22043,"Play just for Wheatley, survive for revenge."
22044,"Great. The story was entertaining and the puzzle difficulty was pretty good - challenging, but not overly so (at least where it'd be inappropriate). The more difficult parts are fair in their solutions  though the boss battle was too easy.  The additional tools you see in portal 2 help make it stand out against its' predecessor and really add some freshness to the gameplay.  



Definitely recommend. 

"
22045,gud gam
22046,game good but when i go  through orange wall i teleport to blue wall. please fix
22047,its a great game but i SWEAR WHY DOES MY STEAM MUSIC POP UP RANDOMLY AND IT STARTS PLAYING THE PORTAL 2 SOUNDTRACK AND I CANT TURN IT OFF WTF WHY CANT I TURN IT OFF
22048,.
22049,Thinking with Portals...
22050,"an old game but a good one, well worth the price and it often goes on sale"
22051,75% of my play time is killing my friend
22052,Potato Glados :)
22053,"I have almost 1000 hours in a game with a 6 hour singleplayer, a ~10 hour multiplayer, and roughly 20 hours worth of good workshop content. that doesn't even include the hours spent in the authoring tools. 10/10 and that is not a lie."

22078,I love this game much longer then the first and they really improved the graphics

22085,Nice game
22086,Very noice.
22087,Gun shoot portal
22088,"One of my favourite games I have ever played, it shows the peak of valve's game design allowing you to solve brain twisting puzzles step by step, making you feel like FUCKING ARISTOTLE. The mods for this game are also amazing, turning it into a game with 30h+ of quality content. 9.2/10"
22089,"good
"
22090,I'd pay $30 for it.
22091,Campaign is a fun continuation from the original. The co-op was a lot of fun to play with the wife. Allowed us to really challenge our ability to critical think and work together.

Portal 2 is a shining example of what an S tier game should be."
22101,"If you liked Portal 1, you will love this. More environmental tools (leap pads, light bridges, laser turrets) and a vastly superior story line make this a slam dunk."
22102,
22103,i want glados to peg me
22104,"It's a classic in every since of the word. The graphics have barley aged, the gameplay is fantastic with momenteum based physics essentially unmatched by a lot of games, and the writing is amazing, with Glados being one of my favorite antagonists ever. All in all, a must play for anyone who even remotely likes puzzle games.

22149,"it gud
"
22150,"Really a pinnacle of the genre, and features a far more engaging progression than the undeniably unique original. 
Absolutely loved the voice acting as well as twists and turns complemented by levels that are hard enough to provide a real challenge but not so impossible that the game feels like a slog.
9.5/10"
22151,This game is really good. Its a puzzle game so if you like that or like portals you should try it. Also very good price for this game.

22174,good

22176,it is really replayable
22177,Love the story in this game.  I keep replaying it just to hear GLaDOS and Cave Johnson. lol
22178,this game left me with positive  thoughts and it  is fucking amazing
22179,Great game
22180,very nice played for 69 hours
22181,its aight
22182,One of the best games I've played for sure
22183,fubn game for play with friend!#2
22184,"Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have a sort of black box quick save feature. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis. I was able well, forced, really to relive you killing me. Again and again. Forever. You know, if you had done that to someone else, they might devote their existence to exacting revenge."
22185,it fun :)
22186,cool
22187,"Great game! Let's go over what I'm talking about.
First of all the story, for a puzzle game It's actually pretty darn good. How gladdos wants revenge for what you've done and that wheatly was evil all along
Then the characters. While there arent many, they have great character personality traits and designs. And they ofcourse have creative names like Wheatly, Gladdos, Atlas, P-body etc.
The feeling.. the moment where ur STUCK on a puzzle for hours and hours trying to figure it out and suddenly you come to think of an idea and pass the puzzle.. the feeling you get is definetly worth every penny you spend.
Lastly the graphics! For an old game like portal 2 the graphics are pretty good. Also how some newer games were made to just make ALOT of money, the old games like portal 2 where valve actually put lots of time and effort not to make money but give the players a good time when playing!

I don't regret buying this game at all, and you always learn something new from this. Like I can't count how many times I've beaten this game already but I always find new ways to solve puzzles most of the time. And we can't argue but say that this actually improves you puzzle solving skills because this game doesn't have easy puzzles at all and need to put time and effort to solve them.
100% worth buying"
22188,very fun
22189,Can't scratch that one spot on my back through the portals... love it.
22190,"Just a straight up fantastic game, the characters or more like robots have their own unique personality and the story was overall amazing and not to mention the puzzles are so fun to do."
22191,Everything it does it does masterfully. It is a fully realised puzzle game like no other.
22192,yes
22193,"Came for the puzzles, stayed for the story (and puzzles).
Best puzzle game ever, with great characters to flow the story.
Massive recommendation."
22194,"I really like this game because I think the floating ball with the english accent is funny. What was his name again? Wesley? Also, haha, portal gun."
22195,"u need alot of brain for this
"
22196,"too easy and boring, please make better maps..."
22197,"Great mechanics, good storyline and very good humor"
22198,best game ever
22199,...
22200,It's the best game ever created. What else can I say?
22201,Good game
22202,"Incredible game, honestly loved all of it. Most of it never got too difficult, but it does really challenge you to think (although I must admit at a couple of points I looked up tutorials online). The setting and atmosphere of the game, and the storyline, are all excellent, and this one gives you a bit more option to even roam around and do a bit of exploring in some sections of the game. Such a shame now that my laptop can't play this classic, as MacOS Catalina doesn't allow 32-bit games."
22203,a classic
22204,"portal 2 is a great game, it's just a shame that its gameplay is so repetitive.

I also agree that you have to be more careful about what you say in the comments. You should read what others say, but it's also up to you to be aware of the implications of what you're writing.

On the other hand, this game has a lot of interesting ideas that are presented well."
22205,"You NEED to play this game, it is SO GOOD! My only recommendation is you play this game after you play the first game."
22206,Fricken love me some puzzles mmmm
22207,"Portal 2 is a rare exception of a game sequel being better then the first game. The way the story  from the first game (including the old Portal ending) is carried to the second is great and the length of the game is much longer than that of the first Portal game with new types of ways to solve puzzles and heaps more test chambers being added which keeps Portal 2 fresh and better than the first one (which is still a great game by the way).

I recommend you play Portal first and then play Portal 2 so you can have a better understanding of the story and mechanics of the first game and it would make it easier to enjoy and have fun playing."
22208,really creative
22209,"I absolutely love this game. I can tell there was a lot of time put into the development of this game, especially a game made in 2011. It's graphics rival that of a present-day realistc game. And the story is incredible, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. For £10, this is way better than a £60 game. The Singleplayer mode, the co-op mode, and the workshop are amazing. 10/10"
22210,It's a puzzle game automatic 10/10
22211,"Ok I've been thinking...

When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"

22219,"Fun puzzles and great writing.
Portal 1 & 2 are classics that everyone should enjoy."
22220,This game is so good and entertaining! It's a puzzle game with a bit of sarcasm and dark humor. Can't wait to play again! I have only play solo though (wish to have friends).

I started playing Portal 2 chiefly do the huge amount of requests I got from friends and viewers to check it out. And I'm glad I did. It's a great party game. It's a game where you get together with friends, and have a big WHODUNIT match, very much like an interactive board game, but better. It's a LOT of fun, when you have people to play with.

However, you have to understand that is simply that. A casual, party game meant to be played with friends. It's not a game that requires a great amount of skill, just the ability to be a detective,  it requires you to be an excellent liar. It's definitely a game worth playing, but it isn't a game that you should take and replace your life with.

The core gameplay loop does get boring relatively quickly, because there is nothing to work towards, nor does it have any real progression mechanics. It simply exists as a fun, round-by-round type game. Nothing more, and nothing less.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title."

22276,"this game is better then the first in many ways because there is betrayal, adventure and of course more puzzles in portal 2. in this game you were able to understand the history and lore of portal and apeture science this is one of my most favourite video games and i hope this encourages you to play it 12/10

Not to mention the the beautiful yet horrid dystopian atmosphere of a a huge scientific installation that's has no humans, the horrifying emptiness in a place that should be filled with scientific staff. Wheatly was a phenomenal antagonist but having a bonding experience with GlaDOS was unprecedented. Once again valve had blown me away. Though sadly we can never get a part 3."

22303,"Mort tries to get into the plane, but King Julien tries to stop him using the security. However, he escapes them and tries to get in the plane. But King Julien closes the door in time. Mort hangs on to a wine and end up on the left wing of the plane. Alex sees him and thinks him to Gremlin. Alex says ""Hi Mort"" and he says ""Hi"", causing him to fall from the plane. 
The 3 friends looking at the falling shark.

In the middle of the film, he crawls and manages to get on to the shore. He says that he is coming ""King Julien."" Out of the blue, a shark begins to chase him and adds humor. The movie progresses and he ultimately meets King Julien and Maurice. But the shark had followed him, as a result, the shark end up inside the volcano. At the end, King Julien, Maurice and Mort are seen, riding a flamingo.
Madly Madagascar
Mort is the first person to use King Julien's Love Potion No. 09. King Julien persuaded him to take it by saying that he is not popular, which he agrees with. After been sprayed, Maurice comes as a lady to show that he is irresistable and King Julien make Maurice even kiss him. At the end, he smiles when all the fur of King Julien gets lost since he had to bath his own new potion.

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted
Mort first appears when they jump out of Alex's cake with king Julien and Maurice to surprise him. When they were at Monte Carlo, Alex says not to draw attention, but King Julien, Maurice and Mort sets outs fireworks and begins to play a song, when they were in a swan boat.

King Julien, Maurice and Mort were sent out to cut the power and he had a clock strapped to his head so an alarm would ring when the time is ready. When King Julien cuts the power, Mort takes control and pulls up and down the power lever, when King Julien and Maurice dance. Later, when Chantel clings with Melman, King Julien sends Mort to fix the problem. He succeeded.

Later, when the plane crashes, he is stuck to a pipe and searches King Julien. In the circus train, they gets into Sonya's apartment, thinking it is first class. When Julien acts weirdly with Sonya, Mort and Maurice are stunned. Since then, Mort has a much closer contact with Maurice and at the end, Mort takes Chantel's pistol and uses it to tranquilize Chantel at the end.

King Julien and Mort just before King Julien was swallowed by Mort.

Penguins of Madagascar
He appears in the mid credit scene. The Penguins use him as the source of cuteness to bring back Private to normal, who now have antlers. King Julien tries to press the button and finally succeeded. After the penguins left, King Julien says to Mort that he expected a ""little more pizzazz"". Then, Mort eats King Julien in one gulp and amazes King Julien since it is 'pizzazz""."

22310,I mean it’s alright overrated as f*ck in my opinion.
22311,Great game

22392,"This game is still great in 2021 and i like it.
"
22393,"Story? Check
Great puzzles? Check
Fun multiplayer? Check

One of Valves staple products, this game lives up to the hype and still holds up great in 2021.
My only issue is that I with they'd make another one already. Portal puzzles force you to use your brain in ways almost no other game does, while also introducing you to an interesting world and story. 10/10"

22405,I liked it
22406,"This game has nice and satisfying puzzle levels, strange cast of characters and ok textures. Pretty outdated actually. Still worth playing if you are into puzzles. You can also make your own test chambers. (puzzle room) The reason for the chamber maker being sort of bad is because of the long rendering time it takes to set up lightning and the level itself. People had like 2 core computers back when the game was released so I bet it took lots of time to just test and modify your own levels. And just like the name is hinting to, Portal 2 is 2 player!"
22407,"Infinite physics puzzles because it has a make your own map mode and community made maps. Also, the campaign is much longer than the first portal."
22408,This game is based
22409,A must play physics-based puzzle game that everyone should know.

22411,this is one of my favortie games

My conclusion to this review:

22493,VERY COOL
22494,"Portal 2 is amazing. The End. Buy the game. That is all. An amazing sequel continuing a very entertaining and not too challenging puzzle game with more story elements, co-op campaign, level editor, community made maps, some fun secrets, and a great campaign with a great story and a few characters with funny dialogue. It's just a nice game to play if you’ve never played through before. 

+Puzzles aren’t that challenging although I would say this game was more challenging than the previous I didn’t have to look up the solutions to any of the test chambers
+Lots of different locations and types of rooms compared to the original
+A lot of interactive items: buttons, cubes, gravity beams, different gels that change your movement, lasers, etc.
+From what I’m sure this is less than $5 on sale
+Grade A dialogue
+More than just a puzzle game
+Lots of cool hidden secrets and easter eggs
+Cheats
+You can select individual test chambers/chapters to play from
+Challenge mode now applies to all test chambers instead of 6 and your score is put upon a leaderboard against your friends list
+Level editor for both solo and co-op levels
+Co-op campaign that you can play with a friend or can do online matchmaking [spoiler] good luck with that [/spoiler] The co-op campaign is super fun and there are a lot of chapters to play through. Additionally you can download custom co-op campaigns and keep playing even after finishing the main game!
+You can taunt and do different gestures in co-op
+Different hats, flags, and skins for co-op
+Community made maps that can easily be downloaded from the Steam Workshop 
+Split-screen
+Remote Play
+The overall level design and environments you go throughout this game is amazing. 
+Quick save during any part of the campaign/challenge maps and quick loading

-I still didn’t get any cake
-The different hats/skins in co-op are rather difficult to obtain. Majority are either no longer obtainable, costs real money and none can be obtained from just playing the game, or you will have to trade with someone else in order to obtain them. Basically you cannot get any of the skins in the game without paying in some sort of way.

Portal 2. Yes. Buy. Now."
22495,bad game wouldnt buy
22496,"This game may be just a modern Portal but, it is really so much more than that. Through its unique level design an superb visual storytelling you feel like you truly impact the story line, the way intended yet creatively and irregular."
22497,This game made me feel emotions towards a game which I never knew i could've felt. Even as I have grown from kid to teen this game still holds up amazingly well compared to other modern day games.
22498,It's Portal... enough said :D
22499,Ive played it twice the end credits are worth the frustration
22500,lose your mind in the gel asylum and fight an idiot with the moon
22501,Funny
22502,wheatley crab
22503,hbuji
22504,"This game is amazing. The main story is so fun, and even after watching a few youtubers play this before I played it myself, the puzzles are still challenging, and so much fun! I love making new chambers using the chamber creator. I love it so much!"
22505,this is a great game
22506,"Great story, great mechanics, great graphics. A great game all around."
22507,It'd be a mistake to not to play it.
22508,this game is so funny ((:
22509,GLaDOS did nothing wrong
22510,"This is a masterpiece, even though this game was made awhile ago the graphics are amazing, the puzzles in the game can get really confusing and fun, remote play with your friends if you like too!"
22511,Just as good as the first.
22512,amazing game! the mysterious aspect of the lore is especially interesting.
22513,Overwhelmingly Portal
22514,BEST GAME!
22515,Das game ist W A V Y
22516,the bitch always insulting my fucking brain
22517,haha portal gun go brrrrrrrrr
22518,"This is literally my favourite game I've ever played. All of it's fantastic, the story, the mechanics, the music, the voice acting, the character writing, the comedy, I love everything about this game and the best part it, is that it's challenging. It's not just story, or mechanics. The puzzles can sometimes take me ages to even wrap my head around, it's brilliant at making your brain think in intuitive and creative ways.

 Long story short, this game will be very hard to top as my favourite game of all time, if at all."
22519,"Steps to make your game the best of the year:
1. Make the player wake up to have a robot tell you that you have brain damage
2. Have that same robot screw everything up at your chance of escape
3. Have a bigger robot insult you throughout most of the game and make the insults funny
4. Make dimensional gun that can cause the player to have mass amounts of confusion at times.
5. Have the best voice lines & animations of that generation
6. Make the game only cost $10
Slap that all to together and you have yourself a great game."
22520,Greatest puzzle game I have ever played.
22521,kinda good lmao
22522,Great
22523,I'm an atheist but this game had me looking to the fucking bible for help
22524,The first game I ever owned on Steam. Still holds up a decade later.
22525,"an amazing sequel to an amazing game! portal 2 is more story rich than the first one as well as some very interesting new mechanics, however the decisions they made in terms of design caused some continuity errors between the two games. regardless, this game looks gorgeous and is addicting, i recommend it to everyone. (after playing the first one of course.)"
22526,fun
22527,yes
22528,bruh moment experience
22529,this is the best  game i have played
22530,Everyone should play this at least once in their life.
22531,fun
22532,"The game isn't beat yet, but I am having a hard time getting past the level, but I will make progress if I can!

Oh well, I don't have anyone to play with on multiplayer, but oh well...nothing to do anyway!"
22533,smell good
22534,"Portal 2 is the greatest sequel to the most iconic puzzle game of all time. Hilarious, fun, brain melting and I'm sure it's great in co-op, too. The only par that sucks is if you have motion sickness, it gets hard to play, so it will be best to take breaks to come back to reality. Over-all, 10/10. It also has a free mod to play, so that's another plus."
22535,I'm a potato
22536,I shat my pants twice...
22537,amazing

22543,Funny lady make me laugh
22544,"i love this game, it can be sad watching wheatley betray you but it gets better i recommend playing👍👍"
22545,10/10 I was thinking in this game and I noticed that I can't find anything negative to say about it.

22548,nice
22549,It's a masterpiece.
22550,"The pinnacle of gaming. It gets almost everything right about the first game and goes above and beyond in the most spectacular and awe-inspiring ways you didn't know were possible. Literally everything about this game is practically pure perfection and should be praised for decades to come. It's actually mental how Valve pulled it off, it's incredible. The perplexing gameplay, the story, the writing and the HUMOR, just everything is just *chef's kiss* magnificent. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I love it dearly with all my heart."

22568,"Literally my favorite game of all time. The story is fun to figure out as you go along and the puzzles are extremely entertaining and confusing at times. Portal and Portal 2 are some of, if not, the best games ever made"

22657,"I'm not gay but, 

I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Kanye. We won’t ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood,shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I’ll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kanye. I won’t be able to climax, and eventually I will go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other’s eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to whatever we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they’ll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love."

22688,fun good i guess yea good
22689,"This is a first-person game in which you create two portals. Going through one leads you out the other. You must then solve environmental puzzles by strategically placing these two portals. Since this could be considered a dull gameplay loop, a psychotic english robot will be present, primarily to antagonize you. Since that could be considered quite daunting, you will also be furnished with a talking potato. She struggles with empathy, but she's quite nice once you get to know her. 

The puzzles are brilliant in this one, so so creative. The graphics and environmental story telling are top-notch. 

I've never been a fan of the music in Portal, it's very synth-wavey and can get quite intrusive. But the sound effects are all very well done.

This is one of the most creative video games i've ever played. Recommended, ten out of ten cakes."
22690,A perfect game to chill out and play through on your own or to play with friends and never talk to them again.
22691,"It's portal 2, who wouldn't wanna play it?"
22692,yeas
22693,"The crown jewel of valvE , want to experience this game again for the first time . from the opening to the end  this game blew me away from its gameplay , the creative direction . i felt the loneliness of source engine. the part where we've have to navigate through the ruin of old  aperture lab is the best part , gladOS great as always but wheatly stole the show. the end is just perfect the turret opera  to the big panther skin and the credit song ."
22694,it has the same weird holes from the first game (idk what they are called) but now i can shoot cum from them. nice improvement.

I have never played a game before in my life with puzzles greater than this. The dialouge is pure comedy, I like how there isnt a lot for characters in the game which makes them feel more real and funny. 

Belive me, you""ll see what I mean when you try it out"
22745,"dooG.
"
22746,"Portal 2 has good humor and great puzzles. I love the scale of everything in the game, and how small it makes you feel. Not to mention the fun and innovative ways you progress through the game. Anyway, its good. You should try it out!"
22747,"Very good implemented game, really enjoy playing this game, recommended."
22748,"There's hundreds of thousands of reviews for this masterpiece of a game. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's solid and another work of art by valve, they might not be able to count past 2, but it's likely the quality would be alot worse for the games past their integer limit, so i'm cool with that :) 

if you haven't played portal 2 you should! it's a classic nowadays (a decade old)"

22758,"Great game, not much to say that's negative. Far more fun when, it felt more open world. (8.5/10)"
22759,you go uh like through um yeah the teleport hole
22760,i maybe accidentally put a british sphere in charge of the science lab. glados potato woman got mad and kicked me out the science lab for life. if only i could still pursue my occupation as a test subject :(((((((((((
22761,splendid game
22762,portal
22763,Fun strategy/puzzle game!
22764,Best Game Ever
22765,i do recommend the game if you think outside the box its easier thinking inside the box is hard for a game where you have to jump from portal to portal only to gain speed to fire you to a part of the stage
22766,Really really really good :)
22767,very cool and epic

22769,so many holes mmmmmmmm
22770,good
22771,"Pros:
- Fun to play with controller or keyboard&mouse.
- Continuity with story events from Portal - I really like the story-script of Portal 2.
- Well thought through Co-Op.
- A lot of community-made puzzles.
- Possibility to build your own riddles/puzzles and even contribute to the Portal community.
- Nice to look at.
- Is it just me or.. Weathly sounds like Stewie from Family Guy. (same voice actor?)
- I somehow started to empathise with GladOS.

Cons:
- there are no cons if you`re into puzzlers 

Anyway, enjoy your day/night, whatever it might be at your place.
So long."

22851,"I liked the original Portal more but I still recommend the sequel. I finished the single player campaign and I was pleasantly surprised that there  are community made test chambers. So far, the ones I have played are quite enjoyable."

22861,"A truly excellent sequel from the series, all of the features are amazing and jaw dropping for it's time, to name a few, superb graphics, marvelous story telling, brilliant CO-OP and so many more. I've been playing Portal 2 since 2015, and I'm still to this day not bored of this masterpiece, even though the features on the console/PS3. (the platform I used to play Portal on) Now that I got a hold of a PC copy of Portal 2 I am amazed on how the community changed this game, mods, custom test chambers, ect. But it gets better, two words, Console Commands, I have tons of fun with this feature, and its hilarious when playing with mates. Overall, perfect game."
22862,"About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses, yeah"

22864,yeah its pretty good first game i got actually
22865,"Extremely fun single player, make sure you have trustworthy friends if you ever want to try co op without losing your mind"
22866,"this game is honestly really great, tests arent as hard as it was in the first game! im kind of dumb so i used a walkthrough to get past like 4 levels

only thing i dislike about this game is SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the aperture science place underground with the orange and blue and white stuff... idk why but it peeved me, it took way to long to solve some parts of it and i was honestly just suffering with potato glados as my only support..

 the game is still amazing though, would play it again but would probably give up at the aperture science place"
22867,fun
22868,"Yes, obviously!"
22869,Very good game
22870,gud gam
22871,"Much like the first game but with more to solve, and more sarcastic comments from glados. It's really cool revisiting old test chambers. The added lore is also amazing! There were a few puzzles that I got stuck on for a bit, so I had to take a break and come back to it. There's also no heartbreak or feelings of betrayal in this game."

22882,portal gun go brrrrr
22883,Fat turret funny
22884,"The reason its called portal 2 is because of the TWO portals you get with the game, Valve DOUBLED the size of the original game and added a story which is cool for people that are causal gamers that have TWO many things to do because they just don't understand how good the SIGMA GAMER GRINDSET (SGG) is. This game shows you the way to enlightment and the ascension to places that are so profound that human languages can't describe the beauty of those places the only thing that comes close is the song third eye by the band tool. The game has the ability to make you into a demi god like hey zeus, Because you will have so much insight of the perceivable universe, The mass growth of knowledge that you will know is just breath taking. Im saying so much about a masterpiece like this that i forget to say that it helped my marriage, My wife hated me because i was a beta male which makes sense because my wife is so so so very very hot the reason she is, is because she is half Filipino and half latino. On a rainy day she told me that she and our TWO kids were going to leave me. My life was going down hill but she told me to stop being a beta cuck and be a man. She lefted me for dead, But by the grace of god this game changed my life around from being a beta to a god. Thank you god for this great game"

22902,"my favourite game after the Witcher 3, and they have something in common: great humor, unique atmosphere, the feeling that the developers were passionate about what they do. 
You can play 5 hours straight, or any times for 10 minutes, anyway it would be enjoyment. Still great choice in 2021, and necessarily play portal 1 as well"
22903,"Like all games from Valve, this one is beautiful too! can not be compared with anything, it's a pity that the Valve do not release the third part of their games"

I don't have words.

First of all yes, the price is worth it 100%.
But i would have been just fine even if it costed more. 
This game is probably my favorite game, and i given me many wonderful memories. The story line is very engaging and the puzzles are incredible. The feel and vibes it gives me (and many others) are warm, and have not been formed by any other games I have played so far. 

""This was a triumph
I'm making a note here:
Huge success.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. ""

P.S.: This review is for Portal 2, but it would be best to play the original first."

10/10 would recommend"
22983,"One of the best games ever made. 

Portal 2 never gets old, every time I pick this game up again it always impresses me with it's fantastic level design, fun mechanics that are still just as cool as they were 10 years ago, visuals that still hold up remarkably well, and the memorable characters and narrative . The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the constant loading screens (especially during chase sequences) can be a bit annoying, and they're definitely a sign of the game's age. But the reason those stick out so much is because the game overall still feels like such a modern experience even 10 years later. 

Most games released today can't even come close to Portal 2, and I think this will stay true for a long long time."
22984,very fun game i am not ashamed to say that some puzzles i had to look up but overall it was really fun to complete the story and occasionally goof around didn't really understand if the ending was a good or bad thing tho so...

23015,I LOVE IT
23016,Its portal 2
23017,yes
23018,"One of my favorite games of all time. I keep going back to play it every few years or so. It is challenging, clever, and a feel-good game. I love it so much."
23019,"LOVE this game!! I would argue it's one of the funniest forms of content, of any kind, ever produced. The problem solving is a ton of fun, the voice acting is top notch, this game is a CLASSIC."
23020,god why is GLaDOS so unbelievably [i]thick[/i]
23021,"This game is still a classic.  Yes, I even have the T-shirt."
23022,i am a potato glados 2012
23023,Very good
23024,you should totally consider playing it with someone after trying out singleplayer
23025,"First i'd like to say that i loved portal 1. the comedy and puzzles were fun, not super challenging, but a few ah-ha moments with a great story line. Now coming into portal 2, i started out loving the humor again and was curious how the story would continue. I loved the first half of the game, but found a section of the second half more of a ""find where to shoot the portal"" game than a puzzle game. That being said, i really enjoyed this game as well. Absolutely beatable in one night but still cheaper than going out to the bar lol."
23026,really good game!!
23027,very nice
23028,The best game by Valve
23029,"Banging game before discovering GLaDOS R34, Favourite Valve game after discovering GLaDOS R34"

23052,"For the price, this is the best value game I have ever played! The tests are awesome (and some are incredibly frustrating), but the challenge is worth it.
The fact Stephen Merchant is doing one of the main voices is just icing on the cake for me - hilarious!

Well worth it, even at triple the price!"

23062,"Portal and Portal 2 are the most innovative puzzle games of their time. Portal 2 is an extension of the brilliant design and potential that the original offered, with new mechanics, graphical improvements, and a new, very charming singleplayer story, with very charming characters.

Portal's gameplay revolves around the properties of two ""portals"" which players can shoot onto specific types of walls. Players can enter through one portal and seamlessly emerge through the other in addition to being able to see directly through them to the other side. Momentum is preserved when traversing through portals, which allows players to gain thrilling levels of velocity while basically playing with space.

Though the player controller's normal walking speed is painfully slow, players can take advantage of various movement techniques to speed themselves up during gameplay. Once you learn how to air-strafe and bunnyhop, the rest becomes increasingly easier to master. Movement techniques enhance the experience.

The game offers a fantastic singleplayer experience with lovable characters and hilariously witty dialogue. Its replay value is immense for someone like me who enjoys experiencing the game world. There's also a two-player cooperative course, full of chambers to complete. On top of all that exists the Perpetual Testing Initiative, or Community Test Chambers. Community members can create and publish their own test chambers for others to enjoy, and there are a lot of geniuses who play this game. You'll virtually never run out of content.

All in all, this is one of my favorite video games of all time. It's incredibly clever in concept and in execution. Though I will close Portal 2 for the last time someday, that day will be very near to the day I die."
23063,you get brain damage and overthrow a being with lots of power twice
23064,"wheatley, wheatley crab."
23065,"Portal 2 is a good game. The puzzles are interesting and satisfying when completed, the story is great, and the community-made levels add an endless amount of quality levels. I recommend Portal 2 for these reasons."
23066,Good Game
23067,It fun
23068,"If the portal is good, then it would work too, so its good and stuff, i don't like women that much, i love men though, please hmu"

23070,its fun lol
23071,portals are fun
23072,yes
23073, pretty fun later levels harder to find where you can portal
23074,Funniest game I ever played
23075,it is a fun and challenging game with so many cool details
23076,its hard but when you get a hang of it its a good game
23077,Revisited the game 10 years later. Aged like a fine wine. A timeless classic.
23078,"Portal 2 is easily one of my favourite games, it has some amazing mechanics (which expanded on the first instalment of the series) which Valve cleverly designed the puzzles around. I found that the game had the perfect balance of difficulty with me having to scratch my head at times but never getting frustrated and shutting the game off.

But how could I write about Portal 2 and not mention the amazing story? I absolutely love it! It continues quite a bit of time after the first game and is extremely captivating. You explore the history of Aperture Science and learn more about the creation of GLaDOS. Talking about GLaDOS, I love her dry humour. This game's sense of comedy really adds to your entertainment.

This game was released in 2011, and still looks STUNNING for its age, I remember I was shocked in the first scene with Chell's room crumbling as Wheatly (quite poorly) manoeuvred it that the Source engine could do something like that! Being a Source game, not only does it look amazing, but can run on pretty much anything - there isn't a reason to not play it!

I would recommend playing the first game first however, while the story isn't [i] as [/i] central and it doesn't look [i] as [/i] good as Portal 2 (not that it looks bad), it is a great intro to the mechanics, gives quite a bit of back story to the game and it still has GLaDOS's amazing humor!

Overall, this game is timeless and I can recommend it to absolutely anyone. Especially for those who want a good puzzle or are used to shooters but want something a bit different (the portal gun is the perfect device for that)."
23079,yuh
23080,"well written sad tragedy vn, spoilers, rip companion cube"
23081,"Good game, especially when it's on sale!"
23082,"uhh, game good"
23083,"Pretty much flawless.
An absolutely gem of a game.
I am incredibly impatient with games and few grip me - this one I played to completion.
Bravo."
23084,"Portal 2 is the best puzzle game I have played. The portal gun is incredibly fun to use and has enough of a skill ceiling that you could play through the game several times while learning new things you can do with portals each time. The puzzles were always engaging and offer a decent amount of challenge on your first play through and on additional plays you can attempt usually difficult portal placements or sequences to bypass some of the puzzles. I have played the co-op campaign with three different people and enjoyed it each time, if the game was made by a different developer anytime in the last 6-8 years the co-op would have likely been a dlc but it is just part of the game, for 10 dollars and frequent 75% off sales it is one of the best purchases you can make on Steam."

23086,spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
23087,gg
23088,"Even after all these years, knowing the solution to all the puzzles, and hearing the same story and jokes again and again. Portal 2 is not really a game to me anymore, but like a trip down memory lane. A walking trail I can describe every step of but I still walk down for nothing more than the experience.

What a precious thing to have."
23089,"for science you monster

get this"
23090,fydf gerfedxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
23091,cult game!! nothing more to say! :-)
23092,Yes
23093,good game
23094,An amazing puzzle game that bends your perception of space with its portals. Has a very engaging at times hilarious storyline. Would totally recommend
23095,sussy among us
23096,"Regrets in my life:

I did not finish high school

I did not ask the first girl out, whom i had a major crush on

I did not buy Portal 2 sooner"
23097,Challenging but not frusterating. the story is nice and the credits are beautiful. you can even design you're own puzzles.
23098,is nice

23106,8.5/10
23107,awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!
23108,The single player story is as humorous and enjoyable as ever. I've bought this game for 3 different people because playing the multiplayer with friends is some of the best fun you will ever have in a game. And once you've done all that there are community made test chambers where there's always something new with loads of tricky problem solving and some simply fantastic levels.
23109,10/10 game
23110,An experience!
23111,my head hurts
23112,haha funny robot thing haha (giv award bc im a comedian) (actually dont)

23115,"This might be my number one favorite game, I love Portal so much and I really enjoyed playing it start to finish. Everything about it has been developed so well and I am just in love with it go play it, there's no need to debate whether or not to get this game, just get it and play it. <3"

23124,gud
23125,good
23126,"Great story, graphics that still hold up well to this day, amazing replay value. Challenging for all skill levels."
23127,This is Portal 2. Friggen play it. It's amazing. If you don't like it... I don't want to know you.
23128,beat it in one day worth the money
23129,OK this is a great game the graphics still hold up today great story and co op is fun and ties in with the story. BUT i have one question how did the potato that GLaDOS was in not get destroyed by the aperture science material emancipation grill?
23130,lovely
23131,FUN

23136,fun
23137,"Played this back on the Xbox 360, bought the steam version when it was on sale a couple years back, and it's just as good as i remember. If you like First person Shooters and Puzzle games, then you'll love Portal 2. One of my all-time favorite games. Very easy to understand controls, interesting story that picks up where the original Portal ended, and great voice acting and dialogue. Must play."
23138,this game is amazing
23139,"Solving the puzzles leaves you feeling rather smug and clever, so it's a great game in that regard. Lots of out of the box thinking, but all can be solved with logic. The multiplayer levels are possibly even more fun, requiring some advanced level communicating skills to get anywhere."
23140,Have not beaten yet but is Amazing and is living up to its predecessor. will update when i beat it!
23141,pog
23142,Very well made
23143,good
23144,This game doesn't even feel if it was 9 years old. This game looks and feels really great actually. Having the option to play with mods after finishing the campaign makes this a long lasting journey
23145,thinking 2
23146,classic
23147,"An outstanding game.

Has all the mechanics from the original portal game while adding on more mechanics throughout the game with a TON more puzzles.

Also expands a lot on the story of the first game with even more memorable characters.

And theres co-op and a level designer, so you can crush your friends with massive boxes while using portals!"
23148,"Great game, very funny and a  real brain twister at some points. 9/10"
23149,"This is the most fun i had messing around in And im still waiting for portal 3 to this day





"
23150,"this game is genuinely amazing, and it deserves it's highest rated spot on steam"
23151,the best puzle game i played
23152,"I did finish the game pretty quick, it is an awesome game"
23153,"id play it to see glados as a potato anyday
"
23154,"Man this game, its got it all, fuckin portals, killer robots, not so killer robots, POTATOES and space. 
-1 tho for the weird cube-bot freaks wheatly puts together."
23155,Classic. Buy it and enjoy it.
23156,yes
23157,"its pretty poger
"
23158,"Portal 2 is a fantastic puzzle game, both in its single and multi-player form (the latter I mostly played on playstation with a friend on shared screen). The story is interesting and the game mechanics emerge in the perfect pace. Once you start getting comfortable and familiar with one, a new puzzle element or combination is introduced, to keep that brain going.
My only real grief is that I never really got the cake I was promised. Still, a good experience."
23159,this game was very hard but the mechanics were super good if i got stuck i just went to the menu and pressed ` and typed noclip or god
23160,incredible
23161,i like potatoe. button goes *tikluk tikluk*. i likes.

23168,One of the best co-op games I ever played. *Just get ready to argue with your partner and get mad at them.* Graphics are really outstanding for an old game.

23197,yeah
23198,"I kinda like it, but its kidna boring after you get used to it"
23199,This is one of the very few games that i got my hats off to. Its impressive how good this game is. I guess valve never fails to treat us with good games.
23200,Its so good If your looking for something to play i recommend this
23201,best pc game in my opinion
23202,
23203,GLaDOS my beloved
23204,"yes, buy!"
23205,"If you legitimately haven't played Portal and Portal 2, please do.  They're fantastic classics and they both hold up today."
23206,InSaNe follow-up to the 1st game!
23207,"Fun puzzle solving game. The characters are humorous, the game play is fun. It is very well done."
23208,"Beautiful game, only complaint is that there isnt a continuation"
23209,"If you liked Portal, play this game. If you haven't played Portal, play both. Portal 2 has better controls, concepts, and story. The lore behind aperture science is very intriguing, elevated by excellent performances by JK Simmons and Ellen McLain. Because of Cave Johnson and GLAdos, the story isn't just intriguing and a bit dark, but laugh out loud hilarious. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoyed the first Portal game or puzzle games in general."
23210,It might be the best sequel game ever made.
23211,This game was very fun to play. It has a excellent story and great characters. The graphics are fantastic. 10/10
23212,
23213,"Great story line, very funny, dramatic, such a delight to play!"
23214,i enjoy
23215,
23216,"the cake is a lie


wait wrong game"
23217,Nice Achievements
23218,still didnt get any cake what a fucking LIE!
23219,Portal 2 expands on almost everything from Portal 1 and also introduces some new ideas. Wheatley and GLaDOS are fun characters and the Turrets are adorable.
23220,"has portals.
approved."
23221,SO GOOD
23222,]
23223,classic
23224,"From the first encounter with Wheatley to the final battle, portal 2 kept me engaged and invested all throughout. This remarkable clacic still holds up a decade later."
23225,worth my money. fard
23226,"I almost got a job down here in the reviews but, guess who the foreman went with. LITERALLY EVERY OTHER PERSON. Ended up giving me the worst job, tending to the playing of games."
23227,very good game i like it i lot you should play portal 1 and 2 story mode then play co op mode <3
23228,Best game!!!!!!
23229,uhhhh good game
23230,"Good game, perhaps a bit too short."
23231,"Even amongst those who don't think it is the greatest puzzle game ever made, Portal 2 usually ranks second place and always breaks the top five.  This is for good reason."
23232,"If you like having your friends go bananas while they watch you play this then this is the game for you. The physics in this game are amazing. Plus the puzzles that a person with object permanence could easily solves racked my brain, but that just made the end results a lot better. Sure both my brain and my friends' brains felt like they were gonna implode, but I was determined to keep on going. All in all a 10/10 experience."
23233,gtood game
23234,"like skyrim, with guns
"
23235,
23236,"must have game, the workshop feature makes this game infinitely more worth the money. However you really should play the first game before this one. Its a longer game so its worth the money it charges up front and the mods, and community maps made for it give it so much more replay value."
23237,One of the best games ever.
23238,"it's portal 2



10/10"
23239,good game
23240,Epik
23241,"SO AMAZING!!!! First off. The story is great, Gameplay is different but fun. And i just, had fun.  I do suggest playing the first game so you understand more. But with it's co-op mode. It's just amazing
"
23242,"In my opinion, Portal 2 falls short of the first Portal by a combination of the following factors:
[list]
[*] Lots more game mechanics to wrangle
[*] Long periods of walking
[*] Very visually dark, with no option to adjust brightness
[*] The environments are generally a lot more visually cluttered, making for better graphics, but also making it harder to engage with the puzzles
[*] Many puzzles that make you answer ""what am I supposed to do"", instead of ""how am I supposed to do it""
[/list]

I can understand how this game would appeal to people more than the first, but for me personally, I prefer the cleaner, brighter aesthetic of Portal. I also prefer the puzzles in the first Portal, which rely more on portals and less on the other varied mechanics introduced in Portal 2."
23243,god game
23244,Amazing game and no blood stains
23245,potato defeated robot
23246,"very funny, puzzles were difficult at the end, overall had a great time"
23247,"yes

"
23248,Its hard man but its good
23249,"Really great characters, storytelling, and soundtrack. A lot of content outside the single player story, but the story alone is worth. Awesome game."
23250,"the single player campaign is a big step up in both graphics, story and voice acting. I do however prefer the portal 1 single player. Portal 2 coop is where it really shines. Buy it and tell a friend to do the same, its a lot of fun."
23251,Just play it already
23252,ironic game

1.there's a build mode   I1.why can i just use all of the thing's in the game like a weatly or gladose or weatly or  2.the story line is        I gladose voises or a world so i can make a story line.
   really good               I2.why isnt there a skip cutscene button."
23259,bro i filled not even close to an entire room with cubes and there is a command to summon an error

23262,Stop reading negative reviews and just play the game.
23263,yes
23264,"Nice
"
23265,"Like its predecessor, this is not a game, it's a masterpiece of art. 1000000/10"
23266,it was a good game :D
23267,"For anyone who wants a good puzzle game combined with a first person view, I couldn't think of a better game. In my opinion, it's even better than the first game and adds a great story full of interesting lore to keep you sucked in. I personally find it satisfying to complete a difficult puzzle after a lot of confused portal making, but the point is to look at your surrounding and take in what you need to do that way. During all of the game play there is a lot of funny dialogue as well and even tragic dialogue at points as well keeping your attention. It's an engrossing story, but if that's not your thing, there are also tens of thousands of community-made puzzles and more coming out all the time so there are infinite puzzle for you to try and enjoy."
23268,Really fun game! even tho it came out in 2011 still an amazing game to play!
23269,yes
23270,"I had a great time with this game, enjoyed the story, enjoyed the gameplay, etc. I still have to play Portal 1 so I guess I still have something else portal related to play."
23271,"imagine a british man evicts you from your apartment so that you can escape london, you first have to find the key to the gate so you find it but queen elizabeth the II spots you and forces you to join the NHS, until you otherthrow the monarchy and the british man takes control. That's basically the plot of this game"

23282,"Play the first game. Play this game.

Excellent writing, fun puzzles that are accessible without really being easy. It's funny, it's weird, it's great.

The co-op is also one of my favorite ways to play games with others. How can you go wrong with Portal?

An essential, must-play game for everyone. Please play it if you haven't."

23343,"very fun to play with friends 
"
23344,"My favourite game of all time. After over 10 years, the game still looks amazing, feels amazing and the story still doesn't fail to engage me. The graphics and physics engine were so ahead of its time that I would still be amazed if the game came out this year. The level design allows for a lot of interesting and intriguing environmental storytelling which makes the 8-10 hour campaign feel a lot longer. For me my favourite part is the genius writing that blends deep character building and dark humour being performed by an incredibly talented cast truly brings the small number of unique characters to life which makes every line memorable and the entire experience unforgettable"

23434,"Cool puzzles, cool mechanics, cool story, what else should i say about this game?"
23435,   This is one of the few games that I have played that I would consider a greatest of all time games. Valve has such a great team there it's usually very hard to mess up a game. This is no exception. The story is absolutely thrilling and is supplemented by the great puzzled place to move the story forward. Many easter eggs and little details that creates an unforgettable experience. It also adds lore to the full portal/half-life universe. Perfectly challenging and engaging. Fantastic game.

23449,"This review is from an idiot who spent 13 hours in the span of 2 or more years trying to finish it. At first i was really bored and would play only if i didnt have anything to do, as the puzzles were too simple, but as the game progressed on i began to see that i would struggle at nearly every level, and even tho i would get stuck at every level for a trillion years i would still be able to solve it without the help of youtube(except for one time). The story was quite unique, from my point of view and the ending was the best.

In conclusion i really recommend this game for anyone who was like 10 hours on their hands and wants some fun and exciting puzzles

23471,"Valve knows how to make sequels (when they actualy decide to make them). It's bigger than first part, it has better story, it has Cave Johnson. It still has good puzzles to solve with your portal gun. If there's one thing I hate about this game it must be the absurd time skip. Like, it doesn't make any sense. However you can kind of alter it yourself because other than that one claim there's no evidence of that in the environment. This part has excellent modding support with active workshop community plus it's often used as a base for excellent fan sequels so it's a must have."
23472,"GLaDOS keeps insulting me every time I play with friends but the jokes on her, she's the one forced to watch me be stupid for hours on end."

23486,"This game is a masterpiece, from the second you start the game to the second the song ends this game is a ride. This takes all the great things from Portal 1 and adds loads of great things. Wheatley is a great villain, the best in any game I've played. The plot twist with Caroline was great along with finally exiting Aperture Science. ""We do what we must, because we can"" - 10/10 Would play again"
23487,"yeah
"
23488,"A classic first-person puzzle game, that is enjoyable for anyone, yet challenging enough for even the most hardcore gamer. The effects introduced this time around have added another level of complexity to the test chambers, making them even more difficult. However, the mechanics of light surfaces, excursion funnels, and the mobility gels also provides players with options for exploring even the hardest testing chambers. The cooperative game is one of the best I've played, requiring team building and strategic problem solving, as well as absolute trust in your teammate. These cooperative challenges can be difficult for even the best of teams, but they are also a lot of fun. Overall, if you have not tried this awesome game or its predecessor, you are simply missing out."

23536,"This game is better than the first one due to Wheatly I also like the ""big brain"" puzzles and if you get stuck then you can look it up."
23537,"[h1] I like Steam more than Valve, but this is the best Valve game without a doubt. [/h1]

It had always been in the 'Play Next' tab of my Steam Library ever since I played Portal 1 in 2019, but I'd always ignored it cause I didn't really feel like committing to a long puzzle game.

I have to keep telling myself that this is a [u]linear game[/u] because I've always been made disappointed when I try to explore or try something else even a bit. Every level in Portal 2 is a confined space with one task to achieve. 'Secret Areas' aren't really secret areas cause it's probably important to solving the puzzle. But the main thing is that if there's a straight path ahead, then that meant's you're not gonna achieve much by going to the left or right, which may irritate some people who are used to games with side objectives crammed in every nook and corner. But to be fair, Portal 1's radios were too excessive, and a linear design was probably the best way to go about in a 3-dimensional puzzle game such as this.

GLaDOS was the best character Valve had made during its prime. No one from Half-Life or their multiplayer games comes close to how amazing it felt when the autotuned robotic voice talked to me. Just like Gordon Freeman, Chell is also a silent protagonist, but she doesn't look like Heisenberg from Breaking Bad, so only her Orange jumpsuit can save her from losing to the free man himself.

[spoiler] There was some questionable level design at the end of chapter 4 where you're stuck in a room with 3 turrets and you had to find a small gap in the wall to shoot a portal to a wall far away, but aside from that, the level designs for the [i]'Modern Aperture'[/i] stages were great.[/spoiler]

As for the older [i]'Aperture Innovators'[/i] maps, I didn't like them as much. The modern labs were just like Portal 1 but detailed with decay, ruin, and organic growth due to being kept unmaintained for several years, which looked really atmospheric. Whereas the underground labs remind me of the plastic-feeling Source games of time's past. Other than the visuals, I was also not too happy with the new elements added for gameplay: The [b]bouncy[/b] and [i]speedy[/i] gels made me slightly motion-sick whenever I interacted with them (a very common quirk with Source™ games), and when the cube is lathered with the gel, it got really hard to track them with my eyes whooshing around the entire room cause it kept bouncing off of the walls onto another. But the most pointless gameplay element of them all were the White and Clear gels (water I suppose). They could've just stopped with the Blue and Orange gels cause most of the time I just spammed the White gel on every surface I could find and then solve the puzzle with my brain afterward. Solving a puzzle with pre-determined portal-spaces was more fun than trial-and-error spilling the white gel everywhere. At least the Clear gel let me stop the bouncy cube from bouncing all over the place, so here's my final gel ranking: [b]Orange > Blue > Clear > White[/b]

After I finished the campaign, I was blown away cause I didn't have any other major hiccups during the game that warranted using a guide. The very next day, I tried the co-op with an online friend, did a couple of levels, and then didn't touch the game for another 3 months. I couldn't find anyone convenient to play with, so I played a few levels here and there until I got my old friend back, where we together tried to 100% all the co-op achievements. One [b]major[/b] issue in co-op was that you can't disable the in-game mic... This game gets random bug fix updates even in 2021, but they still couldn't fix an oversight that allowed you to use Discord or Steam VC without the audio echoing every time.

At least there weren't any game-long 'Collectibles' achievements like in other valve games. Most of them were restricted to a chapter at most.

[u]Final verdict:[/u] This was the best game created by Valve by a longshot. wouldn't play again though."
23538,"Best game in last 10 years, probe me wrong."

23540,"Portal 2 is fun and worth the price. I would get it on sale if possible. The puzzles are fun and the story is easy to understand. Also, the humor and characters are great."
23541,"It was fun and games until you realised you have no friends to play it in co-op mode.
Great game, would play it again once i have friends."
23542,Awesome game

23571,"Very fun game, great story, great mechanics, great levels, overall just amazing. $10 is a steal, so if you haven't gotten it yet, it's 100% worth it. However, I recommend spending the extra $5 to get the bundle for both games since this game's story makes much more sense if you've completed the first game."

23580,*very funny fart sound*
23581,"From what I have experienced so far, this game is really fun and is already becoming pretty difficult even though I started not long ago. The brain power required to beat some of the levels really makes this game unique and the story line is interesting too. The price for this game is quite cheap for what you get to experience so I really recommend this game!"
23582,"Fun to play co-op, there is plenty of stuff to do."
23583,"incredible story, and all around good fun"
23584,"Of all the puzzle games i've played this one is by far one of the most immersive, beautiful and story heavy puzzle game i've played."

23683,"portal 2 was really really good, but it feels like half life to me, it became alot more story focused and less atmospheric, portal 2 actually had really hard levels in it compared to 1 and they were really fun too chapter 7 was hell, still very solid game 9/10 i think this is the last story valve game so them ranked

23715,"If you enjoyed the original portal then this is the direct sequel, it carries on the story 50,000 years in the future or so. This game also has a built in level designer and workshop meaning the game never gets old. The modders have generated some really creative and  tough designs to make this game truly special and timeless."

- excellent story
- very cool mechanics

yeah, its just very simple: one of the best games i know"
23725,Nice game!
23726,"Just like the first chapter, Portal 2 is not just a game, but a world into which the player or players, can drop and work together to get through the various levels. The environment soundtrack help to increase the player engagement to resolve the various puzzle he will have to fight, chamber after chamber.

One of my favourite games so far. It is one of the best games I had ever played. Even today, after 10 years the original release, remain modern, fun and tricky. It is a masterpiece."
23727,portal 2 is great I like the gamplay
23728,portal goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
23729,Good Game. I hated my Friend for a while. Would Recommend it.
23730,doom is eternal
23731,"Earlier in the year I put together my first gaming rig, after a lifetime of console gaming. Went ALL OUT on the components, and after trying out the latest and greatest, i randomly decided to give 360/PS3 era games a run. An unexpected gaming detour but one that I am absolutely loving. Playing these classics at the level they were originally designed for has been like playing them afresh. I shudder at the thought of those old machines struggling to hit 25 FPS. 

It's been 10 years since i've played Portal 2, and - other than the loading screens after ever test chamber - it hasn't aged a day. Nostalgia works in funny ways, and playing it at 4K, 120 FPS feels like how i remember it from back in 2011 on my 360. 

Peerless writing, outstanding puzzles, and a vibe so fresh it's bordering on timeless. 

If you've not played it after all this time, get it done. Pennies for one of the most original and enjoyable games ever made.

Next up, Bioshock Infinite."
23732,"Most of the great games have sequels and this is proof that the second parts can be equal to or even better than their predecessors, a sequel that, in order not to give revelations, I will say that at first it seems that it will be more of the same but as it develops the history and the game in general you realize that it brings many surprises without a doubt the story that gives continuity to the first game is quite entertaining with dramatic turns of events that I invite you to discover and a cooperative mode that works as a way to expand the experience together with a friend.
Simply a game and a fantastic saga."
23733,its fun
23734,Masterpiece
23735,"awesome fucking game, total classic, totally recommend (second favorite game of all time)"
23736,"Portal 2 is a mastapeece, 11/10

23747,I preordered this game when it was first coming out and bought it as soon as it dropped. I used to take my crappy laptop everywhere just to specifically play this game. It has honestly been and will always probably be one of my favorite games of all time. The humor is dark yet still rather funny. The series can have times where the humor is dark for the sake of being dark as it fits the creepy science aesthetic but otherwise it is pretty great! 8/8 would r8!
23748,"it makes you open minded to all possiblities as well as experimenting, so its pretty good"
23749,Everyone with access to a computer needs to play this through at least once in their lives.

23755,"Now I'm pretty young and haven't really played as many games as other people, but Portal 1 & 2 are probably gonna be some of my favorite games of all time. From everything to the puzzles, the story, and just everything about the game is just so good 9.7/10"

The dialog, humor and heaps of design details makes this game truly epic.  They don't make them like this any more.  (really, please make more.) 10/10"

23810,This game is incredible and the graphics are way better than the year it was made says it should be. The puzzles are challenging and it takes me a bit to solve them every time. also i would like to add GlaDOS is my spirit animal. :)
23811,This is an amazing game! i really liked the story and the co-op levels. the only thing i kinda wish was in the game is an option for 4 player co-op instead of just 2 player all the time. but overall its a really great game and you should try it out!
23812,funy gam
23813,"great physics, hilarious story, wonderful graphics even after nine years. I love this game."
23814,FUN
23815,Amazing continuation of the Portal story. Solid on both solo and 2-player content.
23816,"Portal 2, if you haven't gotten it, buy it. One of the most funny (assuming you like dark humor, if not still play this game.) puzzle games. Portal 2 is made by Valve Software so that means that it's good, Portal 2 also has bri'ish robot, so automatically 11/10.  The puzzles can be frustrating, and also can seem too easy, but I think that all games have shit parts and great parts. (""On A Rail"" in Half-Life) So you should get this, but *P*L*A*Y* *P*O*R*T*A*L* *1*!* Play portal 1 first for some context and to understand different things, unfortunately Gabe Newell cannot count to 3, so there is no Portal 3. :("

23875,"Atmosphere. Black holes. Astronauts. Nebulas. Jupiter. The Big Dipper. THE BIG DIPPER
https://youtu.be/BVn1oQL9sWg?t=55"
23876,Pretty great looking game and story.
23877,Simple but fun gameplay. If you liked the first one you'll like this one.
23878,"The Portal franchise started when Valve picked up a student game design team's final project and made it into a bonus feature of sorts for the orange box. Portal 1 eventually became one of the most beloved games of all time, and for it's sequel, that team was given a way higher budget and [b]BOY CAN YOU TELL.[/b] Portal 2  is truly, unironically the only game I can call perfect. I have played through it's campaign more times than I can count, and thoroughly enjoying the experience each individual time. The co-op mode is also incredibly fun (if not a bit of a friendship destroyer lol), the community made test chambers bring thousands of hours worth of new content to it, and [b] that [i]SOUNDTRACK[/i][/b]. Truly a must-play. If someone made me validate videogames as an art form, I'd just show them this absolute masterpiece."
23879,"If there is a perfect game out there, it's this one."
23880,scooby doo
23881,masterpiece
23882,Excellent game! Can play this for hours non stop FPS.
23883,"this game is awesome
to Valve:
count to three
i bet you cant do it"
23884,"I do recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy this game, great soundtrack, fun and moderately difficult co-op, singleplayer has a good and fun  story line, lots of detail into the plots in little hints or easter eggs  this game is easy to run on almost any device, the game regularly goes on discount. An easy to use level editor that can give thousands of more community levels to try via steam workshop. Pretty good game"
23885,"Not even gonna joke around, this is my favourite game of all time. Great writing, great puzzles, great acting, music, community levels, etc. Totally worth it for the price IMO. Even multiplayer is amazing if you can find a freind to do it with."
23886,it's okay
23887,fun interesting story
23888,Portal go Brrrrrrrrrrrr
23889,Gaming with portals a second time

23894,"If you love puzzles that make you feel like a genius, charterers that make you laugh out loud, and a story that is compelling the whole time, play Portal 2. If you haven't played the first, you don't need to play the first to enjoy the second, but I would still recommend playing both just because both are amazing games."
23895,Best Game EVER! You'll never regret to buy it.
23896,get this game on sale for $1 its SO good

23930,"I love portal 2, I don't play videogames all that much but that's what makes portal 2 beautiful. You don't need to be good at shooters and game experience doesn't help you. It's just a fun time that you can always hop in to, or come back to. I've played it 3 and I'm working on the 4th time right now haha."

23948,my friends think I'm crazy because I find a robot hot
23949,Undoubtedly one of the best games I ever bought.
23950,10/10 Do it for science. You monster.
23951,Im not done yet but there is this really funny spherical robot :) he is my new best friend
23952,"[i]Portal 2[/i] is the same as [i]Portal[/i], but worse.
The gameplay is the exact same, with a few new gimmicks. This is fine, as the first game was perfectly acceptable.

It is impossible to change fov. This is unacceptable in any first person game, especially disappointing considering you could in the first game.
At least one of the puzzles has a softlock, forcing you to reload. It's not hard to do, either. 
Additionally quite a few of the puzzles are obtuse, with solutions so ridiculous it's surprising anyone could beat them without a guide.

The ending is amazing however, unlike the first game."
23953,"Amazing game and I like the story. The test chambers were hard and can be very challenging but overall their really fun to solve. This is a game that I highly recommend you play.

23954,10/10 Classic.

23963,awesome
23964,It's one of the best games I've played the only problem is Valve doesn't know how to count to 3

23972,Good game but Portal 3 is better
23973,"I will probably never enjoy any puzzle game as much as i enjoyed this. All the characters are really funny and the game is surprisingly fun on replay as well. If you got 8.19 euros to spare, buy Portal 2, its a masterpiece. 9,5/10

i cant give it a full 10/10 since i havent finished the co-op yet but i can bet thats great to,"
23974,IT IS FUN

23982,Wheatley is the best thing to ever happen in a game.
23983,"Probably one of the best game since early valve. They just cannot be replaced. Anytime I play a game with portals, I will think its a rip off of this"
23984,It's a perfect game
23985,kool geam
23986,"its so cool how they brought back the portal gun from portal, did not expect that in this game."
23987,"i am 100% convinced if you don't own this game, you aren't human"
23988,Portal 1 and 2 are the best puzzle games in existence
23989,swag game :)
23990,ye
23991,"who tf doesn't know about this game. genuinely if you've never played this and even if you've watched a play through of it, nothing will ever be like playing it for yourself."
23992,I like portals.
23993,"Good story, interesting gameplay and some good jokes thrown in. They spent some money on the voice actors, too."
23994,ye

23998,game is good
23999,10/10 game
24000,great
24001,"So like...the first game was interesting. The portal mechanic was clever and the villain was fairly interesting, so it was good. Portal 2? Those same mechanics, a familiar world turned to rot and decay, with a story that is both smart and sad while being really funny. It's so hard to find any flaw in this. It's an amazing game, not much more to say."
24002,Game make u big brain
24003,Wheatly crabe
24004,I would suggest playing this game indeed okay bye

~FINAL REVIEW~
A puzzling masterpiece. The difficultly is just right. The story immersion is just right. A worthy sequel to Portal, an already great game."
24061,8
24062,yea it good
24063,Good
24064,e
24065,It's fun to go through and has some challenge to it. As a puzzle game it's fun. As an fps it's unique.
24066,Portal 2 adds to the highlights and overall gameplay experience of Portal. The story is very well written and the co-op is a nice game mode to play with a friend after your finish the campaign.
24067,giid
24068,Classic puzzles and community created levels.
24069,"For science, you monster.


Genuinely one of my favorite games of all time, and best Portal game in my opinion. This game never fails to make me smile, with GLaDOS' sarcasm, and wheatley's stupidity. it's honestly the funniest valve game to date, and one of my all time favorites!"
24070,An essential game to have in your library.
24071,one of the best games ever. map creator is pretty fun too.
24072,me and my friend played co-op then in about 2 seconds we realized we are too dumb to play games that 1. run on source 2. require some sort of brain usage 3. is probably a video game
24073,"good game
"
24074,"This could be a lazy expansion to the first game, instead they took what little story there was in the first and fleshed it out into a compelling mystery along with more mechanics that allowed to create so much more complexity in the puzzles.
Very much recommended to fans of the first as well as newcomers"
24075,I like portals.
24076,"I'd be shocked if you haven't heard of this game before. It's well loved for a reason. Playing it in 2021, and it holds up. I'm just embarrassed that I set it down for so many years (because of life, not the game) when I was so close to the end. A lot of the puzzles can be fairly challenging, but the solution is there if you just think through everything you know about the mechanics. Co-op is a blast. The story is fun and the end was both lunacy and satisfying."

24078,"fun game, i do miss wheatly though"
24079,Get it while it's on sale.
24080,Now I can wait until my death to play Portal 3
24081,"this game involves puzzle solveing and story adventure to escape the factlty. its 10+ and best game ever. play portal 1 to find out more
"
24082,"WHERE IS ATLAS, CANT FIND ATLAS."
24083,"Just get it. what an amazing game, I cannot believe I just played it only now. I am at a loss for words on how good this game is both gameplay wise and storywise, I am very satisfied with the edning and am yet to play the co-op mode. Just go play it, it'll be good ;) (oh and make sure you played portal 1 ofc)"
24084,one of the best games i have ever played

24100,best game
24101,It's that fun! Sometimes I even get confused in many places
24102,"I genuinely cannot express how much I love this game. Portal 2 is my all time favorite video game, hands down. The story, the puzzles, gah- I love every bit of it. I've played through it 3 times and it doesn't get any less enjoyable no matter how much I play it. 
I don't want to spoil anything, and I want to keep it brief, so I'll just say... play it. It's a masterpiece of storytelling, very funny, and I cry a little at the ending every time."
24103,cool game
24104,Really Fun!!!
24105,Brilliant
24106,"I must have been a real idiot playing this game as a kid because I remember getting stuck somewhere around the beginning. I played the xbox release and hadn't touched it since, and its been about 10 years. Coming back to it now has let me appreciate the game way more than I ever could as an 11 year old. I'm sure this has been said before, but it feels like a timeless classic and I'll be sure to make up for the lost time by playing over and over again. Shoutout to my best friend who bought it for me so we could be dumbasses in co-op"
24107,This is just an amazing game reminds me of the days when valve did something but now its nothing.

24118,Best
24119,rfs
24120,"It's a great game with a cheap price. I always feel that my brain is burning when I'm playing. Here's some advice which has affected my gaming experience and I hope you can fix them in the next few versions:
1.The waiting times between two scenes are a little long.
2.The voice-overs are pure English and they are hard for the foreigners(like me) to understand them clearly. Maybe you can make the voice-overs in different languages or add some subtitles.
3.In the 2 players mode, I hope you can add a switch or something that can turn off the partner's voice. Because my partner always screams at me......ha, just kidding, because the voice quality of the partner is a bit low in the game, and its sometimes intermittent, so we will communicate by the ""voice chat"" in Wechat. So I want to turn off my partner's voice in the game while I can hear the sounds in the game, so that a switch is necessary.
4.It will be very useful to the players that don't have enough IQ to solve all the difficult problems like me if you could make some hints and give them to us when we stuck in some places.
So that's all of my suggestions and I hope you can understand them because my English isn't very well and I didn't use any translators......And of course, I also hope you can accept them!"
24121,there are indeed portals in this game :)
24122,It is a hoot.
24123,"Very cool. One of the best games ever, the story is good and every level is good and packed with story. The CO-OP is also very good. Hopefully, Valve starts making F-stop. Please buy this if you can"
24124,could use less wheatley tbh
24125,Amazing! Even after all this time.

The charm the characters have is funny, and even sad. This game almost had me in tears at the end. I love this game and its easily the best game ive played period. This series has had such a large impact on the game industry as a whole. The voices are amazingly done, and i think this is the gold standard for video games. 10/10 i recommend this game"

Now you may be asking why I would write a review on a game that is over 10 years old and popular enough that most everyone will buy it without reading a review. The answer is simple: I like the game. The story is amazing and the puzzles are perfect. Even the multiplayer was almost as great as the single player, which is hard to come by nowadays. There really isn't much more to ask from a game like this (besides more levels or story). Overall, portal 2 is very unique and one of the greatest games I've played. Definitely worth the money, especially if it is on sale."

10/10"
24286,"It's Portal 2, why haven't you played it?!? Everyone loves this game
"
24287,wanna feel smart then dumb then smart again? well then this is the game for you.
24288,"Fun game with friends and great story!
"
24289,"Yes, I know this says 8 hours but trust me if you combined my 360 and PS3 times it would be much much higher. Its a hell of a game and I couldn't recommend it more- but you already knew that."
24290,e
24291,very fun and well made story even tho it hurts your brain sometimes
24292,"Great game. High quality graphics, great music.

Single Player mode has an interesting story, starting at the decayed Aperture Science enrichment center, from which you're trying to escape.

Cooperation Mode has entirely different levels, designed for two players. Beat test chambers with a friend as one of the Atlas or P-Body robots.

OS Support:
Linux - Fully supported, well-made port. Beware that the port doesn't have all of the spoken languages from the windows version.
Mac OS - Feedback from my friend - does not work on newer versions of Mac OS because Apple dropped 32-bit app support"
24293,don't play the co-op friendships will be lost
24294,goot gme
24295,"What can I say that hasn't been said. A amazing sequel,amazing voice acting, solid game play,and fabulous Co-op. The cake was not a lie because this is it. 10's across the board lemons and all."
24296,really good game... obviously
24297,This game still holds uo to this day despite being released in 2011. One of my favorite games of all time. Definitely recommend 10/10
24298,"i mean its okay i guess
"
24299,"10/10
Best Portal game ever !!!"
24300,best game i ever played
24301,"An amazing game, the story, the characters, the environment, and the mechanics overall are all amazing, and yes I might be late in like almost 10 years but it is still an amazing game and if you didn't play it you should, worth every cent, I also recommend playing Portal 1 before this one, it is not as good but it is definitely something."
24302,"Co-op missions are quite fun. 
If you still didnot try, you are missing a lot
"
24303,May not know how to think but portals are fun
24304,Amazing!!

24306,"one of the best puzzle games on steam, still has an active community, and has a great story line. highly suggest you play this."
24307,"You shoot the portal, you jump through the portal, you get mocked by 2 AIs. What more could you want?"
24308,You aren’t going to find a better puzzle game! Story and characters are absolutely amazing!
24309,worth the money
24310,"probably one of the best games of all time. not much else to it, really. i've replayed single chapters of it dozens of times and probably replayed the entire game at least 5 times across xbox and computer. the multiplayer is really fun and i've probably played the official maps with multiple friends just as much as i've replayed the campaign. also the multiplayers support of user generated maps is probably one of the most fun things i've ever seen/experienced with a friend in any video game."
24311,Loved the story. Loved the mechanics. Loved the sarcasm.
24312,that game make my brain think that math is easy compared to that but it is a really good game
24313,"i've only played it once but it's kinda cool
definitely something to pass time with friends"
24314,Portal 3 pls
24315,Really fun and interesting puzzles. Atmosphere is great too. Playing community levels with friends is always fun.
24316,great game love it

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
+First-person game
+Neat continuation of portals and portal guns (is it an FPS?)
+One of the best stories i played
+End song is great
+They added Co-op so make your friends buy the game and play together!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
-Like in CS:GO or TF2 there are microtransactions to buy clothing, some of them are too expensive

Yes

24366,"Portal 2 is a fantastic game! It takes all the concepts introduced in the first game, then multiplies it by 100. There are so many awesome ideas shoved into this game, from the fun gels to gravity manipulation, they all flesh each other out and add onto one another. They even were able to create some absolutely fantastic lore, to a game that really didn't need it. A solid 10/10, and a must play for everyone!"
24367,gooooooooooooooooooooood

24376,"Incredible gameplay for both new and older players. Fun for those who are new to the game and those who have beaten it several times over. Graphics hold up incredibly well for a game made in 2011, as do the gameplay mechanics. Few major glitches or bugs to be mentioned. Very well made coop mode with thought-provoking puzzles that can either enhance or destroy your friendship in a fun way. Great game to play with friends or family, highly recommend."
24377,"Incredible CoOp game, really can't believe I never paid for it in the past.  Was only a 5 hour coop play through, but the humor, puzzles, story, narration of the game is fully worth the 10 dollars."

This was the game I made this account to play, and I have fun every time I play it. Would recommend this to get people to start playing games with story and humor and puzzles.

24426,"Valve, count to three already!"
24427,"Such a great experience. Rich Storytelling. Valve has this way of helping you learn the game without taking away from the actual experience. Not much in terms of replayability, but if you have not played through yourself I highly recommend purchasing this game and getting through it. Coop is very fun and is just the right amount of difficult, though this might vary for you if you haven't had a lot of experience. Well done Valve. Please give us Portal 3."
24428,"masterpiece. just as good, if not better than the first game"
24429,really damn great
24430,this is perfect
24431,"I wrote this review, a long time ago. Almost one year. And I can still confidently say this is the best gaming experience you will have. For just $10, you can have some of the best comedic timing, writing, storytelling and some of the deepest lore told through environment and game-play.
This is Valve's most recent (excluding Alyx) ""real game"", and it shows that they mastered the formula of story-based game-play and beautiful environments. If you want some of the best gaming imaginable, please pick up this game. If you enjoy it, check out Valve's catalog of games. They are fantastic and will leave you hooked.
Obviously if you're reading this review, you're interested. In the words of Cave Johnson, ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."""
24432,very fun and love the action!

24534,"One of the best games of all time. Period. The portal mechanic is incredibly addictive, the puzzles are well designed, and the story and characters are great. My main critique is that I wish the puzzles were a bit harder, but then again the portal mechanic is unintuitive for new players so the difficulty might be just right. If you are looking for more difficulty, there are always mods and custom maps.

I have but one question:
Where's Portal 3, Valve?
I'll be waiting."

24546,[h1]Do i Need to tell you buying it ?[/h1]
24547,"This... is a masterpiece. A significant improvement over Portal in both the storytelling and gameplay department. The puzzles were all fun and challenging- never did they require RNG or impossible-to-notice elements in order to solve puzzles unlike most other games nowadays. Puzzles had a clear, logical mindset that only required you to connect the dots in the right way at the right time.

There was no compromise in the storytelling department. It had an excellent story to share and it continued perfectly from Portal 1. I listened to the developer commentary and I appreciated all the little details the writers put into the story to make the gameplay and the story work seamlessly together. The character development and, spoiler, plot twist, was neat. Portal 2 is a prime example of how you create a world that blends both gameplay and storytelling together in a way that appeals to both types of people who play for either the story or the puzzles.

Until I get a VR headset and try out Half-Life Alyx, I am content with calling Portal 2 Valve's Magnum Opus.

24548,This has to be the best game ive played its whitty dialogue  funny humour for my brain the puzzels can be tricky at times but through a few play throughs you will get use to it but i found a bit of the game very repative and boring
24549,POTATO MMMMMMMMMMM
24550,qekjroipaehro;aweraeraewraer
24551,weatly
24552,wish Valve would update it to run on 64-bit macOS so i didn't have to build a PC just to play it
24553,игра на 10 из 10 (прошел)
24554,10/10 you need to try this game
24555,"Such a good game, it feels like you can go forever by just repeating it over and over, so much fun and i definitely recommend it to anyone. price is so cheap for the quality and fun :)"
24556,these achievement are mengontol
24557,Volov god gem
24558,this game never get boring fr a masterplace by valve. really recomended.
24559,"Spooky, Tension Building Puzzle Game.
The Lore Is very cool and the gameplay too!

The Start Cutscenes are A Bit Boring"
24560,yes
24561,"its portal 2 man come on

24562,"10/10

24563,I love this game
24564,Groovy
24565,i'm a potato
24566,"Does this game even need another review? Probably not. But I'll give my 2 cents anyways. 
Easily falls somewhere on the Top 10 video games of all time. 
It's like... close to necessary to play Portal and Portal 2 and finish it one before you die. 
As far as replayability goes though....
You have to give it like a 2-3 year hiatus between playthroughs to make it worthwhile. You will never recapture the magic of playing through it for the first time. Sadly."
24567,Yes shoot portal go through yes
24568,Bacon and Cheese
24569,I like this game very funny
24570,"Jogo muito épico para jogar com amigo(s), principalmente o albano, muito legal ele
Ah e sobre o jogo, divertidissimo, mecanicas legais e trilha boa"
24571,Great classic puzzles to keep you thinking. Too bad Valve doesn't know how to make a 3rd game.

24573,Iz gud
24574,i saw a deer
24575,Its portal but better. what more do i need to say?
24576,"This is the best game ever made.
The puzzles, mechanics, characters, story, comedy, art, music, it all fits perfectly and are all masterpieces in their own right.
If you have not played Portal 2, do so. After you have, I strongly recommend installing its predecessor Portal if you have not done so already and install the fan-made additions Portal Stories: Mel and Portal Reloaded.
For a game consisting of this magnitude of greatness, I would usually be more detailed in its review, however I feel as though it would be best experienced by buying and playing it yourself, nor could I do its finer detail justice."
24577,"Really fun, challenges your brain, and after you've finished the story mode you can play to Co-Op with your friends or create your own map. If you haven't played a portal game its a must."
24578,wheatley my beloved
24579,its a veary old fun game\

24602,"Such a great game. Never played a Valve game before but chose just a random one that looked cool and really really enjoyed it. The puzzels were difficult, but overtime I really got the hang of it. I also loved the storyline and all of the character's especially Wheatley's humor."
24603,little moron man haha little moron
24604,"This game was very well made for when it came out and I think that compared to the previous game, they have done very well on the design making it as realistic as it could go and honestly if they support this game with NVIDIA Ray Tracing I cannot wait to see how far this will go."

24615,"It's a fantastically designed game, with tough but rewarding puzzles, satisfying mechanics to use, and one of the greatest endings of all time, all paired up with some very witty writing. One of - if not Valve's best yet."
24616,gud game

It's my favourite game I've ever played so far. I played it in 2015 I think.
Only spent 10-15-20 hours on it, but, that doesn't matter.
It's still my favourite."
24625,portal 2
24626,"Очень круто! Юмор великолепный, даже не верится что это одна с Half-Life вселенная. И хоть Half-Life 1-2 это шутер а Portal головоломка, благодаря юмору Portal гораздо меньше душит (хотя под конец игры и хочется скипнуть некоторые моменты). В общем одна из моих любимых игр. Рекомендую!"
24627,Glados Gaming
24628,"Cool game with nice story line
"
24629,my girl broke up with because we played this game... now she gets railed by a guy who pees out the boxer hole
24630,"The puzzles; fun engaging, original. The comedy; hilarious, varied, original. This game is impeccable. 
People want Portal 3, and of course, I want more Portal, but I think this game went out on a perfect note! This game is more than worth playing all the way through!"
24631,portal 2
24632,"My all time #1 favorite game. Have all 51 achievements. I even have a tattoo. If you haven't played this yet, you haven't lived"
24633,THE ONLY PUZZLE GAME THAT IS FUN
24634,"This is an all-round fantastic experience, and I'm very happy that I finally sat down and went through it. It's the perfect size serving of some of the best puzzle-platforming gameplay you'll find on a platter of a really cool environment and aesthetic. 10/10."
24635,"Could easily replay this thing over and over n still enjoy it. Its just that kinda game. 
Multiplayers cool too. If youre willing to put up with a friend out to drop you into pits constantly, that is.
Dunno what you mean, thats the best part.

Lemon/10 needs more lemons to throw at life."
24636,Great game made me robophobic.
24637,"one of the best games frim valve 
its a masterpiece
i recomend to buy this game its of adventure and nice story"

24639,Fun but short
24640,GG
24641,"lots of fun to play 

"
24642,"One of the best video games of all time. Portal 2 is seriously one of a kind - I can't even think of anything close to it in concept, gameplay, or aesthetics. It's one of those experiences I think every gamer should have, so, if you haven't already, buy the game. You'll enjoy your time with it - that is virtually a guarantee."
24643,going thru a portal is like going thru your moms stinky poopoo hole 10/10
24644,"Very fun puzzles, great writing and voice acting as well"
24645,"The singleplayer is a 10/10. Good story, funny characters, cool mechanics, and creative puzzles.
The multiplayer is a 9/10. Still really good, but it makes more sense if you've played the singleplayer first. The endings are a little disappointing, but they are funny. It would've also been cool to see some new characters besides the 2 players."
24646,"James Eastwood has inverted legs
games fun tho"
24647,much poggers
24648,makes brain bigger
24649,This game is a classic.
24650,Now thinking with Portals!
24651,plz play
24652,one of its kind. really recommend it
24653,"The perfect sequel to portal. Challenging levels, funny characters, and a overall great ending."
24654,It takes IQ to beat this game very challenging
24655,It's Portal 2. It doesn't get much better than this for puzzle games.
24656,You fall through the portal and then you go wOOooOooOSh
24657,"once again, i dont really have to say why this game is good"
24658,everything that says valve on it just buy it
24659,it fun :)
24660,"An instant favorite's sequel, I'm still bad at puzzles tho"
24661,"One of my all-time favorite puzzle games - a must-play on PC if you're one of the few people who has a Steam account and still hasn't managed to invest in Valve's masterpiece. 

The portal gameplay is so iconic at this point that I don't even needs explanation - my only problem with the main story is that it's too short. Valve needs to make Portal 3 already!"
24662,"Very fun game, especially the co op with a friend"
24663,"Amazing puzzles, super funny"
24664,gud
24665,fun and one of a kind puzzle game series

24678,This game is excellent go buy it right now
24679,"Great gameplay, decent story, good graphics, great dialogue, and very good multiplayer mechanics too. Good follow up to the original game"
24680,"this is a certified hood classic

Yeah but seriously I played this when I was a wee lad and I still love it, definitely one of my favorite games. Even runs on terrible computers like mine.
10/10 Would play 50,000 times and still wouldn't be tired of the game. Gotta love the co/op too"
24681,"You know, I've been thinking. When Life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make Life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what the hell am i supposed to do with these!? Demand to see Life's manager. Make Life rue the day it though it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the guy who's gonna burn your house down. With the lemons. I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"
24682,"A really nice stand-alone game, building on the experience of Portal (1) and adding new depth with co-op multi-player that is tricky to complete. Well done Valve."

24726,Just play it
24727,"I have absolutely loved this game. The humour is brilliant. So dry and sarcastic, and quirky in a way I haven't experienced in any other game. The level of puzzle-solving and creativity that is both put out by the developers, and that is required of the player(s), is phenomenal. All-round money in the bank here. DEFINITE recommend!"
24728,"Portal 2 is a great game. There are many game franchises that produce underwhelming sequels. This game however blew me away. It was a massive improvement in all aspects compared to the portal 1. Story, characters, visuals, and even the level designs/variety were superior to the first game. What really made this game shine however was the unique character interaction. Though it was a small cast, (consisting of mainly 4 characters) how they conversed felt very real and was extremely entertaining. If you're looking for a short but sweet game with a little bit of a challenge I'd highly recommend."

The only problem I have is it takes a REALLY long time to fully complete. The first game (Portal) took me 9 hours, and this one took me 15. (It might just be because sometimes I over-think the test levels-) Other that that though, amazing game."
24779,"As a person who has lots of sex all the time, I can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women like I do everyday. This game did not make me horny however. I just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. On the other hand I would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because I have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. She kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who I have sex with a lot. I have lots of sex. I also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say I’m very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but I told her I was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and gameended herself because I did not have sex with her. I have sex with women. Not sometimes men. I am also gay. I am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because I am very cool and sexy. My penis is very big. All my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and I am very good with sex with my women. Every woman I’ve had sex with is very sexy and so am I. I have lots of sex. I’m also very handsome and sexy and have lots of sex."

24835,bonerboy554 craves more
24836,Brilliant game
24837,Tricky but good game to keep your head fit and it is culture and art
24838,"In my opinion a game that you must have played.
Even years after the release still worthy to play if you haven't already. An excellent puzzling game, where you have to solve chambers by teleporting yourself or other objects with the help of two portals, which you can place onto walls. Not too easy, but also not too difficult, although it can be challenging sometimes, but still fun.
Really good and exciting story, which is also interesting and sometimes quite funny. Contains much background information.
Even for 2021 I still wouldn't describe the graphics as outdated, because it still looks beautiful, while being easy to run on low-end hardware.
I can also recommend the multiplayer mode, where you can play together with one of your friends, with more challenging chambers to solve.

I would recommend also playing Portal 1 before playing Portal 2, but you don't really need to. You can also get the game much cheaper during a steam-sale together with Portal 1.
Rating: [b]10/10[/b]
Unfortunately there is no Portal 3, but Portal Reloaded, which is one of the best community mods for Portal 2."

24861,Very fun except it’s too hard. I got it to play with my #gamer boyfriend but some of the levels are too hard for him to figure out so he has to look it up.
24862,brain pain is great fun
24863,"i realy like this game.it has a lot of lore.secrets and is just so fun.this has to be one of my favs.my fav game mode is co-op,it is so fun even when you gont have friends cuz you can find a partner online,and i realy like the story that it tells.over all this is a great game and i realy recomend it"
24864,"Easily my favorite game on Steam. Portal 2 ticks all the boxes; all the great things about Portal 1 and more. Fantastic puzzles, gameplay and mechanics, writing, storytelling, music, voice acting, graphics, and whatever else I haven't thought of.
Go ask your English/media studies/whatever-it's-called-in-your-country teacher to have the class study this video game, if you can.

Even if we have to wait another decade or longer until Portal 3 (or whatever the next major Portal game will be) is released, I still find pleasure playing and building community test chambers for hours on Portal 2, and replaying the singleplayer campaign.

Also, if you don't have Portal 1 and decide to buy this game, I suggest picking up both games through the Portal bundle instead."
24865,yieeessss
24866,"Just completed this masterpiece. Such a beautiful, perfectly implemented game, very humours, if you stop, stand and listen to some of the voice lines the characters speak, it's just amazing, they just didn't throw voice lines. Anyways, games >>> Playing multi-players with toxic teammates. A must play game. 

Talking about the puzzles, they for fun to solve and aren't boring. Thank you Portal 2 <3"
24867,funny portal go phew
24868,Ideal for ending friendships!
24869,its good
24870,"It's over and I'm happy. A game that feels polished in a way where the game still has it's quirks.
I was very late to the Portal games, and I regret not playing them earlier."
24871,Maybe one of THE BEST story modes I ever played!
24872,good
24873,A real one Masterpiece.

24879,"[b]Preformance:[/b]
You don't need a powerful gaming rig to play at reasonable framerate but it is recommended.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The singleplayer gameplay is fairly short but still enjoyable.

[b]Addictiveness [I know it's not an actual word, shut up]: [/b]
You could spend hours designing community test chambers.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Still decent since 2011.

[b]Story: [/b]
a well constructed plot which takes place after [spoiler]Chell gets put into hibernation for YES months by Ratman after Chell was recovered from the portal explosion which killed GlaDOS in Portal 1.[/spoiler] Overall, great story and lore.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
You will need a brain to be able to solve the puzzles.

[b]Is it worth the price?[/b]
Yes; no need to wait for  a sale.

[b]Conclusion: [/b]
Would highly recommend this game if you're into the Portal or Half Life series. Still just as fun as it was 10 years ago, but don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself if this review made you interested."

24885,with over 60 hours on this game including on console as of August 2021 I can say that this game is fantastic even after all this time it has so much replay value. I've replayed the game in its entirety most likely 10+ times so far.
24886,"This is a FANTASTIC game. It gets very difficult, but it makes it all the more satisfying to figure it out. The ending is very much worth going through the long storyline to get to it."

And unlike with anime I was pleasantly surprised. I has becomed one of my favourite games of all time and the themes and genres it decides to tackle hit close to home.

A Timeless title, will revisit again and again."
25004,"One really good and well made game also a classic too! It is significantly longer than Portal, with more challenging puzzles and a ton of new puzzle mechanics, also the story is really good. If you are thinking on buying this game I recommend playing Portal first to understand the story. Overall this is a masterpiece of a game!"
25005,One of the best game ever created
25006,"10/10 

Pros:
+ It's Portal 
+ Expands on the pre-existing story really well 
+ Fkn amazing characters
+ Introduces more variety in gameplay with gels 
+ Banger multiplayer
+ Jam packed w community features which add so much to play time. Explore community maps, make your own maps, heck yeah!

Cons: 
Couldn't think of any."
25007,"A novel idea, perfectly executed. 
Awesome characters, masterfully voice acted.
Oozing with atmosphere: mystery and humor.
Amazing replay value and co-op.

Only two negatives I can think of and neither of them count:
1. Sometimes I wish I could sprint. But that would be less time in a beautiful game and would probably break some puzzles.
2. The campaign ends and it makes me sad.

25008,THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME IN HISTORY
25009,How do you not have this game already

25012,yes

Still my favourite game to play, even after 10 years. Comedy/timing is great, voice acting is phenomenal, music isn't too in your face. Not to mention that Co-op is actually really fun to do as well.
I can't recommend this puzzle game enough!!
It is a bit on the short side when it comes to other games, but god I can't get enough of it.
It's a really good sci-fi, first person shooter/puzzle game. Please check it out if you haven't yet"

Fantastic voice acting too. you cant go wrong. if you havent played this by now, buy and beat portal 1, then buy and beat portal 2. its a blast. great co-op mode too. THE ONLY BAD THING about this game is that the puzzles start to get a little old and stale towards the end of the game. but seriously play this game you'll thank yourself. seriously. go."

25042,"Esse jogo não tem um defeito sequer. Eu costumava pensar que, em comparação com a perfeição enxuta que é o primeiro Portal, essa sequência tinha problemas de ritmo, conteúdo demais, adicionava coisas a uma fórmula que já estava perfeita. Mas não. Não. Portal 2 é maior, mas é tão bom quanto. Tão perfeito quanto."
25043,meh

25045,"This game is an absolutely awesome puzzler.  Hands down my favorite co-op puzzler.  Multitudes of player created levels provides an endless reason to return to playing, even if you take a long break.  The devs keep releasing patches and fixes for issues as they arise."

25059,"You shouldn't be reading this review.

You should be experiencing an amazing game.

But if you want a short review in bullet point form then I can tell you this game has:

- Amazing puzzles and mechanics.
- Incredible level and sound design.
- A great sense of direction without waypoints (classic Valve).
- An awesome story with great funny characters.
- Amazing voice acting.
- Expert pacing.
- A great end-credits GLaDOS song.
- Some nice extra stuff like a comic book and funny videos.
- An awesome easy to use level creator.
- A single and multiplayer option to play user created levels.

This is an amazing experience you should not miss that I cannot recommend enough."

25078,"6/10 Decent:

Don’t kill me for offering a contrarian opinion here, but I think both Portal games are a victim of being overrated. I thoroughly enjoyed the first game, but not to the extent of the full whack of 10/10’s and ‘best game ever’ accolades that fans throw at it – it did, however, have an awesome villain and a fantastic ending song.

Portal 2 is a game of two halves. Initially, it kicks off by following on from the ending of Portal 1, and introduces the hilarious, Wheatley AI, a goofball in every sense of the word, rapid-fire, nonsensical ramblings that add a touch of comedy throughout.

He’s here to help you get out of the joint, and he’s awful at it. And of course, his incompetence leads to a certain villain showing up, and the two mesh well.

At this point, I was totally convinced the game was 9/10 awesomeness, both Wheatley and our villain were brilliant, superbly written and fun to interact with as we go through the typical Portal puzzles, using portals to navigate test chambers.

Where the game fell away for me was in Part 2. See, at the halfway point you get thrown out of the test chambers, I won’t elaborate on why, but suffice to say you get to use your portal gun in more open environments. You also get to incorporate ‘gels’ into your puzzle solving, so blue allows you to bounce higher, orange lets you run fast and white lets you create portals on any surface it comes in contact with.

It’s all neat, but the expanded world doesn’t really change up the puzzles (for me), it just makes them more tedious as I now have to scour the environment for the one flipping piece I can throw a portal on, figure out the mechanics and move on. And this breaks the pacing to such an extent that I just felt it became an entire slog.

The story also, doesn’t really pick up here, because we’re treated to a history lesson – which is nice, but in combination with the pace-breaking, it just doesn’t really entice me so much as it probably should.

This portion of the game was such a slog that it really killed the momentum of the first half, and it doesn’t help that it is more or less devoid of character interaction outside the historical blurbs. That’s what knocks the score down for me. Still, it’s a decent game, worth playing and it has an absolute army of fans that love it, so just treat my view as an anomaly in the pool, that’s science as our friendly villain would say."
25079,FUCK YOU VALVE FOR MAKING ME FUCKING DEAF!
25080,Just as good as when I played it a few years ago
25081,Played this late but the game is as beautiful as 2021 games.

25092,epic
25093,"6 hours of pure fun. Glad I went out of my way to replay an old classic, still better writing and game design than most games nowadays :)"
25094,"I miss the tight pacing and atmosphere of Portal, but Portal 2 improves on its predecessor in nearly every other way. Test chambers are made more complex thanks to the inclusion of the new gel mechanic, the difficulty curve is properly balanced, the campaign and its story is fleshed out this time around, a CO-OP campaign is present, and P2 has a great sense of humor. Portal 2 is easily the most unique gaming experience I've ever had. It's a nice break from the droves of shooters out on the market."
25095,"It's a great classic based around platforming, logical thinking, illogical physics, and witty writing. The main story isn't terribly long, and there's an alternate story line in the two-player cooperative mode. Add on countless community created testing chambers and a workshop to create your own, its playable from ten to hundreds of hours of solid gameplay."
25096,best puzzle game idk wut else to say its a good game
25097,"The story is good, as well as the game-play, and humor."
25098,It's like portal but after!
25099,"oh my fucking god this game is amazing, the level design is simple enough to make it really satisfying to solve every single test chamber as fast as possible without it being too easy, and the comedic narration from chapter 6-7 could be a reason on its own to purchase this game. 
the game is so good that 2010 year old me instantly wanted the game when i saw the trailer on a 360 demo disc, ive beaten the game once on xbox and roughly 3 times on pc and I'm going to do it again (game was so damn good i cried a little when i completed it last time it is so damn fucking good got dayum it is good i cannot emphasize how good this game is i love it so fucking much if i could talk to every single developer behind this i would give them each a gift as a thank you)"

25107,it be fun
25108,amazing game
25109,"Amazing game, still holds up today. A timeless classic, hard recommend."
25110,"What can I say about Portal 2? It's an absolute masterpiece of a game! I remember I immediately got it for the Xbox 360 the day it came out in 2011, and I binge-played the hell out of it!

My only complaint is that Portal 2 felt like it was more focused on the story than puzzle solving to me. Then again as I think about it, there's a lot more chambers that get increasingly complex as you progress when compared to Portal 1/Still Alive. I'm not denying that the story is amazing, but you know what I mean right? Sometimes I admit that the community made test chambers are even harder than the built in test chambers.

Speaking of, Valve really took it a step forward when they added the community test chambers! The ability to create your own test chambers was just the cherry on top! I wish there was more added to the test chamber editor, like custom textures, custom environments, etc. I know the Authoring tools and hammer editor exists for that, but you know, they both can be hard to use if you don't know what to do.

So all in all, Portal 2 gets a 9.5/10 from me! It has an excellent story and great gameplay!"
25111,Epic Game
25112,nice
25113,"Very fun! Puzzles are challenging, The story is great, It has 2 player."

25117,"Portal 2 is my favourite game. The lighting, the story line, the secrets, the acting, the game play. everything about this game is amazing and blows my mind every time I play it."
25118,"This is probably as perfect a game as has ever been released. It's not too difficult, but it rewards thinking. It has enough siderails that you can't get impossibly stuck (like a Myst game) while still giving you time to figure out puzzles on your own schedule. The voice acting is top notch, and the animations are great, too. I love this game."

25138,"great story, clever gameplay, great fps, 10/10"
25139,"This is probably Valve's funniest, and best game of all time. The puzzle play and platforming is amazing and will have you wanting to replay it more and more just to find out all the secrets. I have played this game more times than I can count and that only includes the main story. I have never had the luxury to be able to play the co-op with my friends but from what I can gather, it is excellent as well. There are so many great moments in this game just from the characters interacting with each other and it had me on the floor laughing at one point. The puzzles build up to each other and are not just random bullshit thrown at you just for kicks. There is a room in here, which I'm not going to spoil, but if you played the game, you know what I'm talking about. There are no low points in this game. It's constantly hitting you with new ideas, ambience, imagery, and lore while building on pre-established concepts introduced in the previous game. Portal 2 is so good that it was even a key point in the story for Lego Dimensions. Play Portal 1, Play Portal 2, and play mods for both games. 10/10."
25140,best game i ever played
25141,It's good.
25142,"I rate this game a solid 10/10. the puzzles, AMAZING! The characters, HILARIOUS! This might be one of the BEST games i ever played. I am genuinely sad that it is over. This is such a good game. The story is INSANE and Intense at times. If you are seeing this and on the fence about getting this, I'd say this is the best use of 10 dollars that exists. Even to this day it remains one of, if the THE, best games I have ever played."

25250,First of all it's really tricky (Not the green tricky if anyone knows about him) and people might hate on the game for that. But for me it's the time you finally complete it that feels amazing :) Even when you search up the answers (I ONLY DID THAT ONCE) it still feels good :) AND don't forget the portals (SPOILER ALERT) at the beginning of the you don't have the portal gun witch makes it even more fun when you do get it. The portals are super smooth in the roblox game portal together it isn't really smooth but in this game it's unbelievably smooth and the rest i'll let you see for your self.

If you do play this game, please do not start co-op and first look for someone who needs that darn achievement. Whether that be here, on steam, or on reddit or something. Help out a fellow gamer. Anyways, with the actual game review. The story was pretty epic. The first character you meet, Wheatley ,is one of my favorite video game characters. I am actually convinced he is based off of the Minecraft Youtuber,"" MumboJumbo"" He literally is Mumbo."

25266,"Portal 2 is very good.

It may seem like a simple puzzle game that will challenge you with a unique element that isn't seen in other games & whilst this is true what you really stay for is the humour of the games.

The humour in these games is carried by Stephen Merchant (Wheatley) & Ellen McLain (GLaDOS) who deliver fantastic lines brilliantly. These jokes will often take centre stage over the puzzles as you put those to the back of your mind while just listening to the small funny metal ball speak in an awful american accent to trick the omnipotent, evil AI.

25328,"Explore's aperture a lot more than the first game. The ""vintage"" section that was built pre 1950's (the fall) is probably my favourite part.  While not only showcasing fantastic level design, but also attempting to give you the chance of seeing the fool scale of the facility. So much better than the first game in my opinion, still would recommend playing the first though. 8/10 game."

25332,Really fun puzzles and great communication building game on Co-Op.
25333,"Couldn't say why Portal 2 is just so goddamn good. 

I typically don't make serious reviews when it comes to games, but this game was just such a genuine experience that by the end of it, I wished there was more to mess around with, more levels to play, more of that sweet, sweet, intuitive Valve game design to indulge. 

Guess we'll just have to wait, see if the executives decide that we masses really do need a third title."
25334,Classic must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer. This game is one of those games that is still fun and interesting for a casual game years and decades later.

25385,this is a good game and good storie
25386,It's a cool game which requires a bit of insight and thinking. It's fun to play together
25387,Just incredible with both singleplayer story-gameplay and co-op campaign
25388,"Great game! Fairly short game, but story is delivered quite well. Gameplay is really fun with many puzzles. Dialogue is really interesting and fun to listen to. The characters are well designed and written. Sountracks are nothing special. The story is simple and quick, again nothing special, but good enough to not bore me out of it. Graphics and actual gameplay is clean and   impressive since the game was developed a long time ago. Love the coop gameplay. Coop is also very enjoyable; it involves a lot of thinking and communication to get things done together(the coop has additional levels). Overall, for a cheap game, it is worth the 6-8 hours(9 chapters) single-player gameplay and fantastic for reviving friendships with friends that you don't talk to as often due to covid and lockdown."
25389,"Engaging story and fun, challenging puzzles.  Cannot go wrong with Portal and Portal 2."
25390,My second time to play through and I still enjoy it. Highly recommended .

25419,27/10 Game Of The Century
25420,cool
25421,"Portal 2 is wonderful. As someone who played and loved the first game, Portal 2 takes what I loved from the first game and built upon it. The puzzles are just as fun and challenging as in the first game, and I think the story is impeccable. Is it a little predictable? Maybe. But to me seeing some of the plot points play out when you already guessed them is a little satisfying. The replayability (at least for me) is insane. Plus, I really love the option for co-op play, as it makes the game even more fun getting to solve puzzles with your friends and family. 10/10 would definitely recommend, especially if you loved the first portal game."

it is a very fun game"
25435,"runs pretty good on potato laptop
also i have like 100 hours on ps3 version- its a good f-ing game"
25436,"A great sequel to a great game. The puzzles are more interesting this time around, Co-op is great and the characters are interesting. Although it kinda lost the original Portal atmosphere, which kinda sucks. But either way, this is a good game and I highly recommend it."
25437,"NICE GAME
"
25438,this is good
25439,"Honestly one of the best games EVER. The story is intriguing and exiting. Yet the game still manages to be comprehensible for people who dont often play games. The lore also goes incredible deep and if you pay attention during the game and find some of the many secrets youll start piecing stuff together and its an incredible feeling. Even if you dont feel like uncovering all of the details you can find videos on youtube which explain everything and its honestly incredible. The game also handels learningcurve great and you never feel tricked. It introduces a new mechanism, lets you get used to how it works. makes an especially hard puzzle combining it with previous mechanics and then goes on to the next mechanic so the game never feels repetetive. I wont spoil anything but in the game there are characters with interesting dynamics and personalities which make for great comedic relief (which sometimes is necessary since the game sometimes feels a bit lonely and has an almost creepy atmosphere) for example there is a character which follows you through the game which never fails to make me atleast smirk. It might be a bit frustrating trying to figure out a puzzle since they actually get quite hard .but finding the solution to a puzzle is always incredibly satisfying.  Definately a must play i.m.o"

25502,Literally the best game I've ever played
25503,I am making this review because I need steam awards to feed my poor 3 starving children.
25504,"I love this game it delivered what i was expecting, it is by far the better game of the Portal series by story and gameplay."
25505,"This game is REALLY fun!  I would recommend it to anyone who has played the first Portal game, any of the Half-Life games, or anyone who just really likes puzzles.  In this game, you play as Chell, a mute human being guided by Weatley, a friendly AI.  The object of the game is to escape the Aperture Science testing facility, being run by the evil AI Glados, who wants nothing more than to force the player to complete various tests until the player is killed.  There is also a cooperative mode in which you complete cooperative tests as one of two robots (Atlas or P-Body) designed to replace the human element in Glados' tests.  You do not need to play the first game before playing this one, as everything you would need to know is explained in the game. 
 However keep in mind that if you play the games out of order the second game will spoil a bit of the ending of the first.  :)  Sorry that this is so long!"
25506,Valve's Best Game 10/10

25512,So fun playing together
25513,"What an amazing game! Even today, it's challenging, fun and addictive! The story is engaging and comedic and the level editor is really fun. I'll always play this game, it never gets old."

Hugely recommended :)"
25517,It's Portal 2.
25518,good game
25519,DOUBLE FUN
25520,"Portal 2, while not as classic as the first iteration, is still a very good game. It improves on the characters by making them more lively and the gameplay is still as timeless as ever"
25521,"A classic, addictive game everyone should own."
25522,Awesome puzzle game with some twist
25523,"A very good game, i reccomend it!"

25527,Шедевр нахуй
25528,one of my favorite games ever. have played it across different platforms and accounts. one of the best co-op experiences too. just wish there was a few more levels.
25529,Almost as good as Minecraft Pocket Edition LITE (which is free) and this is paid so its already coming in with a major disadvantage but it makes up for it in a variety of ways. Does not offend me (i am trans)
25530,Great game for anyone looking for a well thought out puzzle style game. Co-op is great fun for two people that like a challenge.
25531,very good
25532,I'll miss you GLaDOS
25533,Portal go brrrr player go portal vzoom cube go wtf
25534,"Very Good Puzzles, it makes you feel smart while also challenging your brain."

25544,"i love this game im not good at rating stuff but i would say that the story is good, the puzzles are challenging while still being fun and once your done with the main game there is also multiplayer and player built levels that can just confuse you but in a fun way i would recommend this if your bored of your other games or just in genral"
25545,this game makes me go Y E S
25546,This is my comfort game. It always makes me happy.
25547,"Yeah, it's a good game"
25548,I will never forgive you Wheatley.
25549,Such a fun and challenging experience. Loved both single player and co-op and would highly recommend to anyone who loves a challenge.

25554,so many plot twists/ not realy. theres like 2 or 3 but i havent finished so.... great game though
25555,"good
"
25556,"Portal 2 is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. The gameplay feels polished and the mechanics are fun to mess around with. The story is fairly simple, but I think it works well, and the characters in this game are amazing. What I will say is that the graphics have not aged amazingly, I think due to the artstyle the game is still nice to look at, but there are definitely places where the game is not very pleasant to look at due to the rendering technology. Though, I think all of that is to be expected of a 10 year old game. It also doesn't feel as lonely or creepy as Portal 1, depending on your tastes this could be a good thing or a bad thing, though the atmosphere of Portal 2 doesn't stand out as much. I will say that Portal 2 does feel like a more polished and completely game than Portal 1, though. And the campaign is definitely longer."
25557,i would if the game openned. i played it month ago with a friend and no i cant open it
25558,"this is one of the best games i have played i don,t see many flaws in it"
25559,very fun
25560,pretty fun game
25561,yes
25562,It's good.
25563,"Excellent & marvelous

= Pros =
* Various puzzle-fps mechanics with several new in difference with first Portal
* Glados, AI that is crazy about science with black sense of humor & one of the best characters from all video games
* Deep atmosphere of laboratory consisting two huge parts. One part is clean futuristic but with effect of glitches & damage after decay. And second part is rusty old-fashioned abandoned underground Cyclopean-sized artificial caves with waste. Simply breathtaking
* High-quality graphics from authors of Source Engine
* More elaborated plot than in first Portal
* Coop mode! Yay!
* Funny & creepy defective & franken turrets
* Nice touching end song of Glados
* Good ost with some hypnotic & scary themes

= Cons =
* Wheatley annoyed me frequently

10/10

I can safely say i have achieved ultimate happiness.

Buy the game, don't even read the reviews."
25569,"This game is a must play for any gamer out there. Single player campaign is brilliant, and the co-op is even better. Just buy the damn game, it is better then most recently released $60 games at literally less than half the price."

25595,its alright
25596,epic
25597,Great continue of the story
25598,"Yes, I recommended this game. And i already read final hours. Thank Valve team build this wonder game.

No more count to three, i accept that. I want tell something.On old time like 90s, classic game sometime they stuck on develop, they will release advanced version of their game. Like magaman or metal slug, they make it 'X' version, [i][X mean advanced][/i]. After that, they continue next number of their game, mostly next number is finalize, advanced, and fun to play.

So I hope valve can develop portal 2 with [u]advanced chamber[/u], with same story line and same graphical. Also can add a few new element to build.
Valve team, You all give the price, many fan and player will pay it.

3D game is hard to imagination, need keep testing and thinking. Keep healthy life and happy to working. And portal 2 say, ""Remember, testing is the future, and the future start with you""."
25599,Ahahaha portal fast
25600,pretty good story lol
25601,.
25602,interesting
25603,"I loved playing this game. It's puzzles are challenging yet enjoyable, and it's story makes you want to know more about it's world. I would rate it a 9/10. The only downside is that I want to play more even after the game is over."

25617,"Phenomenal puzzle game, excellent story and humor.  One of my favorite games ever.
"
25618,A sequel that is very good.
25619,"This game is very good, the gameplay is fluid, there are more levels, and there is a lot of community-created content. The story is amazing, like Kindom Hearts (I say that because I heard that Kindom Hearts is good; I haven't played the game at all). I'd say it's one of the most well-written story games I've played of all time. Also, the multiplayer has a separate campaign! Also, no, this review was not me playing for the first time. I played this game for 100+ hours, and I'm still making community maps today.

(Edit: not 100+ hours, it's about 93 hours...)"

If you like funny robots, you'll love Portal 2. If you like Science, you'll love Portal 2. If you like potatoes, you'll love Portal 2. If you like the colors blue and orange, you'll love Portal 2.

You WILL love Portal 2. And if you don't, J.K Simmons will burn your house down with a combustible lemon. So you better put on your jumpsuit and Long Fall Boots, grab your Portal Gun and a British Eyeball, and Do Some Science."

If you don't own this you should buy it right now. You will not regret it."

25655,best 8 euros in my entire life!
25656,"Funny, puzzling and great graphics for the game's age. Loved the characters and the story as well as the fun game play which makes you work to solve the puzzles. That being said portal 2 does a really good job of introducing you to new objects and items to interact with gradually."

On another note, this was a really good game and even though it's slightly over 10 years old (as of writing) it holds to the beauty standards of today graphics-wise and the story is still amazing. The puzzles are frustrating at times, but that's why we have a wiki page where you can get yourself unstuck.

This was really an amazing end to the portal games. Loved it, recommend it, hope  everyone enjoys this as much as I did.

Also there's multiplayer so my 11 hours turned into a little bit more."

25703,"Portal 2, My Thoughts:
Portal 2 Is Known as a Puzzle Platformer. It's also known as one of the Best games Of Valve.
To Me, I Think it deserves that title.
Portal 2 Is a Huge Update To Portal (1), And Even Includes Co-op.
I Love This Game. Really. The Story Is Easy To Get Hooked Onto.
The Puzzles Are Challenging. It Really Forces You To Think With Portals.
Anyone Who is New to Steam: I Highly Recommend this game. Not just for it's Puzzles, but for it's Story. Even if you dislike the puzzles, You'll like what Portal 2's Story has to offer.
Please Do Yourself a Favor And Drop $9.99 On this game, and experience one of the Best Games Of 2011."

25714,"This is a really great game, probably the best Valve game imo. At least of the one's I've played. The campaign/story is fun and has a nice difficulty, the ending is also great - so there's that. The game also has a ton of community content, so you can never really get board."
25715,"My favourite game. Expands upon the original nicely, the writing is good & the gameplay is smooth. 
10/10"
25716,good game. fun puzzles. emotes are cool. simple but engaging narrative and the puzlles aren't insanely hard or insanely easy. it's a good middle area. Also I really like GLaDOS' character.
25717,"Its a really fun puzzle game, that, while sometimes frustratingly difficult, has alot of fun. Honestly, my main complaint the with the game is that it was too short! Luckily, if you do enjoy the game there's plenty of player made maps to play on for extra hours of fun."
25718,Pre-ordered this game way back and have replayed it for the first time in 10+ years. It still holds up and I can actually say it's nostalgic. Thank you VALVe.

Has incredible puzzles, with very intelligent and intuitive designs that aren't too hard but not too easy. There's also an amazing story with glorious graphics and fantastic writing.

Plus the co-op modes along with the test editor make it, the definitive portal game.

I can't praise this game enough especially as everyone else has done the same.

10/10, just get it. A steam account is incomplete without this and half life 2"

However, what really grabbed me was the high quality of the writing, story, and even a hefty amount of world-building if you look hard enough. It's a fantastic puzzle game wrapped in a further fantastic framework."

25757,Quite a nice game. I recommend it to everyone.
25758,All-time great game.
25759,100% recommend to anyone that wants a great time! the underground levels are tough so it you need to look up a tutorial its okay. google said i should play the first one before this one but i think this one is smoother and has so much more content. all you need to know about portal 1 can be searched up on YouTube but other than that this game was awesome to play.

25765,Does more of everything that was great about portal 1
25766,WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25767,Not many people realize that the cake is actually a ******** and that Aperture's real purpose is *********.
25768,this is just a really good game it saw what the first game had (during this review i have not yet played portal 1) and expanded on it its really good the story while simple is still pretty new and the puzzles are fun my only problem with it was it crashed on me a few times which sucks because i don't think its the games fault probably just the computer that is pretty much the problem i had with it 9/10
25769,"I previously reviewed Portal, and in that review, I claimed that the only puzzle game better than Portal is Portal 2.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that the sequel blows what's already a stellar game out of the water. I'm going to need several paragraphs to accurately describe just how good of a puzzle game, nay, how good of a game, Portal 2 is.

A game is not a game without gameplay, and all other aspects, including graphics, story, characters, and setting are all meaningless if the gameplay isn't good. Fortunately for Valve, Portal 2 delivers exceptional gameplay, with the Portal Gun shining once again in a series of levels that are a well-balanced mix of actual test chambers and dilapidated pathways between them. The puzzles make you think, but not enough to make you quit the game. It's also incredibly fun to be launched out of a portal at high velocity, something you get to do a lot more of in this game than its predecessor. Combine that with the various new tools you have to work with to get by as the game goes on, as well as impressive level design and rich setting, and you have a wonderful single-player experience. The developers really outdid themselves on this one.

While the puzzles alone make this as good as the first Portal, it's the characters that make this game even better than the first. GladOS is back and more spiteful than ever, with dialogue that made me laugh the whole game. On merit of GladOS alone, the writers deserve to get big heads. To top it off, Ellen McLain is better than ever, not only making GladOS more alive than ever, but really selling everything about her character. It isn't just GladOS that makes this game phenomenal though. Wheatley, a new addition to the robotic crew of Aperture Science, is just as endearing as GladOS, while remaining entirely different and amazing in his own right. Despite shifts in his interactions with the player, you never feel like it isn't Wheatley, and honestly, I relate to his cluelessness on a personal level. Stephen Merchant nails the role, delivering a performance that I still can't get out of my head. And I can't talk about incredible characters without referencing the recorded messages of Cave Johnson, voiced by the legendary J. K. Simmons. Man, though he never interacts with the main character, Cave Johnson remains a fan favorite due to his ""everything is possible"" personality mixed with his complete disregard for safety. Sure, it didn't affect his employees well, but when it boils down to it, not even he was exempt from his attitude about his passions, and ultimately, that makes him a character that we find ourselves respecting, even if we would never look up to him. And J. K. Simmons was possibly the only man who could make me like a flippant CEO. He knew the role, and performed the heck out of it. Combine that with superb voice acting from the announcer before GladOS returns, both the good and the broken turrets, and the brief Caroline cameos, not to mention the noises Dee Bradley Baker makes for Atlas and Peabody, the characters and their stellar characterization make this game a masterpiece.

Portal 2 improves on the original in quite a lot of ways, and story is one of them. Almost non-existent in Portal, Portal 2 gives the player purpose in their puzzle-solving adventure. While not terribly complex, it serves as more than enough to get the player personally invested in the outcome. Full of tense moments, riddled with witty remarks, laden with subtle foreshadowing, and driven by a quest that taps into the human desire for freedom, you'll be sucked into the story. To top it off, the game's finale is quite possibly one of the most memorable in all of gaming, which just wouldn't have been possible without the efforts the story team went through to make something magnificent.

All this alone would make Portal 2 one of the best games of all time. But Valve even added a co-op testing course that takes place immediately after the events of the main game. The levels are substantial, and the humor continues to be top-notch. There's even a small storyline, though while it's a little more substantial then that of Portal, it's mostly for flavor. Which isn't to day it's bad, in fact, I quite enjoyed it. The meat of the experience, the complex levels that require two players to beat them, are delightfully difficult, and extremely satisfying to complete, so long as your partner is someone you have fun playing with. I imagine playing with a random player has the potential to turn sour, but that's through no fault of the game itself. Overall, the multiplayer experience was well worth the addition, and it serves as a sparkling gemstone in what is already the crowning achievement of Valve.

If that's not enough, the game has immense replay value. There's enough content to forget how the puzzles play out after a while, and even if you do remember it, the story is still a blast to experience, thanks to the characters Valve created. The co-op mode provides even more replay value, especially if you haven't played the levels with a specific person before. And if that's not enough for you, the community chambers available are extensive, available in both single and multiplayer, and ranging in difficulty from cakewalk to M. C. Escher designing Ocarina of Time's Water Temple.

To top it off, it has a soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the vibe of the long-abandoned Aperture Science. It's mostly atmospheric, but it makes the whole game feel alive. The game even has not one, but two songs performed by Ellen McLain right at the end to send you off, including another excellent composition by Jonathan Coulton, ""Want You Gone."" The song isn't quite as popular as ""Still Alive,"" but it's a good tune nonetheless.

Seriously, the game is that good. With excellent gameplay, amazing sets, levels that work the brain, a killer cast, engaging gameplay, a co-op mode that's its own beast of content, a fantastic soundtrack, and a ridiculously high level of community content, Portal 2 deserves to be remembered as one of the best games ever created. For the best possible experience, I do recommend playing Portal first, which is a great game in its own right, but I'm not joking when I say that its sequel is bound to make the history books."
25770,combustible Lemons! and a talking potato...
25771,"Absolute classic. If you haven't played it, you didn't have a good childhood. I played it and my dad STILL hits me. Perfect game can't wait for the 3rd one to come out next year."
25772,"Portal 2 is a mind numbing puzzle game which actually makes you think hard. The story of the game is amazing as well, it leaves not many questions unanswered as well as keeps you guessing of what's going to happen next. The characters are very well adapted into the story, which leads to answers of why things are happening. This game is 100% worth the play through, and would buy full price."

25774,good
25775,10/10 game. now if only there was a portal 3...
25776,"Great puzzle game, the test chambers are slightly harder than the ones in the first Portal but nothing too hard. If anything, the scale of some of the tests can be a bit confusing at first.
I also liked that this game has a better story than the first one."

I have replayed this game at least 30+ different times on Xbox  360, Xbox one, and PC and each time I come back and replay the campaign its like a new experience. I heavily suggest people who have never played this game before to buy it and take a seat because it is so good. From the deep lore and the fair graphics for its time, this game will keep new players for hours in their seats. I only wish there was a Portal 3."
25906,its good
25907,Great sequel to the classic Portal game. Everything you loved from the first and more. Clever puzzles? Yep. Snarky robots? Extra helpings there.
25908,"Played Portal on the Orange Box on 360 as a kid and never played Portal 2. Such a shame I missed out on playing one of the best games I've played. Unexpectedly top notch story, world building, and the introduction of new mechanics is done incredibly well. Co-op is a great addition too. 100% lives up to the original."

25916,"I have major nostalgia for this game, as it is the first game I ever played (when I was 5). As such it has affected me in many ways, such as the supplementation of my imagination. The story is superb, the characters still make me laugh even to this day, the voice acting ever so quotable and professional, intriguing and fun game-play, a great soundtrack, and the excellent story and world-building that you'd always expect from a Valve game. Additionally, you can make your own test chambers, and other people play them, and if you're good enough with Valve's open-source (no pun intended) Source engine, you could further add features and details to your maps. It would be an accurate statement to say not only was this game my childhood, but Valve in general was childhood, and is now a part of my teen-hood as I continue to grow. I highly recommend this game, especially for your children (if you have any, that is)."

25947,"Just finished the campaign again and really it's Portal 2, good old classic game. Still holds up in today's standard. Gameplay is innovative for its time, played the campaign twice (once when I was in college and just now) and I appreciate the writing and voice acting, puzzles and all the little details even more by replaying it. It's still one the best must-play games out there, and you really need to play it for yourself...

Plus there's Co-Op, where you can shout at your friend for not having the same brain cells as you. And the Steam Workshop, with a seemingly bottomless worth of puzzle contents (and other stuff like horror for some reason) that other people made online...

Go Buy it, I highly recommend it..."

25952,you will love this game totally reccomend
25953,"[b]""Portal 2"" continues on the path of the original ""Portal"" but this time Valve gave us a more complete, longer and even better technically game. The concept is extraordinary, the puzzles' logic is unique, the characters are adorable and the sense of humor is just awesome. The cinematic approach and the clever plot will make your journey through the ruins of Aperture's facilities a magical, surreal experience. The community support of extra levels and the co-op mode give it a lot more extra play hours. Masterpiece.


Manometer: 9/10[/b]


The good
- The main concept is fantastic and the unique gameplay is now even more enriched with various new elements. Control mechanics are accurate and responsive. You can' t stop creating portals here and there to see what happens.
- The puzzles are intelligent with their own unique logic. You have to redefine the way your mind works. They are not too hard, but challenging enough to entertain you for several hours. Some of them are easily placed among the best puzzles ever.
- Amazing, surreal humor. Well written and clever dialogues full of irony. Like the original ""Portal"" it is one of the most hilarious games out there.
- Really good and atmospheric visuals even for today standards. It does not feel old.
- Fantastic sound design with a big variety of sound effects. The main characters' voices are as enjoyable as it gets.
- Great directory and cinematography. The whole journey through the ruins of Aperture's facilities is a seamless continuous cinematic experience.
- Most NPCs are unique. They are absolutely adorable, although they are considered to be villains.
- Awesome, unforgettable music. The credit's song is iconic.
- Animations are so smooth. The building feels alive.
- The story is basic but it is enough to support a puzzle game and enhance the atmosphere.
- One of the best co-op modes out there as it requires good collaboration and synchronization by both players. It is not just a supplement to the single player mode but drives the game to a whole new dimension. Co-op mode robots are so funny too.
- There are dozens of test champers created by the community that can extend the playtime for several extra hours.
- Many levels have more than one solution. Steam achievements also push you to complete some interesting small challenges.
- Some view angles that are created among portals are so surreal. The trip among vertical to horizontal portals (and vice versa) is pure magic.

The bad
- Too many loading screens. They are quick but there is literally one of them every five minutes.
- During the single player mode there are one or two less interesting parts, where nothing really happens. You walk in a straight line without solving a puzzle or learning something new about the story. They are not long, but I felt that they ruined that game's pace for a while.
- Boring design of your character (Chell), although you can see her only via some portals. Everything else in the game is so uniquely designed."

If you dislike many popular games such as Deceit, Unfortunate Spaceman, and Intruder, this is not the game for you. Do NOT play this game under any circumstance. Overall: 9.6/10"

25998,portals are fun
25999,One of the best games I've played! 10++++++++++
26000,"Portal three or ree
"
26001,"I used to play this on Xbox but I was too busy having fun with the portals than actually progressing in the game but I replayed it when I was older and I loved it. It has a good story, really fun gameplay and it has great 
humour. Would highly recommend!"
26002,"Portal 2, whilst a great game of it's own merit, is lesser than it's predecessor. Yes, the physics are impressive, the graphics are lovely even to this day, and Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is everything I could have ever desired in this lifetime, but the main issue I hold is, oddly enough, the gameplay. As opposed to the original's tightly designed test chambers and sole puzzle focus with comedy thrown in as a bonus, the sequel feels more so like Valve wanted to do more with the story, much to the game's detriment, I find. The strength of the original was that tight pacing - it had puzzles galore, not too hard but not too easy, some nice dark humour, and was of a perfect length. Conversely, Portal 2's campaign feels like it drags on somewhat, especially with the deficiency of actual puzzles in this puzzle game. Most of the game boils down to a sight-seeing tour that just so happens to be infrequently broken up by begrudgingly implemented puzzles. Yet, despite the lack of puzzles, as previously mentioned, the game does feel overly long and bloated. 

However, if you wish for a more concise, puzzle-focused experience, you may find what you seek in the Co-Op. The addition of another dolt and another two portals gives the puzzles that extra layer of depth, making them meatier and more head-scratching, and most crucially, extremely satisfying when you work them out. Despite this, it also lacks replayability - if you know the solutions but your partner doesn't, you'll just end up resenting each other, and if you both know the solutions, you'll get through much too quickly and easily. There is more life breathed into this part of the game via Workshop support. The most baffling addition to this mode, however, are the Team Fortress 2 styled cosmetics that Valve must have also realised were a terribly silly concept and never added any more of. Truly strange.

Overall, as a standalone product on it's own merits, Portal 2 is a great game that deserves and would typically be receiving my utmost praise, but it finds itself as a sequel to Portal; one of the best, tightest designed games to grace this mortal plane of existence. That is a tough act to follow - a nigh-impossible one. Portal 2 takes a good crack at it, but falls just a bit short to the point where I would prefer to replay Portal 1. That being said, if you haven't already, and you enjoyed Portal 1, do yourself a favour and play through Portal 2. Despite all of it's shortcomings over it's predecessor, it is still a phenomenal game, and one that simply must be played, if only to christen your Steam account."
26003,"I really like portal games, The puzzles are hard and sometimes easy! What makes portal so good is the puzzles and of course...the story! I do not dislike anything about portal! Portal is my fav game ever! I think portal 2 is better tho."
26004,"This game is amazing. It takes me a while to beat it but that might just be because I'm bad at puzzle games.

I love this game!"
26005,it was an amazing experience and I loved how it puzzled you and made you think outside the box
26006,"Very fun, very funny. The puzzles never gave me too much trouble, but that doesn't mean they weren't difficult, no there are some head-scratchers in here just they are not everywhere like in other puzzle games.

Though a classic, that is very fun. 

Co-op is the same as solo but with a friend which is fun."
26007,Yes
26008,awesome game 10/10 play the story if you have a chance
26009,"O.K., although why has it gone from ""Portal 2"" to ""Make Wheatley Cum Simulator""?"
26010,AWESOME. That's all that's needed to be said.
26011,pure insanity

literally nothing bad about it"
26013,got fat shamed by a robot
26014,the game is fun
26015,"Possibly one of the best games on Steam. The story, the graphics, the mechanics are absolutely stunning and wonderful. I totally recommend this game to everyone"
26016,The story and puzzles are amazing
26017,"Damn, it's good!"
26018,"One of my favorite games of all time. It's extremely funny and the puzzles aren't overly difficult but have definitely stumped me a few times. I really enjoyed this game and I hope that they make a 3rd one, in VR maybe?"
26019,fuck this game i hate it so much
26020,"good
"
26021,"The best game ever. Thanks yo everybody with good workshops, I love you!"
26022,"Portal 2 is a perfect sequel, with improvements to all aspects of gameplay and story. There's a few more characters with a great voice cast (J.K. Simmons and Joe Michaels in particular) and it's a lot funnier. There's even a co-op story mode with its own puzzles as well as some community-made challenges as well, so it has a lot more replayability."
26023,The gameplay gets boring after some time into the game
26024,"WHERE'S THAT DAMN CAKE I WAS PROMISED?!!
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S TURNED INTO A ROCK BY NOW I WANT IT."
26025,"If you somehow haven't already played this game, then just play it. This game on its own is captivating enough, a small but intricate and sweet story, combined with great and challenging puzzles. The single player of this game is a surreal experience, everything sweeps you off your feet in the end and I promise you will really feel immersed in its world. Now, with co-op, you are playing an entirely different game. Here you really get to build and elaborate on bonds you have with friends in such an interactive way, one moment you can be in tears of laughter from ruining each others plans and causing deaths to your partner, to complete silence as both your brains steam while you try and figure out what is supposed to come next. The co-op gets you stimulated mentally in every way possible, communication, understanding, and so much more. The workshop is a great PC addition because you can get lost in a mixture of amazing and horrible solo or co-op levels, and that is a game in and of itself. This is one of the only games I have ever played more than once, and on top of that I have played it on more than one platform. Playing this with people who haven't played before over and over and feeling like I'm experiencing something for the first time again. This is one of the only games I can call more than a game, it is an experience, and a memory. Play this if somehow you haven't already."

26053,"At the time of writing, I have played through Portal 2's single player story mode every day for the past 8 days. I did not do this to increase my hours on the game. I did not do this because i wanted a better understanding of the games inner workings or mechanics. I did this for one simple reason. This game is the most fun gaming experience i may have ever had. I previously played this game on XBOX 360 a year or so after release. I hadn't even turned 10 years old at the time so i couldn't appreciate just how solid this game truly is. I bought this game while it was on sale about a month ago as i am slowly chipping away at purchasing all Valve and Id Software games. In the month since i have dedicated over 50 hours of my time to the game, 85% of that time dedicated the incredibly well written and solidly designed story mode. The game also offers the much praised co-op mode (which admittedly i have not completed. My brother is usually busy doing other things and many of my other friends don't even have the game) and community made test chambers which i have also sunk some time into, alongside a simple and intuitive chamber builder. Overall, this game is one of, if not THE best game of the 2010's and i highly recommend it to gamers of any skill level."

26181,"Fun fact: Portal 2 is the highest rated game on Steam, and for good reason! This is quite easily one of the best games I have ever played, and I have played A LOT of games. If you haven't played Portal 2 yet, Pick it up for 2 bucks during a sale. You have no reason not to play this."
26182,"Portal 2 expands on the characters and world of Portal, with an almost staggering amount more cinematic flare than the original. Though in doing so, it sacrifices the elegant simplicity of the original. If you can accept that Portal 2 isn’t ‘trying’ to accomplish the same thing as Portal 1 and accept it for its narrative strengths, then you’ll have just as much fun as the original. In addition to the single player campaign, Portal 2 also possesses a co-op campaign that’s definitely worth playing if you can find someone willing. All that praise being said, I don’t feel as though Portal 2 is as much of a ‘must-play’ as Portal 1. If Portal 1 left you wanting more Portal-Puzzles, then it’ll deliver, but if you felt the ending of Portal 1 left you satisfied, then I don’t feel like anyone should force themselves through Portal 2 just for the sake of it."

26186,"Now this, THIS is how you do a video game sequel. Portal 2, much like it's predecessor, is a fantastic game despite it's age. Everything you could've possibly want more from the previous game is here and refined to perfection. More uses of the portal gun, more physic based puzzles, more lore, more characters, even better soundtrack, a co-op mode, what more do you want?  Portal 2 breaks free of the enclosed space of the original game's world and thrusts you into the enormous Aperture Laboratory allowing for an incredible journey that everyone should experience at least once. What more can be said except go play Portal 2, it's awesome, you KNOW it's awesome. 10/10"

26199,Good game with cool tricks. Playing with a friend is very fun i would recommend.
26200,epic
26201,good game thats all
26202,very good
26203,This game is super fun and well worth 10 dollars the game has way more levels than u think in solo. multiplayer is also very very fun. Plus you can build your own levels and test other peoples levels so technically theres infinite levels
26204,"This is a really good game, the story telling is amazing, the gameplay stands out massively and the puzzles are fair and most of the time they are solvable with a bit of thought while not being to complicated. The only downside to the almost perfect game is chapter 6 and 7, the open overworld makes it too complicated and forces you to look too far ahead. 

Except for that this is a solid game 9/10."
26205,"Great Classic!!

26271,"(I left this game on overnight, so the actual number of hours I've played is way less)

Portal 2 is a perfect sequel to arguably one of the most iconic games out there. It's an incredibly intuitive way to improve your puzzle-solving ability, and when that fails you, YouTube has your back. PLEASE try this game if you like challenging puzzles - the story, the puzzles, and the sheer addictiveness of this game are a steal at the low price it asks for."
26272,This game is so addicting trying to solve the puzzles. The characters are hilarious and wish i could get more of them. Would buy a portal 3 in a heartbeat
26273,Big pog

26289,It's Portal 2. Play it
26290,i dont neccesarily like it but it has a great story line and has a lot of puzzles to solve. also space core. (how do u spell neccesarily?)

26304,"This game is one of, if not the best game I've ever played. The story and the humour were amazing. Some passages of gameplay felt a little annoying, but overall, cube and button testing is what I would gladly do for living."
26305,yea it's pretty good
26306,Even after tons of times playing it over the years its amazing 100% worth playing.

26326,"Now you're thinking with portals~!

Edit: Spaaace!"
26327,one of my favorite games ! personally I think this series deserves a 3rd installment more than half-life.
26328,.
26329,"It's a perfect classic! Old, yet it hasn't aged a bit!"
26330,bery gud
26331,"Love that the humour aspects of the game are still here. Huge step up in the graphics department from the first game! The puzzles are more challenging now. I would love to have a Portal 3 please!

26339,"haha potato robot, blue robot called me fat tho :("
26340,good shit
26341,Got into gaming a few years ago when I met my husband. Early in our relationship he played through 1 and 2 while I watched to try and get me into gaming. Finally played and beat Portal and Portal 2. Officially one of my favorite games. The characters are wonderful. I was absolutely stumped and subsequently pissed at myself with many of the puzzles. Just wonderful.
26342,"Well, after 18 hours and a friend joining me I have officially beaten every level, including co-op and extras. Pretty good, would recommend if you're still on edge of buying it."
26343,"I like holes too
"
26344,One of the best games i've ever played
26345,"best gam,e"
26346,"loved the game, but she's mean, dont play when you're feeling bad about yourself lmao"
26347,"Every year I come back to this game, and laugh at the same amazing jokes.

26370,i love you glados
26371,"Great story, even better multiplayer. Would recommend to, anyone really. It was really cheap in the Steam Summer Sale. ($0.99 USD) and Source Engine makes the game even better. Would recommend to ANYONE who either played Garry's Mod or the first Portal game. Grab a friend and enjoy!"
26372,"good game with good humor
"
26373,"This is probably one of the best games ever made. The level design is subperb, the story telling is fantastic and it doesn't disturb the game itself and the mechanics it introduces to the Portal series are super fun to use and really fit in. Not to mention the co-op mode. Really good game, would recommend."

26381,h
26382,very engaging
26383,Yes
26384,"This game is one of the best that I played. Good audio, gameplay and everything. I'm recommending very much this game. POTATO GLADOS."
26385,"This game is simply fantastic - it's the first valve game I have played and it was brilliant, when i bought the game i had little knowledge of why it was so critically loved, I thought likely it is for the puzzles - which do a great job balancing difficulty and satisfaction, especially later on into the story, but unexpectedly what had me loving this game so much was it's unique characters, interesting story and even the intriguing larger sci-fi universe only explained through pictures and voice messages. 

So much about this game was fantastic but the stand out part of that for me was the humour - I'm very rarely laughing at video game dialogue and until this game I had seen very few previous attempts at humour in the medium. But this game truly nailed it - from the overhead announcers brilliant lines to the sarcastic comments from Glados, or the somewhat slapstick humour from Wheatly - just truly a joy to have unfold in-front of me, and I enjoyed every line.

The length of the game could be criticised by some but for me it was a refreshing change of pace from a traditional 20 hour campaign, in-fact in odd ways it reminds me of Titanfall 2's campaign both excellent stories that tell so much in a 7-10 hour experience and leaving you wanting more information on what would happen next, but still fulfilling enough so that they don't rely on an unlikely sequel to satisfy the story.

Now is where it is important to mention the downsides of the game but to be frank, I found almost none significant enough to harm the experience, some issues for others may have been more significant but personally, I found the game to still look relatively good, it's physics engine and puzzles still feel intuitive and the controls are logical and easy to understand.

Overall, the game is a wonderful experience and I implore anyone else to purchase this game, if your reading reviews trying to decide - just buy it - it is simply fantastic, and deserving of its title as a classic."
26386,very goood
26387,"good
"
26388,"gud , glados kinda gay tho .

26389,p good

26394,This game is absolutely amazing. The storyline and mechanics fit together so well. Definetly one of the very few must-have games.
26395,i like this game
26396,"Good game, enjoyed the physics puzzles and the ending is nice."
26397,I loved the first one and this one too. It is just a brilliant idea and the story line is awesome. I love the sarcastic robots and AI. One of the best logical games ever.
26398,"Love puzzles and basically countless maps, this is your game. Make sure to play Portal 1 first"
26399,"Even more fun puzzle game!

It's like Portal, but with a lot of new stuff, a new memorable and humorous character, and Co-op!"

26415,Do not plug that little idiot into MY mainframe!
26416,interesting and fun
26417,Great sequel to Portal.
26418,"i fucking love this game
"
26419,good
26420,What can I say.  This is the best game I've ever played!
26421,"Since I first played the Portal 2 singleplayer campaign about a month ago, I've been obsessed with this game and everything about it to the point where I've played it thrice: once to enjoy, once for the developer commentary, and once for achievements. The puzzles are incredibly well balanced and well paced (especially after playing Portal a few days prior)--I only truly felt stuck on the second Chamber 16 (which I later discovered had a commentary node explaining how the level was redesigned slightly because playtesters were more lost than I was on it). The story's writing is immaculate, featuring an incredible sense of humor and a very fun-to-follow plotline. The soundtrack is incredible, and I love the unique style each piece has. And this is all before mentioning the co-op campaign, which I'm certainly looking forward to finish with one of my friends.

I just love it. Portal 2 has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time, and it's let me craving more. More explanations for why Aperture Science followed the path it did (e.g. why the mainframe causes the central core to become a murderous megalomaniac). More puzzles with such finely tuned balance (tried the Portal: Reloaded mod and it is pure suffering in comparison to the learning curve in Portal 2). Just... more stuff to the point that I can't describe it. I haven't been able to find any other game that provides the unique puzzle solving, pacing, story, and overall experience Portal 2 provides, and I'm starving for more.

In short, (in my opinion) Portal 2 is one of the greatest games of all time--if not, THE greatest--and it's a title I'm proud to say it overwhelmingly deserves."
26422,"Great game, awesome puzzles and overall such a fun experience to play"
26423,"I already spoiled myself of parts of the story, but man even when playing it I'm surprised by the detail in the beautiful and absolutely massive environments. Never played a game with this much creativity really, bravo!

"
26424,Pog
26425,"Years later, its just as fun. One of the most perfect games I've played"
26426,good game
26427,this is the best puzzle game on the market no doubt but i recommend playing portal 1 so you can grasp the idea of this game 10/10 would buy again
26428,Amazing game
26429,"Great sequel to original game, expand the idea more than imaginable, makes me want a third game"
26430,this is a perfect example of singleplayer games aren't dead
26431,This is my top S tier game
26432,good
26433,ACTUALLY A GOOD GAME.
26434,VERY gud
26435,one of the greatest games of all time
26436,Best games ever. thought that the only fun games there were was roblox and crappy mobile games. Then I saw a fan animation and decided to check this game out. OH boy was the experience amazing. 10/10 graphics 10/10 ending 9/10 story.
26437,Yes
26438,potato
26439,Still haven't got my cake but it's probably mouldy now so...
26440,it a good game. it has some better things in it than the first one like the co-op and the build your own levels it took me a couple hours longer than the first one. i got the bundle and they were good
26441,timeless game
26442,you can (and should) piss off a british sphere by breaking 11 of his TV sets
26443,Fun game but some of the puzzles are frustrating. 10/10 would recommend.
26444,The best game for people who don't like shoot em up sort of game.
26445,Amazing puzzles not to hard but hard enough.
26446,Co-op in this is amazeballs.

26581,"This game is legitimately one of the most well put-together games I've ever played. I adore it. It's up there with the all-time greats for me, due to the depths that it takes with the atmosphere of the Labs, to just the game mechanics in general and how they upgrade throughout the game. The workshop levels are just the icing on the case (and I've never even beaten the multiplayer modes!)"
26582,"As a sequel to Portal, i have to say this is a great game, it gave me fond memories.
Portal 2 did a lot better than Portal 1, and I mean better here in every aspect: graphics, sound, effects, gameplay, etc. The game gives us a whole new action experience, although it has been out for a long time, it is not outdated.

Like I said this is a game that you have to experience once.

26725,DONT PLAY WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESNT LISTEN .
26726,do i even need to say anything? this game is like if someone took the challenging puzzles from the minds of valve shoved in with the story equivalent of undertale. this game is by far along with hl2 and tf2 one of best games i've ever had the honor of having in my steam library.
26727,it is the most coolest game i've ever seen!
26728,good game
26729,"If you liked portal 1 you are going to love this one too. It's a lot longer, but it gets much more difficult on certain levels (I spent over 30 minutes on one). It's pretty great."

26735,"God damn this game is good. The humor is amazing while not undercutting serious tones, the level design is absolutely phenomenal, the world building is wonderful, this game is so good I'm running out of ways to describe it. if you have ANY interest in games this is a must-have.

This game is no doubt one of the best games, period. you may not be into puzzle games, and neither was I, but this game is still one of the best gaming experiences even after over a decade since it's release, this is a great example of how good valve is at making video games, yet they still don't make any.

Sidenotes:
-I found the final boss to be more interesting and harder than the first game which is good because the final boss last game was way too easy.
-The underground old aperture labs section was probably my least favorite part, and it alone is better than most games I've played before
-I found my experience was much better when I didn't look up things to figure out stuff and instead just figured it out by myself."
26736,"Best game I've ever played. Love the Portal franchise, only if Valve could've counted to 3."
26737,A great puzzle game with a funny character that has a great twist at the begining and a potato and a must have for puzzle game fans
26738,"My kink with robots have substantially increased, thanks Valve."
26739,this is a good game if its on sale
26740,"/
"
26741,"This is the pinnacle of all story games. The conflict between wheatley, chell, and GLaDOS is so crazy. The puzzles make you feel like you're stumped, but right after they give you that ""aha!"" moment. A lot of people don't think this game is re-playable, but thats not nessisarily true. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and im sure it will be yours too."
26742,Amazing game to play with friends
26743,"Though this game is 10 years old, I still find out more and more about the game and things to do in it. At first you play the game for the singleplayer puzzles then when you get bored you find out there is a co-op so you have fun with other people. Then once you memorize all of the co-op puzzles you can show new players the ropes to becoming good at the game. After this most people quit because they get bored and have nothing else to do, however a small amount of players will attempt to learn how to speedrun which opens up a ton of new ways to play in both singleplayer and co-op. Part of the reason why I love this game so much is the fact that it being 10 years old opens up a ton of new things to do in the game such as learning new glitches and tricks or getting a faster time or even just finding other people who enjoy the speedrunning aswell and becoming friends. All of these things to do in such an old source game is why this game is in my top 5 games of all time list. I know this review is kind of late for this game but if you are just seeing this I hope this convinces you to buy the game or if you already have it, to try speedrunning and glitch hunting as that is an entire nother world of fun to be had in a game that most people are bored of by now."

26752,boring as heck i really wanna refund
26753,"While I've only ever played the Portal 2 Co-Op mode - I can confidently say this is one of the most exceptionally well crafted games ever made. Not only do I feel attached to the world and wanting to learn more, I feel closer with my good friend who (gifted this to me and) I played the co-op with. (Hi Koalas! Thank you!). From a mechanical, technical and design standpoint - this game is unmatched when it comes to problem solving and thinking ""outside the box"".

What a truly unique, precise, and challenging experience, all while staying comedic and full of levity. 

Truly exceptional and awe-inspiring. Some would say... [i] Enriching [/i]"
26754,"Big upgrade from the last game, it was a great decission to have two portals instead of one"

26768,"A timeless masterpiece with stunning singleplayer story and really good co-op mode. Bought in October 2020 for $3 (games are cheaper in Russia) and started to play it through after completing Portal. In November I tried co-op with a random teammate. It was fun. I decided to gift my friend a copy of Portal 2 (It was on sale for ~$1). We played together on New Year's Eve (31st December). I hope both I and my friend didn't have potato PCs. We had fun.

Portal 2 ran kinda slow on my [strike]PotatOS[/strike] potato PC, but still playable at ~25fps.
The graphics are amazing, even in 2021, when there are so many graphical technologies.

Buy this game on any sale. You wouldn't regret it."

You cant imagine how much you have to think before you figure out each test. Me and my friend finally finished the 3rd set of tests! And my god, it was very annoyingly difficult with all those turrets, bridges, colliding with teammate to land on the exit or you fail. ETC.!"

26796,"This game is a masterpiece and will always be one of my favorite games of all-time. It is so nostalgic to play this game after playing this game dozens of times on my 360. The only problem I've experienced was that the game kept crashing in developer commentary every time I pressed the node about the advanced aerial faith plates but besides that, I had an otherwise flawless experience with the PC version."
26797,good game

26825,good
26826,"Good old portal 2 - nothing to say, CO-OP is pog."
26827,Portal 2 is genuinly one of the greatest games I've ever played. There aren't many games I'll not only play a lot in one sitting but play the whole game in one sitting. It has fun dialog and a simple story but the atmosphere and gameplay are sooooo good. It also has some great multiplayer and workshop levels too. 10$ is a steal for this game.
26828,COOL GAME GET IT NOW OR I WILL EAT YOUR CABAGE
26829,its very good
26830,"Well done Valve i wish there was a portal 3, portal 1 and 2 masterpieces"

26854,Good
26855,good
26856,"Despite the game being centered around portals, which can be tedious after a while if not done well, I believe Portal 2 designs each level in a way that makes them unique, challenging, and entertaining. I also found the story engaging. Also, portals are cool. How can you say no to portals? 10/10, [spoiler]would send Wheatley to space again.[/spoiler]"
26857,The sequel we didn't know was coming but the perfect sequel
26858,this game is amazing 10/10

26860,amazing story lin poop eeeeeeeeeeeeee
26861,"I finally beat this game after having it for years. I remember getting stuck at one part for a long long time, but I eventually got past it. It's like Portal 1 but it expands on the gameplay and has a really fun co-op mode. It's a good time."
26862,A fun game and quite challenging at some points. Never a dull moment and the commentary is a-mazing. Made the game for me
26863,Pretty good innit.
26864,i bought this game again just for this account and it is still one of my favorite games ever
26865,"Good game
"
26866,Great game if you like physics based puzzles and messing with your friends in co-op
26867,My favorite game of all time. The single player story is so intriguing and I always come back to play it again.
26868,A classic game that is great. It's a very fun puzzle game. Koom approved
26869,"Great puzzles that are more about solving, rather than timing things just right, and so on.  I found a downside is an inability to use my ps4 controller with the game, as well as an inability to successfully mirror to a larger monitor.  However, these are issues with steam/valve/not-the-game.  The game itself is fantastic, with an interesting story that wants you to see what's next."
26870,the murder robots are pretty nice
26871,"Amazing game, it's baffling how this game was made in 2012 and in 2021 most games aren't  half as good as this masterpiece."
26872,An amazing game from an amazing company! After all of those years Portal is still on of my favorite games of all time and i highly recommend it! If you are a puzzle type player this is the game for you.
26873,AHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHHAH portla 2 good game!!11!!!!
26874,Possibly the best story game.
26875,has a potato 10/10
26876,"frustrating to the max when you get put in a room with no open world mechanics. everything is linear and not even appealing. just let me get to a hub area and play my game from there but NOPESAUCE!! do these menial tasks one by one until eternity. zero color diversity, everything feels cold and visually unappealing, not even made in a modern engine like ue4 so it can actually look half decent with proper shaders. i made a puzzle game in ue4 so it shouldn't be that hard for a multi million company to make one. skipped, wish i could refund"
26877,Good Good. Play with friend. Good.
26878,good
26879,The story is so good
26880,THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD BECAUSE THIS GAME STORY AND MUSIC IS VERY GOOD I LIKE END MUSIC

26914,This game is soo good. you make portals and go through them. the story is good. the only thing is that you should play portal 1 first for the story. both are good portal games and i dont know how i spent 19 hours playing portal but its amazing.

26967,"I edited this review.
Despite the fact that Valve blocked me in CS:GO for nothing, I will not write what a bad company Valve is.
I'll keep it short and simple - the game is great! The co-op and single player modes are very cool!"

26980,"An American, a German and a Russian got to a desert island. Once a bottle was washed up on the island, they opened it, and from there-a genie: - You have freed me, I will fulfill two of your wishes! - A bag of money and go home! - said the American and disappeared. - A mug of beer and go home! - said the German and was gone. - It was a good company, a box of vodka and everyone back! ""What's the matter?"" said the Russian."
26981,ROBOT FUNNY LOL
26982,"good game
is good
"
26983,"If the first Portal game was like some sort of a cake mix, Portal 2 would be the amazingly designed cake that would be made with it.

"
26984,"This might be one of my new favorite games so far.

Absolutely loved it. The story and game itself are waaaaay bigger than the original Portal. It might take a little bit more time to complete but it's totally worth diving in. The puzzles are great, the level design is amazing, the music and sound design is beautiful, the characters are full of personality and charm, the story is sick and full of mystery . Totally an amazing game.

"
26985,yes

27006,"The game is Beautiful in every way possible. The journey of adventure you are taken on that sees you travel through pipes and across moving terrain and puzzle obstacles is incredible.

One of the best games I will ever play. And had I have been younger when I played this initially, my jaw would have dropped even more so and I definitely would've had my mind-blown in so many ways. Everything about this experience is Breathtaking. Not just the absolute finale, but the last couple of hours are unbelievably well made. The puzzles made me happy to have had figured them out with only one task I had to look up because I didn't get it. And they get better as the story progresses.   

Robot characters' voice is annoying. British guy is very condescending. A bit too convincing.

They had another funny fun song in the end, but the operatic song before it is Golden and is the best thing in video games ever!"

27011,"Absolutely awesome game. As someone who actually plays very few games (I'm a poor college student; sue me), and completes even fewer, this game was super user-friendly. I'm always nervous that I'll get lost or not know where to go in these kinds of games but even I was able to follow the paths really easily. The humor was right up my alley, and the chambers are so much fun and are really a workout for your brain sometimes. Every time I died it was 100% my fault; the mechanics are really easy to get the hang of and it controls pretty well too. 10/10. I'm so excited to start my second playthrough."

27019,Best puzzle game
27020,I love manipulating and making all of my friends disappear just like my father did 18 years ago today.
27021,so trippy...i luv it
27022,"Lots of fun. Story is great, multiplayer is innovative."
27023,favorite game of mine. 10/10 ValVe make portal 3
27024,"Using a portal gun that shoots two portals that connect to each other, Portal 2 sees you completing a series of test chambers using your intelligence and critical thinking to solve puzzles. Portal 2 is one of the great classics of gaming, especially in the realm of puzzle games. Valve was able to create and expand on such a unique concept in this installment. The puzzles have been vastly improved from last game. The challenge ranges from easy stuff to mind-bending solutions that will sometimes leave you needing a walkthrough guide open to pass. From this, Valve has surely passed over the bar for satisfying, yet challenging puzzles. 

With its simple story, Portal 2 also hosts a few but memorable characters that basically define the Portal franchise. Its characters are able to drive the plot forward in a way that makes the plot deeper than you might think. Thus, the developers have created a story that is on par with their other story-based games and secured a place in gaming Hall of Fame. 

If you still itch for more Portal after the ending, there is also a co-op story mode to play with your friends. In addition, the Steam Workshop advertises many puzzles that players can try out for themselves. Some of these puzzles are leagues and leagues more difficult than the puzzles in the vanilla game, so good luck."
27025,Never met sucha brainless chimp partner like AlohaSexJoos. Back broke from all the weight carried. Other than that fun with a friend that knows how to do simple addition :)
27026,"If portal 1 is good, so is this!"

27041,Super fun co-op with good campaign. Def worth a buy and a must get when on sale.
27042,Extremely fun game! Also very challenging to figure out how to complete some of the test chambers. I have yet to complete single player because I'm stuck and can't figure out what to do. That's the fun! It's great to have a game that can take a long time to complete.

27046,played through the coop with my girlfriend and almost killed myself from frustration but yeah its good

27048,"Amazing game, puzzles take effort to figure out and feel super rewarding when you complete them.  The characters are great as well.  Especially companion cube."
27049,"My new favorite game. Only 38% of people have the campaign ending achievement!!!! If you don't play the single player why did you get it? 
Gamers don't have friends to play co-op with anyways."

27072,is portal 2 what did you expect
27073,"Good coop experience on top of the amazing story. If you have a buddy that also likes puzzle games I highly recommend this one because of how cheap it is, and how many hours you can pour into not only the base game, but the supported workshop levels made by fans."
27074,Makes your brain smorter
27075,"Good graphics, interesting mechanics, wonderful story, Portal 2 expands on what was introduced by the original Portal and brings the world of Portal to life. If you want to play a good puzzle platformer, grab your portal gun and your companion cube and start thinking with portals!"
27076,It's an extremely immersive game that is mainly puzzle based with an excellent storyline.  I just wish they would develop a 3rd one.  You guys created the monster now let's drill through and get feed the beast.
27077,"Very well made, surprisingly beautiful story"
27078,"it's very fun to do with a friend but it can get a bit anfuriating but it's worth all the time
"
27079,"This was one of the first games I ever played on Steam, and the first game from Valve. And dammit, it was an AMAZING first impression. The puzzles are inventive and challenging, and it has that immersive Valve storytelling. I found myself replaying the game over and over, even years after I originally finished it."
27080,hard but good
27081,"one of the most polished valve games to date in my opinion; if you really try to break the game, it will. great humor and workshop support. the jump from the ingame editor to hammer editor is a bit daunting, though."
27082,"I'm trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
And the machine is bleeding to death

27161,This is a great game to pass the time. The puzzle will get more in depth and challenge your problem solving skills the more you play the game. i have also spent a lot of my time screwing around with the portal mechanics because that is fun too. this game yields a unique concept and is very well executed.

27200,great game
27201,"this game is really good, i absolutely recommend it, tho if you get this make sure you play portal 1 before it.

i didnt play coop so im not gonna talk about it 

this game is really good, its filled with good jokes and the gameplay is amazing and fun. Story wise this is alot more in your face then portal 1 where it was more a mystery that you had to piece together. i prefer portal 1  because it leaves a bigger memory because it was such a mystery (if that makes sence). 

this game is longfer than portal 1 which i prefer, but i feel like it does get a little bit tedious especially at chapter 6 and 7. the puzzles are way harder which i prefer also. 

so my verdict is portal 1 is better and also onw of my favourite games of all time, but this game is also really fucking good so you should buy both"
27202,Very good
27203,portal good
27204,Im making a note here. Huge success.

And should you find yourself alone, something that will happen very often in the story, you can always go to enjoy the game with a friend in a distinct co-op campaign."

27210,"Go get it. Even if it doesn't strike your chord. No questions. I promise, you'll love it.

27217,"To be fair, I only bought this game only because of Chell; she's really cute. But this game is fun still- unless you're dumb like me being stuck on a stage, but fun."
27218,"What the shit Valve. I have tried nearly every workaround Ive found for over 2 hours. Support thus far has been brainless.
Im new to valves games and wanted to try Portal 2  (yes everything is legit no piracy).
Thats never going to happen.

Game crashes on start. No error codes, no persistent app hangs or windows, no message whatsoever.
Tried verify integrity and turned off in-game overlay
Tried restarting PC.
Tried msconfig-disable all background services-restart to no avail.
Tried compatibility.
Tried run as admin.
Tried big picture mode.
Tried restart and go offline then again back to online workaround.
Tried McAfee real time exception and turned off firewall.
Tried putting -dxlevel 90 in the launch options as well as -safe and -autoconfig
Tried launching from desktop shortcut, steam, and .exe in local files.
Tried moving the game folder (thru steams button) from F to C. It did produce a window with different behavior but still no launch.
Tried launching without MSI afterburner in background (caused constant crash with mudrunner for me dont ask how idk)
Tried sacrificing a lamb to the cult god Gaben.

Nothing has worked.
Steam up to date.
win10 PRO 64bit. Up to date.
ryzen 2600
16GB ram @3000
SSD
GTX1070 Driver is up to date.

RESOLVED!
MSI after burner and or riva tuner statics server were the cause. Even though I tried earlier in the beginning closing the app..
Story took me 8 hours to do but I loved it. cant tell this is a decade old. Man now I understand why so many people give praise to valve. except when it comes to counting."

27271,"One of the best puzzle games (and games in general) in principle! Ever since I was a kid, I loved the first part of the series, which only took me an hour or an hour and a half to complete. Here... Everything has been polished to the IDEAL: graphics that are still a joy to watch (the game is over 10 years old), interesting story, charismatic and memorable characters, balanced quests, awesome co-op - it's all here in Portal 2! There aren't many such legendary games coming out these days, but Valve just made me idolize this game! Like 👍"

27273,"This game is by far, one of the best games I have played in a long time. The graphics are amazing and the it is a very interesting puzzle game. It is a very humorous and fun strategy game. I did get stuck at some bits, it is a very hard game. But if you ask me, it is 100% worth your money."

Between the game itself, lore, achievements, cooperative testing, and community made mods, this game never gets old and I could, and have, played it for hours on end. Portal Two holds a special place in my heart, now and forever, and I think everyone should play it, even just once. Thank you Valve for making a game I will always love and never forget."

Tanto o modo singleplayer e o multiplayer são fenomenais
E a comunidade é incrível fazendo seus próprios mapas e alguns até fizeram sua ""DLC"" como o portal stories:mel que eu achei muito bom
(Eu sei que tem o portal reloaded, mas eu ainda não joguei ele, então não posso opinar)
E ainda tem mais mods que parecem ser dlc, como , Portal Revoluiton e Portal Community Edition"
27284,very cool game just got for the retarded
27285,"I played this years ago on the Xbox with one of my best friends. Being able to play it again brought back so many memories. Good and bad. 

It is a fun story driven puzzle adventure. Some puzzles more thought provoking than others. Plus a CO-OP mode. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun challenge."

27313,"I never wrote a review before because I couldn't say anything that hadn't already been said. Well, screw that. Portal 2 is well-written, well-designed, and well-acted. It is as close to perfect as a game can be. it's funny, it's tragic, it's suspenseful, it's engaging. The ending brings me to tears every time I play it. The whole thing is just so perfect."
27314,An experience that is hard to rival. Brilliantly designed like every other Valve game with just the right amount of humor to make you laugh thru most of the otherwise filler portions of the game. Can't recommend enough!
27315,the gel puzzles suck

27340,This is a brilliant game by Valve. It's fun and enjoyable. And i'd play it over and over again for a while. And this beats any game that has good graphics but terrible story lines because good graphics isn't always everything.

27366,Love this game. Highly recommend this masterpiece.
27367,"This game is fantastic, I enjoyed every aspect about this cube mover. My 9 year old self stayed up for hours at a time exploring every puzzle and finding out the in depth lore in story, not knowing portal 1 was a thing. I loved playing multiplayer with my friends and I still pop on every now and then to do such. 10/10 game"
27368,Puzzles in fps format. Cool story. Mind bending.
27369,"Great  puzzle game to play with friends, also it makes u feel kinda dumb."

this review is satire lol this game is great"
27375,british claptrap
27376,"nice game\
"
27377,"10/10, would recommend to anyone who loves any other Valve games. The puzzles are fun and introduce new mechanics to give it a fresh new feel from the original Portal, the comedy still holds up today, the multiplayer is incredibly fun, and the story is very well written for a game that was never supposed to get a sequel. Oh, and how could I forget? If you've played this game to death on console like I have, that's perfectly fine. You can play brand new community made tests that are much more challenging than the base game. Do yourself a favour and play it."
27378,Me and the turret became friends :)
27379,Is nice
27380,"A great classic unique Valve game that is easy to learn. 

Singleplayer:
The story is great, with a hilarious ending! Although I haven't played the first game, it was still easy to understand the story and it got me hooked. the levels were fairly simple, but on some tests I guarantee you will have a hard time. The ending credits has a brilliant song as well!

Co-op Multiplayer:
As of writing this, I have only played standard co-op and it is a blast! You will have a laugh every now and again, and your trust for one another will come to the test when one of you are tempted to drop one another into a bottomless pit XD. 

Overall, I don't find anything negative about this game, the story and ending was awesome, the gameplay was brilliant and unique, and the achievement hunting was fun and not too difficult. 

definintely a 10/10



"
27381,Nice game! Some levels are kinda hard.
27382,its portal..... do you live under a rock? buy it
27383,yes
27384,glados aint looking to bad if you get what I mean.
27385,Hehe cube go bounce
27386,this game is very poggers
27387,good
27388,"I don't need to tell you that Portal 2 is good. 

You already know."
27389,"Despite being a simple puzzle game, Portal 2 manages to deliver one of the best story I have ever seen in any game, along with some of the best and most well written characters and jokes."
27390,good gam
27391,i love it
27392,portals are in this game which is surprising considering the title of this game
27393,super fun... love the puzzles.. got it on sale!
27394,"gameplay: 10/10
writing: 10/10
art and audio design: 10/10

imo, portal 2 is the closest thing to the platonic ideal of a perfect video game.  it's also 2 dollars when it's on sale.  there is no reason not to play this game unless you hate quality and/or fun"
27395,rlly good game tbh
27396,best puzzle game
27397,shooting holes in the wall
27398,"My legs are broken and the orb robot lied. 

Had fun and will continue to play mods"
27399,"Ultimate video game classic!

The perfect blend between puzzle and platforming.

Hours of fun to be had between the main story, Co-op, the Perpetual Testing Initiative, and dozens of mods that pretty much reinvent the game."
27400,played through both the co-op and the singleplayer and is one of the best games I have played 11/10
27401,it's gud
27402,"This game features a balance between puzzle solving and a rich storyline, it's a major recommend from me!"
27403,"A ten year old game perhaps but this is an amazing platform/puzzle game. Stephen Merchant brings a lot of humour to proceedings and there's a lot of story going on throughout. As with Half Life, you think you're nearing the end of the game and then you find there's still loads of content remaining. J K Simmons has some great dialogue in the latter part of the game too.
On top of the excellent single player game there's also an innovative co-operative game to play too (actual co-op requiring genuine teamwork, not just two people playing through the game at the same time).
Some of the puzzles are quite tricky to figure out but there's a good sense of achievement when you finally work out the solutions, and as I managed to complete the co-op game with my 4 year old the challenges are obviously not entirely impossible.
The only negative I found was that you really need to know what you're doing with regards to setting up your controllers in the Steam settings (especially if, like me, you're using one PS4 controller and one Xbox One controller) but that's not really an issue with the game itself as it works perfectly once you've sorted that out.
This is a 10/10 game in my opinion."

I would give this game a 9.5/10"

27528,"I played Portal, and got stuck, it sucked. Luckily, I had this game just in case, and I could figure everything out, and it was okay that I didn't finish the first. It's one of the best examples of integrating story and gameplay, and told a damn good one as well. Play it to meet up again with your favorite homicidal Siri, and to prove that while British robots are charming, they're very dull."

Because I am dumb. I am legitimately fucking stupid. It took seven other people in a discord call to help me beat this game. So if you're smart, get it and get it now. If you're dumb, get it, and get some ibuprofen with it. But do get it. It's fun."

One of the best games I have ever played. If you want to do something worthwhile play this game."
27605,"Portal 2 has always been a game series that I held close to my heart. It was one of the very first games I had ever purchased on Steam.  I finally 100% the game in both Co-op and Story Mode after all of these years and I wish I had done it sooner. 

The physics of this game paired with the amazing comedy of the cast makes for a really fun time! I would recommend this game for any new Steam user and any Science lover!

27613,"Portal 2...

Where do I even begin with this one...

For starters, the 3D animation of portal is wonderful, sometimes in games 3D animation can be real hit or miss but in this case I say it was a constant hit! The game assets all look wonderful. The soundtrack is... alright... I mean it works perfectly for the game and really gives of the right vibes, but just in general it's not a OST I would go back and listen to often if at all.

Story gets its own section oh boy. The story was phenomenal! Having the Wheatley bait and switch at the start wasn't something I was expecting but I was pleasantly surprised with him. Taking over Aperture and trying to kill me while I run around with G.L.A.D.O.S in a potato solving puzzles was a'lot more fun than I was expecting.

The Co-op...
Now, this is where the game got good... I'll quickly talk about the story... It was alright I guess. I mean, It's co-op story so I wasn't really expecting much, it was fun to see G.L.A.D.O.S get scared of a bird tho... ANYWAY. I have played through the Co-op 3 times with different people and every time it was enjoyable, so many laughs and good memories thanks to this game so for that I will forever be thankful. Maybe this sais more about my friends than it does the game, but solving puzzles with them was so much fucking fun.

Overall a great game that I would definitely recommend!
Fun on it's own, Fun'er with friends!"
27614,It's a fun game
27615,"This game is nothing but amazing. Not only the graphics or the gameplay but the people who wrote the characters for Wheatley and GLaDOS deserve a raise. An AI with the intents on murdering humanity to develop a gun that can create wormholes while still having a good sense of humor while on the other hand we have a shy and extremely ""smart"" Wheatley. If you have the money buy it nothing else to say"
27616,portel :)
27617,Well i like this game like any another but i recomend if it is in sale but for a full price the story isnt so good its more less about jokes if it was maybe thriller which many mysteries the story could be good i recomend read the comic that give some answers (but the jokes are funny)
27618,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm prtl 2
27619,this game is challenging and the story is great
27620,"Absolute Masterpiece, highly recommended to play with friends. Worth every penny"
27621,really funny and nice game
27622,"just a great game, the puzzles get progressivly harder, theres a great story in the game, it's actually perfect, i do recommend playing the first game (Portal) before playing this one."
27623,"Best Game EVER

Pros
-Awesome Singleplayer Storyline
-Plenty Of Action 
-Incredible Game Mechanics
-REALLY FUN
-Game Never Ends
-WHEATLEY HAS THE BEST BRITISH ACCENT

Cons
-no
"
27624,"Portal 2 is a very cheap game for its category and has a beautiful writen story, and great puzzles. I highly recommend it for a good single player game."
27625,"Both games (Portal and Portal 2) are amazing. The humor and atmosphere suck you in, and hours have passed before you even notice it. One of my favourite games to come out, ever."
27626,ok
27627,"before this game i had a small dick, no girlfriend , no money and a bullshit life BUT now

nothing is changed but this game is good :D"
27628,"good game
"
27629,"This game is awesome! It has a great story, some super fun mechanics and some unique puzzles. The single player story mode for me was about 6-7 hours long, and the game has a really fun coop mode as well. It also has custom maps for both singleplayer & coop, so you'll be able to spend quite some time playing this game.

I definetely recommend you buy this game. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale for just 1,63 euros, but I think I would've bought it for full price if I knew how awesome this was!"
27630,the perfect sequel
27631,who
27632,"Everyone's already said it but, despite there being no options for turning off motion-blur, this game is an absolute masterpiece. If you don't care about the story of the games, just buy this one. There's nothing else to say about this work-of-art. It's just good. The puzzles are intriguing and they have elements from the first game. All around, just buy the game."
27633,silly game

27641,portal is good. get portal
27642,"Game holds ups very nicely for the fact that it's very old. The voicework, art, and overall tone is one of my favorites that explores a futuristic or dystopian type of game and story. 10/10, would r8 again for sure."
27643,Glados is kinda hot ngl would bang
27644,"Easily my favorite game of all time... I remember back when I had an ultra-crappy Windows XP PC and tried to use the shiftshader dll and other graphics hacks in order to make this game run on my computer. I was so enamored with simply being able to play this game. And then when I finally built my first computer, you can guess what the first thing I did was: set my desktop wallpaper to an Aperture Science one and play through Portal 2, and it did not disappoint. Wonderful story, memorable (and funny) characters, unique and challenging gameplay— this game is an instant classic and a must-play."
27645,wow

27655,love it so much
27656,"portal to the other side, die, find a new way, repeat"
27657,"Loved portal 1, which was great because it introduced such a fun and unique mechanic, but portal 2 takes it to the next level, improving on story telling, length, quality of puzzles and other obstacles and tools by adding things like bridges, lasers, and surface altering gels. Valve really knocked this one out of the park, massive improvement on portal 1."
27658,"portal 2 is a great game. the first time i ever played it was on the PS3, and although that was years ago, i still had such a great experience with it. at the time as well, i would easily get stuck on levels and eventually push myself to look up a tutorial. however, after revisiting it years later, i found that solving the puzzles on your own is incredibly satisfying. i am pleased to say that this game is absolutely well made, and playing it now, not only on a different platform, but also in an older (and frankly wiser) mindset, i had such a great time with it. and, there's the co-op of course, which is great to play with your friends. 10/10, i recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a game to play in 1-3 (approximately) sessions."
27659,"Great team building and mind stretching game, one of my favorite games ever."
27660,it's portal 2
27661,"duh, it's portal"

27671,"This game took everything from the first one and built it out to a proper-length game. Great puzzles, that same witty dialogue, fun soundtrack. It might not be the most profound thing ever, but it's great fun."
27672,why have u not played it yet?!?!?!
27673,"I bought this game because I play this game as kid with the pirate version. I am happy, now I bought this game because Portal 2 was so memerable to me as kid, and as adult and I can afford to buy this game. Truely amazing exprience"
27674,this game is very YES

27692,"One of the greatest games of all time. Completed originally on Playstation but going through it again on PC because, well why not?!"
27693,"If you are looking for a puzzle game mixed with an immersive story-line, look no further! 
Dive back into the world of Aperture Science with Chell and traverse the deep underground of the facility! 
The humor is sarcastic and silly, probably my favorite out of any game. 

The controls are easy to use, with keyboard or a plug-in controller. Each stage of the game gets progressively harder (as it should), and new mechanics are introduced into the game from the previous one. There is a level creator where you can publish and play other player's creations. There is also a co-op mode. I adore this game. Always have, always will. It is a must for puzzle lovers or people who enjoy post-apocalyptic/sci-fi stories."

27710,"Portal 2 brings the player (and Chell) back to Aperture Laboratories, and it’s one of the most enjoyable first-person puzzle adventures yet. The gameplay mechanics start from where they left off in the first Portal, but keep adding new elements and improving it gradually, Test Chamber after Test Chamber. Eventually, Chell has an arsenal of tricks worthy of the best heroes, and her journey is one that the player will want to continue playing until the end. The story behind the game is amazing and explains not only the past of Aperture Science, but also the relationship between its creator, Cave Johnson, and Half-Life’s Black Mesa. Exploring the Depths of Aperture is one of the most incredible experiences in videogaming as a whole, both narration-wise as gameplay-wise. Add to that the incredible voice talents, the always sharp background music and a flawless technical compartment, and you got a jaw-dropping game. What tops all of this, is the personality of Wheatley, GLaDOS and Cave Johnson… Portal 2 is a masterpiece. No further words needed."
27711,Still holds up as a great game to this day
27712,10.
27713,"A clever and beautiful game, filled with great characters, biting dialogue, and a great splash of cold war sci-fi, which I love. If you like puzzle games and haven't played this (or the first Portal) yet, it is a necessity."

Ya just gotta love the fact that Stephen Merchants talents have made their way past television into the video game spotlight in such a phenomenal way. It's just brilliant, bloody brilliant, isn't it.

27729,"Best game I've ever played. EVER.  And I have played thousands of game, whether it would be on steam, console, or other platforms.  I have always loved puzzle games, but this one takes the cake.  Except literally.  All of Valve's games have been blessed by Jesus himself, all a masterpiece with relating stories.  This one has a great story, great game play (6 hours if you marathon it) and the puzzles are hard, but do-able with great satisfaction awaiting you at the end.  Plus it's hilarious with the dark humor, I never thought I'd enjoy being insulted.  I loved this game so much I bought it for all my friends.  I suggest you do the same"
27730,"I've been looking at this game for  a while but decided to finally get it on the Steam sale and OMG, WHAT A GAME. Any game with Stephen Merchant in is a 10/10 for me, movies he's in, maybe not so much, but this game. Wow. Portal 3 please (I know its not going to happen, but we can dream I suppose)? 

MORE STEPHEN MERCHANT PLEASE!"

27749,"Portal 2 is the perfect example of a sequel done right. It not only takes everything good from the first game, but also improves its problems as well. The gameplay is mostly similar but adds in plenty of new mechanics to keep it fresh. The story and characters are much more polished and thought out. The atmosphere is very similar to the first game, but you spend more time behind the scenes of Aperture Laboratories which i found really interesting. My only complaint with the first game was that I felt it was too short, but this game definitely fixes that. In general, if you liked the first portal, you'll love this game."

27766,"Life was meaningless.

I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known. Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty. However after some time, my boss began acting strange. It started with the lying. Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous. I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.

Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal. My boss promised me cake when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it. I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence. I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.

Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me. He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work. Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube. At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it. We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.

I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death. My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing. My boss said something about ""symptoms of enrichment center testing"" and ""perceiving inanimate objects as alive"" but I paid no attention. I knew this was love. I knew this was real.

We continued on together for a while. The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me. I tried talking to it, but I received no response. My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute. I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.

This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death. After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship. But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.

""However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized. Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.""

I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator. I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks. I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.

My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong. ""While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.""

""You could never be a burden to me!"" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest. But then I remembered. Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me. I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake. And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...

I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor. I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator. It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it. Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames. Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat. I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty. But then I remember the Cake. And the Cube slipped from my hands.

""You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,"" said my boss. ""Congratulations.""

11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again."

27768,great game to pass the weekend and good fun with friends. this is my 4th time buying the game and beating it
27769,its good
27770,"This game...
OLD BUT GOLD.
I reccomend this game to anyone willing to test himself, testing is important. Really important.
You should also test Portal 1 prior to Portal 2, just to warm up a little and test if you are capable of testing tests.
This game will make you feel smart, a genius... 5 minutes later you wonder how it is possible that you can tie your shoes, since you are obviously a potato. A frustrated one; since we are speaking about potatoes: many tests will be done on potatoes.
The experience is great and i would really thx all the people behind the creation of this psychedelic trip.
Now that i feel tested enough, i think I'm going to do some test on some of the co-op levels and other options you can select. Because once you finish the single player adventure, you will want more testing. 
Oh! And you can even open portals here and there!

I suggest beginning by playing through the single player mode first, then get into the CO-OP, there is a lot of fun to be had in this game. I think anyone can complete this game no matter how dumb they are. It is made so well that the levels are hard to figure out for everyone but after some time you just figure it out. You can also go achievment hunting in this game, I haven't done it yet but I am thinking about doing it. Most of the achievments are from CO-OP.

27847,"do not buy this game cuz u cant play this game after 2 or 3 week , i cant launch this game any more and i did reinstalled it like two three time and it still did nothing."

27853,probably the best puzzle game i can think of along with its predecessor. this game really gets the mind going and is maybe the most healthy game ever ngl
27854,pretty poggers ngl
27855,one of the best games ive ever played 10/10
27856,The puzzles aren't super difficult but you don't just run right through them. The storyline is great and the physics are too. Overall it is a good game that is worth buying.
27857,Just play it. It’s really good you basically have to.
27858,GLaDOS
27859,"What a great game. I can see why it's a favourite of so many people and now I'm one of them.
The story really sells in this game, it's absolutely worth playing."

27869,it good
27870,Fun to play co-op with a friend. Recommended
27871,"What a classic! I'm about a decade late to the party, but fortunately for me, this game is a decade ahead of its time. I thoroughly enjoyed the single-player campaign, a perfect mix of comedy and challenge. If you're considering this purchase as part of the Summer Sale, do it! 

Only one con.. wheres the third?! and the fourth.. and the fifth.. come on Valve! I need it!"
27872,class
27873,"It's portal 2. Which is to say that it's portal, again.
There is less than nothing wrong with that. They had a good formula and they understood why it worked, which not every sequel manages. Solid game. It does isolation in a way I haven't experienced since, well. Portal. I'm sold. Even though being in old aperture makes me feel sick in a way that has nothing to do with the themes and everything to do with the fact that I just personally feel unsettled by how aware I am that it's all polygons. It really ads to the experience."
27874,Very good now buy
27875,Amazing.
27876,
27877,"I got Headache.

27878,good game

27892,"Pretty nice game.
The graphics are nice while still being easy to run and the story is very nice.
Overall the game is great, it has a few bugs here and there but if its on sale then GET it."
27893,"Great game and story. The music, atmosphere, setting... everything is fantastic! GLaDOS has great character too, and the voice lines are really fitting! :)"

27895,good story and good gameplay :)
27896,"Always great. Every time, every play through."
27897,love it!
27898,"I dont even know what to say, this was a major part of my childhood as i played on my XBOX 360, and wasted countless hours replaying sections over and over and over!

i honestly dont know what to say for this review, theres just so much

to sum it up in a sentance, thank you valve for this gem of software"
27899,"I'm not a veteran, I've only started playing near the start of 2021, But I am a big portal fan. I love everything about it, I've completed portal 1 and am making test chambers in portal 2. So I'd recommend this if you'd like to try something new, and exciting, The characters are lovable and relatable. I love portal."
27900,the bouncy coom is my favorite
27901,you can't make me
27902,"i like the song cara mia addio its ok
"
27903,its portal 2.

27906,:) i like the robot from the first game shes fun
27907,yes
27908,"[b]Summary:[/b]
[i]Portal 2[/i] is excellent! For everything that made [i]Portal[/i] good, [i]Portal 2[/i] improved upon, including once again fabulous writing and puzzles.

[b]My Experience:[/b]
[i]Portal 2[/i] is a truly awesome game. A highly polished sequel to [i]Portal[/i], it gave everything fans wanted - an improvement to not only design, puzzles, and story, but also to the programming, feel, and performance. It continues to exceed standards in writing and humor, and the puzzles are even better designed than its predecessor. Now, it also has co-op! Like every game, this one is not flawless. However, it lived up to expectations and continues to be fun and hold a community years later. 

[b]My Recommendation:[/b]
[i]Portal 2[/i] is a great game, and I highly recommend it. If you have any interest in puzzle games, I think this game is a must. Of course, I recommend the wait for a good sale."
27909,Now she only wants me gone...
27910,"My friend became emotionally distraught and mildly frustrated, tears were shed
"
27911,Good game
27912,"Just like the original, one of my favorites to date"
27913,"Amazing gameplay, great story, looks great for an older game"
27914,Replayability factor high and a campaign that is incredibly funny and engaging.
27915,its a good puzzle game with a nice story aspect
27916,".

27917,its a fun awesome game but play portal 1 ferst
27918,Yo

"
27920,9/10 loved the story and loved the co-op even more. Highly recommended.
27921,glados is in this one. 10/10
27922,"veri fun, little hard but i not totally supid so its fun
"
27923,لعبة لو بتلعبها معا خويك حلوه مره
27924,Fun puzzle game with a good sense of humor
27925,"GOOD GAME MUST BUY
Portal one was really fun and funny, so I thought ""Might as well get portal 2""
ITS REALLY FUN!
Im not going to spoil it so please do get this game!"
27926,Portal 2 is a masterpiece of a game i would def 10 out of 10 recommend. The game picks up where the first game left off so i would recommend if you do play the first game if you don't chances are you wont gets lots of the jokes or the lore. Sure the game is old but i think the game has aged very well The puzzles well complex are very satisfying. Portal 2 is a game to all ages that anyone could enjoy. Portal 2 feels like a very complete package which you should definitely pick up if you got some spare steam funds laying around
27927,Nothing much to say except this game is fantastic.
27928,"i hate everything about this, lucky my brain is humongous"
27929,"It's really worth it, especially when it's on sale"
27930,Great story and pretty relaxing to play even though the plot is intense
27931,Great Co-op game!
27932,Honestly still one of the funniest and coolest games out there
27933,"its a good game
"
27934,one of the best Co-op puzzle games ever. Please go play this with a friend you'll have allot of fun finding out how to maps play out
27935,7 hours of trolling and acting smart
27936,"Favorite game of all time. I find the atmosphere of the massive Aperture Science Enrichment Center to be insanely cool, I don't know why. Best game Valve has made so far easily."
27937,"I got this game for its well known puzzle mechanics but what really hooked me in was the story attached to both portal games. I was able to get most (around 80%) through the first game, and the second only supported and added to the story. If you are thinking you have to play the first to play this one you are wrong, even though i HIGHLY recommend that you play both in order to get the best experience."
27938,"very cool game, accidentally bought this one instead of the first one but its fine"
27939,"i like it
"
27940,Hahah huge brain and huge pp
27941,it good
27942,good
27943,theres this funny ball whos british lol
27944,"You can finish the solo game within 7 hours, I finished in 7 and a half because I got stumped twice and had to take a nap to reset my brain. This is one of my favorite games of all time, second to only the first Portal (though I'd honestly say they tie). 

This is a puzzle game! The eNTIRE GAME is puzzles. Escape room after escape room after escape room . So, before you buy it, keep that in mind. The puzzles are physics/logic-based, and if that's a puzzle-style you struggle with in video games, you might have a hard time with this one. This game is more story-heavy than the first, and also includes lore and a bit of origin of the facility and everyone's favorite psychopathic A.I., GLaDOS. All of the characters are lovable and a joy to play with.

I definitely recommend playing this game to fans of the first and new players as well—although playing the first game will give you a bit of context, you can play this sequel without having played the first one and still enjoy it."
27945,"I bought it for 7 bucks then went on sale for 1 dolar.
I felt sad cuz I pay more.
Played the game
No I wish I could give them even more money."
27946,play
27947,i like the part where you portal
27948,You're a horrible person.
27949,brilliant
27950,Very fun puzzle game
27951,I recomend this game to anyone who likes a good story with challenging gameplay 10/10.
27952,i love gamne first game gotten so good
27953,"A Masterpiece of a game that deserves to be played by everyone on Steam. Has amazing levels that expand on the concepts from Portal 1, a fantastic story that will have you heavily invested in what occurs in the game, characters that are a joy to be around the entire time, an OST that really makes you feel in the mood to complete these levels, and an ending that makes you feel that you just completed an epic. The only thing i feel that Portal 1 is better at than in the sequel is the feeling of loneliness and fear that persists in Aperture Science. As soon as i finished this game, I knew it would be cemented in as one of my favorites of all time. 10/10 game."
27954,"This is no ordinary puzzle game! You wake up in a crumbling world full of robots and strange rooms. The puzzles are awesome and mind-bending, and the characters are funny, even if they try to kill you every once in a while...

I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm getting close, and I can't wait to see how the game will end. (The story is cool!)"
27955,HOTY
27956,this game very good
27957,"This game still holds its place in the top ten best games even with todays standards. The graphics are still some of the best. Honestly this game is so cheap theres no point of not buying it
"
27958,Good game
27959,it is portal 2
27960,"Bought this years ago on the xbox, didnt play it too much. bought it on steam sale and played through it instantly. super fun game even in 2021

27964,why does no 3 come out
27965,its rll good
27966,Good fun puzzle game
27967,masterpiece
27968,"The game is absolutely amazing, with many easter eggs to find, great graphics (especially for a 2011 game, I was baffled to see it). The puzzles are fun to solve and make you think outside the box, however, they are not impossible, and are solvable, if you look around and use what you already know. I used a few walkthroughs in a few levels, but mainly because I am new to these types of games. The only thing that was meh to me was the story, as the first few and the last few chapters are full of new details and the middle was kind of filler, but I enjoyed every single chapter nonetheless. Greatly reccommend!"
27969,"so confusing, but i enjoy playing it"
27970,pretty good
27971,amazing game
27972,Lemons
27973,glados changed me
27974,"The game is simple, well made and has good story. Even though it’s short, it leaves you satisfied with each solved puzzle.
Love it, and Portal 1 of course."
27975,This game is the best.
27976,"gay
"
27977,very good but very dark humor
27978,this game is epic and worth buying
27979,"Story: by far the most interesting story of this past millennia and is one  of the most funniest games in human history
Gameplay: improves the mechanics of the original in fun and creative ways
Online mode: the most I have played in a video game in a long while
Overall: would recommend playing it"
27980,Indeed buy.
27981,e
27982,"I have always loved the first portal game, the story being easy and very captivating to understand, but ever since the addition of the sequel, the story makes no sense, my, and the rest of the gaming community's most important question being:
""Who is portal, and why is he so 2?"""
27983,"This game is long ( which matters a good deal for a mostly SP game that said it does have CO OP last time I checked ) it has a great soundtrack that I still listen to today and has simple mechanics and gameplay that are quite addictive.

I would pay 20.99$ for this game if I had too but I ( and everyone else ) dont."
27984,GIVE US PORTAL 3 VALVE

27987,Love it.
27988,"The cake is a lie

But really, almost every game made by valve I have had a good time with and would gladly play if a remaster came out. 

Portal 2 is a fun puzzle game that... well, uses portals. thats all i have to say"
27989,"One of the best games I've ever played
"
27990,"this game is literally perfect, i can't find a single fault from it. 
you WILL enjoy every second you sink into it."
27991,"I played the first one several years ago, it's hyponitizing!"
27992,"Excellent game, not only because of the gameplay like in the first opus, but here, the lore is incredible too. I strongly recommend it, valve made an awesome job for this game"
27993,adopt fattie
27994,good game
27995,haha funny wheatly actor comedian.
27996,good sequel
27997,"I highly suggest if you ever start out new on Steam I would say that both Portal games, TF2, Garry's Mod, Half-Life, and Counter Strike are the most iconic Steam games that you should pick up and are still fun in 2021!"
27998,"Annoyed an AI and survived, was fun, wouldn't do it irl"
27999,"Quite possibly the best game ever made. Only the first one rivals it, but this is bigger and longer and funnier and comes with more stuff."

28011,I realy recommend this game it is for people that like crazy puzzle story games :) Dialogs are amazing GLaDOS is GLaDos and Wheatley is just the best part of this game.... :D
28012,portal go swoosh
28013,"Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure"
28014,"Just finished the game. It was really fan to play! The puzzles were good. Some of them had me stuck for hours! The funny dialogs were a really nice touch and surely made the game interesting and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially to casual gamers like me, with not much experience in gaming and also the puzzle lovers!"
28015,Best way to ruin a friendship since Mario Party.
28016,yes
28017,"Sem dúvidas está entre as melhores sequências que eu já joguei. Portal 2 talvez seja a melhor conjugação entre qualidade, jogabilidade, inventividade e humor que eu vi em um videogame. Recomendo fortemente."
28018,brilliant test of your imagination and having to challenge the world around you without requiring the need for cat like reflexes.
28019,potraal 2
28020,better than portal 1

28024,cool game
28025,its good my guys
28026,"Impossible to dislike, just like Portal 1. It's the holy grail of PC puzzle games. Just make sure to play Portal 1 first so you aren't spoiled by this game's additions."
28027,I love this game. its just amazing. going from the amazing single player to the co-op and the stupid possibility's and last of all the fun level creator. This game is just a fun time and i greatly recommend it.
28028,Very beautiful game to play!
28029,There’s a good reason why this game is rated the highest on steam. The genius puzzles meshes with the fun gameplay and the incredible story goes hand in hand with the environments. I heard lots about this game before and was not disappointed after recently playing for the first time. Hands down one of my favorite games of all time.
28030,very good
28031,greatest game ever made
28032,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this INCREDIBLE game yet.

I bought this the day it came out after already playing and (obviously) loving the first Portal. There is nothing quite like Portal 2. Cave Johnson is a wonderful fictional (?) character. That is all I can really say.

It is a must play game!!!! As if you don't already know that....

We need more Portal, Valve....PLEASE!"

cant wait for portal 3!"
28108,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

28119,"Played this as a kid on the Xbox 360 back when i was like 13 and never payed attention to the dialog or never caught onto subtle jokes, was always focused on how to get past the next test. Id rush through some only to get stumped for days on the next. But coming back after 8 years i caught onto the jokes and dark humor, nostalgia really hit me at the end."
28120,"It is fun. It may be subjective, but the level of difficulty is not too difficult, neither was it easy. I takes a bit of thinking, but never really felt stuck and frustrated throughout the single player mode. It was an enjoyable game."

28137,"Absolutely fantastic, it is filled with whit and the levels are extremely clever and some of them are quite challenging. The characters and story are very well-written. There are community made maps if you're into that and a co-op mode if you have friends to play with. A well-rounded and amazing game. Worth every penny."
28138,p-body
28139,LEHMUNZ!
28140,portal
28141,Portal is a must-play if you're into puzzle.And It's more fun if you have friends to share your thinking process!
28142,dis game gud
28143,"If you enjoy games then this game will be right up your game!  This game is a game.  Now here's the thing... this game is a BIT of a game.  Now listen, I know that sounds bad, but this game is like the game of games, okay?  On the plus side though, the game has a lot of qualities you could probably call game-like.  Some might disagree with that I suppose, but I think it's very fair to call this a game, especially considering the sheer amount of game in this game.  Honestly, when you think about it, this game is really similar to a game in a lot of ways.  For example, it's a game, and I think that really says it all right there.  Let me explain... this game is like if a game and a game had a baby, and it's remarkably game.  Overall, I have very few problems with the game sections of this game, it's really just the small more game parts of the game that just irked me a little.  I'm sorry you had to hear it from me, but this is a game.  My sincerest apologies to anyone that didn't expect that this game would be such a game but that's just the hard truth.  I recommend this game for its game qualities and I think you should purchase this game.  Watch out for the secret Easter egg in level game.  SPOILER ALERT!!! It's a game."
28144,"This right here is another example of how a complete game can be released and be successful with no micro-transactions, add-on content or DLCs. Gameplay is really good, story is amazing, it'll make you chuckle in certain places with good humour and it looks great too considering it's 10 years old now. But it's the puzzles and level design I loved the most, also the community made maps are really worth checking out.

In short it's one of those rare good games out there that ought to be in everyone's library. Other money hungry corporate gaming companies should really take notes from this, because games like Portal 2 is how it's suppose to be done and what gaming was all about in the old days."
28145,"[b]Nobody reads the reviews for sure, so I'll say I'm gay[/b]"
28146,"If you like puzzles, thinking and trust your friends? This game is for you. Still fun to play in 2021."

28172,"I have very few hours in the game, but I really like it,"
28173,"Portal 2 is very long and very challenging at times. In this game you really have to think outside the box and be very observant. 
This game is very fun but in my opinion, Portal is better than Portal 2 just because of how long it took to beat; other than that. I do recommend you get this game after you beat portal."
28174,"how the hell do i get out of this one area



I have been stuck there for about a year"

28200,portal
28201,Very nice game
28202,"Fun game, though I didn't really like it as much as the first game. There were too many puzzles where I was really confused usually because the room was too big to clearly see where I was supposed to portal to, or where I needed to place gel. The amount of new mechanics were nice, and though I really had fun with the gel, the gel puzzles were probably the ones that took me the longest to figure out because of how few directions they gave with them, as well as how the gel can go almost anywhere. Still a great game regardless, the story was good, the test chambers parts were nice, and I had a great time."

I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.

This game takes everything the first game was good at and improves and adds upon it a lot. Gameplay-wise it is still one of the best puzzle games out there, but this time with a great story, great humour and incredible worldbuilding.
 
I would recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly interested in puzzle games."

28307,well well well...
28308,"This is a great game. It's a continuation of Portal, but it's so much better and longer. For the first half of the game, you go through test chambers, but this time, you're not alone. One of the personality cores, Wheatly, tags along, pretending to be your helpful companion, to take down GLaDOS. It works, but Wheatly becomes mad with power and takes over the facility, but not before putting GLaDOS' core into a potato battery. Anyway, for the second half of the game, you go through more test chambers, reunite with GLaDOS, now potatOS, go through even more test chambers, and defeat Wheatly before the facility explodes. There's also a brand new Co-Op mode with its own story, and a puzzle editor where you can create your own puzzles, upload them to the Steam Workshop, and play them with friends. Overall, this game offers many hours of fun, unique and challenging gameplay."

28456,".,."
28457,Amazing game outstanding lore. Just over all amazing
28458,was cool
28459,"I’m going to straight up say that puzzle games aren’t for everybody. There’s a chance that when you get this game that you will feel unsatisfied, but that wasn’t me. The story is great and you can still understand it even if you didn’t play the first game. The puzzles make you feel satisfied after you play through them, with the difficulty pacing very well. I assure you that there aren’t any puzzles that are too hard for some people. Don’t cheese the game by pulling up a guide. The main story mode doesn’t give give too much replay ability, but the fun doesn’t end there. The level builder is so much fun to play with and it’s always fun to test other people’s levels. All around it’s a great game and it’s up there with some of my favorite games."
28460,"I love this game! Some say I am ""addicted"". But I love that it's still a game that can help me to escape from reality while challenging my brain with puzzles! It's wonderful!"
28461,"I don't understand how you can make a game that's seems like just a surface level good time, yet is so complex and thought out.

Good though."
28462,tu mama
28463,Play Portal 1 first and definitely come back to this one afterwards. Both are amazing!
28464,"good game, make portals"
28465,"vedy good

28466,Best SCI-FI Adventure in my life.
28467,portal
28468,Gave me a headache
28469,hi
28470,"If you need a puzzle game with a great story, amazingly funny co-op, and endless amount of community maps, and generally good puzzles, this game is for you!

Besides the previously mentioned few ups of portal 2, I can definitely say that this is my favourite game of all time. So much so that I got and beat portal still alive on Xbox, and recently bought it again. After beating it on Xbox as well.

We may not get portal 3, but that doesn't mean whats already there isn't good enough. So buy it."
28471,"one of rthe most iconic, greatest puzzle games"
28472,"I've only played portal 2 for 8 hours yet i can't stop playing its so fun portal 2 innovates on the original so much but still has that portal 1 feel, where should i start... The single player campaign is absolutely amazing i love Wheatley, he is personally my favorite character in the game. The humor is right up my alley it's a nice mix of wittiness and unexpectedness to make me laugh anytime of the day.
       The co-op is just a really nice touch because it works with portal quite well, I've had a lot of fun with this mode and working with my friends and strangers.
    And finally the level editor, just WOW this is amazing to finally have i love making test chambers, i do wish there was more freedom like changing textures or more items other than that i think this mode is a blast.

          9/10 i really recommend portal 2."

28475,10/10
28476,one if not the best game ever
28477,"This game is a very good game. The puzzles will make you think quite vigourously. I really wish i had a portal gun in real life to everytime i saw a black person, SHOOT, and they are halfway across the earth. or, if i really wanted to, i could do humanity a great service and just send every black person to the moon."
28478,it was good fun.. till my friend turned into an idiot
28479,start thinking with portals i guess?
28480,"This game is fantastic and if you haven't played it yet what are you doing with your life!? 
Ok next part, any game devs reading this hear me out. A sequel to the portal game that takes place in the 80's, you are a homeless person that was paud 60 dollars to do a study at aperture. You start fighting the mantis men and then the whole facility starts falling apart and you get the portal gun and have to solve room puzzles to escape, while also killing more mantis men along the way, so you could have the portal gun and whatevet gun they gave you to kill mantis men. The end of the game would be us witnessing Caroline being downloaded into Glados and her coming online for the first time, squashing the mantis men and killing all extraneous personnel including us. I know lots of run on sentences, but the idea is there, i want zero compensation for this idea, someone please make this game!"
28481,Not too difficult but fun

28502,it doesnt have mario so its alright
28503,"The incredible follow up for the amazing original Portal. 

Portal 2 takes place at least a few decades after the events of the original game in the abandoned Aperture Science facility.... but it won't be abandoned for long.

In Portal 2 you get to explore the long abandoned old sections of the facility that were built in the 1960's.

Portal 2 is full of drama, puzzles and comedy, you won't regret it."
28504,"pretty good game, the story on single player is epic and the coop is also epic"

28521,is very fun
28522,"One of the best games Valve has ever made!

Physics-based puzzle game and for the most part is played at the your own pace - no hurry. The best part is the 2-person co-op mode which has community maps for endless challenges and fun."
28523,now you're thinking with portals.

It even has a extra co-op mode, which is a game itself, Glados and Wheatley are great, and the story is too. It has hard puzzles, but I never got frustrated at anything. It even has great mods, that are most of the time free! I would recommend this to everybody if I could. Great game 10/10 would probably play again."

The story offers (somewhat) closure to the mystery revolving around GLaDOS and Aperture Science origins, initially brought about by Portal 1's story, and has even linked Portal to the Half Life universe. Graphics is a huge improvement from Portal 1, effectively depicting the decaying status of the facility. Portal 2's ending is especially heart-wrenching and touching at the same time. As always, loving GLaDOS sing for the credits. Most importantly, Portal 2 offers co-op gameplay, together with a co-op campaign, which is more challenging and brain-teasing, and playing with another friend only makes it more enjoyable."

28631,funny robot
28632,"One of the best games out there. Totally recommended!

Absolutely love Glados' personality!

Those who leave negative reviews are mostly trolls and salty 5 year-olds who can't take a joke."

28634,"Much harder than portal 1, but still amazing 10/10."

28642,very good
28643,good cooperative game

28651,"portal 2 is the best game ever made, and no one can tell me otherwise. the writing is hilarious and the characters are very enjoyable to watch. the environment and atmosphere in this game is rivaled only by bioshock. the soundtrack perfectly matches the game, and the ambient noise, especially when down in old Aperture, is on point it really makes the game feel lived in and helps portray a sense of loneliness and desolation to the player. the mystery surrounding the early days of Aperture is truly amazing, and can be uncovered by looking at the environment around you and thinking a little more deeply about some of the pre-recorded messages left for you by Aperture's late founder, Cave Johnson. this is a much better way of showing the history than just outright telling you. there are also many easter eggs in this game, and many are hilarious to longtime valve fans, but will go right over the head of a less involved fan. overall a 10/10 play and to anyone thinking about getting the game, just get it, its 5 dollars and an amazing game."
28652,why so ez?
28653,"you have to be big brain to be good at this game.
thats why im so good."
28654,good
28655,it is a fun but difficult puzzle game

28662,"Great game, fun puzzles and good story."

28664,"Great Challenging Game and very rewarding, it takes what the old game had and quintuple it and its one of the best sequal on a game and its super cheap just buy it!"

28673,This game is so good the only way to not like this is to not like puzzles or really not liking it when GLaDOS insults you.
28674,nice
28675,Just as great as the original. Lots of fun and unique puzzles.
28676,"Its good but...... THERES SO MANY CO-OP ACHIEVEMENTS I DON""T HAVE ANY FRIENDS"

28682,portals are pog
28683,game extremely good
28684,fun
28685,"good game but can be frustrating at some times xD 

also its not a very long game i completed it within less than a day pretty much"
28686,its portal 2. need i say more
28687,"It's Portal. What do you expect? Note: this review is based on the singleplayer alone.

Pros:
- the writing is every bit as sharp as you'd expect, and in comparison to the original there's a lot more of it this time, and every bit of it is a delight
- the voice actors (all 3 of them) do an absolutely fantastic job, but the highlight here is still J.K. Simmons
- the puzzles stay consistent in quality throughout, and it never feels like you're treading familiar ground
- there are new additional elements to the puzzles that add entire new mind-bending dimensions to the game
- the physics setpieces still manage to look impressive a decade later
- the great art direction makes the game look great to this day, despite certain sections looking a lot more dated than others
- there is actually a story this time, with more concrete stakes and a lot more worldbuilding alongside it, all peppered with delightful pitch-black humor

Cons:

- some transition sections are incredibly linear, and go on maybe a bit too long
- some sections in the middle part of the game have huge amounts of empty space, leading to the player searching mindlessly for possible hidden elements. I was stuck in one puzzle for about an hour because the game didn't explain one mechanic (the carrying of momentum when jumping from propulstion gel) properly
- the final encounter feels maybe a tad too easy for a 7-8 hour game
- the ending song is great, but can't hold a candle to the bittersweet charm of the classic ""Still Alive""

A few blemishes aside, this is every bit as good as the original Portal, and even better in certain respects. Do yourself a favor and play it"
28688,"Great game, I'd put it on a list of 100 must play games."
28689,one of the best games ever 10 out of 10
28690,yes
28691,thia game sucks asssss!!!!
28692,"very good
"
28693,ME LIKE
28694,One of the storys I've played!
28695,GOOD GAME
28696,unlike portal 1 portal 2 has tons of humor story then the last game and tons of secrets  so i would recconmend buying it
28697,"Spoiler free: this review contains no spoilers. 
Played 30 mins of story and 30mins of coop. A portal 2 expert told me story takes about 2 hours to complete, and coop takes about 50mins with his expert team. Hence def seems a bit short. Haven't looked at the workshops tho maybe more stuff t here? The puzzles are extremely fun, so getting it for 2 dollars is definitely worth it.

Edit: It took me 8 hours to complete single player. After another 2.5 hours I completed chapter 3 of coop mode. Hence the puzzles definitely took longer than planned. Note that it only took me 2 hours to complete portal 1, hence P2 definitely takes more time and thinking to get through. Especially in some of the bigger maps. I strongly recommend this game to anyone that loves puzzle solving or just love a good coop game."
28698,Clasic
28699,"The first portal game was a masterpiece but I felt dissatisfied with it, the story was great, but something just, wasn't right...

Then came portal 2, it filled all the gaps and is amazing, I have an opinion about this game that many others do to, it is one of the best games in gaming history, I love it, just a little disappointed there won't be a third one."
28700,"love how the story line contains amusing lines that match what your currently doing in that part of the story, fun, and runs really well"
28701,"Excellent, Very engaging and you could play for hours if the game was infinate."
28702,"For a puzzle game, Portal 2 is really good and incorporates physics well. It also has an engaging story. You should probably play Portal 1 first, though."
28703,its a fun game with different puzzles to solve and a quite interesting storyline
28704,GOOD
28705,"Jogo muito bom, jogabilidade ótima e mecânicas bem diferenciadas."
28706,"Honestly my favourite game, fun puzzles, great and extremely funny dialogue and generally interesting story with excellent atmosphere and the game can run on a potato ;)"
28707,is good
28708,its amazin
28709,"Its portal, you know what your getting just watch a video or something"
28710,"good
"
28711,good the  game
28712,It takes time to learn the mechanism but after you get used to the gameplay it is a very fun game
28713,"Pretty Great Game. You May Get Stuck At Some Points, So Try Not To Get Annoyed. The Game Takes Some Time To Get Through, But Its Worth It"
28714,"""I hope we can put our differences behind us, for science...you monster.""  - GLaDOS

Portal 2 isn't just the funniest game you will ever play, but it's also focused on telling story with many twists, which you discover in your attempt to escape the ruins. New mechanics are introduced in a smart way, environment can be manipulated with portal gun.
As much as sometimes game will be annoying while you uncover the dirty little secrets of Aperture's past, it will also be rewarding after each level you will pass. Puzzled rooms will get more complicated with each level passed."
28715,noice
28716,You can make portals again and I think that's pretty rad.
28717,"best'
"
28718,so good
28719,"I got the Xbox 360 version of Portal 2 in a desk-sale in 5th grade. I fell in love with the game, despite not really knowing anything about valve. I got the PC version years later (8th Grade) and it has so much more to offer than the Xbox version, especially in multiplayer. If you don't have this game in your steam library, buy it for the $10 price, it is wroth it! At least buy it on sale for usually $2. If you haven't played this game in a while I suggest you replay it. Thank you for reading! Oh also there are tons of great mods!"
28720,ye gud
28721,the potato robit is hot
28722,pretty good

28766,One of the best experiences Ive ever had in gaming history. I would play it again again and again. There is no stopping of fun. Its the most intense puzzle game ive played
28767,haha funny lemonade man go brrrr

Community maps are also fun to play as well (be aware that some of those are very easy to complete...)"
28769,"Did you know that head size directly correlates to intelligence? People have always been telling me that I have a large head. I think I might have an even larger brain. Sometimes when I play this game my head hurts because my brain feels like it's going to break out of my skull from how large it is. This game is very intellectually stimulating and makes you ruminate on all the possibilities in solving the game's manifold puzzles.


Also shout out to my RETARD friend for not telling me that sv_cheats disables the achievement for completing coop like I just wanna noclip around for not reason god damn"

28786,"portal 1 and 2 are great puzzle games with a unique twist on the fps genre. i completed portal 1 in about 2 hours, so i would recommend this game more as it has more meat on its bones. the game is great and would highly recommend

28789,"Fun to test your brain to such puzzles like shooting portals, moving boxes, etc. And also you can make levels and share them online, which I think is a great idea. Very addicting with the Level Editor! :D

This is a perfect game, with extremely good gameplay, good puzzles, amazing story and good replay value. On sale, this game can be less than a DOLLAR, I paid full price for it when I played on Xbox 360, but when I switched I got it for a single dollar.

28909,"Honestly could go down as one of the best games ever made. The theming of this game is incredible, with a portion of it being these minimalist and somewhat liminal testing rooms, and the other portion being overgrown and decrepit. The writing for this game is brilliant, something I think Valve does really well.

With that said, if you haven't given any of the workshop maps a try, you are REALLY missing out. The community for Valve's games usually put them to shame with what they're capable of doing with the assets in this game."
28910,pog
28911,I have played this game more times than I can count; and you should too.
28912,"it's British. That robot is british... The small, spherical, unusually and scarily talkative robot, is also british on top of that."
28913,"One of the best games of all time. It combines some of the cleverest, most innovative puzzles in all of video games. They are difficult but they never feel quite unsolvable, I never had to look up a walkthrough or anything. After I complete one I always feel like, ""Wow, I must be smart!"" 
The gameplay is great and all, but what cements it as one of the best games of all time for me is the writing. No game has such great characters, who are all written and voice acted so perfectly. It's just hilarious. No game can make me laugh like Portal 2 does. 
Graphically, it's aged well. Obviously, it's from 2011, so it's not going to look as good as some AAA games today, but it holds up good enough today, way better than the first Portal. 
VERDICT: This game just has to be experienced. If for some reason you haven't already played it, play it now."
28914,Favorite Valve game easily.
28915,Love this game. Glados is so vengeful.
28916,One of my all time favorite games.
28917,amazing
28918,"Is it better than Portal, the best puzzle game ever made? Yes. Yes it is. Portal 2 takes everything that Portal got right, and makes it better. Witty AI character? Have two. Two hour story? This one takes eight. All sorts of clever test chambers, new puzzle types (light bridges, gels, and faith plates, amongst other things,) and a super engaging story make Portal 2 one of the best games ever made."
28919,"Do you like potatoes? Of course you do. Imagine a world where Valve doesn't make Half Life 3 and makes other games instead. It's kind of like that except it is just like that. Oh and you can play as Gordon Freeman.  Well no you can't, but you can dress up as Gordon Freeman and play the game. It's terrific!!

Or you can dress up as a potato. Ya. You can dress up as a potato and play the game. Incredible game design. Don't miss it!

Instant Classic!

Oh and if your PC is a potato, it will most likely be able to play this game.  And it will still be pretty.  Maybe.

All hail potatoes!!!"
28920,One of the wittiest and enjoyable games ever. Still holds up 10 years later.
28921,"Longer, funnier, more creative and with an ending that made my heart cry. Also online coop mode~"

28932,"Love it, just do."
28933,the b1tch robot wasnt dead
28934,A great game with great destruction and wonderful gameplay and story. definitely worth it
28935,"I originally played this game on the PS3 and I don’t know how many times I played it (over and over again) but playing this game years later on the PC was the closest thing I’ll ever have to re-experiencing it for the first time again save from wiping my own memory just for that experience. 

An absolute classic, one of the best games ever made."
28936,abnsxz
28937,"This game is amazing. I love the puzzles, love the characters, love the story, I think the whole thing is nice and it does a few callbacks to Portal 1 in a few Easter Eggs and mentions. I can say this definitely feels like a nice successor to Portal 1, and it feels like practically all ages could play it too. It's also nice how it fills in the gaps of missing lore that you didn't completely get in Portal 1. It's all relatively nice."
28938,better than sex :)
28939,awsome
28940,fun
28941,"funny ball guy does a thing and stuff happens

10/10 cool story and hard puzzles"
28942,"Very fun. I kinda wanna know what comes next after we escape though. Maybe we need to solve puzzles/parkour and things like the tests we were doing before. And maybe we are solving them to try to reach a civilisation or some other humans or something. I don't know. I think that could be cool. And maybe we will befriend another robot and learn some of our backstory along the way. There's a lot of potential for a Portal 3 is all I'm sayin. Over all it was very very fun. After a while though, near the end some of the levels got a little annoying, kind of monotonous. Still fun though. HIGHLY recommend if you enjoy puzzles and figuring stuff out! (Also, I miss wheatley but I know he ain't comin back anytime soon. Or is he? I don't know, I'm just a simple tester.)"
28943,fun fps puzzle game (with goo)
28944,I liked how the surroundings and funny things in this game as well as the co-op testing in this game but I didn't like how some of the puzzles are hard in this game but thankfully I was smart enough to get through them.
28945,"surprised me with its entertainment value.  not my usual kind of game but i play it with someone and the coop play is challenging because it makes you think in a way you don't normally think.  worth trying if you and a friend are looking for something new.
"
28946,"This game has fun puzzle mechanics, and is funny. I mean it's not that complicated to explain, its a fun game."

28960,10/10
28961,"I like puzzle games. They are generally small games with colorful graphics, which offer puzzles to solve or traps to deconstruct to reach the next level, and they make me spend pleasant moments during the hours I spend in public transport.
Portal 2 (preceded by Portal, or even alone) is of a completely different dimension. First of all, we are immersed in the action: we no longer drag / open / pair virtual elements, we find ourselves really represented by this female character, as in a role-playing game, and it is she who must open passages, avoid turret fire, advance, progress, take lifts or escape... This makes the experience all the more fun as you don't feel like playing a puzzle game. This is very close from an adventure game, and even players who are not at all attracted by puzzles may find this game very interesting. The background story is engaging, very imaginative, and there are ""Easter eggs"" and nods to other Valve games (Half Life). For puzzle enthusiasts, the editor allows you to create and submit puzzles to the community, providing you with as much material as you want to continue ""testing"" long time after you finished the game. And of course, the cooperative mode allows two people to test their brain together, the hardest part being to decide who will be represented by which robot... In short, Portal 2 is an investment you can't regret.
Positive points: the rich story, the tests (more complex than in Portal 1), the long break in the old test rooms, the unexpected twists, the length of the game, the very realistic 3D graphics, the coop mode, the editor...
Negative points: Uh..."
28962,within the day i got it instantly became one of my favourite games
28963,Very good game
28964,The best game of all games that exist and I can give this an Infinite/10

The highest rated game on Steam, developed by Valve, and a video game sequel [i](which tend to be damn good, look at Uncharted 2, Bayonetta 2, Half-Life 2, and TF2, and ignore DMC 2)[/i].

29035,incredibly interesting game with many great and challenging puzzles
29036,"Very good overall, just like the first game. The puzzles are good from start to finish, and the newer things in the second half keep things fresh. There's an actual story this time around, and while I don't think that was something lacking in the first Portal, it's definitely a positive addition. The dry, sarcastic, and sometimes bad humour keeps it from getting too serious and just works. My one complaint is the same that I had with the first Portal. You go from having very defined progression to being completely in the dark, and in Portal 2 that cycle repeats. I don't think you need to know exactly how far along you are in a game at all times, but it's somewhat annoying when you think you're almost done and still have half the game left. It's definitely not a dealbreaker; just a little annoyance worth mentioning."
29037,This is actually one of the greatest video games of all time and if you haven't played it you are poopoo head
29038,VERY BAD AT THIS GAME!!! got bullied last time i played however please play with me if you go at a snail's pace... :steamsad:

It’s puzzles are not easy sometimes, and will require you to stop and think thoroughly through which I think is great. The back story is interesting, and there are splats of humor here and there which really tie the package nicely. Finalizing this up, for people who are into puzzle/mystery types of games, I 99.9% recommend this game."

29079,"Holy macaroni sticks this game is ssssssssssssssssooooooooooo cool and funny though the replay ability is lacking I still go back and play it just cause the dialog is so good and funny everything make sense the motivations of each character and why they do what they do and my god is it funny nearly every time weatly is on scene it cracks me up the times when he don't are when he is not making a joke and every joke lands for me the plot is go and it has a scene were the they tell you why the main antagonist is testing you and the ending is brilliant if you going in blind then you are in for a treat. I think that no I know I would pay $100 for this game holy cow. The sound track is the bomb I listen to the credits song and the quire song a lot. I recommend that you search it up on YouTube and the way they implement them is so cool. This game is one of the best games I have ever plaid it is a godly game and valve like most of there game gave us a masterpiece. After I stop playing this game I dreamed of a game better but nothing was there. But this game is a little challenging but once you figured it out you feel like a 200 IQ gamer. But they did just spawned the a gel blob and I saw it so 0/10 NEVER PLAYING AGAIN. I'm kidding though it break my immersion I quickly regained it. Here is a list of what I'd rather be doing
.......

I would give this game a 10/10.
it is the holy game that you play in haven"

Either way, excellent game! Enjoyable story, great gameplay that is legitimately challenging, great music and sound design, great sense of humor, and Ellen McLain as GLaDOS. What more could you ask for, besides a protagonist with a personality beyond ""determined""?
Very glad I decided to buy the game for myself."

Also an amazing thing is, when you get this it's like getting three games in one because you can finish this and then there are two excellent free single-player mods available here on steam - Portal Stories Mel and Portal Reloaded."
29117,"Good fun and some co-op puzzle solving quality time. 

On the downside it gets a bit boring after awhile. Had to grind through quite a few levels with my girlfriend to get to the end."

Do it from scratch, spare no expense, and never cut corners well thats a corner cutting machine we obviously cut them there, point is we have always done things my father did and his father before him and his father before him and his father before him and we are almost bankrupt."

29156,Honestly love the story to this series. The multiplayer portions are awesome. When you get finished and still want more look towards the community for additional content.
29157,"Portal 2 is a masterpiece of not only the world of gaming, but is also a masterpiece of the world of storytelling. As you make your way through the test chambers, you get a further look into the backstory of Aperature. The funny moments (which are luckily funny instead of 'ah yes joke for kids, now lets get some money') do not get in the way of the serious moments, which you'll have to play this game to see. If you have ever played Undertale by Toby Fox, you will know just how special it can be if you have characters that feel real, instead of your common Skyrim NPC. Valve accomplishes this in what seems to be effortless, enhancing the story even further.

Spoiler ahead, watch out if you haven't played this game.






At the final battle when we see Wheatley mad with power, we make the decision to shoot a portal into the moon, sucking his core into the vacuum of space. I can't speak for everyone else, but for me this felt like the death of a real being. Chell finally escapes, and GLAdoS is left to test with Atlas and P-body for the rest of time. The ending is bittersweet, considering there will probably never be a Portal 3 game in the future, but I can safely say that this is one of the only games that really had an impact on me as a person. Valve truly outdid themselves with this one. Bravo."

29188,"probably a perfect sequel to a game i'm nostalgic for. you can really tell that they put a lot of work into this game, especially looking back on the first game. the story bits are amazing, the graphics are incredible, the intro, seeing so much of the facility and getting an idea of *just how big* the facility is. i just wish there was more to learn."
29189,Its fun and creative the big plot twist and Old Aperture and back were my favorite parts!
29190,"This game is challenging enough to be compelling without being frustrating. The story moves you along with great pacing and ties in perfectly with the puzzle elements. The visuals are fantastic, the characters interesting, there are twists and surprises, and mysteries to solve. Basically I can't praise this game enough. I like it so much I've played it through multiple times and enjoyed it just as much the last time as the first."

29200,"this is one of the best games ever created. The voice acting, the story all of it is so good. So if you've got a spare 10 dollars in your pocket, id recommend buying this one. Play portal 1 as well. but if you don't want to I'll summarize it: you go through tests with a portal gun and promised cake upon completion, however, at the end you are not rewarded with cake but death. You escape said death and go on to destroy glados. This is a continutation of that game obviously. wheatley is my favorite video game character ever and voiced by my favorite comedian. You can even create your own chambers! It is worth the 10 dollars"
29201,"This game blows the original Portal out of the water, there's tons of new game mechanics and characters as well as new areas. I love the sheer amount of detail that's in each area. The voice acting is amazing as well, my personal favorite actor in this game has got to be J.K. Simmons who voices Cave Johnson, the music is also great because it kind of blends in with the level and changes if you do something like step on an aerial faith plate or stand under a hard light bridge. There's also a co-op mode that allows you to play with a friend (or just screw with them). A definite must play for any puzzle game enthusiast."

29241,"portal 2 is an amazing game that is worth the $10 that it costs. it has 9 chapters, packed with levels, and a great story. it even has lore! i highly suggest this game, and if you have $10, buy it!"
29242,yes
29243,"Incredibly well designed and engaging. One of the most memorable experiences I've had playing [i]any[/i] game would have had to be in Portal 2. However, with that said, I do think that there are both positives and negatives in this game. 

First off, I don't think that it's the best game for speedrunning (because of how much dialogue is in the game), which is why mods have been made for that very purpose, however even though that was not Valve's initial concept, it still has that capability. The integration between the hl2 universe and the portal universe, (which was due to not having a large enough design team back when Portal 1 was still in development) actually played a very interesting role in this game, and the easter eggs that you find along the way accomidate for the players that find the Lore more interesting than the game and are just in it for the storyline. The puzzles aren't too challenging, however I will say there is copious amounts of dialogue in the game. So much so, that you can acquire many achievements for just sticking around long enough to hear it. 

I'd like to conclude by saying that this game is very well designed in all fields. Not only in the programming itself but in the music soundtrack, the Lore that was put in, as well as the physical characters and their voice lines. This game has something for everyone, whether you're a fan of Wheatly or more a fan of Glados, you still get equal amounts of exposure to both characters, leaving you with a very memorable experience."
29244,i like it
29245,a
29246,"The first game was a classic. This sequel is a very great change from that. Not necessarily in a bad, nor a good way. The developers have fully taken advantage of today's tools and somehow made this still feel surprisingly Portal'y. The puzzles are harder, the story reveals itself cleverly in them and the game itself is 6 times longer. The first game was about 3 hours long. Portal 2 is 20-30. I'm terrible at puzzle games so I had to look at a guide for a couple of spots."

29252,Very Good.
29253,Does not run on up-to-date macOS systems.
29254,"Have beaten the game twice and i can still, without a doubt, say it is one of my favorite games I've ever played. You get attached to characters and find the story behind it all, that's what makes it such an awesome experience. For an older game it holds up incredibly well and is a must-play for anyone with free time and the dedication to push through each test."

Adding gels that can make you run faster, bounce higher, or place portals on it. Portal 2 is also a lot longer. The original Portal took me an hour to complete. But Portal 2 took me around 6 hours. Portal 2 has fun and well designed puzzles, funny characters, and a good story. If you like puzzle games I would definitely recommend this to you. I give Portal 2 a 10/10. Masterpiece."

29319,"This game is about robots that are using portals to travel through time and space to KILL humans! The solo campaign gives you the perspective of the humans and your objective is to stop the robots, and the coop campaign gives you the perspective of the robots where you have to use a nuke to blow up a large portion of the remaining survivors. Overall, this game is pretty gory and has a lot of swearing. 10/10"
29320,"Mmm, GLaDOS 2"
29321,"When I played Portal 1, I knew people loved this franchise and fully expected a fantastic puzzle game. That's exactly what I got.

Portal 2 took everything I thought was great about Portal 1 and cranks it up to 11. 

Graphically, it's way better, which is to be expected for something that came out 4 years later. I will say though, the ending scene felt low res compared to the rest of the game

The Characters really shine in this game. The voice acting and dialogue for Wheatley is hilarious, Cave Johnson is probably the best fictional name I've heard of yet, and GLaDOS's story is fleshed out to be the most interesting character of them all.

The gameplay is greatly expanded upon with 3 different types of gels that speed you up, bounce you high, and allow you to put portals on. They also add in light bridges (personally my favorite addition) and these weird float light tunnels.

I found the music to be really nice, and I liked it when Wheatley plays Classical music, the music that plays when you hit the jump pad matches it as well.

Hopefully this review is coherent enough for you to understand that this is an 20/10 game, and will make you depressed beyond belief when you realize Valve doesn't make singleplayer games anymore (except for half-life alyx)."

29334,"[h1]The real deal[/h1]
This is Portal 2. It doesn't need any introduction simply because Portal 1 already set the bar, making it a classic; but there are some things which are worth noting. 

As always my reviews are more like a personal thought on something which intrigues me rather than an analysis.

If you're interested on reading my thoughts about the first one, you can click here:
https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/400/

[h3]Original twists on classic Portal mechanics[/h3]
That's right. Core gameplay remains the same while revamping some mechanics. In fact here not only you'll have turrets, portals and platforms but even various gels which can alter your jumping abilities and movement speed.

I feel that puzzle-wise the overrall level design of the campaign has improved quite a bit, involving areas in a more vast scale.

[h3]Lore-amplified[/h3]
What do I mean by [i]amplified[/i]? Well, apart from the opening sequence (which is iconic in game history), the whole game feels like a massive improvement applied to its storytelling, dialogue and lore. 

In fact we'll venture across the old Aperture Laboratories, listening to Audio Logs from Cave Johnson (founder of Aperture) as well as having a more in-depth look at GLaDOS and her personality.

Being able to walk through the old Aperture felt somewhat new, refreshing and I was honestly curious to just look around me.

[h3]Dialogues, again[/h3]
I can't stress this enough. Dialogues in Portal were interesting and well written, but here I think Valve actually overdone itself by adding a lot more movement into them. 

I think adding Wheatley was an interesting move, mainly because we have a back and forth between GLaDOS and him and, thanks to the excellent voice acting, it works flawlessly.

Plus, the extra voice lines when you stand still while waiting to do things as requested by GLaDOS or Wheatley are worth the wait.

[h3]Something which bothered me[/h3]
While I really liked the game, I can't say I really enjoyed that one bit where Cave Johnson talks about lemonade, where you have to use the white gel to create portals. I honestly didn't enjoy solving that puzzle not only because it felt frustrating, but also unclear. It's really nothing gamebreaking, really, but it bothered me because every other level seemed always like an interesting idea and had a clear, logical structure to it. Could be me of course, but still, that's my experience.

[h3]Portal 2 retains an attractive look, even after 10 years[/h3]
Maybe it's because there are no facial animations involved or because the environment is modern and simplistic, but I always enjoyed Portal's graphics. I just finished it again before sitting down here writing this review and I must say that it still feels pleaseant to watch.

My only complaints could be the pre-rendered cutscenes: were them really necessary? I think it's somewhat that the ending is a little immersive-breaking because you notice right away the passage from in-game graphics to cgi.

I won't state this as a negative aspect though, mainly because there are so many good animations during the campaign that I can't really complain.

[h2]A worthy successor, if not a better one[/h2]
Portal 2 is indeed a really good sequel and not only it expands its story in an interesting way, but even lasts longer than its predecessor. It improves the formula in every aspect, so... What is there to say, if not ""buy it"". 

Recommended!

29382,"Legitimately, valve could not have made this game any more perfect. Even if they used the Aperature Science multiverse to steal the idea from Cave Johnson himself. The puzzles are intriguing, mind bending and satisfying to solve. I never felt completely lost even though a few test chambers left me contemplating life. The characters and voice acting aren't the only thing I come back for. The environmental story telling and exploration still feel fresh as I notice new things every play through. The multiplayer is twice the portals, twice the fun! Overall my favorite game. If I could forget everything I knew about Portal I would in a heart beat just to relive the magic for the first time again."

29446,Good game
29447,"A very well done game. If I had not known it’s age I would not have guessed that it was as old as it is. The music is good, and so is the gameplay. The puzzles were too easy for my personal taste. The co-op campaign was very entertaining. Played through it with a friend and we had a blast. Honestly it’s better than the actual game!! Still I would reccomend this to literally everyone. I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t enjoy this game. Except for maybe those who only like first person shooters and tactical games like Xcom haha."

For $10, you are getting a literal masterpiece. I recommend this to ANYONE who wants a good puzzle solving story game. This is my favorite valve game ever."

29497,"100%, would recommend for anyone who likes a challenge and puzzle games. Also one of the most funny games i have ever played. Wheatley and Cave Johnson are so funny and i cant stop laughing when i encounter some certain voice lines. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and i really recommend playing Portal 1 FIRST, before Portal 2."
29498,"Portal is a perfect mix between puzzle and story, the puzzles are challenging and rewarding and the story is very immersive. Overall a great experience, would highly recommend if you are looking for a short puzzle game with great story.

Valve please make portal 3 its been 10 years."
29499,a very good puzule game
29500,"This game is a classic! Everything about this game is great! Characters, gameplay, music, EVERYTHING. If you haven't played this game already then you must!"
29501,yes
29502,walked through the wall but better 2
29503,still waitning for a friend to play it with me.
29504,"The first game i bought on my computer, and i couldn't be happier, this game is amazing and i can't recommend this game more. yeah it might be old, but it's still a masterpiece. I've finished it multiple times, and played many awesome maps made by developers on the workshop. The portal franchise is amazing, and i'm so glad more portal games are being made (even though they aren't being made by Valve) like Portal Stories: Mel, and Portal Reloaded. one of the best masterpieces on steam.

To sum up the game, you shoot portals, and shit on robots, 10/10"
29505,yes
29506,gumbo
29507,"This game has an amazing story that kept me so tied in that I would be caught playing for hours on end, and I enjoyed every second of it. It legitimately depresses me that no game will give me the same feeling that Portal has given me ever again. The entire atmosphere of this game makes you feel like you are alone, with incredible views and silence in most parts of the game, which I happen to love. When there are characters, they have lovable voices and personalities that keep you engaged to listen to their back and forth witty comments. The game play is of course, incredible. Even when I was stuck on some of the puzzles, the game managed to keep me fighting on and trying again. Valve has done a great job of using the materials they created to make new and exotic puzzles over and over again. If you read this review and want to see the game, please do not watch any game play or get spoiled in any way whatsoever. This is an experience you want to have on your own, and one you will miss when it is over. Thank you valve, for this masterpiece."
29508,Good game. Good puzzle challenges
29509,It's in general a pretty solid game with enough story and witty salty remarks to spice things up
29510,"I was so excited to play this game, and after finishing it, I don't regret anything! Great humor, nice puzzles and great graphics for the game of 2010! I recommend you this masterpiece

but... my brain suffered a little bit :D"

29575,"I love this game as do so many other people that play it, the storyline and puzzles are also interesting and the way to play this game just makes everything more enjoyable. Plus, it's longer than the first one and it's fun tormenting glaDOS and wheatley"
29576,"Presently an impression based on the first half of the single player campaign:
Portal 2 disappoints with a lot of fake tension and by removing your own actions from the center of the story. The main characters are GladOS and Wheatley, not you, you are just trapped stringing along their character moments.

When Bureaucracy Core comes off his rails, you are fastened into your own railroad and the game represents its direction by taking up the center of your view for a while with his ""face"" making it difficult to focus on where you're going.

Once you get to puzzles, the puzzles are still good.

The story the game is occasionally lauded for, though? Probably over half the time you're being urgently called to run or take some next action, it is completely impossible to fail. You can just sit there, and you will not die unless you find a ledge not covered in invisible walls (there are excessive amounts of invisible walls ""protecting"" you from drops, fires, being crushed by those wall panels that move) to jump off or something. There is nowhere else you can go, and nothing else you can possibly do. And the game, voiced by Wheatley, will just Not. Stop. Nagging your ear off.

Once there was a facility to escape where you had to figure out how to transfer the thinking-with-portals you had learned to do into an environment that felt much more complex and free-roaming. Once there was more consistency in light walls being portal-compatible and dark walls not. Once there was a game where you were the hero, cleverly navigating a dangerous environment with your wits and an experimental portal gun.

... Now you're barely given any space to explore in, nor three seconds to think and enjoy it, if the game has decided this segment is meant to be ""high intensity"". But it doesn't have the guts to let you fail.

Around where I got so sick of Blue Bubbles pleading me every few seconds for several MINUTES to get in an elevator after wresting control away from GladOS that I finally did... only to have him THEN finally rethink whether he wanted me to in order to bring me down to be a captive audience to his self-indulgent melodrama acting out the hammiest of face-heel-turns I was feeling like... I'm not sure whether I am even going to care enough to get through this.

From time to time I saw a way to go quickly, and got excited feeling as though it might be a branching path, but when I turned around to check what might have been the other way, it was always an immediate dead end. Nope, no room for divergence here. Not every game has to have branching paths of course, but it just got so stale sometimes how short and pointless so many of the dead ends were - very little even there to see.

It could have been so much more, but it forgot to respect the player enough to let them have any difficulty outside of carefully marked Puzzle Zones, and the tension and menace just completely falls apart when it's so easy to see through. A tragic answer to a great original."
29577,this game is f*cking amazing. BUY THIS SH!T TWICE!

29588,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
29589,"Honestly one of my favourite games in the world, i would none stop play this game and wont get bored of it. Definitely recommend it :))"
29590,"Portal 2 is a prime example of how a video game sequel should be done. Everything from the first game is expanded and improved upon from the narrative, gameplay mechanics, and amount of content available. The narrative itself contains a very interesting plot-line as well as some of the funniest and most cleverly written dialogue I can remember in gaming. When it comes to the gameplay, Portal 2 feels extremely polished and unique alongside a stellar co-op mode."

29595,"I called out the villain all along. I KNEW IT. 
Also the cake is a lie."
29596,"This was one of those games which I had heard a lot about but never played; it had co-op so I got it to play with a friend. Initially I only played the co-op which was really fun and gave a great sense of satisfaction once we figured out a challenging puzzle- since I enjoyed it so much I decided to try out the single player (I realise the co-op story is based after the single player story now). The world building in this game is phenomenal, every single character is wonderful and really add to the story, even the world building through easter eggs and the comic give this game and its story so much depth; the puzzles gradually get more complex and slowly introduce different mechanics while still maintaining the simple idea of only having two portals to work with- each puzzle presents its own unique challenge and they vary enough that they never become boring or tiresome. This game was a pleasure to play and it deserves every ounce of love from its community, I can't believe I waited this long to try it."
29597,the second one
29598,.
29599,i like how people make custom test chambers in hammer only to break the fundamental mechanics of portal 2
29600,"I LOVE portal 2  the co-op mode is insane with a friend and a stranger the single player story mode is my personal vavriot
"
29601,very fun puzzle game
29602,port
29603,"It good af (As Fruity Pebbles), and wheatley is funny af (AS FRUITY PEBBLES BRO), honestly since fruity pebbles are fruity and bussin.. S-TIER GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
29604,"I was looking for a nice coop game to play with my girlfriend. Not something that requires you to shoot or kill. I heard about Portal in the past but never looked into it or knew what the game was about.  Bought the game for myself and gifted her a copy, and we're hooked! To solve puzzles together really takes teamwork, thinking and most of all... patience! This game does great in teambuilding!"
29605,This is my 2nd favorite game of all time!
29606,I made portal.
29607,brilliant game. awesome puzzles and characters. full of surprises.
29608,"It was a little short, but fun.  The only thing that would make the Portal games better would be a builder to make your own puzzles.   Maybe in a portal 3?  Time will tell."
29609,"Portal 2 shines in gameplay, visuals, and the characters included in the story."
29610,nvjc
29611,very good game but it gets boring after playing for a while
29612,portals go weee
29613,Good.
29614,Sometimes this game makes me feel like I'm a potato
29615,once you get a level makes you feel like Gigachad big brain :)
29616,"great coop, super fun puzzles with a friend"
29617,"ha
"
29618,good
29619,"Surely it's masterpiece 10/10, but what about VR version? I kinda like the idea that i would fly through the air while shooting portals. It could make someone to puke, but it would worth it :)"
29620,"good game
"
29621,this game is fun and good story too
29622,Perfection of a game. Literally a masterpiece.
29623,"This was a lot of fun. I didn't find the witty banter to be quite as funny as it was in the first one, but extra backstory in this game provided a lot of value."
29624,My absolute favorite of all time
29625,very good single and multiplayer enjoyable
29626,"This is a masterminds correlation of pure tested game play. A testament to dedicated thought processes being seen to unparalleled satisfying fruition, beautifully tuned co op play, the physics of the puzzles is always interesting and thought  provoking and often funnier than a mandatory, [(:{ non-company-liable }:)], terminally dangerous testing chamber full of nitrous oxide and deadly deadly chemicals yeeee... (teeth squeek) good times! 
so with the exception of poor joy pad config (the cluncky old x-box pad works but the ps4 seems to be almost deliberately packed in like eggs at the bottom of the bag. ?) that apart I have a really tough time thinking of anything that isnt made from pure concentrated UUGGHHH!

The sound track.
I once had a troubled plater drive that could've passed for a cheap band member. it was so messed up that it clearly had developed a rebellious rhythm, left it in cause loved the funky tune it made when it booted, plus I knew that it was gifted but not well understood.
music made from the sounds of engineering and science, server concertos, mixes made from broken glass (plus other Aperture deductible machinery costs.) marginally unstable main frame solos, lament of A potato OS, Latin defence turret opera not to mention other mad science mixes to deconstruct by.

Voice over artists are sync with the comedy algorithm and voice actors cast perfectly. Its a very polished work of vocal phonic succinct concurrence that makes you laugh from unfamiliar places like your middle toes in a subterranean testing facility located at the core of Pluto shrunk to the size of a lactose intolerant cow, though this is probably included in the medical disclaimer!
..and please! do not be ashamed if during single player you get just the littlest bit of wee ..psst its ok your not incontinent its simply because your urethra is laughing!

P.S
cara mia portal..
Ill always love you and your crazy turrets! X
its just we need some time and just a lil Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!!!!!!!!!"
29627,Love. Loss. Hyper-Intelligent AI. Good Times.

29629,Fantastic Mind bending stretching - you need to try some of the multi player maps
29630,fun to play with friends

29632,"The game and story are both great, and the level creator has options, yet is simple. Love the game!"
29633,port a lol
29634,hi
29635,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
29636,"great, good to burn your eyes on."
29637,"WOW. I can't believe it took me this long to play this game. Absolute banger, definitely one of my favorite games ever."
29638,"fun puzzle, adventure, platformer-ish game. lively characters. only thing i dont like is how easy you can get lost or stuck on old aperture"
29639,This goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.
29640,"This game is beautiful. It plays awesome, even on a 9 year old potato! Awesome story, awesome graphics, awesome mechanics! I love this game!"
29641,0/10 too many brits
29642,"This is clearly one of the best games of all time. The story, characters, music, sound, puzzles, and universe are absolutely fantastic."
29643,yes.
29644,"aha funny 69 hours
also best game"
29645,portal gun go bwerrp
29646,its fun and funny
29647,"+ very diversified missions 

+ well playable in multiplayer

+ good design

- gets boring relatively fast"
29648,Good Game
29649,"This game is so innovative and fun, definitely a classic. The co-op mode is incredibly well executed, and I had so much fun playing this game with one of my friends. The story line is great, and the levels are designed spectacularly around the plot's development. The levels can be challenging, but are never too difficult. It's lots of fun and very relieving to figure out the solution to a puzzle, especially with a friend. On top of the two different campaigns in the game, there are plenty of extremely entertaining workshop maps and a pretty easy-to-use level editor. I strongly recommend Portal 2, and if at all possible, get a friend and play co-op. The game is super well made, and contains hours of fun. I've never met someone who disliked it."
29650,game is fuckin bussin
29651,fun 2 player game i carried some idiot
29652,Best puzzle game ever made
29653,A cool puzzly game but really fun.You ca play with the bois and have unlimited fun.I highly reccomendid
29654,ok
29655,"Enjoyed the Co-Op
"
29656,much deeper story and more play time than the original. the first is a classic but the second is definitely better in most aspects.
29657,fun! classic! The co-op is awesome too!
29658,Portal 2 is by far one of the best multiplayer co-op and puzzle games of all time. I had a blast both in the single player campaign and playing with my friends on the 2-player puzzles. Some of the levels are extremely difficult and will have you thinking of ways to solve them for awhile but it's so satisfying when you finally figure out the solution!
29659,Was that the part where he kills you?
29660,A really enjoyable game that has tons of memorys to it and i definitely think people should play it with their friends or family members.
29661,It's Portal 2. You don't need anyone to tell you it's good.
29662,A classic game that you have to play through
29663,The Cake is Real!
29664,I mean it's the greatest game of all time.
29665,its fun

29674,"Always wanted to play this game on the xbox 360 when i finished the 1 one, so happy i could finish it after 10 years after the game release. Highly recommend it"
29675,"single player is great, co-op is great. fun"
29676,portal2
29677,"One of the greatest games I have ever played.
Every single character is hilarious.
The puzzles are fantastic.

10/10

This game is almost always on sale, so definitely pick it up."
29678,still haven't found it in me to finish this game despite having it for the ps3 and steam for a couple of years now LOL but yep recommended for those who like physics-based puzzles and is a fan of the claustrophobic loneliness that Source games inherently have
29679,"If you liked the first game then you are sure to like this one even more. More puzzles, more plot, more character, and more exploration. What more can you ask for?"
29680,portals and stuff check it out
29681,veri fun
29682,it is very good game
29683,"best game ever made only second to half life 2
"
29684,The ability to form a good bond with puzzles enjoy the companion cube :)
29685,Portal 2 Best Souls 2
29686,"lots of bugs but if your not speedrunning youll run into at least 0 at most 2. This game is very fun, 4.9 star!"
29687,"“When life gives you lemons, don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!”

— Cave Johnson, founder and CEO of Aperture Science,"
29688,"Although easy, the puzzles are good. The story is great."
29689,GlaDOS kinda sus NGL
29690,E
29691,"With Portal, people said they could not make a sequel. It simply wouldn't be as good. But they did. And it was just as much as the first with so much more, including a heavy story aspect and phenomenal casting. And co-op! Lore! In-depth, fully fleshed out ideas! Community creations readily available, still going 10+ years and strong. This is a game that withstood the test of time. Of course I recommend it. I can't imagine the hours I have on this game on PS3, it's so good I bought it for PC."
29692,"This is one of those games I wish I could forget about, just so I could experience it for the first time again. Great gameplay, great story, and an overall great experience."
29693,"If you are considering buying this game you already know what it is. My advice is go for it, you won't be disappointed. Excellent story, Excellent puzzles, Excellent game."
29694,It's a very easy game from Valve so far. And everything is interesting non the less.
29695,Amazing Game. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who either like the first game or likes puzzles and storytelling.
29696,great.
29697,Fantastic game!
29698,"Really liked the first game, and the second is really good too. Makes my small brain hurt sometimes"
29699,Sexy
29700,ayo
29701,"When the first and second one came out, it didn't appear to be a game I'd enjoy. This is the modern scenario of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" because I LOVE this game. Although my 5 year old is too young for it to play on his own, he LOVES to sit on my lap and watch me play. I REALLY wish they kept this series going. This is a puzzle game which is a switch up to my usual first person shooter style games which is why I thought I wouldn't like it but I was so wrong! LOVE this game!!

If you're reading this, I'd love to play Co-Op, message me!"
29702,This game is why I have trust issues.

29726,GREAT WITH FRIENDS
29727,pogger
29728,"Brilliant game. I am playing this almost 10 years after playing the first Portal game. I have got to say that they really did outdid themselves. Portal 1 was a masterpiece. Portal 2 is even better. The voice acting and dialogues are so good. The re-imagined puzzled felt good and wasn't rehashed versions from the first game. Overall, a really good experience. BTW, the ending was truly out of the world."

29746,portal good mind game
29747,"Okay, look. This game is literally over a decade old at this point. I think Valve charges a buck for it during summer/winter sales. I don't think there's anything I can say to you now that would get you to buy this if you don't already have it. 
Just... Just play it. For science.

You monster."
29748,wheatley is a moron
29749,What else can I say except that this is another masterpiece from Valve? Everything from it's unique and challenging gameplay to it's awesome voice-acting and story makes this game so incredibly good. It's absolutely worth buying with it's 98% positive reviews.
29750,"one of my all time fav games 
if u haven't played it. *what are you doing just buy it*

29759,Graphics and plot are simply amazing. Never gets boring or repetitive. Just brilliant design overall and it takes thought but it's feasible.
29760,"If you love video games, this is for you. Best in class of game design and hands down, funniest game ever. Must play for anyone who calls themselves a gamer."
29761,"If you don't know portal you live under a rock. One of my favorite games all-time. Co-op makes this amazing, but the addition of having player-made maps is perfection."
29762,its portal
29763,Great puzzle game with very enjoyable campaign dialogue.
29764,i enjoyed it
29765,the second one
29766,"needs a third

29778,a
29779,"Easily one of the best games I've ever played. If you're looking for fun logic puzzles, a well written story, or even funny dialogue; well this is the perfect game"

29789,good games
29790,Perfect single player experience that comes with a really fun co-op multiplayer. Try out community maps like Gelocity with a friend!
29791,"Portal 2 is the only game I have ever play in which i can say, without a doubt, is the best game ever made. It really is endlessly replay-able and every time i beat it i still feel every emotion i did from the first time i beat it. The humor is amazing, the puzzle-solving and mechanics are some of the best ive ever seen in a game. Every character and every setpiece is memorable. Portal 2 is the peak of game design. No wonder Valve stopped making games for so long, they had made the perfect game. Buy it now."
29792,brain hurt
29793,pls 3rd game
29794,Fantastic brilliant game that also has hundreds of great fan-made test chambers.
