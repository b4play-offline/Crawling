1,fun game to kill the time
2,"This game is bullshit. I'm glad it's dead.

It was fun at its height, but after 900+ hours, it's tiring hoping for some miracle to come your way while your enemies win with two-star units. Good fucking riddance."
3,unsupported by developers
4,.
5,"Honestly it's fun, it would be nice to be able to have longer games to get 3 star level 5s.  Maybe adding a mode for Knockout to have 6 life points. Or a normal match that can have 150 starting health points."
6,Valve abandoned this game. It had its shortcomings but was overall a great game. Unfortunately without as much as a simple rotation of heroes it gets boring quite quick. Shame on Valve for killing the original AutoChess in Dota and then abandoning their own game. What a drag...
7,"Man i wish this game wasn't dead, i would play the shit out of it"
8,"Underlords themselves is by far best part of this game. 
Sadly its dead."
9,"This game so so so good, but plsss update, plssss !!!"
10,"Worst game ever. Thanks for the fact you stopped support, cause it's continuation would have been shaming you even more. Total disrespect."
11,yes good.
12,damn good
13,"Similar to auto chess but with some hard user interface, good graphics though"
14,..
15,"UPDATE PLEASEEEEE HERO AND METTA UPDATE GABBEN DOG
"
16,Игра прикольная
17,fun
18,"need more updates , boring af now , new units new perk , we need everythings"
19,"relaxing game
some kind of cool"
20,Love the autochess style of games and playing it with heroes from dota adds a lot to the experience. This comes from both my love for them and because their art and look are very distinct from each other. this helps a great deal when trying to get a lot done quickly in a single round compared to teamfight tactics. Not really supported or updated any more so the meta gets stale but it is a stable and fun game none the less and there are other autochess games out there for when you need to mix it up.
21,"It's sad that the mod was awesome, valve attempted to spin on the original and added lords which in my opinion screwed it, how is it that a mod is better than an actual made game? too bad the mod has so many hackers"
22,better go to casino then playing this shit :)
23,cool strategy
24,"nice
"
25,its fun~!
26,It ain't Half-Life 3 but it ain't Artifact.
27,"No one reads reviews, so i'll say that i'm gay"
28,TOO many BUGS fix your game VALVE!
29,mmmmmmmmmmm
30,.
31,yesss
32,"Slark is love, Slark life."
33,"I want this game to be so much.. its a few bots a a bottle of whisky .  cant make no cash with that!

No chicks FTW"
34,better than tft
35,better than dota
36,nice
37,"Still a fun and great game in 2022.
Looking forward for some updates."
38,"#SaveDotaUnderlords
It's an excellent and fun game that hasn't been updated in 2 years. It desperately needs at least one shakeup of the meta every 3-4 months and I believe Valve could do this, but as it stands they abandoned developing this game."
39,Ppl still (remarkably) play this game. How about once a month you have a guy rotate the fucking hero pool
40,Wish this game never died :(
41,"NUAM TOPS
"
42,"old,not update anymore lol but actually gud"
43,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I often return back to it for a quick match to easily kill some time. I've played other autochess like games and this is by far the best, and easiest to use. I wish they continued updating it and that the story mode continued."
44,"No updates, game is abandoned."
45,Dota Underlords is a very fun and addicting game that is in dire need of more attention and support from its developers. I would really like to see this game grow because it has a lot of potential.
46,"Highly recommend this game! One of the best games I've played. Please update again, bring this game back to lifeeee!
#SaveDotaUnderlords"
47,"Please update this game. A lot of us including me still enjoys playing this game, and it's a shame that this game got abandoned."
48,This game is a fantastic mobile game! I'd like to see Valve continue to support DU because it is a great game! It has lots of satisfying effects and graphics! And the gameplay is also really great! So please Valve continue supporting it! Please! #saveDU
49,Best auto battler game. Valve please update
50,"Game was fun, a bit like Hearthstone tavern mode but has not been updated for a loooong time.
I guess development has stopped :|"
51,I really love this game so bad
52,"ниче не ясно, но очень интресно...

Особенно то, какого хера у врагов каждый раунд стак героя, а у тебя 4 раунда тишина"
53,nice games
54,Good game
55,Very Awesome Game and Very fun. But the lack of updates makes it dull.
56,"This game is very addictive. When you're bored with Dota, playing Underlord is quite fun and relaxing."
57,"good game but abandoned by devs. gets old quickly with no changes to meta.

i downloaded this for my deck but ultimately there are far better, maintained games available."
58,nice gayme
59,:)
60,10/10
61,Цікава гра
62,"Nice Game, Valve always make good games"
63,ok
64,very cool
65,the game runs well on the deck but the controls lave more to be desired
66,"Look how they massacared my boi. Still remember the first day, the gameplay was good then valve didn't give any care about this game. İf you wanna play chess but with more exiciting yeah this game for you but don't get to in to it"
67,Terrible game. But like dota once you play it its hard to stop. Negatively addictive. Stupid RNG based dopamine releasing and crashing crap. Minimal skill level.
68,"Amazing game, I wish it would get regular updates though .."
69,"Fun game but is never updated, so things are left stale and unbalanced."
70,LA MASEA LA MASEA
71,please update the game
72, Awesome fun Dota chess so many combo's and meta to learn its loads of fun and a great passing of time without the rage associated with Dota
73,"The best autobattler ever, why is it no updated yet?"
74,"Great auto-chess, but no outlook for updates."
75,Kinda underrated
76,Game was great but as usual Valve stopped updating it and left it to die
77,idiot game ever
78,good gameplay. some seasons have unbalanced alliamces
79,The game is very good but valve let it die
80,"This game was hours and hours of fun until Valve ripped out a bunch of content and then stopped supporting it. If they had left in Jail with all the other heroes, this game could still be playable. As it is, it's gotten stale, but is still pretty fun."
81,dead game
82,#savedotaunderlords
83,yes
84,"Before I played Dota Underlords i had a small wee wee, no friends, no girlfriend and absolutely no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
85,?
86,recomended
87,"Promising game, sadly Valve abandoned it."
88,Nice
89,valve went out to buy some milk and suddenly never came back home again
90,gajelas banget nih game mending autochess original
91,Based so much on luck and the meta is too strong that you can't even compete with experimental builds. Just play TFT instead because at least riot keep their games alive and balanced
92,Pudge doesn't hook enough + walrus punch + ratio
93,"  Best abandonware ever. Be romantic, download it. Right now."
94,game yang mengasah otak sampai otak anda tipis karena terkikis akibat terlalu sering diasah
95,I do not  understand why valve didn't continue to develop this game anymore.
96,Insane game
97,this game is trash. The only thing u need to win is lucky
98,Dead game
99,GOOD TIMEWASTER
100,bla bla bla
101,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
102,kata imam gamenya mengasah otak
103,Terrible game. Boring. Redundant. Poor late game mechanics for RNG stabilization. And when I say poor I mean absolutely NONE. Don't waste your time with this game that they put together aesthetically but has absolutely no substance of advanced mechanics. BAD
104,had crash randomly in PC
105,"Valve stop letting all your games die please. Thank you, Dota better moba"
106,ggwp
107,I get that online the game got stale... but the single player stuff still has me playing it to this day to mess around with. I wish there were other games that had auto chess PvE stuff.
108,Yes.
109,good game
110,Awesome
111,Great game.
112,"I never thought as myself as someone who enjoyed this style of game. It was fairly easy to pick up. This is the only DOTA game I've ever played and I don't feel like I'm ""missing out"" on anything important to like enjoy and understand the game. Its challenging enough to keep me entertained and strive to do better."
113,This game used to be SO fun when there were no underlords
114,"Was a fun game til it was abandoned, not worth playing"
115,Great game to play casually; in desperate need of an update
116,"fun
"
117,Wish the devs never gave up on this really is a fun and addictive game.
118,"PROS:
Stealing a great concept from a game that did it alot better final fantasy tactics.

CONS:
Way too much rng casino card game style."
119,amazing strategic game
120,"Yes and no, The game is suprisingly good but the developer left it without any update for a year. This game got potential but sad"
121,good game while listening to podcasts.
122,dead crap but at least not as dead as artifact
123,addictive fun
124,nice but no update anymore
125,"its good, play it alot n' stuff"
126,Please revive this game. Its really great! Please Valve
127,"I Love it
"
128,gggn
129,"Good game, and at time of writing there is still enough of a playerbase to find matches without too much queueing. Unfortunately game is abandoned and doesnt seem to have any active development anymore, but the current state is still playable."
130,Easy to Start. Good Strategy
131,"This game helped me through a difficult period. I was vomiting often, it was hard to get food down. 

I would play this game every morning as a distraction to make it easier to eat. 

It really does upset me that this game was abandoned in such a state. Maybe it wouldn't be a major cash cow, but it seems like such a waste to create this game and throw it away so quickly."
132,excellent rework
133,Dead game dead :(
134,really fun an cool game recommended !!!! :D
135,"i'm a 45 year old father, probable one of the oldest-
nah i'm just kidding, why did valve kill this game though xd"
136,update the gotdamn game
137,"This game is unnecessarily difficult. 
Thought I could 'get good', but after 70+ hours, it's still more frustrating than fun.
Uninstalling it after posting this review.
Don't waste your time on it."

141,Generally a very well balanced auto chess genre game. Doesn't possess the usual pay-for-cosmetics business model that other games go for.

144,dsfs
145,"Could've been a really fun game and then valve let it die, this game hasn't gotten a meta update in almost 2 years. Funnily enough, I've seen games with smaller player bases have more consistency."
146,
147,
148,"Goodgame
"
149,Fuck valve for abandoning this game
150,"Its not like the dota chess version, I believe there is huge potential to upgrade the searching algorithm, it contains some redundancy and it doesn't evolve with the players different strategies, but still the game worth the try, A huge space that can be even expanded, if Vavle update the game once every year like dota2, the game dope u into collections of  tactics from to counter measure and picking combos, all of that combined with the considerable number of online players on the game, all of that and more makes my hours of playing around 1600 hours."
151,Nice adding friend system
152,Valve had a great game with a healthy community. Until they abandoned it.
153,"Best auto-battler in my opinion. Wish they would make another update, but the game as-is is still fun to me."
154,kontol
155,Amazing
156,Good job Valve u maked a great strategy game.
157,this is good
158,"Amazing game, has a great smooth feel to it.
Downside is it never gets any new patches, it has been a couple years at best. 
If they don't want to put in any effort, I'd like to see them at least recycle old patches to keep things interesting.
"
159,"Not enough maintenance. Need to stir things up a bit, add new heroes. Work on it."
160,Shit
161,Please Update Game
162,"I really like this game and I do think you should play it while you can. It sucks that I feel like I have to put an asterisk on my recommendation. I've played it since it first popped up, but it's really disheartening when a developer just drops a game without a word after consistent updates. It's even more disheartening when the developer in question is Valve. Once Valve drops something without a word, it's a bad sign. That concerns me, because while people still play it NOW, the issue of a totally dead online only game is just looming there. So like I said, play it while you can, cause it won't be there forever."
163,The best auto-chess game i've ever played
164,"Dead game, hasn't been updated in 2 years.  Is valve still a game dev?"
165,No idea what needs to be done.
166,Great game but since Valve has seemingly abandoned it without telling anyone I cannot recommend.
167,gg
168,"Outwitting your opponents and the odds through clever thinking is always immensely satisfying, and the game's complexity means that there are plenty of interesting strategies to try. Dota Underlords is a wonderfully robust and well-crafted strategy game that is very easy to lose yourself in."
169,this is absolutely meta important to you who want to play this game you must need brain and time ygy
170,good game
171,Just play tft
172,Valve keep your games alive challenge (impossible)
173,"please update the game dude
"
174,10/10 GGK
175,"the OG game was much more fun
"
176,"Brilliant game, 10/10. UI is great, a decently challenging single player mode and a very active online matchmaking community. A range of viable strategies with many little nuances that are necessary to know to make them work. Everything is top notch. And all for free!

However I cannot recommend.

Unfortunately Underlords is not supported by the developers anymore (as of July 2022), with the last balance patch being 18 months ago, and so the game and its player base is slowly dying out, myself included. 

I write this review as I uninstall the game after 1500 hours of play. I enjoyed Underlords immensely, but it is now time to move on."
177,funy mikey mose good game
178,so good
179,"Game of luck, stupid game"
180,"Really fun game to play! I was confused at the first but once you get used to alliances and strategy then it will be super fun.
worth spending time on."
181,"A big part of the fun is just gambling (in the sense of being lucky in items and units), but there is tactics, strategy, and planning as well. Plus game sense in being aware of who is your biggest threat and how you can counter them."
182,"poor optimization. lags a good deal, frequent disconnects,"
183,quick game search time
184,"What a great game
Shame [b]No UPDATE![/b]"
185,good
186,good casual game to play with friends
187,"If you wants to use your brain 99%, play this game
"
188,The only things this game will give you is doubt about the principle of the continuous uniform distribution and emotional damage
189,good game but underlords heroes ruins the game
190,"I have over 100 hours in this game and I still feel like I have no real grasp on it.  Anytime something feels like it's working, it falls apart in 5 turns.  Clearly it's got an addictive loop going because I keep playing but it always feels like time lost, don't buy in, rise above, focus on science."
191,"update patch please, last update 2 years ago :("
192,dfS
193,"great autochess, too bad valve left it"
194,needs updates
195,fun and easy to run on simple comps
196,great game. better than regular dota 2
197,"Great game, but dead since January 2021.
Honestly don't waste your time, you're better off with TFT than this."
198,Dead game
199,"Just an absolute masterpiece, devs abandoned the game, but its still fun to hop on and play from time to time. Valve, please don't abandon this wonderful game! :c"
200,AtomicWars is 100% better!
201,git gut
202,"Only played a little and seems ok,"
203,"This game looks great, feels great... it's not done, and apparently isn't getting updates? I guess other auto-chess options? Shame Valve. Shame. Free to install, fun concept, probably worth messing around in, but I'll play a supported clone I guess?"
204,ESTARIA GENIAL QUE LO ACTUALIZARAN!! ES UN JUEGAZO
205,great!
206,Very nice!
207,56
208,i like it

211,Great fun
212,good repetitive fun
213,:D
214,"
feel like shit"
215,Games balance sometimes can be tough but each game is a new possibility to discover for myself. It is pretty fun you can never know what will work since every game creates a new range of possibilites.
216,Great game
217,Low online
218,Good game. but update pls. (2 years no update) hahahhaha
219,We need updates please
220,Zbsksnnskssk
221,update the game please
222,great
223,what is the time now?
224,"I do not recommend playing this game because it is no longer receiving updates.  At the same time, it isn't really at a state where it no longer needed updates.

Dota Underlords was one of the better successors to Dota AutoChess.  It stuck pretty close to the formula, but added some good quality of life upgrades and some interesting new concepts such as team mode, global items, the jail system, items that modified characters tags, etc.

Sometimes, these concepts were not particularly well balanced.  Some of the global items could be pretty snowbally or totally swing the late game, and the jail system often made the meta more stale instead of less.  But instead of refining or balancing the new concepts, the developers often just cut them from the game.  At the same time, the game's core concept, the Underlords, never was particularly interesting or added much to the game, but persisted because its what the game was named after.

The end result was an autobattler that was well-balanced (provided you were doing the meta strategies, as some metas had really low strategic diversity) and skill testing, but at the same time kind of dull.  If you understood the game well, you could climb pretty quickly, but you would probably do so by executing the same 2-3 strategies over and over.

Special positive mention to the team mode, which was simple and effectively executed.  Despite being not too much different from the standard gameplay, the team mode had a different feel and ""tempo,"" and rewarded teamwork in interesting ways.

If this game was still getting updates, I would probably recommend it despite its flaws.  As is, I cannot recommend it."
225,Very Positive
226,"Despite being a dead game, it will always be worth playing because it is good."
227,cool af
228,"Before I begin, I would like to state that I completely and utterly hate this game. Everything is by random  computer generated randomness there is no progression nor play to win or pay to win feature to this game.... With that said, I was hooked on to this like a baby to a moms teets..... There were sooooo many moments i wanted to rage quit sooooooo bad, but as soon as 1 session was over i would jump right back in. This game is so highly addictive and sooooo frustrating I will personally call this the dark souls of card battler/ auto battler/ arena esque? I literally played this game for 13 hours straight, no not kidding, every single match had me cussing up a storm as if I was a sailor in a long lost voyage, yet go right back in to do the same thing. WARNING: this game will make you completely insane."
229,"Play it on PC or Mobile. I enjoy this RNG Chess games and I had to play on the go. Figure out which class or groups of class you like, combine them into a well oiled machine, and watch them conquer the board. Each run is very different and you'll never get what you want. Pray to the RNG god and then call CHECKMATE!"
230,nice
231,Please give update for this great game
232,Wow! Cool game!
233,"Great Game.
Valve Abandoned the game"

244,While one of the better auto-chess games it still is not fun and because of not having fun with this being one of the better ones I do not think I will ever come back to this genre of games.
245,Good game
246,"I love this game and I'm so sad it hasn't been update since a lot of time! This game has a very strong potential using all the Dota 2 heroes , it would be such an amazing game!"
247,Good

256,i like strategy. this is strategy. its fun.

259,It's casual fun.
260,ok
261,"The game itself is quite entertaining, but I wish Valve gave it more attention, seems dead at the moment. I still recommend it, though!"
262,you know you're a boomer if you enjoy this game more than DOTA2.

265,"MENGHORMATI ORANG TUA

“Hormatilah ayahmu dan ibumu, supaya lanjut umurmu di tanah yang diberikan TUHAN, Allahmu, kepadamu” (Keluaran 20:12)

Kata “hormat” dalam bahasa Ibrani menggunakan kata “kabad” yang secara hurufiah berarti menjadi berat, atau bertambah berat, atau berbobot berat. Pada zaman kuno, sesuatu yang berbobot berat dianggap memiliki nilai yang lebih besar. Sampai hari ini pun harga dari batu dan logam mulia yang dinilai oleh bobot mereka, artinya semakin berat bobot dari suatu batu dan logam mulia maka harganya semakin mahal. Sedangkan untuk orang, yang dinilai adalah bobot keberadaan dan peranan orang tersebut dalam masyarakat dan sesamanya. Semakin berbobot keberadaan dan peranan orang tersebut maka semakin penting dan mulia orang tersebut.

Dalam bacaan kita hari ini menunjukkan bahwa Alkitab mencatat orang tua memiliki bobot yang besar. Para rabi Yahudi kuno mengajarkan bahwa orang tua harus dihormati karena mereka adalah mitranya Allah (God's partner). Mereka bekerja sama dengan Allah untuk adanya seorang anak. Allah adalah pencipta kehidupan, dan orang tua adalah media yang melaluinya TUHAN memilih untuk membawa kehidupan baru ke dalam dunia. Sebab itu, menghormati orang tua bukanlah soal apa yang mereka sudah lakukan, perbuat atau berikan kepada kita. Ketika kita menghormati orang tua sebenarnya kita sedang menghormati peran yang TUHAN berikan kepada mereka, yang olehnya kita sebagai anak boleh hadir dan ada dalam dunia ini.

Renungan bagi kita hari ini adalah: pertama, kita wajib memberikan penghormatan kepada orang tua karena peran yang Allah berikan kepada mereka demi menghadirkan kita sebagai anak ke dalam dunia ini. Kedua, kita harus mau mengampuni mereka, jika dalam membesarkan kita ada kesalahan yang mereka perbuat yang menyakiti hati kita. Jangan merendahkan mereka hanya oleh karena satu atau dua perbuatan salah mereka kepada kita sebagai anak. Jangan kita kecewa akan apa yang orang tua kita tidak berikan kepada kita, sebab apa yang mereka bisa berikan itu adalah semua yang ada pada mereka. Ketiga, jika TUHAN masih memberikan kita kesempatan, buatlah segala sesuatu yang baik dan membahagiakan orang tua kita selagi kita hidup. Cintai dan sayangilah mereka, yang memungkinkan kita ada hidup sampai saat ini. Keempat, ketika kita menjadi orang tua, buatlah apa yang baik kepada anak-anak kita seperti yang kita kehendaki diperbuat orang tua kepada kita sebagai anak. Jangan sekali-kali melanjutkan apa yang tidak baik dari orang tua kita kepada anakanak kita saat ini. Ingatlah, bahwa anak-anak lebih memperhatikan apa yang orang tuanya lakukan ketimbang apa yang orang tuanya katakan. Kelima, kita menghormati orang tua kita dengan cara menjadi orang tua yang terhormat dalam membesarkan dan mendidik anak kita. Kita dapat mengasihi orang tua kita ketika kita mengetahui berada di posisi yang sama dan melihat nilai yang sama sebagai orang tua. (YMH)

Questions:
1. Menurut Anda apa yang membuat Anda bangga kepada orang tua Anda?
2. Jika Anda sudah menjadi orang tua, apakah yang ingin Anda sampaikan kepada anak-anak Anda?

Values:
Dalam Kerajaan Allah, orang tua harus dihormati karena mereka adalah mitranya Allah.

266,awsome game pls update!
267,no questions ask i love this game!
268,I am taking compile shader error then game is crushed. Any solution?? It is happening all the time
269,game
270,I'll need to play a couple more matches before I can give my final opinion but so far it seems okay.
271,khobe
272,"Dead game, stolen idea from devs so valve could milk it and abandon it. If you want a good auto chess game that's updated weekly then unfortunately the only option on the market is TFT. (May 2022)

Auto Chess is the original devs, the games still okay and a lot better than this stolen trash. Amazed this got so much positive reception, it's almost like no one does any research. /s"
273,Have fun!
274,great game with hot female i9m simp ik but i have gf 100% im also gay so you cant bully me
275,"very fun & addicting autochess - both knockout & standard are great for multiplayer modes-its balanced
duos is more difficult to find a match, but its still fun when you can
Battle pass is another great way to stay wanting to play the game
Single player mode has a good amount to it & goes through the motions of slightly showing you what is best against what & what hero to use for which reason. The Prestige is cool but for me after that first one I'm looking at the map thinking, ""why do it again""...I'm still more than half way through but that thought did cross my mind."
276,good
277,Less toyoan dito
278,update the game already!
279,chill game
280,playyyyyyy iiiiiittt
281,good game
282,#saveunderlords
283,Was ok before it died :P Perfect game for chat with friends
284,good hame
285,Fun game! Fucked up rnd tho
286,"Left for dead, but still a good game."
287,"Maybe I have terrible luck.
Maybe I have terrible strats.

But there's something disheartening about the way the early and mid game progress in Underlords that just doesn't do it for me. Can't recommend it. Fun for a bit though, but there are better games of its kind out there that feel more balanced when it comes to match ups"
288,no update very boring
289,"I'm not sure why Valve has abandoned this. The updates were interesting, the balance adjustments made you consider your choices. This game had a good run, though I'm glad people still play it. Ques can be a minute or four depending on when you're trying to play, but if you like auto chess style games it's worth taking a look at."
290,Nice.
291,shit game..better hang yourself
292,"Really like Underlords, but not enough updates to keep me interested. Still recommend if you've never played it."
293,Fun and not too laid back
294,this game so perfect because have city crawl for battle pass XP
295,"Should be receiving updates,

Rotating heroes
New Season

A Daily Newspaper would be appreciated ;)"
296,good game but need some updates
297,"Pretty Good, needs an update"
298,luck based games. NO SKILL NEEDED
299,Post modern Solitaire though it's a dead game now.

340,nice gameplay
341,It feels a lot like chess but Dota style
342,it's very chill
343,Liked it very much!
344,No matter what is your combo only get 3 star heroes can win everything
345,dont get me wrong i love dota underlords but i feel like this game kinda fell off like wheres some updates? some new stuff <3
346,revive game
347,Too bad it's dead
348,Next patch when? UPDATE THE GAME
349,"One of the Best F2P Strategy Game You Can Play
But in this 2 Years Have No Update And Thats Bad
I Hope They Revive This Game."
350,Please update this game!!
351,yes
352,What a good game! Why not continuing update? ??
353,Great draft-and-build strategy game based on Dota 2 heroes. Very fun.
354,"Seriously, FUCK THIS GAME. In no way is this piece of shit enjoyable..."

367,the best chess game
368,unbaalanced bullshit
369,I changed my review to a thumbs up. it's a good game. I still suck at it though.
370,"I enjoy playing Underlords even if Valve has abandoned it. I don't think it would be so unpopular if they invest on it, financialy, events, modes etc, to make it richer in content. In my opinion it's a really good and enjoyable game and not unbalanced as Artifact was, so it shouldn't have Artifact's fate."
371,"WHERE ARE THE FOOKING UPDATES ?
2 FRICKIN YEARS AND 0 UPDATES, where the goddamn 4 rotations a year atleast you promised ?
"
372,"come on valve,revive this"
373,best thinking strategy games
374,Make Dota Underlords great again!
375,This game was okay while they were still updating it in beta but since release it was forgotten about and neglected by developers. Better off playing LoL TFT. Writing this review because I'm not going back.

399,noice
400,Penetrates my Firewall without asking.  What I think of this game is locked behind that.
401,It seems to be abandoned.
402,8/10 - It's not as original auto chess but it still has soul. Also i don't like it that it doesn't have support anymore and only one update in a year!!! But still would recommend :)
403,yep
404,no update ?
405,"tongkrongan kami

406,"Valve, please bring new content and update the game."

I miss it so much but I'm done with this meta.

Great game guys, don't let it die."
408,Good
409,I used to add my friends when I don't have 5$ in my account .-.
410,"This is the best version of auto chess. I still play it constantly in my downtime. Knockout is the perfect 20 minute in and out game mode for anyone who wants to play something between work. Tons of people are still online despite the fact valve has one hundred percent abandoned this game to die. Much like all money hungry companies they saw no potential in an in game store and instantly put a stop to any updates. People say it's become stale, I very much disagree. Before they stopped updating they added just enough new characters to the roster to give every match variety. Once you learn what combos to have on the board and how important board placement is you're set for a good time. It's also free."
411,Nice.
412,"Ultimate time killer. I play short mode on mobile and standard on desktop. Nice to have one game for all devices.  I think tutorial should be improved, because it's hard to understand at the beginning"
413,dude keep updating this shit it was dope game
414,I hope they revive the game
415,gud
416,Dead game. Underlords had a solid chance at taking on TFT but Valve thought it would be best to make a pay-to-win digital TCG that no one wanted. Valve doesn't actually make games anymore and they are quick to dismantle each dev team they acquire. Shame.
417,"game is too fast. cannot process between rounds what is going to happen next. idk how the learning curve could be any easier against ai honestly, but the jump to online play is just unbearably brutal despite my strongest short efforts..."

421,"All in all good game, but the fact nothing new happens in the game and there hasn't been an update for a long time makes it a little boring."
422,Nice
423,gd
424,It's not too hard to get into as a new player: The mechanics are explained very well by the tutorial. 9/10
425,This game is fun and challenging. There are very beautiful mechanics of this game that once you learn them you can easily win the game or be in the top 3.
426,just be toxic okay ;) this game is suck if your not lucky
427,Needs a little love from Volvo but otherwise it's a decent game.
428,so goood help me a lot when i was on the bus <3
429,Fun game to pass the time while doing other things. takes some strategy to know when to hold your coins and when to risk them for rerolls. team building is luck of the draw during matches so every game is different. don't like the reliance on battlepass for so much of the offline game part.
430,Great Strategi Game Ever

446,Game nhân phẩm chơi rất vui. Đồ họa đẹp hoạt ảnh chiến đấu bắt mắt
447,"Have played this game a lot. Even enjoyed it. But the random factor is non-existent. If the AI has decided that you have to lose the game/round, it doesnt matter what you do, you still lose. Enemy units wont die even if they have ZERO life. At the start of the rounds, if you have your mouse clicked on a unit, you can briefly see the new kill count of that specific unit, even if the round hasnt even started... Where is the randomness in this game? Its just frustrating to be beaten by the AI, and not by the players. Laughable. Could have been a nice game, but instead its really bad. If you are meant to lose the round, even if youre clearly better then your enemy, before you can win, your units will stop attacking and will just sit around and waiting to attacked to death by enemy units. Shame on the developers for this poor AI.. probably made by russians lol"
448,the rng in this game is terrible
449,good
450,Decent game. Only problem with it is the amount of bugs and crashes you encounter. Expect your game to crash every 3-4  matches

464,cool
465,"Good game to kill time, no real progression aside from the City Crawling which requires a battle pass to really enjoy. Game is free, worth a try."
466,"Add this to the list of valve's new games that failed to catch on.

It was made to jump on the auto chess type games that suddenly became popular, but I guess that eventually people realize that in games such as these there is always one of a few winning strategies each game, and that quickly becomes repetitive. Because, when you want to try out an off meta strategy, you already know you're going to lose.

It felt good to play in the beginning though, but can't say that I miss this genre much."
467,great game
468,"Valve Devs have abandoned this game. No regular update since 11/2020, and the last major update was 01/2021. Same Meta for over a year now. Same 3 builds on top will rushing three stars. Certain Underlords Abilities are better than others, not matter the alliance synergy. It is still a decent autochess, but I would not recommend this game since it has been abandoned.

"
469,"fun game, i enjoy it"
470,typical valve devs never updating their games!
471,ngay ca nguoi so huu tri tue sieu viet nhu toi cung phai tu biet game nay
472,"Decent game to play while watching videos or listening to mandatory, but boring uni lectures...
Also great way to pass the time during an all staff zoom meeting that's like 90 minutes of being ranted at by people you've never met and have nothing to do with, but who feel they need an audience because their families stopped listening to their ramblings long ago.

Game is completely stale now though, the last update was over a year ago, and for this game to be kept alive it needs updates every ~3 months to rotate the hero pool and make minor balance patches to keep the meta fresh.

As it stand you just look up the meta builds on a year old reddit post and play the one that you got the most units for early game and follow it without deviation."
473,good
474,come onnn
475,abandoned nodeJs app
476,goood
477,"I used to love this game, but now it is bleeding, volvo does not care about their game at all - ppl play tft instead
Rest in pepperoni"
478,The UI of the game is nice and informative. Too bad Valve killed the game.
479,ded
480,"Dota Auto Chess but Valve worked on it. 
Here's an algorithm how to win:
> Buy Dota 2 heroes (not, that's not lol)
> Place on the chessboard as you want, unlike common chess
> Watch how your and enemy's heroes fight themselves for their lives
> Suffer from losing HP and gold by using RNG
> Profit? 

Pluses:
+ One more game on Dota franchise, not only unlucky Artifact and original Dota
+ A good puzzle for your brain, can train to strategy the battle
+ On old traditions of Valve: collect all items and decorate the White Spire
+ pt for cross-platform. Now I can play it from my tab (nobody cancelled lags, it's a port from PC ver., even Source 2 is created in priority for PCs). Now this game is only game created by Valve (except of HL2 and Portal ports to nVD Shield) released on digital stores. 

Minuses:
- Annoys faster
- Valve no longer supports this game, updates are rare and only bug fixes.
- MM balance? (from others' words)
- No achievements (like Dota 2, so no wonder), no game badge.

Conclusion: this game is still playable, like most Valve games, MM is alive, BP is alive. But I don't know, how much you can play it."
481,it is good.
482,Game Gacha.
483,nice
484,just nothing
485,"Auto-chess super format game, but unfortunately this game died.
The developers of the game have not taken care of the game for more than a year, maybe longer.
At the same time, it would be enough to add a small update, rotation of heroes, new tasks and a little fine-tuning of the ballnce of heroes and items.
I'm sad about this, the format of this game is super, strong and world-famous developer, the most famous heroes of the game world wacraft-dota.

486,game nya bagus. kurang nasi bungkus saja
487,"This game is so dead that when I try to play Duo with my gf we talk for 2 hours while searching, then we give up and go play casual solo, because we know that 100% of the times we end up in the same game. The game has literally 8 players waiting for us to search so they can play casual with us."
488,"Had potential but alas, it was not meant to be.
Probably my favorite autochess experience."
489,Really amazing funny game
490,First things first. This game was shit when it came out but I somehow still played it. Today I was in for a big surprise when i found out it went from bad to atrocious. Well done. I give it an Ass/10
491,"This game is good, get it... idk what else to say.."
492,"Was great when it got updates, sadly Volvo, like many things, treats their games like they have an expiry and this one has been lost to history."
493,I live for Dota Underlords
494,Fun game with friends poggers!
495,"Basically, this is the pinnacle of pc gaming. No other game even comes close to the perfection that is Dota Underlords. It's free to play and the only people who complain about or don't enjoy this game are just bad and they should probably get good or something."
496,惊奇地发现已经是 dead game 了
497,"Great game.... until the patch where they added the 3 ""gods"" tho. Then I quit. XD"
498,Sure.
499,ruined my marriage. i'd play this on mobile during sexy time my husband got jealous of arc warden
500,"its the ""fun"" kind of fun.

20 hours in and I've just won my first ranked match.  been close, had great combos, i dont know what i did different to win. 

carries on the ""dota"" name well."
501,Team fight tactics much better game then Dota underlords
502,"one of my favorite games of all time, it's like this super cool cross between pokemon and chess!"
503,social credit +15
504,"So the game is not updated.  There are some pretty annoying bugs.  And they don't rotate the heroes so it stays the same.

But man is the meta tight.  They at least left it in a great state.  No alliance feels overpowered, no alliance feels necessary.  The hero pool is small enough where it's effective to adaptive draft instead of going in with some pre-planned team like you have to with many other autochess games.  

I love this game and feel engaged and challenged every time I play it."
505,good game
506,1
507,Dead game. Was fun during the hype though.
508,"Cool auto chess. Of course, with it's problems, but I enjoy playing to chill and maybe watch movie on the side. Just chill, nice animations and pretty basic battle system, but advanced enough to be challenging."
509,"It's a good game, here is hoping for some new content though!"
510,"The best Auto Chess Ever made.

Abandonware."
511,game ded
512,Good game
513,Pretty fun alternative from Valve to TFT. Sad it's dead.
514,good
515,"TLDR: It's an auto-battler / auto-chess free-to-play game with cosmetic microtransactions. Started off promising, some changes led to the player base largely moving on, and the devs seem to have pretty much abandoned it. 

Underlords was an interesting game that seemed like it was going places, only to have a few key changes send the whole thing crashing into the proverbial mountain. As someone who was playing when this big shift occurred, it really felt like watching a design experiment happening in real-time. Sadly, it is now a ghost of its former promise.

For a time the game looked like it would end up a fairly deep, somewhat crunchier Teamfight Tactics-style game. The visual language is FAR easier to read for the new player than TT; the iconography is extremely readable and the interface does a fantastic job keeping you informed. The core mechanics were already quite involved, and the promised inclusion of hero characters seemed like it was going to further deepen the metagame. 

However, alongside the hero updates, the developers also made some key changes that appeared to be intended to streamline the game for platforms other than the PC. It seemed as if the game was starting to take shape, someone in development took it to their boss, and was told that it was ""too much"": simplify. This may have been for interface use reasons, or an attempt to preempt the metagame/update cycle by doling out some of these elements over time. Maybe the upcoming Heroes didn't feel ""cool"" enough, so they dumbed-down the rest of the game to make them seem more interesting.

Whatever the case, It felt like the whole game got rolled back in time six months. The player base was suddenly deprived of a sizable chunk of the mechanics they had learned, and what was offered instead was a flimsy single-player ""campaign mode"" which you could sleepwalk through, for the most part. The new hero units also incorporated an element of further randomness that was a bridge to far and ultimately threw the game balance out-of-wack in many respects. The interface got really buggy and unstable, which seemed to be due to it having to be touch-compatible. 

If I had to guess, someone at Valve figured there might be some huge untapped audience for Auto-Battlers, but when it didn't materialize in during Beta the project got scuttled. It's a shame, because some real talent went into this.

It would be great if whoever's got their hand on the controls handed this abandoned game off to some precocious dev and let 'em run wild with what Valve's left laying around."
516,"i dont like some parts of this game, like the hero thing, the paywall to play the city stuff, but its a ok game."
517,"It's an ok game and I like it more then original DOTA tbh. BUT there are couple of things I don't like about it too keep playing: 
1. messy design of battles. too much colorful stuff happening on screen during battle and it is impossible to keep track whats going on until its over. I enjoy watching the process but here its just a colorful mess of fx thrown in your face all together. 
2. in quick match its hard not just to level up your chars but even equip some items you get and compare what they do and what you need at the moment. Maybe when you knew all of them it is not a problem, but it would be cool to have auto-equip feature if you messed up putting items on your chars.
3. compared to dota2 there is not enough chars and content in general. I mean simplicity is good to start playing it but in couple of hours you know 80% of heroes and what they do so it becomes boring quick.
4. also I just don't like perspective of view of gamecam. it would be much better to zoom it up in spectator mode or look from different angle.
It is just first impression after couple of hours. I could change my mind about it. But for now I know better auto-battlers then this so... yeah. :)"
518,Abandoned.
519,"Fun game but valve choose to abandon this game.

what a waste."
520,.
521,"Never gets updates or any new content. Developers (valve) gave up on it, even though this game had a good following at one point."
522,enjoyable free to play game that's deep in strategy.
523,"If this game had more support it could be a ton of fun, as is its a good time."
524,"I like this game very much 
"
525,RIP
526,"Even tho this game developers and funding got thanos snapped, it still feels quite nice to play."
527,Unplayable under Linux. The game won't even start.
528,this game sucks
529,"A really amazing game even if you are not into auto-chess or strategy-based games. Sadly, it's hard to play since there aren't any upcoming updates or anything, so the game is pretty much dead."
530,Yep
531,"Great Game, it went great for a couple years, and then Devs / Valve decided to lock it like a Sims in a room with no door and just watch it slowly die..... why ?"
532,cool
533,good shit
534,I simply love the games mechanics!
535,coffee and chill
536,Good but hard
537,"Yes and no
But dead"
538,The game is dead. This is too bad. It was a great game when it went out then it just started to go downhill. Now it's rock bottom.
539,luv
540,"""Game is perfect no need for more updates"" - Gandhi, probably."
541,Extremely fun and addicting auto battler. Shame it's completely left for dead by Valve...

547,Pretty fun
548,I miss this game.  Had a lot of fun playing duos with friends but it hasn't been updated in over a year now.  My girlfriend even played it with me and it's near impossible to get her to play any games :(
549,nice game

559,Was a fun game. To bad they let it die with neglect.
560,Nope. Absolutely nope.
561,Whoever makes the decisions for game balance should probably be replaced. Game has been out for years and it's never come close to anything that makes sense. Finally deleting the game instead of giving it a chance every few months.

563,"the game mechanic is good,but need patch. please valve this game has potential"

I wish it was a full on combat mode you can do against other people."
571,Abandonware should be removed from steam
572,nice game time pass game
573,Absolutely Perfect
574,huyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
575,"Was a great game,  Would recommend except they stopped supporting it about 1.5yrs ago.  Not sure why valve so lazy, bad management I guess.  Would be easy for a team of 3 people part time to keep it going...  Weird work ethic at valve.  Surprised they let such a polished game go to waste."
576,"Just like any other auto chess game, horrible interface and gives no information on what is going on."
577,"Auto Chess inspired by WOW. Look, it is a simple game, easy to start and understand. Look online for Meta builds, but overall game is luck based and strategy/skill based. Balanced. Updates happen periodically to keep game balanced and fresh. Fun to play for casual gaming. Easy to stream. Recommend to all players, great way to navigate into actual Dota2 gaming."
578,yes
579,cool game
580,made the original worse with every update. now it dies. sadge
581,trash
582,"Runs fine natively on Ubuntu. That's why I prefer it over TFT. The loading times are faster, too."
583,good game
584,"Fun strategy game! Pretty simple and fast, but with really cool unit mechanics from the DOTA universe."
585,"too much chance involved. i was at the last stage versus a guy who had 2 life left, i had 90, but he got two, three star units, we battled until i was 5 health, then on the last round i lucked out and finally got a three star unit and won........"
586,Abandonware - last best playable state was in beta.
587,Gud
588,It's a good way to kill some time.
589,"I just realized that I never wrote a review for Underlords, so here it is.  I loved this game, and still do play it from time to time (you can play it on your phone and there is still a surprisingly active player base).  The UI and animations are so fluid compared to all the other auto-battlers.  Then Valve just abandoned the game COMPLETELY.  The last balance/content update was even put together by a freelance player/programmer (TinMan), and he did an incredible job, but they couldn't even try to make that a semi-regular thing.  So LAZY, so incredibly frustrating and bizarre, makes me highly unlikely to ever touch any game produced by Valve again."
590,"Great game but abandoned, if you want content updates and dev interaction, go to teamfight tactics. I like Underlords better, but what can you do? the game has stagnated."
591,asdasd
592,Good Game.
593,"it was a great game,then they started to add easier gameplay methods and lost the community.Last update is at January 29 2021.If you want to play a couple of hours once in a while its perfect,but if you want to play consistenly every day you will force uninstall it for sure.Its dead."
594,"Great game, but real chess is going to get an update sooner"
595,An enjoyable experience. Drastically different to the Dota Games Series in my opinion; uniquely engaging.

That is what this game is now, stale bread that no one wants. Sad"

It's still quite fun, despite being unbalanced towards some fairly useless or hard to get alliances (Fallen & Void above all *cough cough*), but in ranked standard matches I managed to win/lose to someone using all of the remaining formations, even with Mages, so it could've been a lot worse, I suppose.
In my opinion, there could be at least two ways to get Underlords back on track while attracting new players: first, by adapting the game to the Steam Deck just like Dota 2 and presented alongside it at launch; a second and maybe more promising way could be continuing to expand the Dota lore by managing to have White Spire and the four competing Underlords with Mama Eeb in a new season of Dota: Dragon's Blood or something. I mean, if it worked for the MOBA, why not give the auto chess a chance? It could and should be a lot better than this."
694,"Zero balance, zero updates etc .... SAD !"
695,Volvo forgot this :(
696,"A good game with great potential, sad that it had to end the way it ended."
697,Best game ever!
698,"This was one of my favorite games. It felt so fluid, and the singleplayer campaigns were fun for when I didn't feel like grinding out ranked. I completed the White Spire twice, and finished all of the Newspapers. And then, Valve left. Maybe it was how popular the competitors were getting, or maybe they couldn't find a way to stuff it full of crates with cosmetics, but like a fart in the wind they just dropped the project entirely. Much like TF2, even though this is an amazing game it wouldn't be right to give a good review to this. They could at least be responsible and say that they are going to stop supporting this game instead of the usual Valve radio silence."
699,one of my favorite game more than 3k hours ^_^
700,still better than tft

704,The most fun game I've played in this genre.
705,ASD
706,nice
707,fun and addictive once you figure out the mechanics
708,Good but through the time it gets boring and boring
709,You don't have to worry about teammate yelling at you
710,good game
711,"Fun game, better game if I've won once."
712,"Nothing more fun than playing games during work,but it's also dangerous, especially when this game can't be windowed."
713,I like the art in it better than other games in the same genre.
714,"My strategy is to copy the winner's lineup in last round, but the things is ,with the same lineup, I can't cause the same damage, this is quite frustrating."
715,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
716,better than dota2 at least
717,Fun game. Maybe. Updated and patched to fix imbalances? No. Avoid if you don't know what to play. Go Team Tactics or other chess related game.
718,I can't stop.
719,This game is easily addictive.
720,"Fun an strategic, although it could be less friendly to newbies"
721,"This game is magic, I constantly lost and constantly wants to play again."
722,"Fun and addictive, love this game!"
723,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
724,Best auto-chess variant
725,"WTF Valve?

I really like this game but obviously you have given up on this game :(

:( :( :( :("
726,Very fun and easy to throw hours into
727,"GOOD but bad update with removed mechanic
"
728,Developers abandoned the game
729,"I love the game, but its been abandoned and feels stale. Play Autochess instead, that still updates. I'm unhappy with the situation, as I loved this game, but the lack of content has killed advanced play."
730,It crashed three times in the span of 15 minutes. I have never had a game crash this much. GL
731,Top
732,they killed this after just 1.5 years of being on steam lmaoo
733,Classic Valve dead game
734,Please update more contents for this game.
735,"What happen to this game

it went from peak 200000 player to 2000 player  

"
736,"No frequent updates, even just for the maintenance fix for the program. When it crashes, it is still running even if you tried to end task the application. You'll end up restarting the whole unit just to make it work again. The program itself is buggy."
737,Nicre game for time to time playing
738,Fun game. No content/Updates.
739,"Valve won't update the game anymore so GG to the last 4 guys playing this game, just like Artifact it's DEAD."
740,"I've been playing for just over a year, I have never seen this game given any developer attention and it appears to be abandoned by Valve. The game itself is basic, but entertaining. 

The only reason I play this game is that it's ""lite"" enough that it can be played on Satellite Connections, which makes it unique as far as multiplayer games go - most will just do a token attempt at connecting before failing, even for turn-based games. Riot's Teamfight Tactics is probably one of the worst offenders in that category for ""games that don't need as good a connection as they demand"" I would much prefer to play TFT if it worked. Beyond this, I don't recommend the game if you have a connection that can play something else. I definitely wouldn't recommend spending money on it with the devs abandoning it in this manner.

EDIT: Should also note that Valve recently updated the game and the ONLY update was extending the Battle Pass expiration until 2032 - which is an odd way of saying ""RIP"" This was done without any other announcement or info. 

The game still has loads of active players and it doesn't take me more than a minute (often only a few seconds) to queue up a lobby of players. For this to still be the case after the devs abandoning it for so long... really doesn't speak well to their decision.

UPDATE:
Still playing, still sucks."
741,"dev team fired RIP underlordo 2020-2020
thx volvo"
742,See you guys in 2032 for Season 2
743,fun/love/hate/luck/
744,needs an update indefenitly
745,"I love this game, easy to play with just enough depth.  Could have been truly amazing with more support and an evolving meta that has now become stagnant.  Yet I still play it almost every day, knockout was an awesome addition for a quick 10 to 15 minute match."
746,ahh grape
747,"If you are a under 12 years old go for it!
"
748,Best auto-battler game. Shame that Valve killed it
749,Valve just updated the game just to extend the Battle Pass until [b] 2031. [/b]
750,"So on December 8th, 2021, was the last day the battle pass could be claimed based on the game files. Well they just updated it so the last day to claim the battle pass would be December 8th, 2031. Yes, 2031. It has been over a year since the last update. Hell we haven't even heard from Valve in over a year. 

With this news, the game is basically officially dead. I would still play it, though. It's a great game and you can have a great time exploring all the different strategies. Also the city crawl is basically a bunch of interesting single player content to play.  I think a big kicker is that you can also play this game on your phone. It's probably my favorite mobile game so I'll play it on the go or when waiting for an appointment. The game is completely free to play. The only thing you can buy is a 5 dollar battle pass, so you won't be hindered by grinding for currency or not having the full gameplay experience. There is still a decent player base, so at lower skill levels it's not hard to find a game. Though it has been steadily declining, and the latest news doesn't help with that....

I would say the moment you become tired of the game is when you quit. Because nothing will be coming to freshen the game up. I will unfortunately still be playing this game. I think it's a great game, but with the latest news, I'm not sure I'll be playing for much longer...."
751,"update pls
"
752,the game was good but now got abandoned and the developer just left it
753,"This was a really fun game back when it was being updated. 

If you want something like it, with consistent patches and innovation, check out Team Fight Tactics. 

RIP to the great, Undies </3"
754,"The game is really fun it had a lot of promise, but just like every other game they make.
They throw it into the world and abandon it immediately before it has a chance to mature.

The game is now dead and has been abandoned for a while.
Well it was a fun experiment."
755,addictive!
756,This game is much better now.
757,"Очень большой вопрос по поводу того, что было сыграно много игр, но их количество и статистика не меняются, все время показывает,  что было отыграно 21 матч, хотя в истории матчей их больше. Статистика тоже не меняется, как было одно Первое и два Вторых, так и осталось, но повторюсь в истории матчей совершенно другая картина. Еще хотелось бы сказать про ""Городской рейд"" после прохождения первой миссии ничего не открывается все время предлагается начать миссию заново. С боевым пропуском тоже не все радужно, удалось прокачать его на два уровня, потому что после выигранной игра очки опыты повышают уровень, но как только выходишь в главное меню, видно, что боевой пропуск не повысился, а остался на том же месте, что и до начала игры и даже после выполнение испытание опыт сначала защитывают, а потом после выхода в главное меню показывается, что испытание не пройдено и уровень боевого пропуска не повышен. Если знаете в чем дело, помогите пожалуйста, буду рад помощи заранее, спасибо.

A very big question about the fact that many games were played, but their number and statistics do not change, all the time shows that 21 matches were played, although there are more of them in the history of matches. Statistics also do not change, as there was one First and two Second, and so it remains, but I repeat in the history of matches a completely different picture. I would also like to say about the ""City Raid"" after completing the first mission, nothing opens all the time it is suggested to start the mission anew. With the combat pass, too, not everything is rosy, we managed to pump it up two levels, because after winning the game, the experience points raise the level, but as soon as you go to the main menu, it is clear that the combat pass did not increase, but remained in the same place as before the start of the game and even after completing the test, the experience is first recorded, and then after entering the main menu, it is shown that the test has not been passed and the level of the combat pass has not been increased. If you know what's the matter, please help, I will be glad to help in advance, thank you."

762,Excellent.
763,Hi dudes.  This game's free and made me feel very good and not doubting about that.!
764,"For VALVE ->
Hi. You guys haven't changed anything in the Underlords for a long time. I understand that you have different priorities. But you have the ability to make this game better with minimal effort. Here are my options on how to balance and make the non-playable alliances playable.

Warriors: Currently, the alliance is generally unplayable. But if you add to the soldiers a 15% / 25% chance to inflict a stun for 1s / 1.5s, the alliance will become good.

Swordsmen: The current 10% / 25% is not enough. The 15% / 35% option would make the alliance playable.

Heartless: -4/9/15 armor can be replaced with -5/10/20

Fallen: An effect that only triggers when the first unit to die should work with all units of this alliance. Then it will make sense to play for this alliance.

Emptiness: you need to increase the chance of triggering from 40% to 50%, and increase the net damage from 4% to 5%, respectively.

P.S. I'm not asking you to waste a lot of time, you just need to change these numbers. Online is constantly falling :(
You will not lose anything, it seems to me, if you make these changes.
Thanks."
765,Good game!
766,"another dead game.

good work."
767,"Instantly got addictive to this after the first match, all set for my weekends"
768,I like it better than LOL
769,its like a chess game with dota 2 gameplay i hope valve going to make new future on this game
770,So so...
771,perfect game to play when you are in an online class
772,"Interface is a mess, it is really hard to understand character attributes, uncomfortable to sell characters.
The ""underlords"" have no real value and just clog up your board, they should be deleted from the game.
Animations, skills and fights are just a blob of something going on, most of what you do not even understand why and when."
773,Abandoned game from devs
774,"I like it, a shame though that it is no longer updated and supported though there are still enough players..."
775,"Most impressive thing about it is that it is free and has a pretty great mobile interface (download on iOS or android store, not steam app; it will connect to your steam account) and is fully cross-platform. It's a satisfying diversion when traveling, home for holidays, etc.

Other than that, it's an autobattler! A complete waste of time. It's a drafting game, so a lot of your success just comes from knowing what's in the deck and how things interact. The game doesn't teach you this, so it takes a lot of either studying or messing around and losing to figure out what's going on. Playing against bots is helpful for the latter because you can pause and think.

A full game can take 40 minutes, though, which is pretty long for a mobile game."

791,"While I have enjoyed playing DOTA:U quite a bit it is clear that Valve has no interest in maintaining this game. The game has stagnated and feels abandoned.

- no more updates for quite a while
- flickering screen on old GPUs on linux

PROS:
- runs on Linux (tested on multiple Arch/Debian distros with old/new vulcan supported GPUs)
- it was fun since realese and had a better UI than Dota2 Autochess
- some dev changes felt like a step back, but at least one had the feeling of work in progress/active development

My concern is when the Steam Deck eventually drops one of Valves own titles will be left behind, and unable to work on the Deck. When I played this on Windows it was still rough around the edges but overall a fun game. Valve seems to be updating it frequently so hopefully works on Linux in the future."

[h1]Summary[/h1]
[quote]Valve's official version of the Dota Auto Chess mod. Dota Underlords is a new stand-alone game that pits you against seven opponents in a battle of wits that will have you building, combining, and leveling-up a crew in a battle of dominance for the city of White Spire. In this game, victory is determined not by twitch reflexes, but by superior tactics.[/quote]

840,This is a visually great game and has fun mechanics. It's a shame player count is low hence no/little update.
841,"I play this one with the MRS and when the little man wants to watch blippi or whatever kids show he's into on the other screen. Super chill game. Sucks they havent made any updates for over a year but I'm sure if they renovated the UI or even added some different alliances, could spice it up. There are obvious META's and the ROI when gambling for your ""given"" crew in a K.O is really what can make/break the game. 

It is satisfying to slap everyone though."
842,"Strategy has nothing to do with it. Just luck. Not a fan of the RNG God. In the past you could choose your Underlord skills. Now you are stuck with two premade options and there is no guarantee you will get the one you need. The game was fun in the past, especially playing Duos, but it has become more and more frustrating. Good idea, good launch, bad follow up."

844,Another failed project. Another negative review in collection.

848,"Yes I would recommend your game :)
You're unlikely to go for years without an update yet

Underlords was built on dynamic updates and rotating heroes or item rosters. Free to play but there's no harm in launching a battlepass with some paid exclusives so the department isn't running at a loss.
I'm a large supporter of DOTA2 so I like to play Underlords when I can't be at the computer or lazy Sunday duos with my partner. It would be nice to see more cross relevance. Perhaps Hobgen or Anessix as a new hero in DOTA?

oh well
...:AetherRay:

It is interesting to notice how the battles will play out in a second on the server and we watch the program drawn. I am not sure if this is correct or exactly the meaning. could have an ultra turbo mode with battle animations disabled....... 🤙"

First couple games of this and I became bored and frustrated, not knowing what I should do to make a stronger team and ultimately losing without any knowledge of what I could do to get better. Second game of TFT and I got 2nd because I was able to easily understand what I could do to make a decent team on the fly and adjust.

871,this is a good game. but unfortunately there are no more updates for this game. both in terms of characters and items. features that have not changed for several years. as if this game had been left to die.
872,Very enjoyable game

879,"It's sad they stopped updating this game. Even though it isn't very competitive, it's fun and you can play it while doing something else. However, if this kind of game doesn't get updates, it becomes boring really quickly. Can't recommend this game until the developers revive the game."
880,like game
881,PLEASE CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT...!!!
882,"yes

884,if the game gets new content i will get 100hr to this game

891,It was fun playing for a while until they stopped updating it. There hasn't been a update for what... 2 years?
892,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend, depression, and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
893,I love this game .
894,"Coming up on a year since last update, getting sick of this patch, pleeeeease devs touch this again"
895,Pretty fun.
896,Unfairly forgotten autobattler. Perfectly fits on mobile phone during breaks. Dreaming about new updates :(

899,??????????????????????
900,Game has no updates. Save your time.
901,"It could have been the greatest, but Valve let it die. No content or patches for a year, probably never getting updated again. Just go play TFT sadge"
902,"This game saved my life.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you!"
903,Have a good time
904,Decent copy of autochess
905,Game is straight up crashing.
906,GOD NO EWWWWWWWWW
907,"This was a great little game, being able to move items and having a much more interaction with the board and units, that was a long time ago now the queue time are long after for some reason they didn't update the game with a new pass or even a new rotation, it just seem like the devs just drop for no real reason and its basicly a dead game now, such a sad thing"

914,Fun but no updates :(
915,Interesting
916,Its fun
917,"Great game and really fun to play. Also a great game to play while you are watching movies or listening to audiobooks. Sadly valve has abandonned it a few months after release failing once again to understand what people want. Even tho people still play it 2 years later, i just hope they start updating the game and add some new content because its a waste if they let it die completly. Meanwhile the League and hearthstone auto chess games are still getting updates and seasons, sadly they are not as good as underlords or the orignal auto chess."

After a single game I knew I never wanted to play it again."
935,10/10
936,THIS GAME SO AMAZING
937,"Even if it is abandoned by Valve, this game is the best auto-battle game since it has been launched and even now that it doesn't have any update since 2020.

Developer team, please come back and bring this game to its peak once again."
938,Games abandoned.
939,7.5/10
940,"Underlords has a lot of quality assets, good sound effects, interesting balance etc and it looked way more professional than it's main competitor Teamfight Tactics, that was a year ago. They haven't updated this game for a year. Meanwhile Teamfight Tactics has continued development, they have changed their meta multiple times, even added innovation to many systems. 

The characters in Underlords are more interesting, the audio diversity is still better, the balance is more accurate (but not as fun as most autobattlers), everything else is inferior and outdated at this point. This game is stagnant and dead.

Extremely disappointing, don't waste your time. Valve, wtf."
941,WHERE'S THE UPDATE!?
942,AWESOME GAMEE!!! its the best game for this genre
943,"Best game ever, PLZ UPDATE"

954,"Really needs a new update, game got stale a very long time ago now."
955,.
956,"while playing, info panel is hard to see or it will cover the main battle.
The color to realize which group heroes is not good to see."
957,Best played with duos.
958,"i'm new to auto chess players, and found this one to be the easiest one to follow along and play and I felt like I kind of learned a bit while playing.  I can't say that about tft. would like to learn more :) The graphics are not too bad."
959,Real easy to learn up front and gradually master it at your own pace. Incredibly fun and entertaining for a Battle-Chess style game with DOTA characters and items. The Standard style play begins slow but can speed up quickly with the right (or wrong) matchups so it does go deeper into the skill-cap if you're willing.
960,"Game's been completely dropped, hasn't seen an update since November 21, 2020. Most likely won't see one in the future, the way Valve operates. SadFace, had a lot of potential to be fun, but developers couldn't be bothered.

Stil a decent game if you need something you can pause and walk away from at a moment's notice (It IS free after all)."
961,"was better as a mod, only split off to make money.  actual strategy is minimal, some games like real chess manage to be simple and deep, this is simple and shallow."
962,"very nice combination team skill, need more abundant characters"
963,nice game
964,one of my favorite game for fun
965,I mean yeh lol its good lmao eat dick fab

Having so much fun!"
967,"I've been playing since the release, after a lot of patches killed the game.
Also, she is not being followed just for nothing!"
968,"This is a fun game got many hours of enjoyment
Sadly doesn't look like they do anything with it anymore tho
Update please"
969,"Games last too long, and they are not really fun.  Confusing UI,  play a different auto-chess"
970,"Nobody is gonna read this anyway, and I can't find any other safe place to save my PC's password, so I will just write it here:-
""suckyourmum"""
971,"Game doesn't work like majority of the time. Not sure, what the heck happened. You install it, you play it. Everythings fine. you close it. And now you can no longer launch the game anymore. it feeds you with a shader error or something? And you have to reinstall it. lame."
972,good turn base game
973,"It crashes all the time for me, and I got a good rig. Dont know whats happening yet, and need to investigate further (drivers ?).
But as of now it's not really enjoyable to me."
974,abandoned son of valve
975,nice
976,"1) Game has not received a major update in over a year despite the fact that a casual player will be able to see that certain units and alliances are simply significantly better than others. Most successful compositions have a shortlist of units and alliances.
2) AI is very poor at the best of times, making it a crapshoot as to whether or not the units you have will decide to simply kill an enemy or bring it down to 1hp and then move onto another unit while ignoring the 1hp unit."
977,I want to play this game
978,"An autobattler where you build teams out of Dota heroes. I like the core gameplay enough, but the single player side gets annoying at the higher end with difficult battles that need specific counters to beat, and the multiplayer is no longer being actively supported by the developers so it looks like it will be Season One forever."
979,good
980,"This game has been forsaken , no more update since Nov 2020"
981,Last update was 21/11/2020 that is why i stop playing

Unfortunately after one major update, our knowledge were all obsolete and we couldn’t even reach top 4.  Been forced to re-learn all heroes after major updates is not fun."

997,Took me 30 hours to beat my first game lol. Don't go on the swag of the characters. Stack co existing toons.
998,i prefer chess.com
999,A very satisfying game. Not too time consuming and doesn't require too much focus.
1000,A good autochess style game with enough tactics / synergies to keep it interesting for a while. Fun playing with friend against each other and bots. Pity they dont keep updating though and rotate in other characters. This would refresh it and make it have longer lasting appeal.
1001,niceeee

It stands out in its simplicity.

1024,"I've spent over 2k hours on this game so I think I am pretty qualified to leave an honest review. Firstly. Do not download it. It's a completely unbalanced, fully based on rng game. Your input has little to no difference, especially once u claim higher ranking. Once u on the level were everybody on your ranking knows the game plans, knows how to and when to roll, when to level: RNG kicks in strong. Game hasnt been touched since last year November, so that sums it up. The fractions that suppose to counter other fractions, dont really do it.(Hello 6 magicians that suppose to be counter by 4 scaled, not the case at all, or assassins that suppose to counter healers).   Leveling up your characters to 3 stars (of u got those 6 characters on level 3, it doesnt matter m8, u get ruined by the guy that has level 10, with 5 level 1 characters.)  You could be winning all the fights, yet one stupid behaviour from one of your characters and your round is completely lost. Even the single target spells by some of your characters are complete rng, so you have to fully rely on rng that crystal maiden or that shadow deamon will target that level 3 character, that your crew needs to get rid of first. This results in absolute rng with battle outcomes. It had a great potential, Valve first ruined the autochess game by adding 3 underlords that completely changed the whole game play(hence why players just literally deserted from the game, cuz all the current game plans and set up were suddenly irrelevant), then gets rid of the one of the most interesting fractions (goblins, warlocks), and then just abbondons the game. I even bought a battle pass, thats how much I wanted to get to succeed, cuz I thought it had potential."

1039,If you want a game you can play casually or seriously that is built well enough as other games such as dota....this is great. the gameplay is interesting and what auto-chess games have become now. The big point I enjoy is the fact this has been ported and cross-platform plays to tablets as well.
1040,ta chulito

1050,"As everyone else says, the game has been all but abandoned. There has been no new content, no bug fixes, no balance patches, no updates of any kind in nearly a year. Per Valve standards, there have been no communication about the game's future either. 

Underlords was an interesting concept that had potential to build on the lore and universe of DOTA 2, but ultimately failed to find it's footing due to lack of interest from players and developers alike.

Can't recommend playing it now, especially as I'd sooner expect them to shut the servers down than give it the facelift it needs."

1148,THIS GAME REQUIRED BRAIN TO PLAY. MAKE SURE TO HAVE ONE BEFORE INSTALL.
1149,"Valve’s response to Riot’s Teamfight Tactics auto-battler since they need to have a competitor. At their core, they play the same but there are plenty of little things that differentiate them (I have not played TT so I don’t know the specifics). The gameplay is fairly casual and revolves around buying heroes, forming the right alliances and just letting the battle play out. After you figure everything out it can easily be played in the background on autopilot. 

Your knowledge of what heroes and alliances do is what will make or break the game. So you do need to devote quite some time to reading and remembering all the different hero abilities and alliance combinations. Since the hero buy pool is always random and all available units are shared between all players, units that you need may be hoarded by other players. So you need to have multiple builds figured out, work with what you have and adapt on the go. Because of this, there is a big amount of luck on whether you or your opponents will end up with the winning combinations. Some will like this and others won’t, I am in the latter.

Also, it doesn’t look like the game is being actively worked on - the last update was in November 2020. I can understand why since the only revenue stream is from a cheap battle pass and the playerbase is only at around 4k. Healthy amount but maybe not enough to invest more resources in development. Regardless though, if the gameplay sounds appealing to you and you care to put in the time to learn all the different combinations, the game can still be enjoyable."

1161,"Fun to play
"
1162,aye aye sir!!!
1163,"Would be a good game but looks like the developers have given up on it and stopped updating it so it becomes boring once you work out the best combinations. Barely ever lose if I play the same team and this is ""high ranked"" as well."
1164,"very good game, the graphic is good and sound is very good.
the hero is very different and so fun to play,
also it's connected to the mobile server and make the play more fun."
1165,Doesn't seem to receive updates anymore.
1166,"During the time this game was being regularly updated, it was a very good one. Now it's just another abandoned valve project."
1167,"been playing since beta, has been very fun game that requires you rly to focus to your build. smooth game with nice graphics and lots of playable units and different build possibilities, maybe requires still some more balancing but overall very entertaining game"
1168,Best Chess Game Ever.
1169,I LOVE SLARKYMALARKIE
1170,"Good game for those who liked TFT and auto chess. Gameplay is well described and user friendly. However, there is 1 fatal flaw to this game; after release, there was only a couple of updates which which made significant changes to the meta and hero pool. As a result, users are either using the same heroes and lords over and over again, not to mention the battle pass is not renewed in any way whatsoever."
1171,"Possibly the most RNG game made to date, shaman alliance = wins or you get a lvl 3 slark with satanic GGWP shittest game would not recommend."
1172,"The Devs straight up disappeared, there hasnt been an update in over a year"
1173,great
1174,"no complaints honestly. It's a solid lil strategy game and whether i win or lose I'm usually having a good time, and winning a game is very rewarding."

1183,Update this game ffs
1184,Just plain fun. Honestly better than Team Fight Tactics.
1185,"This game is dead. This game was abandoned by the developers almost a year ago.

Do yourself a favor and play something else."

1189,Update please!!
1190,10/10 dead game
1191,"Not awesome

devs do not add meaningful content
no meaningful patches
might as well be single player"
1192,Dota Underlords is a game where you will be placing heroes in a position where it will be defending its area of responsibility until such time that it will eliminate all of its opponents
1193,too long for autogames
1194,bad game
1195,Update the game for new content
1196,"Plz don't give up on underlords, it has always been my favorite auto chess, best graphic, best racial connection system, best spawn, this game is always the best game for Dota players. It has been more than 1 year since the last update, i haven't given up on you, please don't give up yourself, i'm still waiting for your next update. Give those copycat HELL."
1197,"i just tried that game, i can say everything is nice! cross-platform that means we players don't have a PC's can play that game just trough their phones, and there are offline modes, co-op etc... the game is so great to be honest:)"
1198,"Fun and addictive game!
would have been great without cheaters!"
1199,It's a great game but valve refuses to support their games LMAO
1200,Team Fortress 2 Treatment
1201,"not waste of time, atleast"

Autochess games requires update, doesn't need to be THAT often; like at least an update every semester??? But nah, Valve straight up threw this perfectly good game to a ditch. Play Teamfight Tactics instead, at least Riot Games care about their Autochess."

It was a good game once, but not anymore until they decide to update it once again."
1238,A new way to easily become friends in steam without the 5$ transaction XD
1239,Nicest autochess game. Need some updates and disconect fixing. Thanks!
1240,Just a really fun game with a good amount of randomness and strategy. Sure there hasn't been a real update in almost a year but I still enjoy playing it.

1245,"[h1] Sadly a dead Game [/h1]

I liked this game a lot when it first came into closed beta. From there it went all the way down to where it is now. Very small player base, no patches since (i think) November 2020, bad game balance and very bad graphics.

2/10 because i had some fun hours with it when it was in closed and open beta..."
1246,fun game if you wanna do other things like eat or just listen to music
1247,when we gonna get a damn update valve???
1248,update？？
1249,just play
1250,"Game is dead, was good when it came out but the lack of new elements made it too boring too quick, I can't believe the good reviews in a dead game, bots?"
1251,good game when your just chilling
1252,"Coulda been better. Seems unbalanced. Not sure if devs will be updating this to correct a lot of the issues. That's just my gameplay critique. Obviously, the battlepass option that gives minimally interesting cosmetics and board effects is... lame.

Looks like valve just popped out an autochess to get in on the zeitgeist. Coulda been a lot better."
1253,less time to buy your heroes in the match than the last update
1254,good game
1255,Good game
1256,i love this game but for duos play its so long finding match. damn!!
1257,GOated
1258,"Why Valve has essentially abandoned development on this game is beyond me. Could easily be the best game in its genre, if it's not already."
1259,Too complex and too random for my taste.
1260,"Great game unfortunately it has been ignored by Valve for a long time now.
It's a bit to heavy on the RNG at times"
1261,ALL I NEED IS A NEW UPDATE. PLS VALVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1262,dead game
1263,"Don't listen to this guys saying its a dead game,its not, a lot of people are still playing and you will find a game in seconds.Main problem of the game is RNG,the more lucky you are,the more wins you will get.Too much dependance on luck is never a good thing.Developers need to come back to this master piece and make it even better with updates,all in all good time killer,with some more development it can be perfect."
1264,Toxic and yet fun
1265,"need some works valve more heroes designs some adjustments. update this game or this will be garbage game
"
1266,"I am convinced this game is full of hackers. If not , then Valve should really start balancing the LUCK/RNG on this game. It is hard to believe that China and Russia alwats has the best ""LUCK"" in this game."
1267,nice game bro
1268,please update the game. VALVE ..what are you doing? its a good game and you fuckeeed up.
1269,"There was no balance and there is none.
The first to win is the one who collects slacker 2-3 earlier than the others.
Apparently no one needs to fix it.

And so in general to kill your life for 10-20 hours is suitable"
1270,"game goblok, roll nggak jelas"
1271,"This game is very good, because it can be done when time is boring"
1272,no updates since 2020 damn
1273,Stupidly addicting
1274,"Amazing game :)

Edit: hope we can get new updates for this game. New Alliance etc. :)"
1275,"I like the game and still playing it. however, since the last update, valve seems to forget about this game and let the game die but the community remain loyal. its kinda sad to be honest, the game have potential, they should observe and learn from other game and bring back the community"
1276,5
1277,Great game but Valve just ditched it with no word what so ever.
1278,Just boring. Maybe not my genre.
1279,nocie one
1280,"Great for wasting a few minutes. Not too much brain work involved, but enough involved to keep you busy."
1281,Addicting to play.
1282,"I really like this game. As a DotA fan of over a decade, I really have to say I think the concept is amazing, not that it was original, but it is extremely polished and provides a unique view of DotA. The only issue is, I don't recommend investing a ton of time or money into this game for a couple reasons:
1) There is very little support for Dota Underlords from Valve at this point in time. This means, new heroes and alliances are unlikely to come to Dota Underlords anytime soon if at all, and even the battle pass is reused each season now.
2) After an update about a month ago now I also get random crashes, the game just freezes. It's weird because I play DotA 2, Cyberpunk, Apex, and a lot of other graphic intensive games on my PC but dota underlords is the only one giving me crashes right now.

IF, like me, you want something to play mindlessly while watching netflix or hulu sometimes, go for it, totally worth the download. It's free so if you want to space out and not focus too much on a game, it's worth the download. If you are wanting to grind to be good at it, or to get a bunch of cosmetics, or whatever else, there are a lot of better games for that imho.

TL;DR
Don't download it unless it's for when you want to mindlessly mess with something while you watch netflix."
1283,nice
1284,Getting my ass clapped but i really enjoy the butt f******g
1285," Positive review just because i had a good time playing with a friend. It was good, i had a good time playing it on pc and phone. They gave a lot of attention to it, gave a lot of patches and one day they just... stopped. Last patch was on November, no balance, no cosmetics, no nothing. I guess autochess is not that popular anymore and Valve just left.
"
1286,this is most relax game i hope u enjoy it
1287,"When this game was being updated, it was a very good game.  As others have mentioned, there has not been a single update since November last year.  Hence the game has grown stale."
1288,You can play this game and chill with music at the same time. Great game :))))
1289,Great game to spend you free time.
1290,"This is a great strategy game in the auto-chess genre that I have played and enjoyed for many hours. If you like HS BG or TFT but want a different take on the genre, look no further than DOTA Underlords."
1291,"it been half a year since the last update, valve makes the game dead already"
1292,This sucks. Even TFT is better.
1293,abit of dota knowledge and it can kill time without being tired like playing dota2.
1294,my gf left me

1296,This really just isn't fun. Valve seems to agree considering they've seemingly abandoned development for it.
1297,"Great fun, both the npc and online battles. No ""punishment"" if you suddenly have to run which is great if you have kids :)"
1298,not as intriguing as the beta version to many heroes less update
1299,"After 8 months, unfortunately it is obvious that it is out of development. I wish I could play it but it has gotten so routine it isn't even worth it anymore. Bring it back after TI guys, maybe I can have fun with it again :("
1300,The game was great until Steam left it for dead. no updates since Nov 2020. so sad.
1301,Dead game that not even balanced
1302,relaaaxxxxssszzz
1303,yes
1304,"You would think that the series used to make auto chess popular would stand at the top of the genre. Well, you would be oh so wrong. 

Underlords, despite being one of the first auto chess games on the scene after the death of dota auto chess, has fallen into irrelevancy after being abandoned by the devs. The game is still playable but nowhere near what it was at launch. Along with a still shrinking player base and going over a year without a single update, under lords is pretty much dead. 

Tl;Dr: Go play TFT"
1305,"Great game, need more attention from devs tho. no update in a year wtf!"
1306,"The game had an okay run, heck! It even had a crossover mobile release... 100x times better then that one card game. Pretty weird that it got abondoned soo fast. If you're an auto chess enthusiast I recommend looking somewhere else. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1307,Should get more updates and chages in builds. Clunky at times.
1308,good autochess game and the single player is decent as well just for fun/practice
1309,really fun. You donjt have to know anything about dota. not complicated. anyone can pickup and play and do well
1310,IDK HOW TO SAY
1311,great game
1312,Good Era
1313,Did this game die?
1314,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1315,The game is so good and idk why the have stopped working on this project
1316,This game desperately needs updates.
1317,A delightfully fun game to pick up and play for little bits at a time or really sit down and grind for hours. I like a game that gives you everything you need to be successful up front. It's easy enough to learn and gives you lots of opportunity to experiment and find out what works best to win. There's not a huge amount of variety once you settle on your playstyle but it's more than enough fun for a free game.
1318,good
1319,"They really abandoned this game, server lag is HORRIBLE.  I've been a long time player but there's just no reason to play this one anymore"
1320,"Great game, just a shame valve isn't doing any updates. whish they would hand it over to the community"

1325,BCUS THEY DONT UPDATE THE DAMN GAME
1326,good stuff
1327,Great fun with friends even just against bots. An update would be nice.
1328,"RIP Dota Underlords, the dev team tried to change the game too dramatically and too often and I feel the lack of stability was what drove out the community. It's hard to stay attached to the game when everything you've learned is removed every couple weeks. 

I played this game mostly before they tried to shove the Underlords onto every board, and it was a really solid autochess variant with the focus being on the heroes. Good synergies and either playing for board or loss streaking in the early game into trying to nab the strong 4-5 stars and fit them onto your board before other people could get them in the late game.

Many people have their own complaints about the game but the one that made me stop playing was the poor introduction of the underlords themselves, they took away from the decision making process instead of adding to it because there will always be an objectively best underlord so long as you pick underlords before the game begins. A good autochess game is a fast test for your ability to calculate odds, evaluate the worth of different units/teams and make quick but good decisions about your board. Almost none of the changes the team made increased the depth of the game, if anything they made it more shallow, having power packed into a staple character that you always start the game with severely hurts the variety of directions you can go with teambuilding and makes that team you were so excited to make feel less distinct.

There are plenty of good autobattlers on the market, this one just couldn't match the competition. It was fun while it lasted."
1329,Nice game!
1330,GG
1331,Never ever i had a game that crashed that often! I dont know how many matches i have lost because the game crashed 3-4 times in a row and i could not do anything.
1332,"Well at the time I write this review the game pretty much dead by now, but hey at least it let you play with bot"
1333,fun in small - medium doses
1334,good but not bad
1335,"This game is ""heavily inspired"" by the Dota 2 community created game Dota Autochess.
Apparently (((VALVE))) decided it was worth to give up on other projects for a while and develop Underlors to get that dough.
It brings some of the well known dota 2 universe heroes into the yada yada you know it who the fuck gives a shit.
This game is completely garbage. Like all games that play themselves and require little to no effort to be played.
Don't get me wrong, i get that this game is, in fact AUTO chess and i get what it's trying to do.
Point is, it does not even do it well. 
Of all the faction synergies and heroes combos, only a very limited few are viable if you want to win. The meta varies every now and then but still remains the same: Get X heroes of X faction and X of that other factions and you win *literally* automatically. 
Funniest part is that even after studying the meta and bs like that, you still can't ensure a win as all the hero drafts are COMPLETELY RANDOMIC.
This game requires no skill to be played, just luck and a bit of current meta's knowledge.
The only thing about ""Dota"" in this game is the universe it's set in.
But please, if you are into wasting time watching some AI controlled characters fight each other while you hopelessly continue to press the ""Refresh shop"" button go ahead, give this ""game"" a try.
Also it's no longer getting updated, i think. I've checked this game twice in a year (one at the start and one at the end) and nothing had changed.
Fucking Valve

1372,this auto-chess is really good. i love playing duos mode which other auto-chess game don't have. but i think this game needs some update heroes. or set all heroes is available for play maybe(?)
1373,Chill game :)
1374,"Much fun, many polish"
1375,so good
1376,good
1377,go back to fortnite
1378,"I love Dota and i like this game so much but please update something... Feel so disappointed if the rumor ""Underlord is the newest trash of Valve"" came true... >""<
"
1379,Great game. Too bad Valve seems to have thrown it into trash like Artifact.
1380,do yourself a favor and let this genre rest in peace
1381,Needs a VR plugin for new dimension. Worth a play. It does scratch an itch. And can keep the kids busy for a few hours.
1382,fucking remove hero and add hero again and again do for nothing this game like a game card why need meta game card fucking stupid to do
1383,"Absolutely TEEMING with hackers/cheaters 
RNG based, so don't go expecting your actually gonna win consistently or strategically.
Kinda buggy at times (models moving in ways they shouldn't)

However, good to kill time with. If you don't have another time killer to play, this is a decent one. Just don't go expecting fair gameplay going in. Guarantee you if there was a chat function, it would be just as toxic as Dota 2."
1384,I WAS HERE
1385,"Pretty casual, fun to play"
1386,Great game!
1387,please update and make game more interesting
1388,"[b]Edit, May 2022:[/b] This game is still excellent and Valve still haven't touched it. 9/10 and 0/10. It's now been two years. 

Very fun, plays well as both a casual or competitive idler/auto battler - deceptively simple yet devilishly complex, in classic Valve fashion the game's characters, game modes, logic, voices, strategy and art are all top-notch, while [i]also[/i] in classic Valve fashion, it's been simply ghosted and no sign of even bug fixing updates has been seen for six months. Very likely Underlords will end up with the same fate - or lack thereof - as TF2. 

Grab it to have something fun for your free moments at work, or as a Dota fan, and get used to Spirit, Knight and Heartless alliances being meta. Otherwise, hard pass for an auto-battler that the devs [i]actually[/i] keep up-to-date. 

I recommend this game; however I'm choosing not to recommend due to the utter, sudden, total silence from Valve. We may not have the right to tell you what you should update, when, for how long - but that doesn't mean we shouldn't complain when you give us something great, then let it rot in our hands."

1398,Pure luck based
1399,Saying that I like this game makes me feel like Jerry when he and morty get abducted by Plutonians. Could've been good with more updates.
1400,good
1401,"Quite addictive little game, would recommend it to anyone liking strategy and fun :)"
1402,"Was great before when the developers cared enough to update. Nowadays, it's good for looking at and thinking ""Ah, classic Valve."""
1403,a great game to pass the time
1404,Good stuff!
1405,Need to try
1406,good
1407,:)
1408,Really a good casual game for those who are familliar with dota
1409,"If u have no good pc, and if u love dota but u r bored of toxic people and have no time to play full match this is the best game for you .."
1410,"Game had potential, was fun for quite some time, but they left the game on a very boring meta and stopped updating it, last update was ~6 months ago, you can only play same strats for so long until you blow your brains out, if you are new and never tried i would recommend to try it, but since game is dead i cant generally recommend it."
1411, meh
1412,yes
1413,"A huge problem with this game is the graphics, it doesnt really look real, more like a highly skilled painter was painting it before your eyes. Cool and all, but this is a video game, not a fine arts museum."
1414,Pretty good but needs frequent update.
1415,good

1420,This is the way.
1421,Fun game to kill time. 7/10
1422,"Dog, woof  woof."
1423,"Dota Underlords is a bad strategy game. The combination of RNG, high speed, and lack of hotkey controls means whoever is faster wins the game, which means it's not a good strategy game. Contrast this to Age of Empires 2, where speed is adjustable, hot keys provide easy controls, and strategy is more important."
1424,"Given Valve's treatment of Artifact i don't know what i expected but this game is abandonware.
Which is sad given how it was actually a lot of fun when it first released and then destroyed by updates."
1425,"good game, would be nice to see occasional patches"
1426,yes
1427,Great game
1428,GOOD TIME WASTER
1429,"It is a very fun game, although it randomly freezes during the game play. I have tried several times to re/install the game, it keeps happening."
1430,"- Looks like shit 
- Crashes all the time 
- Removed a lot of complexity from original autochess
- Adding hero to the game feels out of place
- cringe themes"
1431,No
1432,"compared to other same type and genre, this game graphics is one of the best I've played so far."
1433,fgh
1434,Cool
1435,I think it is  a really  good game . Hope Developers can continue develop the program.
1436,"Just not really as good as other AutoChess games out there, and also feels a bit abandoned compared to the sheer number of updates being given to other games such as TFT.

Lots of potential wasted :("
1437,Fun game
1438,0 update. Absolute 0.
1439,"Great game abandoned by developers.
Valve small indie studio."
1440,"abandoned by valve but I love this game, decent ranking system imo. Add a new battle pass!!!!"
1441,the game was slow in early but got intense in late game
1442,"This game is strategic but fun. If you know anyone that plays Dota 2 or even tried yourself and couldn't really get into it then this is the perfect game for you. I wish they were still making improvements on this game, I play it everyday almost religiously."

1450,Fun casual game :D
1451,Good Game
1452,Was fun for some time when it first came out. Now a dead game with no clear future and barely any players.
1453,just bad
1454,"my first experience with autochess genre, i love the content and lore and the game is addictive. countless strategies. i sank a few hours into it : )"
1455,"Updates have dried up with little to no news from the Devs. Many meaningless features like Battlepass and city crawl.

Pros:
1. Excellent interface, UI and polished animations
2. (Not anymore) rotating meta, alliances and heroes
3. Excellent cross compatibility with mobile

Cons:
1. Alliances are unbalanced
2. Small player base
3. Poor balance makes the game more RNG heavy
4. Devs have abandoned the game

Overall, it was a decent game but not anymore. Try other Auto Chess games where the devs and players are active. RIP 900hrs I really enjoyed it while it lasted"
1456,"Valve, what happen to this game? 
I spent lot of time, but this game die :) just lije the old Arti***k"

1458,thoi bien!
1459,but is it as good as dota 2
1460,"if you can play normal dota auto chess do that... if that game still has players to play.

This game is pretty easy to get into and overall is a casual escape. but there are better versions of the game out there. until updates get pushed out to this game to revert it to more of dota auto chess. it will just be an easy grind up to big boss"
1461,"Game is good. Relaxing and fun. Maybe more time between rounds will be better, or a mode with more time between rounds."
1462,"Good enough for a match or two, a day."
1463,Veeery Nice!
1464,very good
1465,"Sadly this game hasn't been updated for quite awhile, It's a shame because this was actually a game that I enjoyed playing every day"
1466,The best time killer game
1467,Good
1468,Game was ok but the mission take a long time to complete and if you don't buy battle pass you will feel like you are missing out on things.
1469,Chimi para pasar el tiempo
1470,Better than tft
1471,Quite inconsistent (i.e. units stats differ per game mode due to not applying updates) and it feels like it has been abandoned by Valve as there is nothing actually changing or getting fixed.
1472,logic is all it takes to master with 99% luck :D
1473,dead
1474,"freezes constantly, unplayable."
1475,boring game and really bad tutorial

AND DOTA SUCKS BIG BALLS MAN JUST TERRIBLE GAME LEAGUE PF ELEGNDS CLEARLY BETTERS . in the past 10 year decades valve has realeased a total of 6 characters meanwhile league of legends the copy pasta of heroes of the storm, has generated 16 million new characteres . you knows what that means ? it means riot the small indie company has put more effort that valve, thhis multi m,illino dollasr companies and that's why smite is the best moba because it is simply the worst moba understood ?"

1513,Realy nice game
1514,"A good casual game, you can have plenty of fun and experiment with different builds and tactics. Very good for mobile."
1515,I played it because I used to love Dota and card games. It was fun while it lasted. I assume it is a dead game now.
1516,Interesting game

Fun`less wasting of time. I'm sorry that this is a game from vALVE."
1518,gud
1519,great game
1520,"The addition of Underlords ruined the game. Gameplay still has not recovered and the system has not been adequately redesigned.

Not entirely sure why they didn't walk back or completely overhaul a change that lost 5/6 of the game's players overnight and completely killed all hype for it. But, that is the reality we live in I suppose. Over a year later and the game still is a shadow of its former self."
1521, . . .
1522,another card game
1523,Seems like its still in its beta phase.
1524,Was a great game. Practically abandoned. Typical Valve.
1525,Nice
1526,Better than tft
1527,Very good strategy and brainstorming game....
1528,"I love this game, but due to the lack of any new content or updates for a WHILE now, I don't think I could recommend it to anyone. Duos was really fun and unlike anything in any other autochess game but good luck actually finding a match. Everyone has gone off to play games that are updated."
1529,"Best game, when your internet sucks and can't play Dota 2."
1530,fun
1531,I don't know why I've started playing this again. but here we are.
1532,4/10
1533,It's definitely frustrating at times but I do enjoy it to pass time.
1534,Good game.
1535,Game is dead nobody plays it guess trash Riot wins again
1536,fun

1538,really time killer
1539,inne the beninging
1540,So many toxic players. Reporting options especially for intentional feeders are not in the options.
1541,Great casual game
1542,"Diamond 2 TFT Player here!
Compared with TFT its nearly the same game but with better graphics (imho). But it seems that the player base is shrinking finding a ranked match at the morning kinda take long time."
1543,"Always gotta love when a developer spends more time on graphics then showing you how to play the game. Instructions are literally here's a unit they merge to get better and they have some synergy but were not going to bother to tell you what they are, Oh and we know your brand new but your going to put you up against people who are 100 plus levels ahead of you because that's fair right?"
1544,"I'll be brief: 

22 hrs played in 3 days
I worked 18 hours during that time
It's good"
1545,really a good game
1546,loveee
1547,First autochess
1548,"I loved this game when it first came out, I've put almost 250 hours into it. The problem I'm seeing is that the dev interaction seems to have just stopped. We were getting constant updates/post but now there hasn't been any word since November. The Retake the City is using a previous build of champion sets/items that aren't even in the main part of the game with the champions that are in both having different set effects than what they actually are. The game is constantly crashing with no reason or error pop up. Champion animations will wig out and glitch breaking till the round is over. Until we get some kind of response from the devs I feel the game is dead."
1549,horrivel
1550,"Even if you know the meta, the foundation of the game is basically RNG, with 20-60 minute rounds that you're  almost guaranteed to lose. I only really started playing cause a friend of mine wanted a duo partner. But hey, at least it's free."
1551,it was fun
1552,"It is a overall a very fun to play game but at some point you might feel that it will feel repetitive. i think this game is one of the top games of the auto chess genre. if you are looking for a game to kill time, then i feel this game will be suited for you."
1553,great game

1563,game is dead
1564,"it is pleased.

WHERE IS THE UPDATE !!!"
1565,I enjoyed playing this game on my surface pro 5 because it supported touch controls but a recent update has killed the graphics engine and its no longer displaying properly.
1566,"Played a lot in the beta and it was great. Now about 1 year later on I came back and it definitely feels different. I think the game in general has become a lot less fun, but I think the fun was removed to make it more balanced, which is understandable. Still a fun game though for sure, but it does need more attention since it could be so much better."
1567,A good game to play in free time between matchmaking in Dota2
1568,"They let it die. If they would just open it up to all of the alliances again it would at least have some replay ability. 

For now avoid it and just play something else until they start updating it again or it shuts down."
1569,A fun game to play when you are bored!!!
1570,good game if u like chess + board game
1571,Dead Game...  Fun while it lasted.

1573,Ok
1574,naysu
1575,One of the best auto battler - just abandoned by valve. Sadge
1576,calm strategy game based on dota.. what else to say
1577,"I wish I could recommend this game. I really wish I could. But I feel like Valve took an idea they didn't create, and without properly knowing what was good about that idea took it in their own direction, which ended up ruining what I enjoyed about the game. I played entirely too much of this when it was in beta, and I enjoyed every minute of it, even when things weren't entirely balanced. The polish Valve put on the game with the interface and coding was just miles above the competition. Perhaps its better now, but TFT wasn't even a game when Riot released it. I feel Valve had a great head-start on the competition, but I feel they're ruined it, and while I don't have access to player numbers, I get the feeling those would back up my claim.

In particular, one of the things that Valve did was add the namesake of the game, the underlords. I can understand the concept, but after playing with them I am not a fan. I understand the idea behind adding consistency to the game, but I think the fundamental concept of the game lacks that consistency, and that's what makes it fun. Sometimes you have to pivot your strategy when something isn't open. Removing other aspects from the game like creep waves makes it feel too fast as well. I can understand the reasoning behind making the game faster, as that could cater to a mobile audience, but it also takes out a lot of the downtime of the game, which I feel helps promote strategy. Auto chess games are hard, and there are a lot of decisions to be made. But without time to make those properly, I feel it removes a lot of what makes the game interesting. 

The final things that makes me disappointed is how the game has evolved to be fast, meaning abilities are constantly flying around and it's hard to tell what is happening on the screen. Again, speeding up the game makes sense, but also the main gameplay is watching your units fight it out, and if you can't tell what's going on, then what's the point? For me, that's the real bummer. I want to clearly see what's going on and what unit targets who, and how the abilities are used. If that makes a battle take ten more seconds, that's fine, because without that, I'm not really sure what the game has left."
1578,Fun game.
1579,Garbage bulshit RNG
1580,quick and fun rng based game to play to pass time
1581,Fix it now pls. no way to play 08.05.2021
1582,"Started as a lovely game, but Valve did what they do. They stopped updating the game since 19 november 2020 without any reason, no explanation, almost a year. Why? It started good, playerbase falled because Riot stupid Games instantly copied this gamemode. Of course. I am sorry for the game, it was fun, but no communication is SOO Valve"
1583,"//e: most issues got fixed or fixed themselves, not sure really.

it's a great game that, sadly, crashes on:
- match start
- trying to reconnect to a match
- early-match
- mid-match
- late-match
- in the menu
- when changing settings
- navigating the menu

unplayable in its current state."
1584,"Until they work on balancing the alliances this game is broken. Don't play it. It's trash. It pigeon holes you into specific setups, if you don't go them and your opponent does you lose. There's no choice. There's the illusion of choice. But some of the things in here have no real counter and if you got a bad roll for units and they didn't, might as well just leave"
1585,"This game is just downright pathetic, on mobile, after some time, game just got diconected from ""Steam"", and if you try to connect back, it just does not connect. I tried everything even instaling ""Steam"" to mobile, nothing works..."
1586,"There is so much more to this game than just RNG, those who complain about RNG can't comprehend the advanced gameplay and they should stick to baby games."

1599,"The game is good, in theory, but it has been long since abandoned. It really sucks that they'd do that to the game. It has ridiculously often crashing and freezing issues, even in offline games. They tore down the ""Classic"" way to play autochess and made it worse. It's hard to keep up with what characters are available in which modes because it's not all of them in every mode. Standard mode got entirely changed and is just awful now. The devs long since abandoned this game and I suggest you do too. TFT is obviously the winner, and these devs know it, so they abandoned ship the moment they lost. Which sucks, because I would prefer this, a simpler autochess game, over TFT. But with all the bugs, lack of clarity, lack of players, and lack of updates, there is absolutely no reason to play this game instead. It is dreadful. There are mobile app autochess games based on nothing with less in them that run better and provide more fun."

1605,"good game
"
1606,"Was looking for a game to play casually against computer AI.   Although this game provides a mechanism for playing against bots instead of PvP, it's still not casual.  It has virtually no time to examine characters to purchase with in-game gold, or to put them into play, before the next match starts.  Why?  If I'm playing against bots, why the rush?!  Terrible and frustrating beginner experience!"
1607,Game mechanism is shit but i cant stop playing it either
1608,its OK i guess
1609,not as good i have in tft
1610,"Originally, a far superior autochess compared to TFT. However, since development has ceased for the past 6 months, it has been completely overtaken by Riot and TFT a company that actually puts development time and effort into their game."
1611,Fun game recommended
1612,"Besides crashing during the ""tutorial"", this sad piece of software appears to target audiences of 6 and under"
1613,easy to play
1614,"This game is a mixed bag.

While it has solid game-play and is genuinely fun at times, its mechanics are what hold it back. The game tries to be both luck and skill based at the same time which is a terrible idea for a game that relies on auto-battling.

I believe the game should focus on being either luck or skill based as the two tend to contradict each other heavily. You can have good positioning and understanding of the mechanics but having to re-roll 10 times just to find the last piece for a weak 3 star hero can lead to being from first place to fifth in a matter of minutes.

If you like luck based games then you'll like this one but for those who want to transition from Dota and want a more skill based experience, I would recommend holding on for the moment or finding a different game which suits your needs.

The game allows you to customize your arena and profile related quirks such as sound effects and dummy targets which are always a welcome bonus.

Update: The inclusion of battlepass/citycrawl is a positive but it's negatives are still present. What used to be a 4/10 can now be considered a 6/10. However I still won't recommend playing it due to how heavy the luck aspect of the game factors in."
1615,PIECE OF SHIT
1616,RNGesus Piece Of Shit...

1638,Great game. Ages since an update tho....

1649,Too addictive
1650,"RIP Underlords, we had some fun. Seems like Valve is done with this project. Onward."
1651,Dota Auto chess is good
1652,Great!
1653,the game is so relaxing and competitive together ! take it and you never regert it. have a nice games
1654,I love dota 2
1655,"I lost my life.
I lost my friends.
I lost my girlfriend.
I lost my personality.
I forgot my hobbies.
I forgot my studies.
I forgot my manners.
And finally, when I thought life would get better, I lost my family.


GGWP 11/10 Would Pay Again."
1656,"I honestly don't see the point in this game. It's like a card game with obscure rules and strategies, and the party play with friends is completely abstract so you may as well not be playing with them at all. It's hard to understand why this kind of game would be made except to exploit a F2P money making model."
1657,its literally just gambling
1658,"The game has many options of characters to pick between. Personally, I think a lot of changes need to be made in terms of characters such as slark and spectre but overall the game is fun and has plenty of events to participate in for content. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you like something that will challenge your brain and keep you occupied for hours. Is this game dead? Seeing as you can't even find a duo game, it seems as though this game is just a tight-knit community of roughly 5,000 people. A good community nonetheless. But if you are looking for something to play for years to come, this is not your game."
1659,Its a good past time game
1660,"The best chess game for dota player. Not like mobelejen, or auto chess. Nice game"
1661,great game
1662,"this game really need a nerf. you can easily win with full summoner with a few healer or full hunter with knight. 

absolute boring pattern."
1663,Better than TFT.
1664,good
1665,"I like it. The art is good, the characters are fun.

I am constantly dying because it's a bit hard for me to make the good buffs but I think I will manage to get better in time.

No updates since November.

1679,good
1680,Love the game
1681,"Super fun but some hero has been removed make it a little bit boring.  After you played a few hour and have discover all the combination, it started to feel like you just playing a repetitive game. If developer make all hero available even at least in the bot matches then maybe it will become fun again. Other than that, it just a super boring game right now for this patch without any update."
1682,The game is fun for a little while but eventually it gets tiring. It does require some skill but all it really boils down to in the end is luck. No matter how good your moves are if you are unlucky on the unit draw then it is game over.
1683,"RNG based, there are only a few combinations that actually work, the rest are completely useless..."
1684,Yes
1685,Jogo muito maneiro apesar de ser uma bosta

1710,"Perfect difficulty curve. And no patches is not necessarily a negative as it gives you plenty of time to explore the meta at your own pace. Just a game that fit well personally, your experience may vary."

1715,Funny Sholex game
1716,This is the best game ever.
1717,"I dont like seeing the battle pass spammed in my face every single time i go to menu, finish a game like fuck you might as well pop it up when you change a setting"
1718,"Underlords is a good game, and as far as auto battlers go, it's pretty unique in that it has PvE and different gamemodes.  However, it hasn't received an update in ~5 months now, and earlier on there were some updates that removed stuff that I liked, most notably being able to choose your Underlord's ability and Creep rounds.  That kind of threw me off, but the game is still good, so if you're interested, give it a try - just probably don't spend money on the Battle Pass until if or when Valve figures out what they're doing with the game."
1719,Good board game
1720,i dont like this gmae
1721,"Decent game, terrible UI / UX.

Half of the times that you remove a unit from the field will be by accident"
1722,"a fun casual game that relies on luck (just like all the other auto-battler). The Underlords gives so much flexibility and strategy to your team (in case your luck really sucks). It is rough around the edges for sure and haven't seen any update since 2020, but it is a great auto-battler and a fun one at that! I am truly hoping that the devs would release a new update that may or may not smoothen the game. PLEASE DEVS"
1723,"Just picked up this game thanks to a friend, and it's a nice game to play in the background and has a lot of potential."
1724,1
1725,yes
1726,very good game
1727,Dont bother
1728,"Good interface for auto chess. 

One of the annoying things about the game is not knowing if a character is ranged or melee until you watch it attack. Besides that not many complaints."
1729,"gg game for kill time
"
1730,Dead Game
1731,"I found this game to be really a lot of fun... when it was in beta. The more they updated the game, the worse it got."
1732,spectre 1 star was too op. when it gets 3 star its considered unstoppable. fix this and i'll change the review.
1733,Artifact. Dota underlords. Valve should stick to selling games than making games.
1734,pls update gaben
1735,"Used to be cool, fun and simple.... now overdone and far too nichey"
1736,Kill time so easy!!!
1737,tis goots game
1738,The only thing I don't like about it is that the devs doesn't update it anymore
1739,"I saw that this game has ""mixed"" reviews, so felt compelled to write something. This is one of the most fun games I have ever played. It balances luck, strategy and skill very well and is easy to learn. This is the perfect game to have several beverages and grind with friends for a night as you can have private lobbies of up to 8 people.

Most of the recent negative reviews stem from the fact that the game has not gotten any meaningful attention from the developers in several months. This is very disappointing, but the game in it's current state is very fun. You should balance your expectations going in that this game isn't sort of priority for Valve, and may never get an update again. That being said, if you've never played this and are interested, it is absolutely worth trying out."
1740,gg
1741, Toxic Community
1742,"The game has great fun potential and while until about half a year ago there were interesting updates and a ton of new content on a regular basis, it now seems to be abandoned by the developers, which is a pity since the game still seems quite beta in many ways and remains with a lot of unused potential."
1743,Dead but fun
1744,Fast and great strategic game
1745,disaanaaaaaaa
1746,"Awesome , but nerve wreching game :D

never give up on ur hero's and try new stuff , beat the meta :DDD

If u stick long enough u will start to love it :D"
1747,"dogshit, boring game. it was much better in the beta"
1748,"Nice game, i just used it to add a friend on steam for free :P"
1749,good game

1754,zzz
1755,Дисбаланс на уровне
1756,good game
1757,This game is actually entertaining.
1758,"Should add replay feature for previous game to learn mistakes and better future game plans.
Post game interface should be more detail such as clicking heroes to see precise stats:Hero mana pool and casting spell mana cost should display by placing cursor on heroes. Underlords and Dota 2 should be more inter-relationship to increase player count as the others MOBA games doing nowadays. Game is pretty much fun as a Dota veteran hoping more franchise but still need to improve for mobile version. Get better exp in PC platform than mobile. 
"
1759,"Its always fun to play whenever, wherever."
1760,"if you want to commit to playing this, you gotta now that
the game is dead now 2 april 2021

the last update was november 2020
and its only a minor fixes"
1761,.
1762,there's no more update??? its kinda sad
1763,I JUST PLAYING KNOCK OUT MODE. 5-10MIN FOR EACH GAME IS VERY QUICK PLAY.
1764,"Very nice game, although the interface within the game is still very simple."
1765,GG
1766,Good i think
1767,Fun! Simply Fun. ;)
1768,"Fun, casual, but gets kind've repetive."
1769,Pretty good time waster. The whole auto combat is not everyone's cup of tea but I like it.
1770,"Еще один проект на который валв уже все равно(
"
1771,this game is dead when valve cant update a game with this bullshit hero like slark or  player balance ! shouldt waste your time on this game
1772,Good
1773,kinda reminds one of the star wars chess
1774,This game could have been great if they had just kept the dota auto chess formula instead of trying to add underlords into the mix which completely took away from the core idea. They haven't updated it in nearly half a year now and it's not worth your time as any month now they'll announce its cancellation.
1775,Great game with some more in-depth mechanics than some of it's competitors bring to the table. I hope Valve continues to support this game.
1776,"This game was fine until they started having major freezing issues.  I get kicked at the top of a round about 50% of the time.  Is it so difficult for Valve to make a good game?  The initial loading of the game is slow, and so I'm liable to miss more than a round when this happens.  If i didn't experience this freeze 10 times per match, it would at least be tolerable, but I miss choosing my Underlord and randomly get an item I didn't choose. 

I don't know what caused this, but it hasn't always been this way.  Seriously Valve, learn to fix your bugs."
1777,:D
1778,trash optimization
1779,"Don't play this game, waste ur time"
1780,"I've played some auto-battlers before so I feel like i can learn pretty fast. I just have NO idea why I'm losing in the late game. I feel like its really confusing to new players. also i dont like the underlords aspect. just keep the heroes.
"
1781,Its a fun Game.
1782,"This was my favorite Auto-Chess. Too bad it crashes multiple times per match, making you miss out on entire rounds if you try to rejoin. Valve has seemed to abandon it in a broken state, which is pretty f*cked."
1783,"Meh

Its another spaz take.

The art is nice the UI is serviceable very mobile game esk but what do you expect from this ADD style of game play the characters are interesting lore I think is the strong point here everything else is well meh at best. 

Would I recommend it ... its free, the game play is as you might expect and the quality is high so sure its worth a look but just barely"
1784,its an alright game to reconnect with your old school buddy for a while since he doesnt want to download teamfight tactics
1785,"stupid ""TOP TALENT"" mission!, whoever design that level will get volcanic diarrhea"
1786,nice game]
1787,"if i didnt crash like 3 times a game it would be fine, but yeah lol."
1788,good game
1789,Yes
1790,:)
1791,before I used to play this game when it was release then now I kinda still play this game for 2 to 3 hours since it helps me clear my mind when I have a losing streak on dota 2
1792,Gg
1793,dogshit
1794,Dota
1795,The fuck? I actually have over 200 hours on this game? This was a great game but once again Valve has abandoned their child :( sadge.
1796,good
1797,I can't understand the game
1798,game thrown in deep shit with foolish minions
1799,"Dota Underlords more like Doo Doo Underlords this game be mad boring bro this game dumb like what the hell is up with all these Dota side projects? Enough with the Artifacts and the auto chesses and that stupid cringey anime on Netflix bro just gimme a J.J. Abrams directed Half-Life or Portal movie or whatever the fuck you guys at Valve were talking about with him and give me a Half-Life 3 before I file a complaint to Valve HQ for customer misconduct. At least wear a condom and take me out to dinner before you decide to fuck me in the ass. Fuck you guys, you guys are fucking pieces of shit, the bottom of the barrel scumbags.

Anyway this game's kinda fun and its free so it gets the official shark seal of approval."
1800,YES
1801,it sucks
1802,cool game
1803,"So unblanced, Basiclly get something that gives you extra summmoned guy in the 1st two rounds, then get a dark shaman, will take you all the way to the top 4 garenteed. Team fight tactics is much much much better."
1804,"This is:
10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% teamplay if your Team is ok"
1805,Dota chess is better.
1806,Good.
1807,"WOW

1810,WAW.. COOL

1813,dota 2.5
1814,"if you're trash in dota 2, dota underlords is for you."
1815,I played both this and TFT... This game is total ass. They complete threw balancing out the window and didn't even bother to updated it after realizing this game wasn't as popular as TFT. I really wanted a good DOTA auto-battlers game but this isn't it. If you enjoy playing auto-battlers I suggest TFT over this.
1816,rubbish
1817,"HEY NEWBIES !!! WELCOME 2 DOTKA WOLRD! <3 YOU CAN PLAY DAT GAME 2 LEARN DOTKA COMBI IN GENERAL WOW!! JOIN NOW WIN CRAZY STUFF LATER :p SEARCH 4 ME, I L GIVE YA FREE CRYPTOS AND SKINS , NIHILKUNT IS MY NAKE DOTKA IS MA GAM,E"

1821,worst game
1822,I like the anime girls
1823,I suggest you not to start playing because your time will literally disappear into the void
1824,"it is repetitive at some point, and it is actually a little bit abandoned by valve, but its hella fun with your friends."
1825,Playing in casino is more fair than playing this game :)
1826,One of my favorite games
1827,"its pretty much left to die by the devs (seemingly) but its still pretty fun. Maybe there is a new update comming someday, who knows"
1828,you'll learn along the way
1829,"Lots of crashes, wasn't able to find a fix."
1830,This game will soon be dead. Stay Away as Far as possible.

1848,"the heroes, skills and damages are completely random. so as the winning. there is no strategy in this 'strategy' game."
1849,Good timepass. Nothing serious.
1850,no updates. could have been fun if it has more updates. Its been 4-5 months since the last update. The game is stale.
1851,"bruh
fook yeah"
1852,"With a heavy heart I can't recommend this game. I was a huge fan, often playing a round every night before bed, but its clearly been abandoned. The meta shakeups that made it so fun don't exist anymore which means in high ranks the optimum combos were figured out months ago so there isn't much variation anymore. I really hope the dev's revisit this project because it was incredibly fun and I truthfully miss its peak."
1853,game breaking bugs that kick you out mid game for months and left to die by valve. not worth playing.
1854,bruh
1855,"ded game no updates, go play tft instead"
1856,Update or else
1857,An amusing slot machine that crashes once a game.
1858,"this game is good if u know the startgy from DOTA autochess, but this game its very simple

1874,"ENGLISH - Its like a boardgame that uses miniatures (minis) to fight. Combat is automated. 8 Players battle each other one at a time. Every turn provide players gold and a pool of Five random minis wich you can buy. This pool can be rerolled by spending adicional gold. Obtaining 3 identical minis fuse them on a bigger one of same name. Later turns allows players to level up and buy/use stronger minis. Sometimes itens are dropped and minis can equip them. Each miniature is labeled two to three classes it belong, and combining diferent minis that share the same class garant them combat bonuses.

PORTUGUESE - É tipo um jogo de tabuleiro de luta com miniaturas. O combate é automático. 8 Players lutam entre si um a um. A cada turno os jogadores recebem moedas e cinco miniaturas aleatórias para escolher comprar. Essas minis podem ser re-roladas gastando moedas adicionais. Comprar 3 minis idênticas produz uma maior de mesmo nome. Turnos mais tardios permitem passar o jogador de level e comprar minis mais fortes. As vezes, itens são obtidos e as minis podem equipá-los. Cada miniatura é identificada com duas a três classes, sendo que combinar minis diferentes que compartilham uma mesma classe garante bonus de combate para o time.

1878,"Interesting game mechanic with DOTA2 theme.
Worth trying out."
1879,"It's fun to play, with friends. :)"
1880,i mean ist alright i guss the game is pruty simple but its wourf puting at least 50 hours in it
1881,goodtimes
1882,"so far i enjoy this game, but please volvo update"
1883,"No dev support to be had for months now. It's a lot of fun, an autochess or tft clone but with a few unique mechanics. if the devs would update it and release new stuff as well as fix the ENORMOUS plethora of bugs it has it would be a definite recommend."
1884,Valve has abandoned Underlords.
1885,"Do YOU enjoy getting XXXXXX over by RNG?
Do YOU have a masochistic desire to attempt to play anyway knowing full well you'll NEVER get a 3-star minion?
Do YOU develop strategies that kind of work but don't because EVERYONE ELSE has multiple 3-star minions?
Do YOU want to waste money on frivolous things like Battle Passes?

Then this is the game for you! Dota Underlords ENJOYS ripping you off, and then getting you to proverbially bend over in-game in an attempt to 3-star those minions which only ever seems to happen to everyone else.

Praise be! A game worthy of our worship to RNGesus, and give thanks to the (un)Holy Battle Pass for those useless unrewarding rewards!

Seriously though, visuals are alright, it seems to be a little slow loading up sometimes, sounds is okay.

And uh... its an... auto...chess... game....
I think that fad has kind of died off already, so... yeah.

They haven't really done an update in a while (server maintenance i think was the last), and don't really update with any real frequency either so, don't expect to get much out of this. (Last update was Nov last year, and before that September. They used to do updates twice or more a month but now... well you can tell they don't want to keep up the farce anymore.)

In short, if you like getting jipped by RNG, have at it. (I don't. It's one of my pet peeves in strategy games. Darn you Solomon's Xcom: ""You were supposed to be the chosen one"" etcetera.)
Don't expect the game to be around forever or to have a sizeable player base for much longer, it's the beginning of it's end - and its for that reason I heavily suggest you don't sink any cash into it.

A lot of these companies now a days want ""renewable income"" from their products - its the whole reason for this ""Live Service"" epidemic and Battle Pass systems and various in-game currencies and all that dross - and seem to get all upset that their ""cash cows"" turn out to be ""trash now's"" as we've all been stung by these things before, (In my case it was an MMO and their cash shop free to play model,) and don't want to sink our hard earned wedge into a short-lived, rarely-updated novelty prize fresh from its cereal box.

Just like the nintendo wii, powerglove, vr headsets, keyrings that make a series of noises when you push the buttons, fidget spinners, pogs and every other novelty item, this will die off soon - enjoy it while it lasts if that's your thing... I'll be elsewhere (but not playing Solomon's Xcom. Darn you Solomon. DARN YOU!)"
1886,Please still alive
1887,underlord's
1888,Good game!! Every strategy can work
1889,Chill game but lacks abit of depth compared to the other variant like TFT from LOL.
1890,Auto chess is better
1891,"Used to be a good game, now it is not. 

Devs had a view not in line with the community, and decided to go their own way. Playerbase is less then 10% of it's prime, a sign how well that went."

1904,"Whas perfect before intruducing the ""Hero"" units."
1905,"Another game dying tragically at the hands of Valve, Inc.  The main dev got canned in mid 2020.  As of this writing, there have been no updates in nearly 6 months.  The current build is incredibly unstable, crash prone and poorly optimized.  This is what happens when a company like Valve has the money printer that is Steam.  They don't give a damn, because they don't have to.  The company's ""flat"" structure actively encourages miserable situations like the fate of Dota Underlords.  For another example see the dead-as-of-today Artifact."

have no clue what Dota is?

Play this game"
1916,Imagine being a multi billion dollar company and releasing a game that crashes every couple of games played
1917,Not bad with bot.
1918,ditme trung quoc
1919,"Underlords had a pretty good start and I think a lot of the changes it went through were alright. It's a good game. Sadly, it is not getting support. Valve is a confusing company.

Artifact and Underlords. Both games Valve has pretty much abandoned. But why? Why tarnish their reputation? Now consumers are going to look at all their new games with apprehension.

We have seen time and time again of companies that turn around a crappy game into something great. Not to say underlords is crappy, yes a lot of people thought some updates were bad. Artifact? Yes it had a lot of problems. But they are FIXABLE and instead of caring for their games, Valve has left them to die, and let Riot Games surpass them and now they have lost a lot of customers. 

Valve, please take care of your games. Maybe if Steam didn't make them so much money things would be different."
1920,I like it
1921,nice
1922,"After playing this, I'm hooked again since I stopped playing autochess in Dota 2. Great way to get back to the game."
1923,"Well polished version of Auto Chess. Strategy is the name of the game and if you want a challenge, this is the game for you"
1924,Great game wish it had more mass appeal. It was a lot more fun in the early days when meta changed more often.
1925,Some build is op but some is so crappy shit
1926,WHEN WILL THERE BE AN UPDATE??????
1927,I think I like this game
1928,"Autochess! It's an acquired taste, but kinda fun. You buy your pieces from a random pool, you get to pick where they start on the board, equip them with some items and they'll do the fighting for you. There's some strategy to it mainly by you planning for a correct party setup to beat your competitors, but it's very random. You don't get to decide which units you get, which items you get or which enemies you get, so even the best plans have a tendency to go belly up. 

It does have its charm. Getting a strong team composition going and stomping every other team that comes your way is really satisfying, but the very next match with the very same strategy you may end up falling flat on your face. The randomness works for the game as much as against it. You might get the heroes you need for your strategy, but not the items you need, or vice versa. Or you might not get either. 

If you enjoy auto-chess, you'll probably enjoy Underlords, but be warned. Valve obviously had big plans to maintain this game as a live service for years, but it wasn't popular enough, so the game is stuck with the current rotation of heroes/alliances and very likely isn't getting any new content."
1929,screen freeze
1930,fun
1931,"Dont ever pay smth in this game, they had an rotation system, an awesome indivdual talent system for the heros and they abbonded the game, still sometimes fun but nearly half a year without real update, so sad to have a low effort game and fucking it all up"
1932,"After very successful autobattler mod to DOTA 2 from drodo studio, Valve wanted to create stand alone game. It all started very well but unfortunatelly game stalled and it feels very abandoned right now. 
If you are into autobattler genre you better play Teamfight Tactics, LoL based autobattler from Riot.

Pros:
- Free to play autobattler
- Easy to hop in
- Had potential with skins, heroes, lords but unfortunatelly its abandoned

Cons:
- Abandoned
- Almost mandatory battlepass
- Heroes no longer feels like it belong to some alliance, they feel like just randomly assigned somewhere for balance 
- RNG? :) (isnt autobattlers about RNG sometimes? :D)"
1933,game cash every game
1934,"It's a good game to play idly while watching youtube or something, my main issue is the game always ends when it starts to get fun. It'd be good if there were more customisation for the game modes with settings such as quicker upgrades, +/- life points etc."
1935,Complicated unlike other auto chess game(s).
1936,its so perfectly
1937,"This game is bad, this game has no different with slot machines in the casino. Its a game that based on luck and you don't even need skills to win. Beside that the game constantly crash for unknown reason. I wouldn't recommend to play this game because this game really waste of time and nothing much to have fun. I stopped for almost 1 year. When i came back, everything is still the same. They only add a few things and the game really boring right now"
1938,another abandoned valve project
1939,Artifact 2.0
1940,"Really like the gameplay, such a nice game"
1941,"I was hoping that after all this time, taking into the consideration that the game never got much attention, the creator took the time to improve it and make it fun to play. The game is not really bad, some things are done right, but: 1-It crashes frequently. 2-The ""in your face"" constant nagings to spend money in the game get old very quickly."
1942,"As always, Valve sets deadlines then totally fails to meet them in any capacity.
Ricochet 2 will be released before this even gets  half a glance from a valve employee."
1943,Crashes more than monopoly 3
1944,fuckkkkkkkk hahaha wooooooo wee wweeeee awaaaaaa
1945,"Overall game idea is very fun. But there is lots of stuff that that make it quite miserable. Game menu is broken and looks like devs intentionally made it like that for people to waste as much time as possible in it. 90% of cosmetics and >60% of white spire campaign is paywall locked. Interface is super unfriendly for new players  that want to quickly check hero abilities mid-match. I am so frustrated, game idea is super fun and I want to continue playing, but looks like devs intentionally made everything to prevent me from that."
1946,BEST IN AUS/KOREA
1947,"hope u dead soom , lords really suck"
1948,brawny go brrr
1949,"This game isn't worth it anymore, whatever idiot is in charge of the balance team done goofed to such a degree that it's not even fixable without basically starting from scratch.  If you do play it, play knights only, knights are the only viable class in the entire game so it's all RNG about who gets them all first."
1950,The game is super buggy and dead.
1951,"To be honest, Valve, f*** you. Update your f***ing game already, i'm getting sick of this shitty ass game. A piece of crap based on luck which is too shitty that it couldn't be used as something to relax anymore, f*** you Valve for not fix your piece of shit"
1952,Good game
1953,The best game I have ever played .
1954,"Nice game, good for wasting time."
1955,"Good game!
Shame it's dead :("
1956,nice

1962,"So, admittedly I took almost a year off of this game. However; there's a point where I just absolutely do not know what the fuck is going on. I took a similar break from TFT, and after a couple of rounds- I got the hang of things again.

Underlords? Not so much. I just flat out do not enjoy the game anymore."
1963,Nice game but CONSTANTLY FREEZING AND CRASHING WITH NO APPARENT FIXES.
1964,"fucking trash gamed, cant even give the hero i want, all oponents gain 3 stars, but i never get the chance to get 3, so idiot of games, not based on luck at all."
1965,shit
1966,"The crashes (especially in knockout) have a huge effect on your rank and they cant seem to fix it.  It NEVER updates.  If you're looking for an autochess, go find the original custom on dota2's list or look up the other version the guy made because he actually at least tries to fix these things and rolls out new things often enough.  (OR TFT i guess but I haven't kept up with it.)"
1967,I personally love this game. Devs worked hard to make it balanced and keep the fun but now we need a new update. I really hope this game isn't dead. PATCH PLEASE! Thank you
1968,"If your not doing anymore updates and have abandoned the game, then take it off the Steam Store. Online games do not become single player games if updates are over."

1974,damn bro
1975,Fuck
1976,Game was a lot of fun but Valve has stopped putting updates for the game.  I'll change review to recommend if they start supporting it again.  It started off really well too.

2036,"Bagus, tapi terlalu besar grafiknya"
2037,"Totally unbalanced and not updated for months at a time game. This is lottery. You can have a three star unit (the most upgraded state) in 9-11 rounds or you can go 25+ rounds w/o a three stars. If you wish to try out your luck then go ahead play it. If you wish to play a balanced and logical game that follows some kind of rules at the very least and w/o kids spamming sound emojis, then skip this. Not worth it. From a guy with too many hours spent with it."
2038,"This was valves attempt at creating their own 'Dota Auto Chess'.
Was it a success? In comparison to the former - No, not really.
It failed to live up to expectations and strange gameplay updates/mechanics turned off a lot of players.

Having said that, I've found Underlords has become a cool, casual experience that I can enjoy on my smartphone during short periods of downtime. I only ever play knock-out mode these days, as it allows for the experience to be short and sweet."

2042,very cool game oh yes
2043,"After many hours playing this game, the lack of updates has killed this easy to update game. Bye"
2044,Sadly the game crashes all the time - I cannot play on the pc. Maybe I have just the ryzen 7 3700x and a RTX 3070? ;) It is better developed for IOS/Android. So don't play it on the pc..
2045,"I don't really know anything about this game, I just installed it to add my friends, when I was just a F2P"
2046,"I've never seen a game crash so consistently yet so inconsistent in it's stability. 2/10 experience, would rather any other autochess game instead of this game.

UI and unit tool tips are super unclear as well. make that a 1/10 experience. Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies."
2047,"As long as valve doesn't do his classic ""Create something then abandon it"", it's good."
2048,I think you should just play dota instead TBH
2049,"No !! the RNG on this game is so damn stpid, I played games where at round 20 there are players who already have a 3 3stars hero, and me having a hard to get 2 stars hero, once you fcked theres no way of coming back , just better to quit the game at round 3 or 4 . so stupd"
2050,great fun thoug it could use trophies
2051,Yeah. This game is really good. Duos is amazing. Sometimes the matchmaking time can take a few minutes. Worth it.
2052,Easy to get into and a lot of fun
2053,"A bit of fun, but too RNG for my liking so probably wont go back to it, but fun for a dota fan."
2054,wtf is going on
2055,not bad at all
2056,Won my first game today in ranked and so far the game as been fun. The only downside is the possible crashing if you do not do certain things to fix it.
2057,"Very addictive. (Supposed to work that way)
But, what if I told you that you are just playing with an AI all along will you believe me?
No matter how good you get, you can't beat the processing speed of an AI.

Don't get sucked on this game or any other type of game like I did. Not worth the time.
It's not yet too late to repent. r/stopgaming

Help yourself to be a better person."
2058,keep crashing
2059,"Battle Pass is grindy.
Meta is simplistic.
Apparently Season 1 has been going on for over a year.
Can't use cosmetics unlocked in DotA.
ZERO ability to chat in game.
Balance and mechanics are fucky and non-sensical.
Playerbase is flooded with sweatlords.
AI is downright dumb, be prepared for them to run the long way around to commence an attack, losing you the round, when a shorter and clearer path was available.

My suggestion: Go play TFT. It's a far better game, otherwise you'll spend hours being sweated on by a bunch of Dorito munching, Mtn. Dew chugging idiots.

Genuinely, the people behind the AI and mechanics need fired, because this is an abortion of a auto-chess game. It's genuinely bad and is a sign of Valve being completely unable to create their own content competently. Sure, Half-Life: Alyx was okay, but that was one of the FIRST serious VR games. It'll easily be eclipsed by other products down the line and once again Valve will be stuck siting on their fat bottoms, sucking their thumbs, unable to create anything of their own. People beg on the forums for updates, yet get zero responses. Can't even get ranked due to the lack of players.

The few remaining players will defend it, but will quickly lose their shit or shut up when you bring up TFT for a reason: They know it's better overall."
2060,lots to understand at first but a dope strategy game
2061,"The game is okay. But, the way the game tries to make itself different is kind of boring. It's certainly meant to be on the phone."
2062,i like this game
2063,"Very enjoyable! Its fun for competitive people, not as triggering like many other competitive games."
2064,"Underlods doesn't get any MAJOR updates since a long time. It is stuck on season 1 for more than a year now.
Board is not clear, it is hard to know what is going on. And because they messed up the UI with big portraits/animations, it makes it even worse.
Something is wrong with the sound, i keep hearing other players boards even when we don't chose to watch them.
Big fan of Valve games, but they failed in this one. I mean... it is okay, but it is not what it set out to be, it was made to be an improvement in every way of the original MOD within Dota 2 ""Dota 2 Auto Chess"", witch is still active at the moment, has a bigger player base and growing, a better game overall. But if i would recommend a game of the genre it would be Teamfight Tactics, another good one is Drodo Auto Chess from the same creators of the Dota 2 Auto Chess Mod."
2065,"The game is literally unplayable at the moment, constant disconnects in every single game I've joined since I've re-installed this game today to give it a try.

Edit: tried reinstalling again today, 10/02/21 and had 3 crashes in my first game making it impossible to play."

2073,"Great Game I played it a lot and enjoyed it alot alone and with friends. Its a great game to play, while you can listen to music and dont have to give 100% all the time so its nice an chill. But ever since the start it seems the devs have no idea where they are going. They patched heaps and each patch felt like you had to learn a different game as they changed the stats and abilitys of the units. Back then the game was still alive, but now it kinda feels dead. There are many issues to be adressed like are certain factions coming back to the game ? and when will that be? Why are we still stuck in season 1 and why doesnt it feel rewarding at all to play hours to get to white spire? I feel there should be some meaningfull desirable reward. Furthermore the only players left are either noobs who havent played the game and the hardcore pros who played since day one who will be matched against you since there isnt really a balanced matchmaking ... neither a clear rule why you sometimes loose 100points and gain 0 although you win ... I could go on, but thats it ... best greetings from White Spire (145 AceKun)"
2074,"good game with auto chess gameplay, if you are familiar with Dota 2 Heros and Items, then you can play this game easily. Some deployed hero in arena have their own combo, so put your best strategy on it. Good Luck~"

2076,cool
2077,"The autobattler genre had its time in the sun in 2019, but between all of its iterations, clones, and spawn, Underlords keeps pulling me back.

The game [b]has its issues[/b] with performance and from time to time it's just freezing. The balancing may not be perfect, the way valve likes to monetize may be questionable too and last but not least don't expect that valve will improve the game, it looks like they are done with it. It's on keeping the light on mode.

But as a [b]casual game after work, it's perfect[/b]. The [b]knockout mode[/b] for a quick game serves very well to come down. Just [b]ignore[/b] the whole stuff around the [b]game pass[/b] and the [b]cosmetics[/b] and you are [b]ready to enjoy[/b] the game."

While playing it initially I didn't mind the mechanic, but now that I've played Underlords a decent amount, I don't think that I could ever go back. There's an unspoken value to a fluid gameplay loop. 

It also helps me familiarize myself with the heroes a bit since I've also recently made the switch from League of Legends to Dota 2 :3"

2133,Very nice :)
2134,Ive actually grown to greatly enjoy this game but I would like to see Valve hand development off to a smaller studio if they arent willing to maintain it for longer than a single season. Even Elder Scrolls Legends got better treatment despite getting shelved later in its life span.

2141,"Been on an auto chess binge, playing Auto Chess, TFT and this game. Out of the three, I would recommend this game over the other two. The bot mode is a must for people learning the ropes, with the ability to pause to read up on rules and stats. The other two games lack this function and didn't seem very beginner friendly. 

Dota Underlords is an addictive blast."

2147,"Dota Underlords is an auto-chess based off of Dota 2. It's not that hard to get into, but I did have prior experience with Riot's Teamfight Tactics. Each champion have traits that combined with other champions with the same traits get special buffs. In later rounds you get to choose 1 of 4 heros to help with your team comp, ranging from a tank, healer, damage, or a buffer. An interesting mode they have is the ability to play with a team mate. Personally I don't really care for it, I rather play Teamfight Tactics with my experience of League. But it's not that bad of a game, maybe a little too rng heavy, plus it's free so why not. And I give this a 6/10."

2153,The game just constantly feels like an RNG sim. Yes I get that the whole point is adapting to the RNG but it's kind of ridiculous when my opponent has 4 3 stars and I have 0. SMH
2154,"Always had technical issues with this game, then I'd uninstall and forget the issues, and reinstall. Well, I downloaded it today and it froze my gaming laptop which is less than a year old. I don't have issues with any other games, including games that use a lot of resources like Battlefront 2, Apex Legends, etc.

Unfortunately Dota Underlords seems neglected by Valve.

I guess the only real (and functional) Autochess left is Teamfight Tactics..."

2168,"I like the idea of original mini-game so much and also i like the underlords version of it at the begining, but it almost two years from the official release and there is nothing new."
2169,Underated game but with very limited variety in gameplay. Can be from super fun to super annoying.
2170,"Vastly improved UI from the original auto-chess dota mod, and plays mostly the same."
2171,Boring
2172,"Available on mobile, easy to play."
2173,"this game tips JUST in favor of the thumbs up, given that it's playable, and you actually can enjoy all of the work that was put into it, despite the multitudinous bugs...

PROS: well-balanced and design-wise very solid auto chess, fun sub quests to complete and good cosmetics (even if you can't always access them).  experimentally slotting items with different team comps is fun too.  good for all skill levels!!  style-wise, falls under a slightly darker, pretty (dota) aesthetic

CONS: bugs, bugs, bugs.  bars you from entering loadout (cosmetic setup) after entering any game mode, slow loading times (if assets load at all, the longer the playtime the less likely), doesn't always give quest rewards upon completion... just to name a few among the many.  i'm impressed, negatively, that this game has been out for so long yet is still so buggy in handling.  truly a lovely game, but neglected :("
2174,nice game.
2175,"spent a decent amount of time playing this and it was alright. not bad at all. 
its tiring at times but it is really fun. 
a jolly good time!"

2178,yes
2179,addictive
2180,"Fun game with quite a bit of depth, very easy to pick up. However it seems development has been abandoned, at least for now. Has not received an update since November, not a good look for a live service game. Also, extremely buggy and a lot of players are experiencing crashes."
2181,"ASP:ASX knows Gold and this has been my benchmarch for good games, 

also invest now in ASP:ASX"
2182,Fun.
2183,"This is such a terrible run for the game. Constant shader crashes force me to skip turns and eventually end up with worse stuff that the game just picks. Lowering the settings down to its fullest doesn't work at all. Using the launch options are just as useless.

I don't get it. You've been running this game for a year and it has suffered a terrible bunch of crashes. It's a wonder why Valve even keeps this thing running."
2184,"iam a big fans of auto chess, and this Dota 2 Characters gives me lot of fun to play with...
hope this game keep alive!"
2185,Worth it
2186,like dota? like auto chess? try it.
2187,verry beautiful
2188,"One of the better auto-chess games out there. Takes a little troubleshooting to get working with WIN10, but once that's sorted it's a blast. Easy to learn and hard to master, I would recommend."

2195,"I've been playing Dota's Autochess since back when it was an in-game workshop mod. Though I do miss parts of the original, Dota Underlords is a more well-rounded, polished creation. It's fun to play with friends or even go solo in the city crawl or against AI, which is beneficial for those times with limited/no internet connection.

Decent game that needs some work, but a good go-to nonetheless. 7/10"
2196,It is always interesting to come up with innovative and clever ways to transition from any combo into elementals/summoners!

2209,Very good
2210,"Game was great until the devs decided to pull all support. Game is dead, no updates, no balance changes, same meta for god knows how long. If you want to play auto chess, play TFT."
2211,"Fun game to play, pretty simple to get the hang of and also decently easy to play while doing other things like watching TV. I never played DOTA but I still picked this game up pretty quickly. It's definitely less complex and complicated than TFT and it's nice to play either online or against bots and still get xp. I also really like the new addition of the story mode. Some things are witheld until you buy a battle pass but it's cheaper than other games and it's far from lacking content without the bp"
2212,good game

2214,I mean is good
2215,Nice Game

2217,Kinda turn-based action. Can be hard to get into because of the knowledge curve. But a fun strategy game.
2218,"if you're a dota player , you'll probably like this auto chess."
2219,"Dead game, no major updates for the past 8 months and no communication from devs. Don't waste your time and go play TFT or the original DAC instead."
2220,"fun game and i'll beat your  dads ass IRL

2221,Standard matches have more heros and looks like it would be more fun but I never have the time to play those long matches. Knockout is faster and that's what I generally play but it's very imbalanced and games are won or lost entirely on RNG
2222,the game keeps crashing before i finish a match
2223,Its fun
2224,good game
2225,A good auto chess strategy game. A lot of game changer situations as you play along. It is a must have game for dota fans.

2235,its nice
2236,I love Dota 2 ❤️❤️❤️
2237,RNG based game but trying to pretends to be an competition one.
2238,"As far as auto-chess games go this i probably the best one.
Hope it will get some more love from Valve in the future."
2239,"Lots of fun, the learning curve isn't too steep (unlike some I've played), it's consistent (also unlike some I've played), and you can team up with friends (unlike most auto-battlers I've played). I wish it had better team-up options, but those aren't common as I said, to I consider the best I've played so far."
2240,"After the last update game is biggest trash around ... Heroes glitch underground , you never got  a level 2 hero in ranked matches , except you got some Chinese letters in your name then you got lvl 3 from 1st round... Useless apes can't even make the game better every update make this game worst than last time..... After 1800 games and more than 1200 in first 3 places  uninstall this shit. 
"
2241,"keeps me sane, somehow."
2242,best autochess outside dota
2243,Good for big brain not brain dead like me :)
2244,They have given up on this game
2245,"cash grab, a fun, cash grab."
2246,"If you liked playing Dota 2 or even if you know nothing about it and you are just looking for a game to pass the time, I do recommend playing Dota 2 Underlords. With 2020 being all crazy and for me to have online classes, I would actually have this game on in the background and be playing it while being in my classes. It is simple and you find out how to play quickly. It also leaves room for you to play with your friends easily, and that is a lot of fun. I highly recommend this especially because it is free and you don't need to pay for any areas of the game because you are given everything you will need from the start."
2247,The best  autochess game i've ever played!!!!
2248,is great when you are hungover and need to pass time :)
2249,"Too much RNG involved to really be a successful competitive game, and the RNG applies to getting the heroes you want. Everyone wants whatever heroes are in the current meta, and the meta dominates. See the problem? I have some fun with it anyway, but it's flawed to its core."
2250,"the game started out as a pretty good and entertaining idea of a timesink, but for that to work out, they have to fix the stability issue AND to rework their QA and balance team. Instead of having a more complex rock, paper ,scissors alliance system, we got a pick of 3 decent alliances and a whopping total of, at most , 1 interchangable minion in each. Combining this fact with the lackluster patch frequency of 2-3 patches a year ( 5-6 would be the aimed target) makes this game sadly boring and uninspiring after a short while. There are better alternatives on the F2P market"
2251,its good for afk game to chill while busy with work. :)
2252,"Ok, so isn't obvious that I played this for a while before I wrote a review, yeah I was too busy enjoying this game!

I played it in my phone before I played it in PC and the difference will be based on your PC or Phone's ability to show quality graphics. Overall this is a good game, very enjoyable and the best thing is its free!"

2259,"Very in-depth strategy game, easy learning curve and lot's of variety when it comes to building, it is mostly rng based but you have plenty of counters to work whit if that rng isn't in your favor.
One good move of a tile can win you the game and late game is really fun UNLESS YOU END UP AGAINST A MOM SLARK OR SHAMAN RUSH.. please nerf these!"
2260,Fun game to play when I'm doing other stuff but still want to play a game.

2279,"Dota Underlords is the same Auto Chess game from the Dota 2 mod but made officially by Valve. If you don't know what that is give ""Auto Chess"" a quick YouTube search and there's a few videos explaining the Auto Battler genre. [url=https://youtu.be/asDg8N-T73Y]This IGN video from 2019[/url] gives a pretty clear overview of the genre despite its now outdated hype and footage.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
Dota Underlords is a lot more streamlined and has a vastly improved UI than the mod and other competing Auto Battlers, with all necessary information now available in the in-game Rulebook (much better than scouring forums, YouTube and wikis for the basics on team synergies and unit stats). It's very quick to learn because of this and the very handy pauseable single player mode.
The game also has a lot of personality in its voicelines and cosmetics and the addition of the Underlords (special boss units) is a nice touch. The removal of the carrier unit/donkey is also a nice addition as items and gold are now automatically collected. The game also gets a nominal thumbs up for not including Pay-To-Win mechanics.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
Unfortunately it seems like Dota Underlords may have been put on life support as there's only been one major content update since release but that could very well be because of outside factors like Covid-19 (although it is worth noting that the Auto Battler genre is well past the fad stage it enjoyed in 2019/2020).
Other than that the only thing that the game suffers from is a lack of depth when compared to other titles in the genre, a symptom of the aforementioned streamlining of the game.

[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]
At time of writing it's definitely worth trying considering it's free with no pay-to-win mechanics and is very quick to learn thanks to the stated Rulebook and pauseable single player mode. Give it a go.

[h1]The Competition[/h1]
While we're here, it's also worth noting that there are currently three other Auto Battler games available outside of Steam that are Free To Play as well. These are Auto Chess by Drodo and Dragonest Co.Ltd (the original Dota 2 mod team), Team Fight Tactics by Riot and Might & Magic: Chess Royale by Ubisoft. 

Might & Magic: Chess Royale is the most divergent title in the genre and tries several things to shake up the formula. None of these are worth mentioning however, as the game is flat out not worth your time due to it clearly being a straight mobile port with no thought to desktop use that's also riddled with Pay-To-Win mechanics.

Team Fight Tactics is a very good offering and plays almost identically to the original mod, with a couple of innovations here and there. It's by far the more in depth offering and ultimately the better game but suffers in the UI department when compared to Dota Underlords. Migrate to this if you find Dota Underlords too shallow.

I have yet to play the standalone release of Auto Chess but will update this when I do."
2280,"Used to be a great game, but VALVE development culture seems to be to abandon games as soon as it gets difficult nowadays."
2281,"probably the best autobattler out there right now. graphically, it's worse than teamfight tactics, but gameplay wise it has many more decisions to make in regards to items and team comps. games in underlords strike a good balance of ""one unit carries me"" and ""my composition is stronger than the other guy's"" which is much closer to the original dota 2 autochess than anything out right now."
2282,"Yes, good Autochess-like one. Abaddoned by Valve.. what a pity"
2283,It ded
2284,"Really like this game. Especially the facts it's not pay to win or grinding any exp. Just learn the game, adjust your strategies and you can become good player!"
2285,"I have no idea what I'm doing, never lost a game. 10/10"

2303,"No more support!! Loved the Game, but Valve suxx"
2304,"Really nice game, good user interface and fun co-op battles with my friend."
2305,If only this game would actually get some updates
2306,Auto Battler is a disease!!
2307,"literally all this game needed was more content, some extra polish and a little bit of marketing"
2308,00
2309,they removed ogre magi
2310,Valve took lot of stupid directions against the advice of the inner circle of players who they were in contact with. This lead to player bleed after player bleed till it got to the point its at now. There is still enough people playing that you can get insta ques and enjoy the game and while I think this is one of the better Auto Chess games in a lot of ways the lack of care from valve after its bad decisions lead to huge player bleed off makes me not wanna recommend it. You're better off in other Auto chess games that are still thriving and get updates. This one hasn't had a real update in 2 months and they basically left the current Meta broken and introduced dumb mechanics last minute that ruined the point of the game in the first place. This game least represents what Auto Chess is all about in its current state and is focused on just rolling overpowered 3* units and sitting level 7-8 forever because the higher cost synergies are not valuable. I honestly think Valve has always struggled when it came to balancing the synergies out and making them worthwhile. They also have never been able to really make 4 cost units valuable either. Other Auto Chess games don't have this problem so you'd be better off trying those. If Valve suddenly gets an interest to try to fix it's mess it made I could recommend this over everything but probably won't happen at this rate. I mean they've still been on the Season 1 BP for an entire year. That alone should kind of scream what kind of state this game is in lmao.
2311,"I do not like moba's. Especially not Dota. So unsurprisingly I strongly disliked this. Don't let anyone fool you into trying it. It's not different, it's a smug grind rave. It presumes knowledge of, and attachment too all the dota-dudes. If you try it, Steam will never truly forget, no matter what you do. (I tried an early public build.)"

2319,Zzz
2320,"For someone who hasn't played dota bar 2 times themselves, this is a easy straightforward game to get into. Well described and helpful, Co-op or alone this is a nice auto chess to get your teeth into. With a new edition of a battle pass and a city worth of side quests, brings a nice twist to a normally closed of genre. 8/10"

2355,fun game - long queues for duos which stinks cause its a ton of fun
2356,a6
2357,"Before the game was fun, but then it began to turn in something about being luck only, you need to roll and pray to finish 3 stars hero, that is what the game has turned to, 99% of times there is no late game, usually you end the game at lvl 6 or 7, you can hardly go up to 8, much less lvl 10 as you could before.

The only thing fun yet is duo"
2358,mantap
2359,"Game randomly crashes and disconnects from beta to now, no clue why this hasn't changed since beta.  I have no connection issues with dota2 or any other steam game except this one"
2360,"Decent game but it depends on the latest update. The current one isn't great, it's not very tactical. There only a few stratsn that are good and it's all about getting level 3 *** units. 

Duo's is the only thing keeping this patch alive for me but that also needs improvement. Level 4 units are pointless unless you need to finish off 6 knights or 6 assassins and level 5 units don't even exist in duo's at the moment. 

Also, because level 3 units are the meta some strats are just awful. For example warriors are very bad because they have no  level 3 units and swordsman have 2 level 4's and a level 5 so 6 swordsmen is virtually impossible. So they either need to get rid of the *** perks or completely rebalance all strats so that they are better. 

"
2361,"Worst game ever! Unless you're willing to grind days of your life, you'll be facing off with tri-hards who can't afford to buy a laptop, playing mobile version."
2362,I recently returned to this game to give it another try after the updates. Unfortunately I couldn't even get it to run properly without crashing due to shader errors. I looked up fixes and tried everything but nothing worked. If you can get the game to run properly it may be fun but I'll never know.
2363,"Unplayable, in the first match I got shadows and parts of some trees expanding chaotically on the screen, freezes every 10 seconds, and 5 disconnects. The enemy spells are so realistic they break the game."
2364,nice game
2365,2 hard 2 understand
2366,"En son underlords lar cıktıgında oyunun içine etmişlerdi ve bırakmıstım. Ama son güncellemeler ile oyunu toparlamayı basarmıslar. Ozellıkle knockdown gayet basarılı, hızlı ve eglenceli bir oyun modu olmus.
In conclusion, tekrar şans vermeye deger.

INVOKER I GETIRIN YETER ARTIK BE."
2367,Daddy recommends this game ♥
2368,Great game to past time with around 5-15 minutes.
2369,Wish it had more support but it seems like the auto-battler genre is turning out to be a fad. I enjoyed AutoChess in Dota 2 a lot more than all these standalone versions of AutoChess.
2370,The game is fun but it is so incredibly powerful it closes itself for no rhyme or reason and you jolly well better not alt-tab to do anything else - it even supersedes the Task Manager.
2371,love it
2372,"Gamenya terlalu bagus, tapi masih enakan ngedota :)"
2373,Fun at first until you figure out the strategy to get level 3 creatures with biggest stats as soon as possible. Also too much RNG/randomness for any strategy to be almost always reliable.
2374,Fun and easy to pick up. Great on mobile as well.
2375,meh
2376,good game
2377,In between a Battle Royale and Solitaire! :)
2378,I like it!
2379,"Current meta; rush your level up
previous metas; select teams base on synergy and compatible strengths. not you need the 3 OP pieces and to have spammed your level... because more units distract while the 3 decent pieces do all the work... another update is needed...."
2380,Great game
2381,Fun little game to kill time.  Rounds are a bit long in my opinion and should be shortened.  But other than that I like it.
2382,"Awesome game ! I think it is very well balanced too, each build has a counter build ... so trying to do a routine makes you fail most of the time. Sometimes I won with a certain build, sometimes I loose.

It has a lot of polish for the price tag too (season pass costs some money, otherwise the game is free)"
2383,fun game.

2405,it is good
2406,Game keeps declining with each new patch. First tried to copy the custom game created in Dota 2. Which sparked TFT to come along as well. Now it's turned into something you'd solely play on a mobile device where you can't commit the time to long games. Prayers to the RNG gods are required to win.

2414,"Game is fun to play with really nice visuals, but without buying the season pass, you'll run out of things to do rather quickly. It's not expensive, just worth mentioning."
2415,yes
2416,"The game is good, mostly based on LUCK, but u can always make some strategy. Biggest problem is that game drop about 5-10times in 1 Game, thats make it unplayable."
2417,"Fortunately, the learning curve for DTU is incredibly mild, so you can hop into a few matches and start enjoying the game immediately. Beneath its face value, however, DTU is deceivingly complex and takes a level of forethought that, once you have, reduces the game to a meta, but if you lack, makes the game seem unpredictable and frustrating. Somewhere between those extremes lies a certain intrigue that keeps you coming back, not entirely unlike its namesake: DoTA.

Controversially, there is of course a level of RNG to DTU, but it's no more prevelant than the average CCG -- You ""draw"" your hand and make the best of it. I'd also add that there are simple rules to counteract some of the RNG, such as getting a free re-roll after a lost round. Unlike CCGs, however,  DTU asks you to consider hero abilities, alliance synergies, underlord choices, party composition & placement, item effects, resource management and hero tier %-chance distribution. All of which has to happen fairly quickly before a round begins -- ironically, you don't have much time to strategize. At some point you need to have played enough bot matches or casual matches to start forming mental and visual heuristics, but the journey to get to that point is fairly full of experimentation and payoff, which is rewarding in its own way."

2427,"The core game mechanic in play is the ""loot crate"" model. In order to upgrade your heroes (play the game) you spend coin to get a random set of cards. I feel like this model is toxic to the gaming community and provides no value whatsoever."
2428,Good game . I am looking forward for more games like this that supports in both pc and SmartPhone i.e. Android.
2429,"Borders on autocheckers than autochess.

I haven't played the original dota autochess but I have played League's TFT and it's a really sad sign if Riot can do something better than Valve. I cant finish a game 90% of the time because of wild swings in winning/losing that I cant tell if my comp is trash or I just need to tweak it. Too bad the game gives you no time to think. TFT is also kinda bad but at least has upgradable items and filler waves to improve the gameplay's depth and pacing (just enough to make this game the worse option). 

I hate the 4 Underlord characters and what they ""add"". A needless avatar joins your board where their abilities are used (randomly).  I assume this was meant as some complement mechanic but comes very early into the game and is a permanent choice. Choosing something that complements your comp (early) is not a good late game strategy (obviously) so this specific choice has no place. At best it fulfills a weakness in your composition (your late game composition) or at worst tricks you into making a garbage comp work. I understand you need to evolve your characters while maintaining your alliance strategies but this shoehorn of an addition does not even fit into that line of thinking so why do they exist? Please tell me why Underlords exist.

The alliances (type combinations) are overall pretty average - armor, magic resist,  armor debuff, summon damage, healing increase, extra attacks, summon an extra thing,. There are better alliances but most are not very interesting. Most of the gameplay is spent in the early - mid tiers so you'll be riveted to know the basic alliances listed are prevalent and too common to constantly be building into without growing WEARY.
 
I've read older reviews where previous versions of this game were better and its too bad I cant try it myself. I only really had something to elaborate extensively on for what Underlords actually does differently (the Underlords) and its not good.

Also the game strangely crashed once during a game. Easy to come back into but seriously?"
2430,Great game for free time
2431,very good very nice

2434,"I like it, just it."
2435,Game keeps disconnecting you for no reason. 1 match disconnects me 5 times.
2436,great
2437,"Absolutely the worst auto battler you could play. It feels like someone played the original auto chess and then added their own shitty ""twist"" to the gameplay by forcing you to put their ""original character do not steel"" garbage onto your board. Throw in a downright mess of a UI, and you have a clusterfuck of a game that its clear why they are losing players every month. 

gameplay aside, the tutorial also literally teaches you to play the game wrong (has you 2 star a unit with two of a kind, rather than three), what a joke."

You are at the mercy of random luck completely. Don't bother trying to come up with a strategy since you won't get the heroes you need, or the item's to support your attempt at making a team.  Personally I feel most people will be frustrated and put off by this game's lack of control on the outcome in a match."

2493,"It takes some getting used to. I think many of the bad reviews are just opposed to competitive gaming generally, in which you have to be quick and there's often a fairly steep learning curve. But yes, the game is good and worth playing if you're not opposed to putting in a little time."
2494,I surprisingly spent a ton of time here - mostly in the beta version. It was the first game with auto chess concept. Most of the time i was playing it on my secondary monitor when watching some stuff on youtube.
2495,ok
2496,"Dota Underlords is a super fun, casual - competitive strategy game.
It's way ahead of other auto battler games when it comes to its visuals, its controls, its theming, its UI, its accessibility, its narrative, its gameplay modes, its features, and so on.
Developers clearly put love and money into this game. Even if its meta is a bit stale, it has a WAY smoother user experience than anything else on the market. This isn't a hacked-together mod or extra gamemode to get rich quick. This is a legitimate game. There's good menus, mechanics built for it, a map. End screens even look like in-universe newspapers, which is super cool!
All the UI/UX people who worked on this game deserve a raise. The competitors' are a nightmare but this is exceptionally good.

It has PvP, PvE, a campaign, puzzle levels, and a fun little story centered around the wake of a powerful, interesting, female character. And you don't see that every day."
2497,it's just auto chess reskinned. mobile isn't optimized and it destroys your laptop's battery.

2516,"I like this game because the game uses the heroes from Dota 2, and it automatically resolves the battles over the course of a 30-second period, with the heroes using a hand-picked selection of skills to wallop one another as fast as they can. Once a round has begun, you don't have any influence on it, so all you can do is watch, wait, and pray that your team strategy will work for you."

2525,"I play mostly on my phone, and the experience over my 300+ hours has definitely had its ups and downs when it comes to performance. On PC the experience is immersive, easy and fun. Most of my hours are in Knock Out mode, and boy howdy nothing is more fun than putting together the perfect team to just munch everybody by the end. Its a great combination of strategy, skill, quick thinking, and luck. 

While it might seem overwhelming for players to learn all the characters, alliances, and various interactions/spells. I found it to be natural and come easily. Definitely easier to pick those things up in the normal, longer form mode. I have never played dota or dota2, except probably some bastardized starcraft version of it.

The support this year has been so/so, perhaps lackluster. Development does seem to keep chugging along though. They put season 2 out sooner than I had hoped. Come give it a try! Help us build the player base to see continued support and love from our beloved masters Valve."

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game [/quote]

Dota Underlords is a game developed and published by Valve and forms part of the Dota universe

The game offers some nice graphics, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

Dota Underlords overall, however, is an okay game to play, and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an okay-ish to meh free to play game and to play in short bursts

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

[*] None"
2564,"Somehow just not quite as fun as DotA2 autochess or LoL teamfight tactics. Those games are jankier, for sure, but their more minimalist approach makes for a much more enjoyable experience. Underlords locks you into a claustrophobic game board with a UI that throws everything at you at once. With no 'NPC' rounds there isn't as much time to think about your plans and take a breather, without a controllable character there is somehow a layer of separation from you and the game, and from your ability to personalize and interact with it. Without any chat... it's hard to feel like there is any community, and every opponent I ever face could be a bot.. and that's what it feels like. It feels much more like locking myself into a very solitary slot machine experience, where I cannot interact with the game and there is no one else playing. The game certainly oozes character and tries to push its lore very hard through.. a  single player experience. The game does not feel designed for a multiplayer community to thrive."
2565,"I was on Auto chess from the early days, hooked me in and i just love the strategy/chance balance. Great game with loads of different builds to try. can be frustrating at times but whatever just start another game."
2566,boring
2567,pretty fun
2568,crashes to much.
2569,nice
2570,ASD
2571,lots of synergies to work with
2572,"Cannot recommend it. 
Seems Valve stopped caring about this game when they saw the genre dying and other games in the same genre take over the remaining playerbase
I quite like the core gameplay, but there are not enough valid strategies to make each game differ from the last one"
2573,i have graphical glitch that i can't fix
2574,IS GOOD I LIKE YEAAA
2575,Relaxing game :)
2576,"Underlords suffers from abundance; there is just to many things littering the board. This game use to be a lot better: when there was only a chess sized hero pool to pick from, but now everything is bloated, and boring because of it. Auto chess really does not need to be a complicated game; the simplicity is what makes it fun to play. The more content that was added, the less interesting I became. Also, there is a tacky amount of cosmetics that derive from a lazy battle pass system. I wish I could say its a good game, but imo that is no longer the case. 

I recommend you try it because it's free, but if it doesn't grab your intention immediately, it's not worth getting into."
2577,great
2578,"A very fun game.  Easy to get into, difficult to master.

Graphics is top notch but still playable.

It's like chess but at a faster pace and random pieces.

I will keep coming back again and again to play this game."
2579,Nice game
2580,"good game
"
2581,great game and truly free to play
2582,Good Game!
2583,"It seems like there's some level of thinking and strategy involved until you see how many 3-Star units your opponents have, and how much gold you've spent to re-roll only to have 2 2-Stars and 2 1-Stars doing nothing but taking up space.

You have to come to terms with the fact that this is a glorified competitive free for all slot machine sort of game, where nothing but your luck matters.

Otherwise prepare for a roller coaster ride of frustration as all your hard work of strategizing, positioning and planning is useless because you didn't get the units you wanted within an important time frame.

At the end of the day, your losses feel irritating because you know your opponent got lucky, and your wins feel underwhelming because you know you got lucky. The game gives you some rank points as you pat yourself on your back trying to convince yourself you're good at this game when deep down you know you could have banged your head on the keyboard all game long and it still wouldn't have made a difference.

If you want my opinion, they shouldn't have made a standalone game off a Dota 2 game mode. Dota Autochess was a fun break from regular Dota, it was an RNG based game that players would escape to from a skill based one. I feel like any Valve employee should have seen that before pitching Underlords.

2589,This game takes a little bit to get use to but once you get the hang of things it can be very addicting. There zero pay to win aspect which i love and the season pass is 4.99 if you want skins. The knock out mode is the best mode for new players because it a lot more fast past then regular.
2590,amazing
2591,Go pick spectre and win
2592,"This game was so badly optimized for mobile which made it born crippled. Combined with the underlords which was the worst thing that happened to the game, it paralyzed it completely. Game is not fun anymore, because everyone builts whatever they get theyr hands on and it's more of a ""get the best units/items"" and play from there. The last good game I played was when I invented octarine core tristar ogre assassin build. Which was so fun to watch, or the mages/inventors build which absolutely one shot everyone who stood close.

Initially it was fun, but as i kept playing i realized how unbalanced the game was, and that every update they made something different unbalanced. I quit when I had (I don't remember the characters names) a full team, with one of them receiving health for each kill (I had about 30+ kills on the character, it was a strategic build) and almost only lvl 3's, against a team of mostly lvl twos. He won because he had two dwarf snipers  and another overpowered character. I then understood that this game would be about spamming the most overpowered characters only, and that the factions basically did not matter."
2607,Great auto chess. thinking mans game.

Only me playing Dazzle on the game, still having 95 hearts with 5 heroes and need 1 Dazzle to get 3*. With more than nearly 100 rolls still cant even get 1 more Dazzle and get lost the game.

It's just a rabid click fest on a set of random characters and items for ten seconds before each round, then you sit back and watch your half of the board, without any real clue as to what's happening.  It's garbage."
2617,Very additive
2618,"Balance completely went away over the past several months.  Strategy went away in favor of gacha-style rerolls.   
Got to the point where skill didn't matter at all.  This has been a common complaint over the past year, but Valve kept doubling down on a bad design.

2629,"Played a bunch in the beta, just came back to check it out..
I am c r y i n g laughing at the ultra sweaty bad reviews.
400 hours playing a game you don't like says more about you than the game. Moving on.

Its fun, runs great on my computer and my phone.
pvp modes have some variety. i'm a classic guy myself but the faster Knockout mode has its appeal.
pve matches to get your chops up that reward with actual xp,
battle pass is totally not necessary but also only like 5 bucks.
Idk I'm not a DotA guy at all but this one is pretty accessible and fun to play.

tldr ""fun game gets bad wrap from vicious fan-base"""
2630,"if you're a casual that's not good at games, this is def. the one for you.  You don't have to be good to win, the game is so random that skill gets thrown out the windows.  As a long time Dota and autochess player I had high hopes in this game and thought they'd balance it out.  Instead they dumbed it down and down until I literally felt like  f*ckin r*tard playing it.  Seriously I started to question why I bothered playing this game so I uninstalled and came to warn you hopefully.  Time and time again you'll be making smart decisions and winning only to be losing out of nowhere to the same people who magically end up having lvl 3 heroes everytime.  I couldn't get a level 3 to save my own ass but every game by lvl 20 or so there was always 1 or 2 level 3's per player, meanwhile I was stuck with lvl 2's wondering how many rerolls it takes just to get that one piece to finish the hero.  No amount of planning and careful decision making will make it easier to win, just pray to the gods and hope for the suckouts!  Come to think of it I'd compare this game to online poker, totally random and rigged against you.    Saving up gold is pointless if you don't get the rolls.  If you value your time and want to use that brainpower for something useful, it won't be for this game.  Trust me.  On the other hand if you're a trash player, knock yourself out!  I'm not a godlike player either but I'm smart enough to see that the algorithm is shoddy at best and just a waste of time.    Don't worry the game will do all the thinking for you!"

The devs gave up on the game after failing hard and losing to TFT. SO the game is not receiving updates regularly.

Only a few strats can work at higher elo and they get so boring.

The RNG factor is simply to big. The random opponent and targeting makes the game to much of a clusterfuck. 

DOnt start. It is addicting, but simply not worth your time"

The same meta comps (looking at you, knights) continue to be a brain-dead, flavourless, and dominant way to play the game. Games are now shorter as the devs have incentivised rushing 3-star characters with particularly powerful 3-star abilities over levelling, which has taken away a large amount of the economy aspect of the game (along with the decrease in max interest). 

If you're looking to win, you're not likely to have fun and vice versa. 4/10 - Meh"

2691,Played a lot offline. Yes if you want a simple on the outside yet complicated on the inside type thing
2692,"I used to fucking love this game. I've churned many hours into it thanks to covid-19 leaving a lot of people with the hard choice of deciding whether to wank before or after their horrendously unsociable amount of gaming time. Once you learned how to not be a twat and save gold, play for interest etc you were rewarded by being able to reasonably consistently reach higher levels and get tier 4 or 5 units to 2 stars, which meant you clapped the retards who rolled their gold away faster than your uncle Jim does at the bookies every Thursday. Sure, occasionally some troglodyte managed to strike gold with their army of low-tiered 3 star units but at least you had a fighting chance of lathing the boy with a good synergy and higher level. There was risk reward available but always the ol' reliable focus on efficiently levelling to tide you over, as you could play with the % quite reliably even if lady luck gave you a hoof up the backside with her size 15's. It was absolute quality, and if you took several of these reroll clowns' IQ's and added them together you'd struggle to reach double figures.

Then everything changed when some absolute bellend decided that 3-star effects for the tier 3 and lower units was a fun idea. Well let me tell you that it wasn't, and isn't, and never will be. You see, back in the good old days, the smelly undesirables who loved nothing more than to slam their webbed fingers on the reroll button were left quietly in the corner to wallow in their own filth while the ""people's champion"" chad and the boys consistently made at least top 4 with their decent planning, good economy, and massive... shoes. But then when the 3-star effect was born the cunts in the former group had a fucking field day. These boys had so much fun beavering away over the reroll button that you'd think destroy-dick December had come early. it was an absolute catastrophe the likes of which mankind has never seen and never will. 

But why was it such a disaster, I hear you enquire. Well to put it simply, the strength of these rancid low-tiered 3-star units is enough to make He-Man jealous. If Jimmy Saville manages to get several tier 1 and 2 units up to 3 stars he can clap almost any poor boy, even against someone 3 levels higher, with a mix of tier 3, 4 and perhaps even 5 units at 2 stars. Because of this, almost everyone is rolling their gold faster than your mum rolls to Iceland (the food retail chain, not the country you fucking clown). And also because of this, it inevitably happens that at least ONE of these wide-os will have several in their team by wave 20, possibly only at level 4 or 5. This takes away the element of choosing strategy and safer % as everyone has to incorporate at least a moderate amount of rerolling before level 7 to have even the slightest chance of a high placement in a match. It becomes completely luck based because you either hit Carol Smilie's postcode lottery jackpot and get all the 3-stars, or end up like Matthew Kelly and are left with stars in your eyes, as Billy No-mates cleans up with his successful virgin reroll build. Attempting to make the comeback with the higher tier units at higher levels is now also luck based as you are likely to get bummed by Billy before you get your higher tiers built. And even if you manage to linger at level 7/8 for a bit you need to join the mass reroll choo choo train to get several units built quickly regardless.

I played this a decent amount recently with the false hope that, somehow, I was missing a trick and the good old fashioned way was still doable, but a bit harder. But no, the last few sessions have ended consistently in bitter disappointment as the village idiots on reroll go BRRRRRRRRRRR and fuck me, all strategy goes clean out the window. I used to make fun of these idiots, now I'M the idiot because I have to join the poo-flinging party of rolling if I'm to have any chance at a decent placement in a match. The best way to fix this would be if the cadre thought ""you know what, this Radagast cunt knows his stuff eh, lets chop this shitey 3-star effect pish"" and it was gone. Then bam, suddenly Chad and the lads are back in town reaping the wins off the virgin reroll twats. But there is no chance of this happening, so the next best option would be to either buff the higher tier units' stats/abilities to bring balance and restore order to the galaxy, or to give them some form of mild 2-star effect, which is again buffed a bit at 3 stars. Very unlikely this will happen though as the devs are too busy thinking they're Erch with their Lynx Africa gift set that their mums got them for Christmas.

About 6 months ago or so if you'd slid up to me and said ""ere m8 shud I plae this game pawl"" I'd be like, aye mate, it's a gid laugh eh, then you'd probably offer me a joint and we'd all have a grand time. Now I have to hit that big bad ""no"" button, because devs, you're a prick, and yer dad's a shite driver anyway. Play Auto Chess on Dota 2.

Spent many an hour on this game even recently. Should've had a wank instead. GGs Dota Underlords, you will be missed."

It can be a bit quick at times however, you might feel flustered until you learn the game and the champs well.

Standard is very good, for the reasons listed above, however in my opinion Knockout is very bad, if strategic gameplay is what you want.  Knockout is mostly luck, with very little tactical decision making, however the games are faster. Just play standard, or knockout if you want to mindlessly kill some time, and you should have a good time."

2736,nice
2737,"No balance. No point in gaming economy to reach levels fast. No point in getting to max level. Current meta is to stack 3-stars as soon as possible. I've seen games where people had 3-stars before hitting round 18. Level 5-6-7 with 3-stars can absolutely destroy max levels - doesn't matter if you stack decent buffs or not. It's just infuriating. 

Some characters are straight up broken. You don't need any synergy with Spectre. Besides dealing enormous  damage, the character has an ability that gives it insane attack speed - it's comparable to the attack speed of a 2-star Slark after he gets enough agility 10 seconds into the round. No really, what was the thought behind this character design?


Play the mod. This is just awful.

Build slark, and it's very likely that you will win the game. Build slark 3 and get lucky with a bkb drop, and you WILL win the game."

2754,You can tell that Valve really didn't spend much time developing this really terrible game. There are so many things that lack polish. The combining of different heroes types to make them stronger is just terribly designed with zero thought so you will never be able to focus on a particular or a few types its just completely random.Healing is obviously the better path all the time over pretty much any other type. During the actual fighting the AI makes really stupid decisions and bugs out for example spectre who goes into a rage is not only OP during the rage but for some reason stops attacking after his enrage is complete and just sits there. The lone druids bear sits in a corner and rarely attacks. The drow ranger and windrunner damage is so low and laughable that even stacking dmg types and giving them dmg items with 2 or 3 stars they still cant out damage most 1 star heroes. Sometimes the characters just stop attacking a character they have almost dead only to switch to someone with more HP. Game looks good but thats pretty much all it has going for it. Even at the cost of free i wouldnt recommend it.

When the game first came out, I really liked its mechanics thanks to its simplicity, especially since it was available on mobile devices. Nevertheless, now it has changed significantly and acquired mechanics that at certain points is rather too random. And if earlier there was no difficulty in guessing how the selected ""figures"" would behave, now additional variables makes game too chaotic.

On the other hand that is still the same game in Dota 2 universe and it will gather an audience, yet the truth is whether you should play it is in a question of: How much you like to flip a coin and guess?

reVote 7 /10

RUS
Когда игра только вышла её механика в плане своей простоты мне очень даже понравилась, в особенности за счёт того что она была на мобильных устройствах Андроид. Тем не менее теперь она значительно изменилась и обзавелась механиками которые в определенных моментах работают черезчур случайным образом. И если раньше не было сложности предположить как поведут себя нами выбраные ""фигуры"", то теперь виду добавление более большого спектра дополнительных переменных игра становится слишком хаотичной.

С другой стороны это все та же игра стилизованная под вселенную Dota 2 и свою аудиторию она стабильно собирает, правда стоит ли в ней задерживаться и вам это вопрос того: Насколько вы любите подбрасывать монетку и угадывать?

2802,EASY GAME!
2803,It's the second time I try this game and after two hours I still have no idea what's happening :-(
2804,Fun to pass the time on mobile. You can still buy the battle pass for cosmetics progression as it's cheap and there doesn't seem to be an end date.
2805,"At first, it is really fun playing through all the quests, unlocking new costumes and effects and stuff and just derping around with different strategies.

The problem is: this game is both frustrating because of the horrible RNG-fuckery and addictive at the same time, so you'll spent most of your time beeing frustrated at the horrible rolls you get.

Especially with ranked matches, everybody can be a champion and everybody can be a loser. Sucks when you actually got to lv100, unlocked every major archievement, got lots of skill in this game, and then just get fucked over and over by the horrible RNG system.

There is NO system that gives you the heroes you need for upgrading here.
NO system that increases the chance for heroes you already have.

You'll have 2 heroes almost 3-star and 2x2stars +2x1stars each sitting on your bench, waiting for that 1 fucking unit that you will NEVER GET not in 200 rolls, and you'll lose the game despite having a strong lineup. Very frustrating to lose because of this.

Then, there is a HORRIBLE IMBALANCE concerning heroes and alliances. Some are right away broken OP, and nothing will be done to nerf or balance these, so you will see the same top 3 alliances all over the place. It's getting really boring. And the fact that Slark wins 1vs10 is fucking hilarious.

And then there are the LAGS, because this game has no regional servers. You'll be thrown together with people from China, Russia, Iran, America, Europe, Africa, Australia. THE WHOLE WORLD ON 1 SERVER. The lags will sometimes make you miss out on your starting unit choice, getting you randomed, which sucks.

Also, the TIME between rounds is way to short to make dedicated planings, it is VERY HECTIC - ""TOK TOK TOK"" - oooh to late - Well, fuck you Dota Underlords! Give us older people some time to react!

TL;DR:
STAY AWAY! Do something better with your time, like playing games where you actually have fun."
2806,I love this game!

It offers strategic depth while having a relatively simple concept. The meta changes every once in a while. I know some people that find the game stale every once in a while but I can't say so.  
It plays a bit better on PC than on your phone, but unless you are insanely high ranked, the odds are quite even when playing on mobile. I definetly encourage you to try this game out!"
2840,WHY IS THIS SO ADDICTIVE??!!
2841,"its fun
"
2842,"Dota Underlords is pretty cool. The ""meta"" changes often and it doesn't take long to figure them out. I love how it's 100% free and doesn't require the player to pay for anything."
2843,"its all about the meta

i can make a witty explanation, but if you're looking for strategic game that tickles your mind then sorry this is not the game for you."

2851,boring already season 2 needs to happen
2852,"Dota autochess. I play the shortened ""knockout"" mode cause I'm a filthy casual. It's fun. Recommend it if you enjoy strategy games."
2853,"The gameplay is very weird and random, but the whole thing is somehow very addictive! Worth a try if you have some some free time to kill"
2854,it's good yo

2856,love it

2858,GOOD
2859,nice
2860,oui oui
2861,you can play this game for 1 day and fix the imbalance. they take like 90 days to fix an op character.
2862,"Its fun, what more can I say."
2863,fun strategy game.
2864,The game has been out for a while now and the game still crashes at least twice a day for me. The application window size also breaks when i change my main windows display. Fun game but come on valve.
2865,"A fast paced and fun game compared to Dota 2 itself. There are still a lot of strategics, but they are now a bit more compressed and easier to get. Also losing in Dota Underlords doesn't suck as much vs. losing in Dota 2.
I love the overall aesthetic of the game. It looks good, the UI is very clear and the game itself is addicting enough to keep you playing. If you like dota 2, you will also like Dota Underlords :)"
2866,"Game depends on pure luck. The below review isn't based solely on one game but multiple time I have encountered such situation. No one, NO ONE is playing Spirit team, no one is buying Raijin and no one is keeping my desired hero form me but i seldom get my Raijin and Earth Spirit for my spirit team. It is useless, I stayed at level 6 (that level with only 5% tier 4 hero) till the end of the game, rolled all my gold every match still its futile. I would not say anything if opponent purposely bought my hero and store at bench BUT NO I checked. At this stage it isn't even luck or rng problem. Maybe some invisible opponents Im fighting lol."
2867,very much like a game of luck and casino

Crashes are real in this game"
2875,so so
2876,"chutiya wala game hai

2877,"This game getting worse and worse every update. Since open beta they heavily focus only RNG element to the game such as 3-star buff, 100% random Underlord trait. The result is nothing but utter RNG garbage. That's why people are abandoned game every month. And Valve still have no idea why people are gone, or else they don't care about this game anymore. It's their another failure likes Artifact. This game is no hope."
2878,how can I bought the battle pass?
2879,Have no idea how to play the game but the bots are challenging
2880,Amazing free to play game :)
2881,"RNG is ruining this game . Sometimes you are agianst 4-5 heros with 3 stars upgrades. Waste of time , just stay away from this."
2882,"The autochess craze I think may actually have come and gone at this point. But hey, this one is probably the most polished one. 

The gameplay is standard autochess but the twist being that you have an Underlord leader unit that you get partway through matches all with their own abilities. It adds another layer that I feel some other games of the genre are missing. The game is constantly balanced, but the battlepass hasn't gotten an update for a long time. Another thing that sets it apart is that Dota Underlords has a duos mode that I really like. Communication and coordination with your teammate is key and I feel voice chat is very helpful in that mode, especially early on as you're desperately telling your teammate what units you need and you guys try to squeeze out that last point of interest. All in all, it's polished and fun to play, plus it's free, what do you have to lose?"
2883,Abandoned by devs only people left use cheese strats 24/7 RNG is top tier b*****hit
2884,just like dota 2 it need achievements
2885,"- Did you see double 3 stars heroes during round 12? - play this game
- Do you want to be f*up after 8 hours hardworking everyday? Yep that's correct, play this game! 
- Your life is not suffering enough? - cool, you already know my answer dude"
2886,Bullshit just bullshit i have 4 lvl 2 hero and ready to do 3 with one more hero and never came that hero. Also when i got -20 hp others taking -0 can u belive how fair it is. Play from artwork on dota!
2887,nice
2888,Its just mad chill
2889,"very good
"
2890,"At first I thought there was strategy to this game, but your success or failure in a match ultimately depends on the RNG of the models you have the opportunity to purchase each round. There is very little you can do to actually alter the outcome of a game or match."
2891,"I CAN'T FIND UNSUSCRIBE FOR UNDERLORDS!
YOU SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO UNSUSCRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

2894,It's fun.
2895,"Not enough time between rounds to read anything.

2902,gud
2903,cool game
2904,"This game would be a lot better if the devs worked on improving spell targeting. Each unit feels as dumb as a pawn.

Needs some serious TLC in terms of balancing and bug fixes. 

The game feels sloppy for something from Valve, even if it is free.... Most of the content was already part of Dota 2 or imagined by the original Auto Chess creator. Besides the Underlord characters and the City Brawl it's not a very unique auto battler."
2905,"Fantastic game, play forever despite 0 updates"
2906,Worst targeting system of all the games i've played in my lifetime and i've been gaming for 20 years. The authors seem to not care about the game or lack very basic coding skills.
2907,This game is incredibly chilled out and ez to pick up. I have played over 200 hours and I absolutely love it!!!!! They make regular changes and updates to balance the game and the meta is constantly changing.

2933,good
2934,Nice game to play a few quick rounds.
2935,"BYE forever for real, underlords, you will not be missed.A RNG-DEPENDENT, 0-SKILL INVOLVED, POSITIONING DONT MATTER game. It actually became worse after updates. Peak gameplay was during summoners stone time, and then you guys decided to be clever and added underlords into the game when it was just fine. Fine, whatever, but then after the long-awaited big update recently, everything is just bunch of RNG dogshit shitshow clown fest afk game. THIS GAME SHOULD JUST STAY DEAD GTFO, if I enjoy/ want to enjoy Rng so much I might as well go to the casino rather than playing this bullshit."

2939,"Dota Underlords is a great time waster. I would highly recommend it for that, but I would not go into it expecting a super deep or balanced experience. There is a ton of RNG involved, to the point where some victories or defeats simply come down to luck. With that said, games are relatively short, and over the course of a few matches, the luck evens out. I really enjoy the large pool of heroes, alliances, and items, and all the intricate ways in which they complement each other. The single-player campaign is also pretty fun and contains some challenging puzzles.

I have played this game since it first came out, and I originally hated the addition of Underlords as characters on the board—I thought it felt gimmicky and unnecessary and didn't add anything to the game. However, since then Valve has done a great job incorporating them into the gameplay, and though it can be frustrating when they single-handedly decide the outcome of a battle, I now feel that they add a welcome layer of depth to the strategy of the game.

I would recommend this game, but only with properly managed expectations. It is by no means Game of the Year, but it is a fun, relatively mindless way to kill some time."

2980,"nicely developed, good ideas, hope to see some of them, in dota2 
ALSO SOMETHING LORE RELATED like new game, arcade ""campaign' like map in dota ?"
2981,"I generally like this genre and have gotten quite a bit of enjoyment from this title. Mostly I have been playing the knockout mode, which is nice for quicker games.
The most recent update has effectively turned knockout mode into a slot machine (more so than before). Your team selection and alliance affinity matter very little in comparison to how fast you can level up individual characters. It is a disappointing dynamic as the alliance affinities provide interesting approaches in how to consistently do well. The current iteration undermines that entirely in favor of luck. Hopefully something comes soon to balance that."

2991,"I would recommend this if you like a more casual random game. There are some strats too it, but in general it comes down to gambling, do you get more upgrades than everyone else. Do you get get units you need for you alliance, etc. It seems that every game the deck is saturated with one or two cards and people get 3 stars of that very quickly (before round 10 sometimes). So you have to guess what card that might be from round one and hope you get it right."

If dota auto chess is a basketball sport, then underlords feels like a basketball arcade machine.

3001,Good balance of luck and skill.
3002,"started out good, getting boring along the way, no real in game improvement and the playerbase is dying. The developers can learn a thing or two from Teamfight Tactics really, they do it really well and change the pieces every season"
3003,dota without voip + RNG
3004,"This is a great idle game if you are someone like me who can never sit still and just do one thing at a time. I will often have underlords going while watching tv, eating, or playing another video game. Its just easy enough to play casually once you kinda know what you're doing."

I feel like this should be a fun game as there are no loot boxes or pay to win type of mechanics. If you can figure it out and enjoy it, props to you.  However I cannot recommend this game to anyone as the learning curve is simply too steep."
3012,gdf
3013,"Fun at first but gets old after awhile

Autobattle games need have that wow factor from a visual and visceral viewpoint, because you just sit back and watch the battles, so imo the units need to look amazing, the animations need to be a joy to watch, effects need to wow you, it just needs to be a spectacle, and unfortunately this type of autobattler doesnt exist at the moment as afaik.

3014,For those of us who aren't quick enough to play Dota 2 anymore.
3015,"Underlords are balanced now. Lots of QoL features that other autobattlers lack (""one-click"" scouting of the lobby you're in so you can see other players' comps easily, ability to buy units and add them to the board even when you're at max units aka ""overflow"", a real Borderless Window mode etc). Units have a distinct look, making it easier to see what's going on, what you need to take out/add in, etc. Too bad the people that quit this game's last impression of the Underlords was the first iteration of them when there were only 2 and you got to ""build your own Underlord"" because they are much, much better now (Underlords is this game's ""gimmick"" just like Carousel is TFT's ""gimmick"", etc - Carousel isn't even about getting units, it's about getting items on those units despite the Carousel being made up of units)."

3020,"honestly it's not very fun. It's like actual Chess in the way that players memorize an optimal strategy and never differ from it no matter what. Doing so is actually required, since you have to play against other players, meaning that anyone who plays the game casually gets eliminated early and basically forced out of the game.

And there's the fact that it's a blatant rip off of auto chess, who Riot Games also cloned. At least Valve met with the devs of that and worked something out, according to wikipedia. 

But honestly this version is inferior in my opinion. I still like it, but I feel like there's only so much fun and experimentation allowed for in the design since you have to fight other players no matter what."
3021,"If you like chess, you'll like this. 
If you love Dota 2, you'll love the Underlords."
3022,"So new patches are hard in every game, and this isn't a criticism of that.  I'm sure a lot of reviews are.  The new meta is actually pretty entertaining to play.

Rather, my problems with the game are more structural.  There's a laggy bit at the end of each round, which is a crucial time for buying, especially if you're rolling.  I've gotten stuck unable to do anything but watch my team get disassembled because the game is chugging for no real reason.  It can literally throw the game for you.

On a second note, the randomness needs tighter bounds.  About 5ish percent of the time, you cannot win.  There's no route to victory, because the random nature of the game doesn't allow you to win.  This may be fine for many players, but taking skill completely off the table makes sitting through the rest of the game torture, waiting to get your 7th/8th place win.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, unless they fix some of the structural issues that prevent you from playing the game as they apparently intend it to be played."
3023,I have only Dota in my life now
3024,"Great strategy game with different game modes based on Dota 2 heroes.
I would also recommend to purchase the Battle Pass to enter the full campaign mode of the city crawl experience and to receive special items and in-game skins :)"

The strange thing is that the resemblance to the game of chess is huge. Both games have a square area as a base. That's probably why chess. However, that's the end of the similarity, and then it's just an arcade. Many write how the game is easily affected by chance? But where is that! The factor of chance plays the most important role here. After each round, a player can buy something from the five offered units of several types, abilities, races and who knows what else for the torn money, or move up a level, which allows you to send more units to the field. Three of the same units will be promoted by an asterisk, several of the same races, professions, etc. will receive a bonus. Once every five rounds, a usable item. And here is the fatal role of chance. If one player gets better characters to choose from, God forbid he immediately connects a two-star character, other players can go straight. What's more, they stare blankly into the monitor for an hour as they get a ""knock"" from these lucky ones (because chance just looked elsewhere) and don't do anything about it. And when a promotion character finally appears in the menu, others have more promoted characters. Even the announced arrangement of units will not affect the game much. Most of the characters run somewhere, ported, so mostly only dances rest on the spot and they lie down cheerfully first. Or not. You can't intervene in the battle, so you just grit your teeth."

If you want to build an army that you've planned out and reach lvl 10 to put 10 units on the board, the game won't give you the characters that you want, even when you spend about 50 gold to shuffle through... 

Also there's no way to know why you lost, especially when you've built a good team & get completely demolished... 

Also the builds that win the most are completely repeated over and over... not much creativity with how people win: they either go delta-slam-spam, troll-knight, or full shaman (at this time)."

A great roulette system for character growth and solid formation options for the field of battle. Over all a really enjoyable way to pass the time. A great side game for long queues while in DoTA or a perhaps an MMO as well should you be into PC gaming. It's cross platform so your Steam account is playable from PC to mobile as well. So you can progress on the go too! Worth a couple hours of play at the very least."
3099,Fan of dota so this game is kind of good to me
3100,Good game when you're at work and got nothing to do

3109,This game was so addicted by myself and I love the strategic gameplay
3110,ok
3111,I love playing this game to pass my time in between work sessions.  It has a great interface on PC.
3112,Very good variety of chess pieces and interesting combination. Worth the try if you wanna play an auto chess alternative
3113,a fun game to past your time and increase your critical and analytical thinking.
3114,not bad

3117,"По сравнению с бета версией, все очень быстро меняется, вначале стал целый отряд появляться. Подумать совсем некогда."
3118,Meh.
3119,FUCK THIS GAME EVERYTIME I WIN A ROUND IT WILL STUCK MOTHERFUCKER
3120,gicior
3121,"would recommend the battle pass, great way to burn time on the pc and off"
3122,when dota underlords release was a big fun now is very boring
3123,"Play the fucking trailer, Valve"
3124,Its free and you can have casual fun.  I don't know how it is competitively but as a basic autochess game it works if you just want to chill on steam against bots or whatever.
3125,its a great game
3126,It's okay.
3127,"Fun and relaxing.
Lots of combos, great versatility. Never gets old for long."
3128,bechuuul
3129,"This is one of the worst video games I ever played. Verily, it is astounding an electronic game can be this bad. All my playtime comes from Android gameplay. I think it is exaggerated because after pressing home button the game sits in background, Steam probably counts the time and indeed, android game library is that bad I'm forced to suffer with this mess. Unfortunately, the original Auto Chess app is a Chinese spyware."
3130,"Love the game but fix the fucking crashing issue that gets fixed and broken every other update - lost MANY rounds/games because of it
"
3131,"An extension of Dota2, it is okay. I still recommend if you want to get out of the daily dota2 grind."
3132,Amazingly good and entertaining with a steep learning curve. Love it!
3133,"Fun game on the whole. Es[ecially considering it is free to play. It is not as complex as many other autochess games on the market, but its seen a lot of updates and is pretty well balanced. My largest complaint, which has nothing to do with game play, is that nearly all the rewards for leveling are locked behind a paywall so the entire leveling system is more or less irrelevant."
3134,great game try it
3135,good
3136,good

3151,"It got way better, in a good playable state right now."
3152,"I enjoyed Dota Underworlds better than TeamFight Tactics. Especially the Onslaught mode, I could play it for 15 minutes during break."
3153,"its shit
"
3154,"If you are into autobattler you should try this game.

Right now with an upcoming hero rotation it is probably the best time to get into it.
I prefer the dota graphics over the more cartoonish style of the competitors. There are some things i am not the biggest fan of like the underlords have in my opinion too much influence on the fights but overall it is a good game right now.

So give it a try :)"
3155,Kinda cool
3156,good game
3157,RNG and unbalanced.
3158,It's Valve. It's addicting. I'm reinstalling it. The usual.
3159,If you want to play dota but not fully commited then this is the game
3160,chill game with some new content on the way!
3161,"Fun game but gets repetitive very fast, since you can just force any build of your choosing every game.."
3162,"completely trash RNG game - if you don't build knights & trolls or get completely lucky as fuck with rng 3 stars then gl ranking up.

ps does anyone have the dota underlords support number as I think i played vs a bot by the name of Aryan in my competitive games

thanks in advance"
3163,play this game.
3164,ITs okey for fun
3165,Its fun
3166,It's fun.
3167,best game aver
3168,"This game is amazing. Never thought I'd get into auto-chess, but I had no idea there was so much tactic behind it. I feel like this game takes a long time to master, but even then, every fight is still different. I've played 30 hours over three days and the challenge is amazing every single time. Looking forward to diving deeper and understanding each individual hero better as I play more. No P2W/P2P aspect to this game, everyone draws from the same pool of toons. Super solid, worth the $5 battle pass, I hope the game continues to see support!"
3169,"Released a year ago this game is good as a timewaster but lacks:

-Workable feedback (menus shift on between view modes for poor design reasons, hp ticks up but doesn't tick fast enough to tell you anything before the end of round animation ends, tooltips are vague)
-Balance.  Devs update one group at a time, don't adjust the tiers of their units to compensate (looking at you druids), give passive buffs to one group but don't adjust other groups to account (looking at summoners) and have constantly done this for a year
-Interruptions.  (You read one tooltip to have it interrupted by a round start message, you end a game to have a popup about cosmetics interrupt your options to spectate or review your own play)
-Strategic choice. You go for two stars to win initial rounds then aim to pick which ever group is currently over powered. Bad feedback inhibits anything else.
-Stability.  I have started getting silent crashes after the initial 6 months.  Which mean lost buy rounds, which means lost games.  Not fun.
-Improvements.  The game has been out a year and the design has been radically redesigned away from strategic auto chess to tactical tapper without adding to the original concept.  This looks like the focus shifted to a mobile market.

For a PC user I would say you are better off playing hearthstone battlegrounds."
3170,"Fun to play, strategy, card/auto chess  type of game.
Easy to learn , decent updated and story mode."
3171,solid
3172,"autochess
"
3173,Blaze it
3174,sht game
3175,"The game was fun and straight forward in the beta before they put the ""Underlords"" in it. 
Now it just feels stressed, you must rush decisions and the match is often over before you even knew what happened.
Much like the issues they had in the beta before they nerfed AOE to make matches easier to follow and feel less like RNG. Now thats all it feels like. RNG."
3176,"couldn't get to immortal rank on dota2, got to lord of white spire on dota underlords. however, nobody plays this damn game. please come play with us"
3177,"This has been my favorite auto chess game. I played a lot during the beta and from time to time recently. The meta and other things have changed a lot pretty quickly making it hard for a casual player like myself to keep up with it, but it's a very solid game."
3178,Play auto chess OG mod until valve can get off their arses and implement more heroes into this... They don't really have any excuses not to... Also the AI needs serious improvements.
3179,"Genuinely fun, A different take on the Auto-chess Style"
3180,"game is stupid like shit i wait 10 rounds to get 1 hero lvl 1 nice shit
"
3181,ah
3182,"if youre down for strategies and combinations, recommend it!!"
3183,"Too much RNG.
Half the heroes are useless, ""never pick"" tier.
Most synergies are meaningless.
No tournaments.
1 major update per year.
PvE mode is locked behind paywall."
3184,"The game is 5% skill and 95% RNG, if you are okay with that, it's fun to get frustrated about getting screwed over every time and maniacally laugh when you finally get three of the right units in a row. Beats the hell out of the league one."
3185,"Pretty good game, gotten better with latest updates and meta changes."
3186,"There is no neutral review so I have put it through as a positive. However there are so many issues with this game that many people may find, exhausting and frustrating. 
When in Beta the game was excellent, it was full of strategy and had multiple ways to play with unique alliances and you had to actually think and combine different alliances and characters to make it to the top three. However as the game developed and the battle pass was released, the game has changed for the worse.
The game has been drastically simplified. You no longer have to worry about alliances or any real strategy as there are some incredibly overpowered characters which dominate everything. If you manage to get them on the field the game is yours.
Alliances have been overthrown for the newest gimmick of three star abilities, which are more powerful than any alliance and is too easily attained. 
The characters are on a constant rotation and there are times when all you will see is; Chaos Knight, Blood Seeker or Tiny and you have a guaranteed three star on turn 4. Just don't look for satisfying plays or cool ways to win, just stick with the random op characters. 

The game is worth a play as some people may enjoy it but if your looking for something strategic and brain activating, I don't recommend this game for you. 
Those who want to casually tune out the world and mindlessly click, give it a go.

3189,"Battle pass being very intrusive after every game popping up even if you don't have, its like the devs are trying to force ppl to buy the battle pass with the popup after each game, might aswell play TFT instead when shit like this is added."
3190,Just no no and no.. Autochess is better
3191,This game is not as fun as it used to be. No update. Bunch of hackers
3192,"chess like game, 10 gold of 10"
3193,the best !!!
3194,really makes you feel like an underlord 9/10
3195,nice game!!!
3196,good
3197,"Good game!
"
3198,"Really great game, although it seems its been sidelined by its developers - promised season two for months yet haven't gotten it. Unfortunate really as this was much better than TFT."
3199,"Avoid! It was good during beta, but since then they've changed alot, removed info that is available to you (such as enemy team comp, if you lose a fight there's no way to find out why and what to improve) and has become more about getting lucky than being a strategic game. There is also no value in getting the battlepass (which for some reason uses its own currency instead of the steam wallet).

TLDR: It used to be good, now just avoid it like the plague. All positive reviews are from the beta."
3200,Since adding knockout its been a fun quick pickup and go game. the integration between phone and computer is great as well!
3201,Yikes..
3202,"Its a pretty nice game only problem is in my opinion there isnt enough  underlords
"
3203,decent gamer
3204,great
3205,"Was good before they dumbed it down. Teamfight tactics is way, way better."
3206,way better than tft
3207, Good stuff.
3208,"The game obviously rewards basic dota knowledge, as the abilities doesn't need as much explaining/exploring for those who know most of them already. As for autochess experience, I have come from TFT, and it couldn't be more different, not much help from there.

The basics (controls, concept of alliances and underlords) are easy to understand, a couple hours and one can comfortably navigate the game. The potential of strategy is immerse though, almost any alliances can be combined with success, if one chose the right items.

The dynamic feels good, less waiting around compared to TFT. I don't really approve the paylocked features, could have been just cosmetics, but not gonna judge it, as it doesn't affect multiplayer. It is certainly worth a try."
3209,"They ran this game to the ground. Was fun and addictive, now is a hot mess. A great example of what not to do in a game, congratulations devs!"
3210,The best AutoChess out there!
3211,nice autochess game
3212,strategy
3213,Goood
3214,"Love this game, but Update this s****"
3215,Great game.  Player base is a little low which makes matchmaking a little long some times.
3216,They ruined it by making it a huge mess to even try to look at.
3217,"For a long time I really loved this game. The Duos mode meant I could play with a friend and we could try to compete with other teams. It was a good time. Over the last few months it feels like one guy has been making this game. Every update introduces some new 3 stare effect and the characters haven't rotated at all. There are less characters than there were since the game started, and it feels like valve doesn't care about it at all. It feels like they never found a way to monetize the game, so it's put onto life support.

This game was really good and I really hope Valve fixes it. I don't see that happening, but still I can hope.

***UPDATE***
I've added another 100 or so hours to this game and I still stand by this review. We haven't had an update since November and I haven't seen any information about anything coming soon. Hopefully we'll see something. At least they abandoned the game in an ok place."
3218,Fun. Very simple when you get the hang of out
3219,good
3220,ONE OF THE BEST GAME !!  AMAZING STUFF!
3221,"Unique, fresh and fun. Underlords is as deep as it is accessable with a very high skill ceiling and engaging gameplay. Min max your lists and experiment with different builds and lineups, when to roll, when to save, when to blow your load and when to swap heroes. Highly recommend"
3222,good game
3223,Its auto chess
3224,its good game - repetitive a bit but good
3225,its fun i guest
3226,Has a relatively short learning curve. I learned on the standard play and had no idea what Knockout mode was. I tried it and that's what I mostly play now. I recommend learning in Knockout Mode. 10/10
3227,Nahhh Man this game is so lit!!
3228,Remove spirit builds they are game breaking.
3229,
3230,Hay
3231,"despite the timer by steam, i played for about 10mins.

gotta be honest, it did nothing for me. dont get me wrong its alright but, i just found it a bit ....meh
i cannot give it a thumbs down as i didnt see anything to deserve it and im sure for some it will be a nice game. 

i did find it more interesting to play than dota 2 which i just found to be dull, but this still lacked anything i haven't seen elsewhere. worth a go if it looks like your thing but i thought it was up my alley and it turned out to just be the neon sign pointing it out"
3232,Great timewaster.
3233,this game suck
3234,"Removed scrappy and mechs, heroes like Alch, Kunkka, Pa and more.
Tier 5 heroes are mostly usekess. T5 troll, SK, Axe, Void is useless.
Balance is weird. Game become faster. In mostly cases you didn't even think about lvl 10 you have less money and you need to roll. So what for lvl 10 exists?
Such alliances as Void, Brute, Primordial are useless. 
Demons useless if you pick SF, because he can't ulti but he cast his ult and loses time staying afk because of animation
Assassins is very weak because there is no PA. Only Slark can win round if you find and upgrade him.

I can't imagine how can developers make such simple game worse and worse with updates"
3235,mmhmmhhmhmmmh
3236,verry hard
3237,LOL
3238,.
3239,"i like it ,"
3240,fun
3241,yes
3242,"Great game, great UI. Takes a few games to get into it and understand the synergies and then you can just keep playing forever."
3243,Best Autochess I know :)
3244,nice game
3245,Must play this game if you're a player who wants a strategy game and if you have knowledge about Dota 2 skills. 10/10 rating
3246,"its like chess but with dota pieces but also gambling.

so always remember to pay gaben and u win"
3247,this game is fun alot of stratigic gameplay fun fact did you know this game is maid by the same creator of team fortress 2
3248,this game was better than dota chess.
3249,"The game mechanics are awesome, but the rng ruined the game"
3250,Long time no game like this shook my world
3251,"It's a fast paced, defensive strategy game that is great for casual and competitive players. The learning curve is pretty steep but if you watch a youtube video or two it can make the game a lot easier. I used to play on a regular basis but I was getting tired of how often the characters and strategy changed with each up date. It felt like I was relearning the game every week. Hopefully they have found a more consistent balance so I can play casually and still enjoy it."
3252,nice game. the game has a good balance.
3253,It's a good game to play if you don't want to try too hard but pass time
3254,"Another Auto-chess, free to play so everyone can give it a chance. If you are a DotA fan you may enjoy it. But the final answer is that I don' recommend it cause it lacks some improvements or new things to the genre, it's just the basic stuff."
3255,"Regular crashes and an intro you can't skip. The UI constantly bugs requiring a restart to fix and in their infinite wisdom they disabled alt+F4 and the windows key so you have to open task manager to get out of the game. Stupid AI that target full health units instead of low health units. Games are based more on luck of the draw and who you're matched against than skill. Some synergies don't work with units you'd expect them to limiting viable builds (insect + brawler for example). Annoying animations that stop you from progressing when you start a game, unlock an item, get an unlock or try and zoom the map.

How my solo game's going at the moment: I click a mission, wait through the menu animation, finish the mission, and then I have to kill the game with task manager because the UI breaks and I can't claim my reward or close the game."
3256,Great Game to kill time with Friends!
3257,"new patch doesnt make re-roll feasible. games now are purely based on RNG, i mean its an RNG game anyway. Broken heroes such as spectre is an auto-win most likely so meh."
3258,"this game is addictive

Would not recommend
Lagging a lot in the city crawl
Also has a battle pass
11/10 would not recommend"
3261,Duos take too long to find match. Pls improve matchmaking system
3262,"DOTA Underlords. More like DOTA Build Summoners, Mages, Or Assassin's simulator. Most if not all my opponents within the last few weeks build nothing but Summoners. One or two build Assassins. And, I might get lucky and find a mage user. I switch my build every game. No sense of playing the same comp in casuals and tryharding. Literally, the only thing I see my opponents to is press the R button. that's it. The OG Auto Chess used to be about playing the economy and playing it smart to get to late game and building comps. No longer like that it seems. Nothing but people level 5/6 with 0 gold with like 4 3 star heroes who seem to get dumb lucky until they steam roll all game. No smart placements. No playing the economy. Just a summoner comp with a 3 star random hero that doesn't even fit with the squad into a snowball win. 
I hate that Valve decided to abandon this. If you want to play Auto Chess I recommend just downloading DOTA 2 and playing it that way. This game is loooooong doomed."
3263,"Extremely good game in the ""Auto Chess"" Genre. it has a lot of potential and there have been some positive changes made but the player base has been slowly falling off, the game is not dead by any means, it's just not as popular as it once was, usually averaging around 12k players actively playing now when there used to be literally 100k + 

I know this happens to a lot of games over time but i can't help but think about how much longer this game is really going to last, personally i'm looking for games that i can play for the next few years with a good player base etc, the drop in player count for Dota Underlords doesn't fill me with much confidence in the longevity of the game

If you can look past all of that and want to play a game in this kind of genre,i'd highly recommend trying Dota Underlords
"
3264,Is cool game for cool dudes that like a cool time.
3265,5/5
3266,"This game used to be fun.

It's now plagued with Chinese bots/hackers. The RNG is fucked. The meta shifts so often it's impossible to keep track of, so a build you know works today may be totally useless tomorrow. 
The hero system seemed cool, but there's ones that are so much obviously better than the others and if you don't get the one you need you're fucked. 

It used to be a good game, but now it's just a mangled husk of what it used to be."
3267,ya yeet
3268,Used to be good.
3269,fuck the rng
3270,Bit of a downfall as you compared with other card based games. The only perk is that you can play the game with dota 2 her ocards.
3271,Dota with Chess
3272,good
3273,noice
3274,"Superb game for wasting time when you should actually be productive. 

I just made it to Boss level today after 273 hours. This is time I could have been doing literally anything else other than drafting Trolls or losing. It's not a 'bad' game- it's just always there. On your phone or ipad waiting for you saying, ""hey buddy- you want to not do anything for 20 minutes?"" and I'm like- yeah yeah i do. 

Buy a narritive game. Read a book. Learn a skill. Practice some coding. 

Dota Underlords gives you what you ask for. Color matching and the illusion that you're doing something. 8/10"

3327,"This is the biggest trash game ever created. It started out alright but they have systematically screwed it up so bad that its actually infuriating. I swear this game studio is run by a bunch of apes that never even play their own game. There are so many features missing that other games in this genre have and over the months they just remove features instead of add. They destroy OP classes instead of just balancing them, like wtf are you even thinking?! OMG and the artwork...the artwork is so fucking bad that I can shit on a piece of paper and will look better than the trash you create. Like who the fuck at your studio looks at this shit and thinks ""Yeah that is nice"". Is your art department blind or just plain retarded?!

To fix your issues is so easy...listen to the community. Let the community design artwork for you like they do for Dota 2. Add more strategic elements to this game like being able to customise your underlord (like you had at the beginning) and the ability to save line ups. I mean holy shit man, this stuff is so basic. OMG and don't let me even get started on your RNG for getting units. The amount of times I reach level 9 and have still only seen one wind ranger when no-one else is picking them up is just absurd. The same for many other units. Sometimes you just need that one level 3 or 4 unit and you look, and look, and look and you just don't get it. I have played 3 other games similar to Dota Underlords and this shit never happens in the others...this RNG feels like it was designed to screw with you instead of being fair. I hate it...I hate this game...and I don't understand why you people don't just fix it. Anyway I guess the only things stupider than this game is me for still playing it. No more"
3328,none
3329,fun

3331,never played it :/
3332,"This game has been screwed over quite badly.  I would still have mixed feelings about this game. I used to love the game for its customization and how it gave the portability of auto chess, specially in terms of a standard match, we had the option to select abilities, as to which one our hero would have, suddenly they just decided to remove it entirely, and we were left with random abilities along with random ultimate. While there are 4 heroes to choose from, it just feels like they are trying to dumb down the game for users."
3333,good game
3334,Fun competitive game to play.
3335,"I think Underlords is an improvement over Auto Chess, personally. It runs smoother for me, the item and unit placement system is more intuitive, and there are more modes to play + hero units to change gameplay. However, it has been streamlined to lose some of the original charm of Auto Chess, and subsequent updates have upset some people. I don't have high expectations, so perhaps I'm not the right person to ask about the overall history."
3336,nice game
3337,Nice dota2 chess with a beautiful animation and gameplay
3338,Best auto fighter game that I've played so far. This game is a card and board game hybrid. And who doesn't love DOTA?
3339,"Enjoyable casual game. Mechanics of the Underlords can be a little complex to beginners, but it's fairly easy to pick up after a few games."
3340,"How do you fuck up a game this badly, shit was so fun on release."
3341,nice game
3342,Its easily the best auto chess game on steam filled with all the characters you know and love from dota 2! Also its free so try it out!

3361,Not balanced. Don't waste your time.
3362,"Easy to pick up on an easy difficulty and not feel totally lost, great depth as well for once you get the hang of it and a moderate challenge as your going up bot levels etc. Also like the two different game modes as well very different play styles which was awesome ! First auto battler i have tried and i have enjoyed it so far"

3367,"This is cool game
"
3368,"I'm giving this game a 4/10. While it is fun, the lack of valve not releasing a season two yet has made it incredibly stale and i can only find myself playing on a very inconsistent basis."
3369,"Fun game to play with nice but partial strategy combined with random chaos.
I like the short battles - good to have a go for a couple of minutes.
I think this game can also easily morph into something more - with regards to equipment, different play boards, obstacles etc.
In short - worth playing."

3373,Gud
3374,"Increase Hero Pool, and improve chance and gameplay for players to have 3 star on 5 gold hero"
3375,Good when bored
3376,"The game is very buggy. The dragging to sell or to send to your team mate on duos sometimes get stuck and won't work for a couple seconds. The game also crashes a lot. Although, you can reconnect to a match, the time you lose will make you lose a turn, in which can be very detrimental to the match if it is already late into it. There is also a Sound glitch that EVERY match a play the SFX and Music gets distorted and crackly and, sadly, the only way I can fix it is by restarting the computer. I had this issue in 2 different PC's and I've already tested on a fresh windows install to check with it was a sound drive problem. 

This problems makes the game very hard to recommend as it is very frustrating. The Gameplay itself can be fun if you know the meta builds and understand the the game is pretty much like playing Black Jack with extra steps. In the early days of the game you could be more creative. However, the newer updates and, the fact that players got better at the game, made so that only few combinations can get to the late game."
3377,"it has only 30 frame number sometime in game, and even 5. it is like playing a flash or ppt. please optimize it more times or offer the programer for sacrifice. it is the worst optimize i ever met"
3378,"Dota: Underlords is absolute shit! The graphics certainly look good, although the game is boring. All you do is throw characters at other characters and watch them fight. You do nothing, its like playing hoi4 in spectator mode!"
3379,Good game. Thematically well developed and interesting game. Would be nicer if the embed Voice chat for play duos game with friends.

3384,Great game to play when you're doing something else and wants to play something
3385,"Great autochess inspired game, smooth UI, gameplay and plenty of game info in the client, could be a little more on the in depth things like atk speed and armour. Frequent balance updates, but usually very small, sometimes long wait for the next season (with the big changes to the hero pool, item pool etc). Dota heroes and flavour included. If you like strategy, playing the odds and/or dota this game is enjoyable."
3386,best game
3387,"I don't play Dota, but this seemed interesting. It's good, but I wish there were more alliances, and now that I've played as much as I have, I feel like I've seen everything. I've done all the decks I've wanted, so I'm not sure if I'll really keep playing, as I've found the decks I like best, so every time I play I just copy them. Still a good time, and it's free so there's no point not to try it."
3388,Dying game
3389,Dota Autochess+
3390,"Followed this game through the beta and I thoroughly enjoy DotA's adaptation of autochess. Every now and again they tweak the heroes and the items and the tier lists but it never creates too big of an impact to change how you play. Their absolutely is a learning curve here. I hadn't been a big autochess guy myself with might and magic: clash of heroes being my reference point, but this is fast paced. First time players will think the game moves too fast which is understandable, but once you learn how to save your money for interest, how to make alliances, and figure out what combos/alliances work well together, the pace of play is perfect.

To conclude if you like autochess games, and have at least dabbled with DotA, you will like this game. No doubt in my mind this is one of the best of it's type, just like DotA is for MOBA's."

3400,"I like strategy games. I still haven't got a good grasp on current meta (because I'm too lazy to read) but the game is enjoyable nevertheless. I like that I can log into my steam account on the mobile app and play from there as well on the go. The unlocks you can earn are funny and interesting, don't have to pay to win which is a plus. All in all it's a good little time waster for me. Some folks might get deeper into the meta and be competitive, but even if you don't it's still fun."

AFter reconsideration I will change review from positive to negative. I I realize I just can't play with the characters I like and matches are totally random so no, I do not recommend the game.Music disabled yet still Plays music. speech disabled yet still plays speech. The game is not top notch but isnt bad. It seems like it's lacking with only 4 main heros which are dislikeable. The rewards page is annoying and I dont need to see it every match. Post match play again dosn't restart matchmaking.

There are better games of this style but are not supported on steamOS. Therefor that makes this the top game of its class because its the only one on steamOS."

3420,"This thing makes me rage more than CS:GO and DotA2 for some reason, but it's a good game nonetheless.

That being said, the game needs balance improvements, there are some alliances which are too strong during the early game and too weak on late game (i.e. Insects) or simply lacking at all stages of the game (i.e. Primordials)."

3424,"Buggy at times, but not frequently. Nice free casual game that has strategic depth to it allowing for scalability for non-casual playing sessions and replayability."
3425,This game hits harder then Mike Tyson
3426,"Dota Underlords is free to play and is an auto battler game.
Born out of the well known Autochess mod for Dota2 Underlords is a standalone game. A knowledge of Dota2 is not necessary at all.
You pick your heroes and place them on the chessboard and they fight by themself against the enemy heroes. Round by round you try to form alliances. ""Stacking your team with allied heroes will unlock powerful bonuses that can crush your rivals."" However, RNG plays a big role here, units you can pick are offered random every round.
Dota Underlords features crossplay between PC and mobile (Android/IOS). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices (Steam login). 
The game is fun and kinda addictive for a while. I personaly lost the interest after 177 hours.
The graphics are ok, from my point of view the original Autochess had way better graphics. It is even looking worse on mobile platform. But it is not all about the graphics...
If you are searching for a free online game as a time waster which you can also play with your phone, you should give Dota Underlords definitely a try.

3461,amazing
3462,"I wanted to like this.  I was hoping to find something better than TFT but from what I can tell there arnt many options for this genre of game yet unfortunately. 

So to start the button placement for buying and the gold icons are super annoyingly placed on the interface. And then even in a casual match you just feel super rushed so you cant actually look at what the items are or what abilities the units have. And I COULD go and look it all up somewhere else but I the game itself doesnt feel fun enough for that extra effort to be worth it. I would hate to try their ""rushed"" version.

Then the abilities for the characters graphics are all terrible. They flood the screen and none look polished.

The in game chat features are very limited and annoying to even find.

And to top it off the underlords you can buy to compliment your team once your a few rounds in do not feel at all balanced. In fact none of the units feel very balanced. The same can be said for the items. 0 balance in this game."
3463,"Dota underlords can be quite fun if you like games that mostly depend on luck. Don't be fooled by the strategic appearance, it all comes down to praying to rngeezus for getting the one or 2 picks you need."

I loved the strategic rounds, the neutral rounds and the few combos that were out there and you needed to get good at. I quit playing the game since the underlords update, imo it completely destroyed the game. I would absolutely LOVE to be able to play the version before that update. I really dislike the way they patched this game. I guess it was an attempt to differentiate and make it original but they just failed to deliver (for me).

3475,"Everyone has a taste and I think this game has 2 drawbacks. First of all, if he wants to improve in dota, he won't have time to give this game to him professionally, and secondly, it has become much harder since underlord's was added to this game, and this hardening has made him less popular.

I've been playing since just before the imclusion of knockout mode in the beta. I dont have a huge amount of hours invested but when you consider knockout mode games like around 5mins and thats basically all ive played i've played a bunch.. In typical dota fashion the patches are pretty big and completly flips shit on its head. which in my opinion is a terrible way to update a game like this.  currently at the time of writign this review  the game is severly unbalanced. 
the addition of the city crawler is fantastic and a lot of fun to do, the street brawls and the puzzles are so much fun that i would love to see more of those 2 features"

3604,"Valve is back to doing what it does best and boy am I happy about it.  The standard Valve recipe for making one of their famous genre defining games is to take an idea that is somewhat interesting and polish it to within an inch of its life. This is true for most of their biggest hits and it is certainly true for this game as well. As far as I am concerned DOTA Underlords is the pinnacle of the auto chess genre (some may call it fad). Every single aspect of the game is well thought out and has some deep strategy attached to it. Yet despite this incredible amount of depth it is still a game which is very easy to pick up and play. The core gameplay loop is so rewarding and addictive that I don't think there will ever be a time when it gets boring. And the presentation, while certainly somewhat flashy and cartoonish, is still top notch and reminiscent of a high quality Saturday morning cartoon show that adults would enjoy watching as well. In comparison I found Team Fight Tactics' presentation irritatingly juvenile and childish.To cut a long story short this is the best game to pick up if you are new to the autochess genre or you want to stick to just one game in the genre. I sincerely hope that the DOTA community keeps this game alive for a long, long time to come."

3640,"I wasn't sure I was going to be interested in this at the beginning. But the game sucked me in almost immediately, which really surprised me because I don't typically enjoy turn based games. There were hick-ups in the beta stages, also during the pre-release, and certainly still exist, but the game continues to keep me interested. I also play a lot of MOBA games, with a pretty high competitive spirit, so this happens to be a perfect game for me to take breaks from the higher pace of these games. I still get the benefits of playing against other players, but at a much calmer pace for the most part. 

Its worth mentioning that the game does offer rank play, as well as, a much faster paced version in the Knockout addition. 

Overall I really enjoy this game."

First time I played this game I struggled, it's the same as today though mild as compared as before.

3668,good game
3669,"It's a fun game that feels really good when you find yourself able to put together a good composition, but that's not always going to happen. So, is it still fun when you kind of get shafted? Sure. Figuring out which compositions work, which underlord is best to pick for your comp, and how to properly manage your economy can all be fun even if you're losing. 

That being said, it does feel like the game lacks transparency in terms of just how to properly evaluate your units. There are times where I've built a composition that looks good on paper but just gets shredded, and it's hard for me to understand how. Seems like with an expanded roster of characters compared to previous versions, it does seem like randomness plays a bit of an outsized role.

I could put probably put in the work and dig into the stats, but the stats and replays aren't available after games end (and if they are, I don't know how to find them, which is a problem!). And what I mean by not available is that while you're in the game, you can see damage dealt and healed and all that, but when you're eliminated or even when you win, the menus for how to find that information aren't great, hard to navigate, and once you leave them entirely, that's it. You can't go back to old games. So, if you lose and want to queue again quickly, you basically have to just forfeit the ability to review the game. 

So, fun and interesting game, but user interfaces aren't great, RNG feels bad some times, and opacity in terms of how to review mistakes and improve improve is real."

3675,Very entertained game. Made my day
3676,"Fun Auto-Chess Game. Even if you have no prior knowledge about the DOTA universe, the game is very accessible. Don't expect strategic depths - even though you have to know the different mechanisms and how they work together, the best strategy fails if you continue to get the wrong characters for implementing. Therefore, the game reuires you to be very flexible in your set-up, which is a strategic choice in its own right. Overall, it is a fun concept perfectly executed that can keep you entertained for quite some time."

3681,"Great game for a great price. The battle pass is very worth it if you enjoy the game. $4.99 USD is the best pricing for a battlepass in the market and gives you plenty of options that you can truly enjoy.

The gameplay is simple enough to be casual and enjoyable, while complex enough that it takes a true attention to detail and mechanics to master. There are so many things going on behind the scenes of the battlefield that you really need to pay attention to if you want to become great, but even if you're looking for a very casual auto-chess game, you can just build units and alliances and beat people/bots down and enjoy yourself. 

The developers are doing great at frequent updates, patches, and hotfixes as well. Great game"
3682,"A lot of fun, and quite the challenge as well. Many improvements have been made since launch, and as you can see from my play hours, well, it's pretty fun (and occasionally maddening, as there is luck involved as well!)

If the online matches are too hard (and they likely will be), then play against bots. You still get XP, but you can pause the game and take your time to figure out a winning strategy. I'm sure as time goes on, the game will keep getting better and better!"

At a certain point in early access, they have removed the spawns, but probably community complained it's too hard to think of a strategy to be in top 3 at the end of a game.
So pick all the heroes that can spawn anything, throw in a healer and you're set to win.
I'm really disappointed as a returning player...."

3703,"They came a long way. Starting out as a blatent clone of the original Autochess they have well profiled themselves among the auto battlers out there. I like the inclusion of the quick variant ""knockout"". A breath of fresh air of the normal very long games. 
I do feel that there is still a lot of possibilities for improvement. The economy aspect feels a bit lackluster as they reduced the maximum interest. It feels more like an obligatory hurdle now than actually having impact on the gameplay.
Keep up the improvements!"

3727,"Despite its decline in popularity this is still a Valve game and very high quality. For reference I play TFT with my friends and play this as a time killer while watching netflix. This is a very well designed game, the UI and game feel is terrific and the single player is pretty fun and serves as a good break from the online. In this game units can only hold one item and many of the synergies are not dps oriented so power is distributed across more units rather than in a few hypercarries (for most lineups at least). This has the effect of making units feel more unique and potentially useful. Many units also have power spikes when they hit level 3 giving them a new ability making it worthwhile to keep low tier level 3s and makes it possible for some units to carry you from round 1 to victory. I think auto battlers are ultimately just dumb fun time killers and this game is much more polished and complete than TFT leading me to sink way more singleplayer hours into it. I would recommend trying it out if you like auto battlers."
3728,ONLY BIG BRAIN PLAY THIS GAME
3729,"Played and enjoyed the game in beta.    However after reinstalling the game 6 months later the first two games crashed with no error message.       No error catching in code is a joke.

3786,"Dota Auto Chess is among the three spiritual successors of the famous Dota 2 mod (the other ones are Riot's LoL Team Fight Tactics and the cross platform stand alone version of the mod, released on both Google Play Store and Epic Game Store). 
Mechanics - The core mechanics are simple yet it takes a while to fully understand the game. It's an easy to learn, difficult to master kind of game. A little bit of RNG ish.
Matchmaking - Queue time is fast compared to Dota 2. 
Community - Toxicity isn't a problem since there are no ways to communicate with other players. People on forums are not salty.
Stability - I haven't encountered any instance of bugs or glitches while playing the game so far.
Graphics - Fair, to say the least. Aesthetically pleasing to eyes as it follows Dota's cartoony look does not require you to have a nice set up to run.
Replayability - There are tons of combos to utilize and strategies to implement. Every match is different from the other."
3787,Highly recommended!
3788,"I give it a 8/10

Its fun to try different combos with traits and all, hope they add more though because I like experimenting.
I do come back and play it again after some time, I can play it on Mobile as well and easily switch over (big plus in my book). The RNG in the game is kinda rewarding kinda bullshitty but I mean, so is life. Easy going game, basic but you can really do well if you know what you are doing.

3810,"Nice graphics - poor game play :(
After playing this game for a bit, I have to say that it is far too dependant on getting lucky in the shop and tactical decisions only play a minor role. 
You need to fuse equal units to level them up and if you dont get the units you need, to upgrade the units you already have, you just cant win against someone who got a little luckier. And what units you find in the shop after each round, is just too random.
The fact that units of certain types can buff each other, only complicates this further and makes it even more luck based. 
In the end that makes even the wins rather shale, because they are also just a matter of luck and not to a significant degree of tactis."

is good game"
3853,Exciting
3854,can be boring but its nice.

3858,You have to play this game or keeping live a boring life.
3859,"As just staring off you get some wins, then while you are still learning, it lets go of your hand and throws you into the deep and end you just end up with loss after loss against bots.....and you only have 30 seconds to read what each minion does....I was only aloud 4 on the bored...yet the bot could have 5....

This game isn't for me."
3860,Funny game
3861,good game

3863,"Used to be 70% RNG and 30% skill. Fortunately, the devs saw the problem and proceeded to helpfully patch it to be 100% RNG and 0% skill. Thanks Valve!"
3864,good game
3865,Am I having fun? I just...don't know...
3866,enjoy
3867,"Been playing this since beta. The first couple of hours were addicted. And as of today i play it just to relax. 
Like many auto battle games you choose your set up. Put the characters in place. You make combinations as you like (for example full tank with healing) and you get to sit in your lazy chair, a good cup of coffee while you own the battle, or not.

Anyway, since they've add heroes and some on the side line mission to unluck stuff, it's gotten a whole lot better. 
And i enjoyed it quite a lot before that time! 

Another important fact is dat queue times are short. Within a few seconds you'r in game.

If this game got you attention, and you'r still reading this, go play it. Really!"
3868,"not bad , i would prefer to play on mobile platform's :|"
3869,JEU DE CHIASSE
3870,fantastic and a compatitive game
3871,adding the underlords ruined the game
3872,Fun game that gets some pretty nice updates.
3873,"A lot of fun for a free to play game, purchasable things are purely cosmetic. Great way to waste a half hour. And then another half hour... and then another... and.."
3874,Great update
3875,"This game would be acceptable from an indie studio but definitely not from valve.
RNG in this game genre is nothing surprising, what is surprising is that valve found a way to add more of it by creating the most idiotic combat system. Pathing, item usage, skill usage, targeting makes the game not about making builds but about hoping that your legion commander doesn't attack treants on the other side of the map for the whole goddamn round."
3876,nice and chill game
3877,"Played since early Beta testing (Big Boss - 600+hours total). Game got better overtime and is in it's best state it's ever been imo. I especially like what the have done with the Underlords, and balancing."
3878,BLA BLA BLA

3885,"𝒀𝒆𝒔, 𝒉𝒐𝒏𝒆𝒚."
3886,"Good on first release, a bit too much when Underlords initially released - but more streamlined now for both quick and longer/regular games."
3887,Fun auto battler with a lot to learn. Really enjoy it so far and expect to continue doing so.
3888,yeah its alright to pass the time while TFT is down i guess
3889,Great game!
3890,good
3891,Damn good; best auto-battler there is.  Play knock-out though :)
3892,"Pleasing aesthetic. Needs some updates to make items and builds more customizable, but a solid game."
3893,Awesome auto battler with reasonable balancing. The HUD of the game is also so much more intuitive and helpful than all other auto battlers on the market.
3894,"If you having a great day, this game will please you."
3895,"Almost all content is locked behind a pay wall, don't bother it"
3896,"this game is pure garbage. RNG and non permissive meta. after 500 hours and reaching lord of white spire, I can tell it. FUCKING GARBAGE GAME. Obviously fuckings devs don't give a damn fuck about balance or RNG issues. 

At the moment, mage / spirit and brawny are the meta. This game has no strategy, just hoping for luck on your meta and thats it."
3897,"This game is stupid fun, and by that I mean a lot!  Its the perfect game to wind down to at the end of the night, because you have to think a bit, but its not ""action packed"" to keep your heart racing.  Also, this is on mobile as well, which is super sick."
3898,not bad
3899,"Once you study the game mechanics, it becomes fun. I'm mediochre at best, but even I can improve my lot through strategy."
3900,Better than Team Fight Tactics
3901,I really tried to like this autochess variation. I put over 400 hours into playing this game. Ultimately the game just is not balanced. If you are lucky to get a Level 3 hero with one of the top tier alliances you can basically steam roll without much strategy.  Will revisit this game if they make major adjustments to the RNG and balance. Good luck everyone!!.
3902,Great game
3903,casual fun
3904,good
3905,They showed us how to ruin the balance. If your roster doesnt include knight and warlock your team is completely useless. Especially warrior class. If you focus on warriors there’s no chance to win. The game was good but with the last version it became something like put your knights and healers on the table and watch game. As a player who doesnt like to do the same thing over and over again i wont play till the balance come back.
3906,keren
3907,"Edit: This game has stopped being updated and is no longer being supported. You're better off going elsewhere.

3919,good game
3920,excellent
3921,"This is one of those games I wish steam had a neutral options. I'm ultimately giving it a not recommended vote because this game is nearly entirely RNG driven. The outcome of the game will largely depend on RNG factors and luck rather than any sort of strategy. That said, it's still a fun game to semi-afk because it doesn't require much thought or dedicated attention. I play while browsing the internet, watching netflix, or on the subway. If you can accept it for what it is, a game where RNG determines whether you mostly win or lose rather than strategy, it can be fun. I'm sure there are people who spend 100s of hours studying arcane tactics of all the different heroes and get a 5% boost in their win/loss rate, but for those of us who live in the real world this game can only be fun if you accept it as a mindless RNG game."
3922,gros jeu de thug
3923,"A fun and comfy game. Doesn't require much energy nor your full attention the whole time, but even if you choose to give it that, it doesn't get boring.

Gets a little stale at higher ranks, though."
3924,Love the quick Knockout games.
3925,Not random.  Ai is deployed to make the matches interesting.  Basically it's always balancing the rolls which makes it stupid.
3926,Nice casual game!
3927,Marginally more confusing then DOTA 2.
3928,Causes addiction
3929,In the beginning i thought that this game was a little boring until i learned how the game works. After that i started get in the first 3 places and got addicted. I recommend this game with the battle bass because the system of rewarding the player is so good!
3930,"The best chess game of all, but sadly the players is not that much."

3944,good game given valve produced it
3945,Fun for like 2 days and it gets boring very fast after u realise the game is 90% Luck and you're the unluckiest person in the entire fucking history of mankind
3946,"Do yourself a favor and avoid getting addicted to this slot machine simulator. The game is always dominated by one super OP meta that people try and force. Your success basically hinges on getting good rolls. Not item placement, not hero placement, and most certainly not creative alliance building. As long as you get your heroes for whatever this month's meta is you're good. If not, there's always next game. At the time of writing this I've wasted 421 hours of my life on this stupid ""game"". With that time I could've watched Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy 56 times. Hell, watching paint dry is more competitive than this game. Anyways, hit me up if you want to play duos."
3947,good to release your strees

3950,fun to play
3951,Fun game if you know DotA and DotA2.
3952,ada yg lebih keraas
3953,"Its becoming a great game. the only thing is that it needs more variance, more options to build your team. It can be boring if you`re playing too many matches a day. The builds are gonna be very similar if you want to win. Other than that i feel like its going to the right direction."
3954,I would like to see more heroes in this game as well as a more close up view of the herous would also like to see ziggs and meepo
3955,"I've been playing since the beginning of Dota AutoChess in the mode itself. I was super excited with the release of Underlords and to be honest early builds was not that bad and quite nice.
Still since they added Underlords the game is bad.
They change their units and faction each update which is not nice.
Doing Ranked in Duo remove points from your Duo (eehhh whyyyyyyy seriously) it's not even the same genre
But most of the time whats sad is that you don't understand WHY you lose. With other auto chess you kind of know why you lose, you kind of know how to re-do your strategy, but Underlords, you completly are in unknown.
One thing a game is suppose to do it's learn from your failure and adjust, and I'm sorry but Underlords no not help you understand your failures and grow to be better.
It's sad but that's the reason I don't recommend this game to invest time in it. Play occasionally if you want to it's good but they change their game so many time in short time each time you come in you will curse on the game.
Oh yeah I almost forgot, a lot of stuff don't add up in their game. The programmers must be junior or something because when you find exploit they are super slow to fix them."
3956,"I really enjoy the play of this game. It allows a neutral start up for every player, which gives everyone the same advantages. Then it is up to strategy and luck. Super fun and fairly intuitive in its build. It is a nice chill game."
3957,good devs
3958, .
3959,Better have watch playing..
3960,"Information overloaded, enigmatic tactics, and time constrained. 
Despite these, DOTA Underlords sports a wealth of heroes, abilities, alliances, and more; This abundance supports a gaming experience unique to each and every match. 

If deep-thinking strategy games are your thing and you're not afraid of learning, give DOTA Underlords a try. 

It is free after all!"

3983,very good game
3984,"Will try to be brief.
Game is free, no purchases affect winrate and is FAR easier to learn than Team Fight Tactics. The game is not easier, in fact the two are 99.9% the same but unlike TFT which only lets you play ranked or unranked, Underlords has lots of tools to learn including a rulebook you can consult at any time and the ability to pause when playing against bots."
3985,SO ADDICTIVE HOPE I GOT A BETTER PHONE TO PLAY THIS GAME
3986,"Munantabbbb , good game"
3987,"RECOMMENDED

If you want play dota but wanna relax 
this game answer it"
3988,I find this game very fun. I did not think that I would like it at first but then I tried it and it was satisfying when you win and teaches you hoe to do better when you lose.
3989,Wicked Game!
3990,dc
3991,"I always hate people who make reviews like this, but DOTA Underlords is just an Inferior TeamFight Tactics.

They are both very similar games, with the same premise, but TFT just has one thing that Underlords doesn't...and that's character. 

In TFT, each character has a unique style and, if you play LoL, you already have a general sense of these characters and their personalities are all present. DOTA's characters just do not have that character, and that lack of character carries over to Underlords, and the game suffers for it."
3992,"awesome game
"
3993,"If you are looking for a 1:1 Dota Autochess clone, this game is not for you. Dota Underlords is kind of a faster paced version of Auto Chess and unit pools are more limited which makes it harder to get 2* or even 3* units. The game is more strategical than Autochess because you have to adapt more to what you find in the shop and can't usually force a specific build you have in mind.

The smaller unit pools lead to more variance in builds, which is why I enjoy the game a bit more than the original Auto Chess where forcing a specific comp was much easier. The faster pace is not to everybody's liking (a normal ranked game takes roughly 20-30 minutes) but for me it's perfect.

Give it a try, it's free after all so you got nothing to lose. You can buy a battle pass for <10€ but that only adds cosmetics, so it's not pay to win."
3994,"Out of all the auto-chess knockoff games, this one is my favorite.

The one from Riot Games is too simple for me, Dota Autochess (the mod) is only played by professionals at this point so it's too hard for me.

Underlords has a good amount of players and it is rather complex as well."
3995,"This is a great game of Auto Chess, it has the traditional mode,some fast pvp and competent bots. The reward system is mostly deco for board and more sophisticated content is behindd season pass,but everything else is really solid."
3996,addictive fun
3997,Great to play with friends
3998,it's ok
3999,"It's kinda fun, if you like DOTA 2 then this is a less stressful game with the same heroes.
you can play this on your phone so.. cool"
4000,"not bad

4001,cant equip some the posters from the battle pass rewards
4002,"Terrible game, terrible balancing.  All comes down to RNG, little to no skill involved."
4003,AwesomeGame
4004,"This game is a complete bullshit, you can spend hours and hours playing it , like I did,  and get fucking nothing, just because it's completely random and every time you gain some rank, you immediately lose it. I just hate the day I dowloaded it."
4005,Good desktop experience that follows the iOS game.
4006,"The game is fun but there are POPUPS! POPUPS EVERYWHERE! Stop spamming me, Valve!"
4007,"I stopped liking the game as much when they added Underlords, but it's really picked back up. Knockout is a ton of fun!"
4008,Poorly balanced. To many heroes/items and random abilities make for a clown fiesta of multi layered (items/champions/underlords/random targeting) and constantly shifting RNG. More frustrating than fun.
4009,Totally recommending it.
4010,The game seems overwhelming at the start but once you get an understanding it becomes pretty interesting.
4011,"I play this game from Beta until today, but recently there is a bug that game close automatically after finish match or before match start.

Please fix this"

4023,"Broke my phone in frustration.

10/10 will break again."
4024,Trash
4025,As a big fan of DotA I would say that this game is a great extension to this universe!
4026,"After 450+ hours, I finally decided to write a review. First of all, I'm normally a fan of puzzle, turn-based, and tactic-based games. I found this game early into the beta, and never played anything Dota related. I have a background as a chess player, so this seemed interesting to me. 

I can say that from the beta, this game has come a long way. If you've never played an auto-battler, this is a great place to start! I find myself playing 5-6 standard rounds without even realizing that I have played that much, and Valve tends to keep the game balanced and the meta changing on a weekly schedule, making adapting to the changes and finding new builds one of the most enjoyable (and sometimes frustrating) parts of the game. It takes a little bit to learn what Underlord, items, and alliances to go for in a game, but after a few hours, you get the feel for the styles you want to play. 

City Crawl was a nice add to take a break from the online games, and knockout has been fun in the short bursts. 

Edit: There are also a handful of great YouTubers who make tutorials for different builds. I highly recommend looking into them if you're interested in the game!

Overall, for a free (if you decide not to use the battle pass) game, it's a good time killer that's rewarding once you learn the mechanics. Highly recommend!"
4027,GG
4028,"It was fun when it was in Beta, then they added stuff that messed it all up."
4029,"Too much RNG, Too little strategy.

Yeah there is some strategy here but not enough to be impactfull. I would say there is 80% luck and 20% strategy here which means even if you play your 20% perfectly you will lose to luck more times than are fun. Also you will win many games you shouldn't making wins not as rewarding.

1. Every game dynamic with the acceptance of two (interest and placement) is defined by RNG. There are cases where you can mix RNG and strategy and have a fun experience but you cannot have the RNG control the strategic decisions presented for this to be fun. Consider poker, you can't control the hand you get but you can bluff (strategy), control your bets (strategy), and then calculate your odds for a good hand (RNG). If these game devs created poker they would give you 3 different bet amounts you could choose from out of a pool, completely leaving your strategic decisions up to luck.The hero's, items, and boss abilities you get are all random.This usually means that it doesn't matter much where you place your heroes or how you manage your money if your opponent gets lucky.

2. What little strategy there is feels more like memorization than strategy. The game doesn't give enough time to make strategic decisions. If you haven't already memorized what heroes go good in your build, what item goes on what hero, and what boss ability to choose (assuming RNG gods even give you a choice on those) you certainly don't have enough time to figure it out in game. You wont be forming strategies against your opponent or laying strategic traps here, not enough time. You must memorize what you will do provided RNG is kind before you start the game.Yeah you can change your build to counter your opponent or to have a higher chance of getting your heroes but if you try to do this even close to mid game you have already lost. They also change the meta so much that this memorization is quite the chore which again can't be done during gameplay, so do your homework before you play your games kids.

3. Game balance and design issues. First of all there is only a few metas, and they change it up frequently but never balance. What may be Bloodseeker = win today could mean loss in two weeks. Some alliances are just useless until they roll out an update. They seem to have trouble balancing all of the alliances and it makes half of all the heroes useless. On top of that the game has some really bone headed design. Several times when buying an item or choosing a boss within the last 3 seconds the game will simply ignore your choice and choose for you. I am told this is intentional in case you didn't choose in time? I don't know how this is a feature anyone would want. If I chose wrong let me suffer the consequences but don't override my decision. If I really have x-3seconds amount of time to choose then just show x-3 seconds don't give me a false timer.

So why have I played it and continue to occasionally play it? Well because its a fun mindless game that doesn't require a lot of thought to win or lose. But when its pitched like some deep strategy I assume that's what they are going for and they have completely failed in that aspect. Ive heard this game described as chess with DOTA heroes, more like bingo with DOTA heroes who don't know how to focus and do the worst and uncontrollable things in combat."
4030,COOL
4031,"They took a good ""ish"" mod and made a brand new game out of it, Not only does it feel worse but there is even more RNG than in the mod!
I regret buying the battlepass and i regret ever playing this shit. I don't think anything can drag me back here.

Do yourself a favor and play the mod instead if it is still updated."
4032,The roll really sucks
4033,"Great game with many possibilities primarily based on DotA, while also being independent of DotA with its own strategies. Duelyst players may enjoy this, as it plays similar to a card game. Positioning, early game, mid game and late game strategies all play a very important role."
4034,cards be like woooooo
4035,"The game is great for a quick offside episode in your gaming life. Of course it's based on the original dota universe, so if you've played that before you should be familiar with all the heroes, their abilities and lore (if anyone cares about that). 

Just like teamfight tactics the game has been struggling with balance and heavily meta-orientated gameplay, where instead of adapting to a situation and trying to come up with ideas you end up forcing the same builds over and over again because you know, that in the long run it is a better way of climbing the ladder/winning. That makes it very repetitive, rng based and eventually boring.

On a design and mechanics level it's still a good game and a solid timekiller, but not something that you would treat with a serious approach. Will get back to it in maybe like 2028 once I get a smartphone I can run it on."
4036,"i've been on and off from this game because I enjoyed playing TFT more. But now I am just loving this game. I like how everytime you go play a game there is no one comp that people abuse which is so common in TFT. Its also really fun to do the crawl city missions even though some are really tough to beat and it gives me a great sense of challenge. I have not bought the battle pass because of the current crisis hopefully i can buy the next one. Anyway, this is a great game to try for those who are in to autochess games. Its beginner friendly while also fun for veterans. 11/10 game"
4037,Fun and addicting game.
4038,everything i wish league of legends team fight tactics had.
4039,Best thing since dota 2!!!
4040,"editing my review : I had a lot of fun with the game until valve decided to destroy it, too bad /:
I honestly can't recommend this game in its current state over TFT."
4041,"Simple to play, really hard to master. More exciting than it looks at first glance, love it !"
4042,"Game that plays itself. Finally! I only play games because I would feel bad if they weren't played. A game that plays itself allows me free time to do other things. Like mindlessly watch TV and drool into my unkempt beard.

4083,11/10 This is what sitting for an MCQ test you did not study for feels like.
4084,"Generally I play a lot of story centred games, call me a fan of walking simulators and I will not be offended. Sometimes I just want to move around a nice world and read some nice stuff. A short hike, Donut County, Dream Daddy, Dreamfall, Gone Home, Life is Strange, Thomas was Alone. That kind of stuff. 

Dota Underlords is pretty different to the above but it still succeeded where League of Legends, actual Dota, Hearthstone or Slay the Spire didn't. 

Firstly, I'm pretty bad at this game. I don't have a natural talent for memorising large swathes of trivia about intricate rule systems. I have trouble seeing the big picture and tend to get tunnel vision on a small area of information, which in a game where you want to be comprehending the overall strength of your team and how your team's character's abilities support and enhance each other, that's kind of a problem. ALSO I'm bad at evaluating a large swathe of options relative to the other competitor's teams and the existing construction of my team. 

So if I'm so poorly suited to playing this then why do I enjoy it?
1. The battles play out automatically and all I do is construct the team and then watch them do their thing with some consideration to character positioning on the board also playing a part. This creates breaks and makes it less taxing than say a Dota or an overwatch.

2. I do visual stuff as my day job and the way the synergies are organised by colour is a major help to the way I process information, it's easier for me to run my eyes across my team synergies and immediately see ""Oh..I'm building too many synergies and if I cut this character I can focus into a team that has clarity of style."" (I'm really bad at just...remembering all this stuff so being able to re-check what the current state of my team is is necessary to my poor brain.)

3. The four round knockout mode of gameplay is what I needed to get myself over the initial hump of needing to be familiar with the different synergies, characters and abilities enough that I can look at a battle play out and have some kind of sense of the forces at play within what was previously just a frenetic unintelligible mess of fighting characters. Four round knock out lets me try different variations on the same tune and see the effects of making small tweaks that going through a full length game doesn't allow so easily.

So I guess those are the main things. OH I also love that I can play with a friend and the way they make that teamwork a real part of the experience. So I can send my friend gold which is neat but what is really neat is that when I open the shop between rounds and the characters for sale renew, it shows me what characters I am already building but ALSO now it shows me in a second bar what characters my friend is building. So if things aren't going so great for me I can still feel kind of useful because I can send them a character that completes a set and allows theirs to level up to a 2 star or a 3 star. This is GREAT, I can support my friend and make their game go better which is just RAD. 

Anyway, this is the most I've stuck with a game of this kind so it's doing something a little different, whether that makes it enjoyable to me personally but like...not actually a good version of the multiplayer/competitive thing it is seemingly aimed at being is difficult to tell though.

ridiculous knights only lvl3
This game is completely umbalanced
Better try LOL TFT"
4090,best
4091,"During beta, the pace of the game was relatively slow, and some builds were not viable. Now with the current state of the game, with interest capped at 30 gold and having a faster,  more reliable strategy, it makes the game a lot of fun, but also tactical for the thinking gamers out there. 10/10 would recommend."

4110,"69 hours in, fun game"
4111,This game is fun and beautiful.  It is also free to play!!!  Awesome and really love it!
4112,"Game was at it best before it was released.   First they remove alot of units in the game for each season(everyone knows a game is easier too balance if a game is remaked every season(not)  Think starcraft 2 with 15 added and removed units each season + a new race, nice huh ?

Then they ruin the hero selection, now you are stuck with a random hero which might not suit the build your going for, the game is badly balanced, some races are completely ruined, some lategame units are useless and now they even messed up the game more last patch."
4113,"They have no clue how too patch the game in a way so it makes sense. 
Every patch destroys the game more and more. 

The random overlords make actually getting your build to work RNG.
Removing heroes from the pool each season makes diversity go down.
Less amount of each hero in pool. (Well this was just dumb.)
Instead of balancing a team that is overpowered they seem to like to add a hard counter, witch just changes the game play to complete utter random bullshit.

Stop with the game breaking patches and rather tweak the game as it is.

I loved the game for a long time. But now it just pisses me of and i have no fun playing it anymore."
4114,great fun game
4115,"Pretty solid autobattler. Pretty, city crawl is fun, being able to move items around is nice. I like Knockout for shorter games with less brainwork involved."
4116,"knockout is fun, usually I feel autochess games are too long and slow. knockout games are <10 minutes and have minimal downtime"
4117,Not bad
4118,original auto chess was superior
4119,its hard
4120,"Really nice strategy behind this little game, no previous knowledge in DOTA is needed to understand the game in a couple of hours. 
Awesome for chill gaming and multitasking while gaming.
This game is about builds, resources(just the one), tactics and strategy.

4121,so good
4122,Nice relaxing game to play can easily multi task different things while playing
4123,Actually very good.

The gameplay is Ok"
4129,i just want a badge.
4130,"Not terribly complex and pretty luck based, but all in all a fun game to play around on and try and go for the challenges in the battle pass"
4131,"I want to recommend this game, I really really do.  I'm having fun with it.  However, this is why I do not recommend this game yet.  The devs need to give it a lot of TLC.  The A.I. in this game is DUMB!  Nothing like watching your characters freeze in the corner or your summons standing still not aggroing anything.  I've also watched my tied hunter circle the entire map instead of just taking a direct path to an enemy, makes 0 sense.  Finally, the crashes and disconnect on P.C. is unacceptable for a fully released games.  I would expect this for early access but not a game that wants you to buy a season pass.  With all honesty, this game has a lot of potential if they could just work out these bugs.  I would recommend Teamfight tactics over this game however I refuse to support Tencent."

4133,"Frankly speaking I have played this game quite enough and was never disappointed in its RNG factor until it became ridiculously obvious how bad it influences the whole game. First it seemed to be logical and quite predictable, then with tons of hours spent on it I discovered how unplayable it is because of its disgusting hero pool algorithm and how ""random"" it is. I used really really love it, but now I can't even look at it not to mention playing."
4134,"good game, but on mobile sucks"
4135,"White Spire is up for grabs. The leader has died from natural causes (a knife in the back) and now 4 contestants rise to the challenge by recruiting monsters from DOTA2 and sending them out against each other.

This game started as a minigame as part of DOTA2 called Autochess, but was spun out as a standalone game and good thing too. It doesn't have much to do with chess, the mechanisms are more similar to Yahtzee. You roll a selection of thugs, pick a few, then roll again and hope that the monsters that you roll has synergy with your already existing army.

Sound: 4/10. Nothing special.

Graphics: 5/10. Functional. Not great.

Story: 0/10. The less said the better.

Fun: 8/10. It really is good fun. On release they made the good decision of making a faster version of the game, called 'Knockout'. This makes for a very quick casual game if you have some minutes to use up. It still also allows the longer  (45 minutes-ish) games.

This game is good for people who want to play a quick casual fantasy style boardgame. Tryhards may find the amount of RNG overwhelming, as at the end of the day the RNG triumphs over the tactics. Sure, a stronger player will win more often than a weaker player, but if you're going to get frustrated over bad luck, you may be in for a bad time.

I have enjoyed this game a lot. This is my go-to for a quick game."
4136,balance game
4137,ถ้าผมไม่เล่นนานมันจะเจ๋งหรอ
4138,"The devs have been drip-feeding content into underlords for some time now, resulting in a meta that was getting some small changes but not enough to warrant big interest.

However, now there is life back in the game with this season 1.5 update, I hope underlords continues to have strong content updates as it's worming it's way back into my games list. 

edit: I have changed this review from negative to positive mainly in hopes that positive feedback will encourage more updates in the future(!).

P.S. Spectre might need a hotfix as this hero is bonkers"

4142,"Very nice, but very load intensive for laptops."
4143,"It gives a dota/LoL feel while away from those games. It is almost like a chess match. While at first it is daunting to learn how to play, you get it after a while."
4144,good addicting game
4145,ye iz gud
4146,"The coop is not actual coop. You just play separate single-player games, and then share health.

Also the game is super buggy, and takes forever to find a match.  TFT was better."
4147,"The game still lacks a lot of aspects considering its a multiplayer game, and the developers are slacking too much about it. Players are leaving, and the game is dying. I won't recommend a game that will not last very long."
4148,great game!
4149,Fun despite being hard to master.
4150,I like it.
4151,"Simple to play, hard to master, a very good auto chess with great characters and a nice single player mode"
4152,"as repetitive as it can be, it's still fun, shame on the need to pay for good stuff, but it's just custom skins more than anything else."
4153,Underlords are an unwelcome addition to the formula that adds nothing but clutter and confusion.
4154,GG
4155,best one of its kind
4156,good
4157,It was some fun game beside Dota 2 actually tbh
4158,"Welcome to a draft. That's essentially what Dota Underlords is and for those of you who have never played a draft before you are in luck. Underlords does a great job of taking a whole lot of random and building a lot of strategy into it. Your job is to know a little bit about the elements before going in, or it may be too chaotic for you. There are constantly evolving and changing mechanics and strategies that differ greatly between the Knockout and standard modes (don't get me started on Dual mode). It's fun and fresh but like any good strategy game takes time, the difference here is as you win/lose you also unlock items on the city crawl.

Give it a shot because hell, it's free."
4159,good to learn skill n item
4160,"Great strategy game, if you are a fan of DOTA this is a must play."

4177,1 APM Dota
4178,"Recommended, although many are complaining about RNG, I feel that the heroes are quite balanced and the Alliance combinations are really fun to explore. Each of the alliance can be used perfectly and therefore I do not think RNG are all that matters, your understanding to combine different heroes are the one that is important. For new players I recommend starting in standard mode as that mode is not as punishing as in knockout mode."

4187,"Going from Drodo Autochess to this was a bit of a shift given the different mechanics, but I find Dota Underlords a bit more involving but also easier to interpret, and the stable releases make it a bit more accessible.

The PVE campaign and objectives are also great; they give you something else to do in the game if you want to play but dont want to invest half an hour, while also teaching you various combos and mechanics."

4217,"Very fun game. Every match you play is different, but it is very RNG heavy which is why. So sometimes you will get really bad luck and not be able to build a strong team, but you might still be able to out build everyone else and pull off a good round. When you do get rolling it's great. I'd sway 8/10 overall"
4218,Nice Game.
4219,Auto Chess
4220,"It's a lot of fun and the ultimate time killer especially since you have access to it on PC and mobile. My biggest complaint, along with most people, is that it is more luck than skill based."

4222,yes
4223,It is fun but they said that it is like chess. It is nothing like chess.

"
4240,"Much better than before, so they seem to be ironing out issues as they go. Decent single player experience, and faster game mode (knockout). It's essentially free too. You don't *need* to have played DOTA I guess, but i'm sure it helps."
4241,Can be played in window'ed mode while watching something else on the other half of the screen.
4242,"after playing 175 hours, i should say the beta version was better than this version
so many times you cant pick your idea and you couldnt go with your plan
but heroes like bloodseekr are not balance
The biggest problem with the game is that once you play with a category, the game will force you to use the same category in your next games.
And I have to say I think the game needs a big update
The absence of the following heroes in the game is strongly felt
sniper
thinker
clockwerk"

4249,"is it fun? yes, its casual and relaxing. lots of play style and build to play in a match, BUT, is it competitive? HELL NO, pure RNG luck based game. whoever have the core unit with 3 star first wins the game easily, plus this game is really META based especially in a ranked match"
4250,its shit
4251,Good game
4252,"If you want to get back to Underlords, the time is now!

The game has recovered after a series of weird turns. It is now back to being fun, by having implemented knockout mode and reducing the complexity and impact of overlords.

Starting with the Dota Auto Chess mod and switching to Underlords, then Drodo  Mobile Auto Chess, then TFT, then Chess Rush ... I am now back to Underlords and I am surprised to see, that it has become a more complete and more balanced game, with a better level of complexity, improved cosmetics and a a solid solo campaign with rewards.

Overall I should have approximately 2000 or more hours of Autobattler game experience. 900 in Underlords alone, as the time of writing. 

If you want to get back to overlords, because other games have increased their complexity, added useless modes to thin out the player base per mode, or have added weird mechanics like the jail mechanic or similar, then the time is now. The development of the game has taken a good turn, eventually. It feels fresh and effortless to plan your turns and upgrade heroes, to develop strategies and alliance compositions.

Performance-wise, the game is terrible for average mobile devices, but it is a visual gem for desktop devices and it has a nicely designed User Interface and fluid animations.

As a developer myself, I know that creating such a game can be a challenge, not only for the developers, but also for people implementing proper user tests and making design and gameplay decisions. At the beginning I had the feeling the development team did only test themselves and had few user tests, with random users, but this may have changed now. Of course, testing inside a development team is basically useless to harmful, since there is massive bias and it doesn't necessarily reflect the target groups behaviour and opinions.

Let's just assume that the process has been improved and that all the wild experiments will be replaced by solid and tested decisions from now on, so that we can now get back to Underlords and enjoy the game, which is now better than ever before."

4261,It's okay but I just can't recommend it at this stage. There's very little diversity in the kind of builds that are competitive and just feels very repetitive. With some more alliances it could be pretty fun.

Being one of the first players back in 2019, I have a love/hate relationship with this game. DOTA is a fun strategy game, the characters are cute, and the game is evolving well. The nerfing of certain classes has been corrected, and new characters have been added. But as others have posted: the RNG can go badly against you round after round, and this makes DOTA Underlords less strategic and more tactical. The problem there however, is that you cannot give commands to your crew (which is what tactics is). What the game needs is basic orders we can set before a battle begins, like: ""kill enemy with most HP or most mana"" or ""always heal tank"" and so on. Otherwise, I'd say that Valve is doing a very good job. They are growing the game, and that makes me want to support them."
4280,might look stupid in the beginning but then you'll get really hooked.
4281,nice

4343,Very refined auto-chess game.  Developers listen and are a part of the community.  Spent hundreds of hours playing before I even had an option to send them money.  Give it a shot.

4362,I played a ton of Auto Chess. This game improves the interface and gives it its own space to be a full fledged developed game. I very much enjoyed playing it and would suggest it to anyone who likes strategy games.

what a suprise another valve shit ass game 
and it has a battle pass what a suprise again,it used to be free...used to"
4367,"Its very fun when you are learning the game, abd figuring stuff out. But once you get the hang on it and kinda gain some skill it will turn a bit stale. If you know all the basics and you play a few more rounds it will start to become very very repetitive. 
But i must say it is very satisfying when you get a Legendary hero to 2 or 3 before the final boss of that round. 
It is a animated card game with heroes instead of cards, just that there are very few diversity. It will not give you any adrenalin or exitement, if that is what you are looking for i would recommend Doom Eternal or Subnautica."
4368,"Almost 4 years since i first played Special Edition on PS4 and this is still one of the most enjoyable, immersive and re-playable games i've played with only 1 game (The Witcher 3) coming close to the feeling i get playing this.
If you're looking to play a game in this whole lock down situation going on, i highly recommend Skyrim."

4377,Excellent game with different game modes. Good to play with friends as it strikes a good balance between casual and competitive. I like that the devs are quite active and the game is well balanced.
4378,what a game !!
4379,"A few of the skills and abilities of the Characters don't stack of proc how you'd think they would. Which frustrates me trying new combinations. 

For instance two Drow rangers next to eachother don't have a synergystic attack speed buff stacking effect.

The Poison item doesn't proc per weapon bounce of Luna's moon glaive. This includes lifesteal and other procing effects.

The Arc warden clones don't actually clone items on the Arc warden. The attack damage is also not reflective of the copied Arc warden. For instance, if the Arc warden has +20 attack from team buffs or items, that damage isn't carried over on to the copies.

It's a free game, but the progression doesn't feel like I've made any sort of gain. The Undercity feature is cool, but part of it is also blocked by a paywall. It's a bit frustrating when the game mechanics aren't true to the description of the Characters or items.

I've looked through the patch notes on some of these characters, I definitely see effort being made. So I will give some props to the development team. However, the game itself is too barebones for me.

If I had 40 hours a day to learn what is best vs what I may fair better. Oh wait.... Only 24 hours in a day. I also have tried using the tier guides and building the S tiers and still lose constantly.

4417,Love this game!! A very different type of game mode which keeps me entertained for hours
4418,"Of the auto-chess type games, I've found that Underlords is the most accessible and easily-parse-able. The Auto-chess genre is basically just metagaming. It's about knowing characters and comps and peeking at your opponents and trying to counter their picks, which for people who are not familar with the characters or their abilities is pretty overwhelming. Underlords has an actual tutorial, which is incredibly helpful for anyone just getting into auto chess games, and their UI and UX are ultimately far more readable and inherently understandable, in my opinion. I'm not great at these types of games, but after a dozen or so matches I started being able to come up with decent team compositions and began to understand the characters and the basics and ended up having a pretty good time! If you wanna see what auto chess is all about, this is a great place to start, and I also generally prefer their characters and stylization over that of TFT. 
I don't play DOTA  or League, though, so YMMV"

4429,"A little history with this game. Originally a mod to DoTA 2, the people who made the mod ended up branching off and making their own version of the game called Autochess and changed all the names. Valve then creates Underlords as the ""official"" successor to the mod. This is basically the same story as the original warcraft mod DoTA went and made league of legends, then came out with the ""official successor"" to the mod with DoTA 2.

Anyway history lesson aside, Underlords is a strategy game where the units battle automatically and its up to the player to manage their economy and what combination of units to purchase and where to position them. The game is played as a series of rotating 1v1's where everyone faces everyone eventually and the player left as the last man standing taking the win. The games are relatively short, usually taking about 40mins per game. 

I honestly love this genre of games so much, pretty much became an instant fave and i dont think you could go wrong with any of them. However thats not the point of a review. Im here to tell you this is the game i reccomend over the others in the market. 

While the game i think is functionally the best is the new standalone autochess, it just simply doesnt have the playerbase to keep it rewarding enough for me, the community is super small and doesnt leave you with much interaction. I really also want a version that i can play on PC, so that pretty much just leaves this one and TFT by riot games. I personally think this game slaps, no contest, and the only reason people like TFT is because of the Intellectual property of LoL. Underlords is less RNG, More intuitive and most importantly feels the most natural, not like its just trying to desperately cram its assests into the autochess mould.

TLdr: Dota underlords is a fun game that does a decent job of following the original mod. id give it a 7/10 as the best choice when accounting for popularity."

4466,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review, because at 217 hours of game-play at the time of writing, I have invested a lot of my time into this game. I've played since the first publicly available build, so feel I have enough experience to critique this and its development as time has gone on. And for anyone wondering I capped out at Lieutenant IV, hardly a rank to sniff at.

I enjoy this game, I really do, when the game goes right it hits that sweet spot so well and you come away with a shiny new rank knowing you were the best of the best in that game.

Except were you the best?

For a genre called auto-chess it's awfully strange that this game relies so heavily on RNG. And when I say relies heavily I mean revolves entirely around RNG. Chess is a game of pure strategy, there's no luck involved, how you move your pieces relies entirely on your knowledge and ability as a player. That's why thousands of years after the game was invented, it is still played today, it's why there are Grandmasters, and tournaments and why it has endured for so long as the favourite game of generals.

Underlords has 'elements' of strategy, with your line-up you can strategise what's best going to help you, what item is best for who, how your formation might fare up against another opponents. But what you can't do is control when or if a hero is going to be available to you at all, when or if a certain item is going to make its way over to you, and whether that all important lynchpin of your design is ever going to get upgraded.

So in one game you might get to upgrade your pieces time and time again leading you to a stunning steamroll and a first place snag. In the next game you find nary a piece and trundle along with rank 1's and 2's until you're booted out in last place wondering how the fates could be so cruel and how on Earth it was fair that NOTHING was coming up for you.

My latest example was a game of knockout. My first opponent had lucked out by upgrading his NP and Magnus on the first turn, meaning on the FIRST round I was up against a Rank 3 Magnus with 400 cleave damage that wiped out my entire force in a couple of hits. For me? No upgrades whatsoever. It was pure luck that he ended up with such a powerful early game, and pure bad luck that I had nothing. So what happened? I crapped out in last place. This past week I endured a 12 loss streak, scoring no higher than 5th place and averaging 6th place, dropping FOUR ranks all the way back to square one and undoing the painstaking progress I had made earlier on. This happened through a combination of terrible starting alliances available to me, zero meaningful upgrades, and dumb luck from my opponents. There was just absolutely nothing I could do.

And that's the issue with Underlords. You will shout at your screen all too often 'What was I supposed to do?' And the answer is there was nothing you could do, because the Mirana you were desperate to find to complete your Hunter and Vigilant alliance didn't come up even once after spending 50 gold searching. Your Earth Spirit wouldn't stop wandering off to die immediately meaning your Delta Slam could never pass. The Legion Commander you built all your alliances around supporting couldn't gain any duel damage because at round 7 she was still rank 1 and no upgrades had come your way. The enemy Terrorblade tearing away at your forces who was one hit away from death managed to wipe you out because your Lycan inexplicably stopped attacking him and ran to the other side of the board to swat at a Weaver.

The game will just as soon catapult you to the top as it will cut off your balls and throw you in the gutter. You are totally at the mercy of dice rolls, and until Valve figures out a way to give players a stronger grip and hands-on approach to the game and its outcomes, Underlords will steadily fizzle out of existence.

I really enjoyed this game and its potential, I'm probably going to keep playing it and pray to RNGesus that I'll be lucky enough to at least get to Boss rank, but it won't be my skill or ability that gets me there, it'll be my good fortune, and my opponents bad fortune.

Also fix the fucking lighting on the character portraits God damn, look at Hobgens wings why are the lighting and shadows so messed up? And why are you sometimes using HD models like Bristleback, and then these super low poly models like Abaddon and Razor?"
4467,Great fun
4468,"Underlords if a fun auto-chess style strategy game, where to goal is to put the best combination of pieces on the board to fight against your opponents. There is an element of randomness in the game in regard to which units or pieces, if you will, that are made available to you between each round, to strengthen your roster. Which may force you to change strategy during the game. This combined with items you can use to strengthen certain abilities for your pieces makes up the core game. 

There are multiple modes of playing versus other players or AI bots, and both paths allow you to advance in level. The bots are reasonable opponents until you get the hang of the game, but when your skill increases, you will need to look for challenges against human opponents. 
In the game there is a nice campaign that sets up different challenges that slowly teaches you the different strategies and aspects of the game. By setting up obstructions for the player, you are challenged to discover strategies that can defeat your enemies given the circumstances. The knowledge gained, can be used outside campaigns to counter your opponents builds. 

I recommend this game due to all the above reasons and because, the game is fun and free to play. That being said, Underlords is a competitive game with rapidly changing metas and regular patching to balance the game. Some players may not like these aspects of the game, where others thrive in a changing meta, forcing them to adapt their strategies to the new changes. 

If you are looking for something that is easy to pick up, entertaining and hard to master, I recommend giving this title a go. 
"
4469,joia!
4470,"fun, and quick enough to play a couple matches of knockout in 30 minutes. no need to quick twitch muscle movement with this game, just simple strategy (until you get into ranked standard then the strategy becomes a bit less simple, still fun)"
4471,fuck
4472,I like it.
4473,"Fun and well polished auto chess. After a couple dozen games it seems pretty well balanced and City Crawl is an awesome single player addition. I love having objectives to go after, really gives the game an extra layer."
4474,good game
4475,"Best Autochess format: clean, fun, fair, and largely stays true to the original Dota 2 Autochess.

Edit: Regardless of how fun it is, the ridiculously long update cycles have me switched over to TFT. The game may be more hectic and cluttered, but at least Riot Games updates their damn game regularly."
4476,good game
4477,"I rarely go through and edit my reviews, but this game has gone from a fun little diversion with a little bit of strategy to a time-sucking chance fest. With each update, Valve have gone through and sucked a little bit more of any sort of strategic decision making out of the game in favor of gambling for big numbers. 

Went from a game worth playing when you're bored to an avoid. You might as well just go play War, it's about the same level of strategy but at least playing card makers don't try and nickle and dime you to death to boot."

4499,"Excellent auto battler! The UI is very polished and the DEV team is active, implementing feedback often. It would do better with more alliances and more variety, but that's just a nitpick. There is at least 300hrs of content in the game, if you buy the season pass."
4500,"It's free, so you can try it for yourself. I'm not saying I'll never play it again, it can be kinda fun at times, but it's just way too dependent on RNG, to a point where there really isn't much strategy to be found.

Team Fight Tactics is better, and also free... the decision of whether to save up money to increase match earnings or spend early to go after early wins, the carousel rounds that allow you to go after specific champions, the ability to combine items to build specific higher tier items... These mechanics from TFT allow you to make decisions that really feel like they impact the outcome of the game. NONE of these strategic decisions exist in this game, the only decision you are really faced with is ""do I buy one of these champs, or do I buy a re-roll?"".

To be fair, there are a few other things that pop up. Between early and mid game you get to choose one of the four Underlords to place on the board, which is a powerful unit, but with only 4 to choose from it is hardly much of a choice, you pick whichever happens to synergize with your comp, you're going to know which one you're picking well before you get to that point. It's less of a strategic decision and more just... a thing that happens.

Also, occasionally, you'll get to pick one of a choice of three equippable items. Each champ has one equip slot, and the items can be powerful. This is the closest the game comes to real strategy, where you'll find choices that aren't obviously right or wrong... but again, it will usually boil down to apples to apples differences, or a clearly superior item, and you just have to decide who to put it on (highest lvl champ that can make use of it, not really much thought involved).

It's not terrible, it just plays itself a bit too much for me to feel like I'm good or bad at it, more lucky or unlucky.

If you like slot machines, you will probably like this game."

4519,"Avoid this game at all cost. Abandoned by Valve just like Artifact except they gave even less fucks about this game, it didn't even get announced anywhere officially and flopped harder. From 200k players to <5k in less than six months. Updates went from weekly with new features, heroes, etc, and now we get 1 bullet point every two months about how they nerfed someone's attack speed by .05 or they changed the color of an ability. Every update that IS sizeable makes a drastic change that no one asks for (example: 3-star units get new abilities) and no one bothers to learn. Attempting to keep up with the meta in this game was a nightmare.

The BETA season was great. All the units were fun and most of them were ported directly from the DAC-mod and a few extras from the DoTA IP. Fun cosmetics, etc, but at the end of a season they removed the cosmetics from the battle pass that was $5 that I spent months earning and removed a lot of the alliances and heroes. I remember some alliances couldn't even be finished b/c of how many they removed. They were just removed from the game no explanation and Underlords were added. None of them are from the DoTA universe, just random stand-ins that command them, and that mechanic ruined the game. Unlike couriers in DAC where they don't effect combat and can just run around and pick up candies, here you have to choose between one of the four units every game and they have 2 different ability sets. This RNG just fucking sucks and its all based around a shit mechanic that shouldn't be in the game. Not to mention COUNTLESS bugs and glitches.

Valve has officially moved in the direction of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard: they're done making quality games. Won't trust a single release from them after this. They did a kill-your-game-like-Artifact speed run with this, showing they haven't and won't learn if they're still making $$$."

The thing is, I almost want to brag about ""Balance is a come with great cost.."", something something about the people likes to gambling, RNG,... and true, it can be fun 'sometime'.
But actually, when I come back to Dodoro's Autochess, I just went ""what the hell with this specific strategy that you just can't doing anything about it"".
And yes, people actually obsessed with those RNGs things, and still always complain about that.

Think about that, you guys doing a very good job indeed. 
It will be hard to balance everything, but still, I hope you guys can continue to add more elemental to the game, to expand the strategy can be done and varieties each game.

Thanks for the hard work."

Though it may not have the depth of strategy that it's competitors (DAC, TFT) have, it makes up for it with a a neat user interface that simplifies the experience for people that may be new to auto battlers. I've pumped around about 400 hours into this at this point and while the meta has kinda stagnated, there is an update coming soon that will refresh the pool of heroes and add new items. Definitely pick up Underlords if you're into the auto-battler genre."
4539,fun
4540,"Here's what I like:
+ Actually playing the game.
+ It's chill. Don't have to sweat.
+ Duos
+ Gives you that tingly feeling that you get when you gamble.
+ It's free. (Battlepass model)

What I don't like:
- Some of the items could be better or more fun to use. I guess that's all part of the game.
- Hunters (Lol they are cool, just op right now. I'm just being salty)

Meh:
-/+ I kind of don't like the underlords. They lack aesthetic and character. (Jull? Like Juul? Seriously? He looks like an awful Tusk ripoff) It should of just been dota heroes.
-/+ Unable to communicate to other players beyond emoji and sprays.

Like most auto-battlers, it's heavily RNG-based."
4541,Awesome game!
4542,Game has gone way above it's previous state and I commend valve for supporting this game. Expecting more to come or maybe add some tournaments comparable to TI
4543,very good and very strategic game
4544,"As a Dota player , i love it. Looking forward to play more."
4545,Legit the games isnt fair like if you even bother to try then you die instantly because of the units being hacked
4546,crashes all the time ios and osx
4547,"I really enjoyed Underlords and the original Dota 2 mod for this. Overall I think they've done a good job with the game and balancing. The issue I had is that they were making so many changes, that I couldn't really keep up and stopped playing for a while. 

Now that it's gotten into it's official release, I think they're in a good spot. 

There's still some minor things I'd like to see (e.g. if two players are knocked out on the same round, have them battle again to see who gets what place, rather than it being essentially random based on timing who was knocked out seconds before the other.) 

I don't play this as much anymore, but it's still a game I'll pick up from time to time and enjoy."
4548,"I DO NOT LIKE:
- no 4v4 - this mode could revolutionize this already revolutionary genre. you already implemented 2v2.. JUST DO IT.
-  communikation with others is much better but still improvable. maybe a temporary chat or something..
 I LOVE:
- the deep strategical process of demolishing your enemys
- dynamically building your team, which could result in either brutal, hilarious or useless constellations.
- turn-based games in general, but this one is turn-based amplified in terms of decision making
- watching cute 1* units grow into 3* deathmachines
- the currently 4 avaliable underlords are very well designed and all of them have fleshed out personalities and character.
I LIKE:
-the newly implemented campaign, character skins and customizable board"

4550,"It is OK, but I cannot get into the game as much as I did with original Dota2 AutoChess. It feels convoluted, and less streamlined. Somehow, it lost some of its original charm of what made AutoChess fun. However, it is well-polished game that people should try out."

4563,"Great game. 

Discovering how the different heroes and alliances work and how to optimise your team is a lot of fun.
It's very well balanced and games modes have just the right length.
The f2p model is done exactly right, with cosmetics at a low price point, aimed at getting lots of players and sales. I really hope they do well and can keep this game going and updated for many years to come.

It's free so just give it a try!"

4599,"Very balanced, this is what I can say about this game. It does not compare with TFT or other games like this. Definetely worth to give it a try. :D"
4600,love it
4601,"After almost 750 hours of playing this game, I can confidently say that you shouldn't waste your time with this game. From the very beginning, they have been dipping their toes into an unprocessed genre of gaming, and during the early stages of development, their wild swinging changes were actually very fun and exciting to see. During early access, it was very bare bones, but they had a battle pass in place and when version 1.0 released, it left me with much to be desired. I'm upset I paid for the battle pass, and the fact that they hide content behind a pay wall (parts of the city to explore) is just gross AF. I know it's for nothing more than cosmetic garbage anyway, but still the playable content you get from the battle pass is very whatever.

 I hope that games on a free to play structure all suffocate and die out, and this game is no exception. Before when it was in beta, I again will praise their attempts at trying something new, but how they made it fit into a free to play format like every other free game on steam makes me yawn and contemplate how all the work they did was for nothing. 

Gameplay? It's pretty unique, and as long as you don't pay anything for it, it will scratch that itch you might have for some strategic gameplay. At the end of the day however, learning all the combos and what's weak to what and what all the units do and the randomness of how it all plays out is really annoying. I was hoping for the ability to micro manage units during the battle, making the game more strategy focused and less of a random encounter that you just hope lands in your favor.  Some might defend this point and just say I'm total trash, but I'll remind those players about the beta phase before the games were head to head battles, where even though you won on your screen, you lost the battle on your opponent's end. Same fighters, same configuration, and yet the game would just fall into absolute chaos moments after starting. While it was nice to see head to head where both fights played out the same, the real issue was the randomness of the battles. 

While rank doesn't seem to matter either, you will pull your hair out when you play 8 games to climb up 1 level, and then lose 2 levels after losing 3-4 games due to randomness slapping you into 8th place every game. Too many times have I been watching my rank slowly go up just to quickly get blasted back down, and a 2-5 hour game session means nothing when you don't see any progress. Terribly disheartening, and winning new crap to place on my map doesn't make up enough for it. 

The only saving grace of this game is the duo platform. while still frustrating, it gives you the opportunity to play with friends, and have someone else to suffer along with.

Added update: they have updated this game as much as I've updated my health insurance. We're both slowly dying, and there is no good outcome in sight."
4602,is pretty good.
4603,Very fun and good game.
4604,"It's autochess, but I love the differences in co-op."

4616,Not bad.
4617,Can't P2W. Totally free game.
4618,good game
4619,A very addicting game that is fairly simple to learn but hard to master. Sometimes it has balancing issues but can expect devs to patch in fixes regularly in response to community feedback. Hoping for even more mods and heroes in the future!
4620,good
4621,The combo possibilities is very fun! so many tactics we can try
4622,very recommended game
4623,"Mega pointless stupid game developed by very stupid people with very stupid algoritms.
No way u can get units that u want or need:
I play only the one knigts, no abbadon entire game no one plays knights in looby with me WHERE ABBOADON HELLO???

I do not tell about tire 3 units WTFFFFF???? NO WAY U CAN GET IT  without rolling but the rolling is not the 100% chance to get units LOL, U start rolling a little or more and u now level 6 with tire one units all table and other people level 8 no one ROLL NO ANY ONE ROLL gets all table tire 2 units, AND in some games some one HAVE TIRE 3 UNIT WTF?????? is this normal stupid developers delete and no install no WAY EVER."
4624,"So I found I'll have a look at Underlords today. Maybe something to teach my son?  Well, something's happening on the screen and I don't appear to have much ways to influence anything. Wins and losses seem to come totally random. 
Graphically very nice looking though. But the battles happen so quick it's over before I understand what's even happening. Luckily it says at the end of each round ""you won"" or ""you lost"" - because without that I wouldn't even know the outcome.
The game hower seems to be quite complex with a huge choice of heros, artifacts, weapons etc... And then also it is possible to position each hero on the checkboard to get some tactical advantage (I assume? But during fight it doesnt seem to make an obvious difference). Then also it is possible to use spells or something similar during the battles - again without any obvious difference to just sit and watchin' the colorful mess on the screen.
Can I recommend? Sure! Lots to discover and to  learn."
4625,Ded gam
4626,dota auto chess was better
4627,"Fast, entertaining. I would recommend it."
4628,"After the initial hype for autochess games died down, dota underlords still survives at a low player count in an interesting niche. 
The standard game is alright, good to play a match with a mug of coffee in one hand. 
The duo mode is excellent. If you and a mate want to play a game together and don't have the time to get gud, this game is perfect. It involves a lot of communication and doesn't need a lot of skill to learn. It is mainly thinking and luck.
"
4629,"As the name says, I'm pretty Shite at DOTA.
Couldnt stand the orginal game. this is great fun and i dont need ot pay too much attention.

4635,What a waste of time.
4636,"Really nice game if you liked Dota and autochess. I hope the game will become more balanced with time.
"
4637,"I thought MOBAs were a chore and a downgrade from RTSes, trading in epic battles and strategy for split second precision and adherence to established metagame builds. Then I tried this and wow turns out strategy-inspired games can get even more dull. The general premise is neat but it doesn't grip me, so even all the continious metagame switchups just make me go ""meh"".

I'm amazed by how Dota franchise manages to get a game or game mode in every single flavour of the season subgenre that I end up hating."
4638,"Auto battler, pick the correct pieces to win. Quick and fun."
4639,(Y)
4640,"I realy like the game and had a lot of fun playing it. Especialy the coop mode that no other auto chess offers. However valve just abandoned the project for no reaseon without an update explanation whatsoever. The last update is from november 19 2020.

4651,let the game play itself
4652,"
gamble game!"
4653,"This game is not very fun. To get good you basically need to be a human calculator. Maybe some people like that IDK. After 40ish games (not winning a single one) I've determined that again unless you are a calculator, there are not enough basic heros available. if you want to try a build, you likely wont be able to because someone is hoarding one of your heros. The quick mode sucks too. None of the suspense of full game, and it's missing way too many features. LOL at the campaign. Overall DotA Chess was much better than this."
4654,"The entry point for this game is well bridged with the tutorial and ""rulebook"". Anyone who has played DOTA or DOTA2 will recognize the heroes, their abilities, and the items. The chat is preset so this cuts down on the unnecessary toxic nature of the community that you often find in these types of games. The objectives, puzzles, and NPC/AI fights are great for practice and casual play. The Battle Pass is reasonably priced, however there doesn't seem to be much documentation about it. Overall for what it is this is a great game to play."
4655,simple fun

4668,a strategy game that is fast paced
4669,cmonBruh we coo?
4670,"Fun game absurdly great at wasting time trying to come up with counter builds and even just basic viable ones with seemingly endless possibilities definitely does have a learning curve due to the amount of heroes. Some of the choices not working as well as I would think some would is a bit frustrating at times even seemingly obvious ones that just don't work well together, but that's a tale for an extremely long post that im not getting into currently but still is a great game that plays well is worth a look if you have some extra time to waste and aren't sure how to waste it if that's what your looking for look no further as this fits that need amazingly well~! Check it out!"

4679,"Best version of Dota Autochess that i have tried.  Plays really fluid and looks great.  If you like hats, this game may seem like a perfect fit; however not truly offer what hats in a way you really are after such as the heroes, spells, and characters carrying the extra items they are given."
4680,"At first I hated the introduction of the Underlords. The game was very stable at that point and all of a sudden it was a completely different game. I still don't love the UI/UX, but it is getting better. On the other hand, the game become so dynamic with endless combinations and possibilities. You can't pinpoint just one single ""metabuild"" anymore, like the Knights used to be."
4681,"Maybe it's just me, but it's great to kill time in style!"
4682,stuff
4683,"RNG is rampant in this game. The odds will stack against you regardless of how efficient you play. That being said, find the 1-2 meta builds that exist in each patch and ride them out. Statistics will play out and you will average more wins than not. Hope to see the balance of this game refined more, but I love it nonetheless."
4684,"Well.. worst randomizer ever.. you dont need any knowledge or skill for it cuz they make only 30% of the gameplay, the rest 70% are pure luck. deleted thank you."

4717,:)
4718,good game
4719,super fun!
4720,"This game requires a little bit of prep to play, but once you have an understanding of what comps are good and what you want to look for when you start each match, You will do well. That being said this game is pretty balanced. There is no OP comp that doesn't have a real counter. If you want to get used to each kind of comp and each kind of match type then I would recommend going through bot matches. Mainly because they come with a button that lets you skip turn timers when you're ready so you can power through them to test stuff out. The Spire is super handy, but incredibly slow if you don't have a battle pass ($5). If you want to fight 2 or 3 rounds against 1 kind of comp then it will run you through those in street fights. 
Overall its a good game. It has very good pve elements that teach people a lot more about the game than pvp. Having a rulebook available within the front page is handy. If i had to gripe about it I would say that they don't give any mana information about any units inside of the matches. Other than that It's a good free game to play"
4721,"Sorry this is crap,

I personally play DOTA-Frozen-THRONE ( before DOTA 2)

I adore the concept tower defense

I enjoy the unique character, based on WARCRAFT - 3

I give respect to LORD GEBEN who supports DOTA2 and other wonderful steam original games,

But this is crap as strategy game, as strategy gamer, i don't get this, change my mind please.


1. Place heroes , and we do nothing after that
2. IMO it should be card game, not placing-like-chess game"
4722,"The connectivity issues alone have ruined so many games for me, especially when I'm about to select an item or hero. Disconnects. I get back in and it's selected the worst item or hero for my build and boom, there goes any hope of winning. 

It's gotten to the point where I've just totally given up and uninstalled. Let me know when you fix this absurd BS please. KTHXBAI"
4723,"This is your place if you suck in dota 2, no mid or feed."
4724,"I appreciate that in Underlords you can have a bot match or play a campaign. While I'm working from home, I can play a round (pause - do work), play another round (pause - do work), and continue until my work day is done! Most other auto-battlers force PVP, which gets old and is less flexible to life.

Not to mention all the other great stuff it offers (better interface than its peers, better graphics, more game modes, customization, etc etc)"
4725,"nice to play with friends or while watching youtube videos.
knockout is nice for mobile"
4726,I just can't deal with that randomness.
4727,it is good yes.
4728,Q
4729,"20 rolls and i didnt find last unit i needed for 3 star, fuck off valve"
4730,"Fairly robust amount of solo content. Playing vs bots (which can be challenging while you learn the game) is pretty fun and can be played in both standard and knockout. There's also an extensive single player campaign which is partially free and can be completely unlocked for $5 iirc.  I've also tried out Duo play with a friend and while it may not seem to be very cooperative, there is definitely some teamwork involved in trading units/gold or optimizing strategies between you and your partner. 

My main complaint about the game is that to be strategic you need to know all the units, alliances, what each does, and how they work together pretty thoroughly. Because there are so many heroes (60 i believe), this can take a while before you feel like you can make real strategic choices. Until you reach that point it can feel a bit frustrating"

Some other changes make it such a visual clusterfuck that there's this sort of artificial learning curve. There's no ""HEY COME AND JUMP INTO THIS FUN NEW GAME"" digital addiction vibe at all. Oh and a battle pass. The PVE is... interesting.  That's the tactful way to put it. I'm gonna check this game out again in a few months, but rn i'd give it a rough 3/5"

At the time I'm writing this review, I have played 13 hours of the game, and have won my first casual game right now, first of 8 players. I had played TFT (League of Legends Auto Chess) before and I got the feeling Dota Underlords is a better tought game, the mechanics and the whole aspect of the game fits together in a good way.

I would definitely recommend it for people that like strategy, turn based games. Hope the comunnity grows and it becomes with time a huge game with a huge scenario, casually and competitively.

It's a really fun game, but it's optimization on low end phone is pretty bad and it sucks that I can't use steam wallet on phone to buy the battle pass. The complexity is just right, its piece, synergy and item varieties are just right for me.

But all in all I'd say it's a 7/10."

4773,good for killing time in quarantine
4774,"The personalized recommendation said this was a strategy game similar to Wargroove. It is an auto-battler, which is very very different. It's not bad, it's just not my kind of game."

4776,"Game is really not fun or rewarding at all. They took a great thing DAC had going and made it worse, splitting the community at the same time. Updates are painstakingly slow. Fun heroes are removed and un-fun heroes are buffed and left in the game for months before any balance changes are made. Chat and world map view were removed so it feels like you're playing a single player game against bots. Not worth investing any time in this game."

4797,"not a strategy game, it all depends on luck really. luck of 3 out of 5 first heroes they give you because the only sure ones are the first two, then luck of the underlords skill you can choose. for example, you need the speed buff of hobgoblin but the skill that appears is the aoe bombadrment. and even when everything is going your way for the earlier rounds, it can turn sour really fast when the heroes you need dont come up on the rolls so that you can upgrade your heroes. NOT A STRATEGY GAME!!! DEPENDS MORE ON LUCK!"
4798,yes
4799,fast queues!
4800,mhh
4801,One more match disorder is real
4802,"This is the most elaborate case of rock paper scissors I've ever seen.

Is there strategy in the game, does your skill matter? Yes, to a degree. But luck is just as, if not more impactful.

The whole game is completely random. What minions you are given and what minions your opponent are given. Therefore, all of the following is down to luck:

1. How many people are going to counter you?

2. How many people are going to counter those guys?

3. How many people you are countering?

4. Are the people countering you going to get eliminated first or are they going to be left last?

5. Are you going to get good minions, or is RNGesus gonna fuck with you?

But if you thought all of that can be helped with skill:

6. Which target your minions will pick and which they will use their spells on is mostly random: Is your crystal maiden going to freeze the 2 star treeman with a bazillion HP or is she going to freeze the Bloodseeker eating her ass? Is your disruptor going to silence 1 assassin or the entire enemy team? Are your spirits going to form their triangle on 1 guy or are they going to wipe the entire enemy team? Is your Anessix going to charm the 3 star Terrorblade or the 1 star Tiny? etc, etc, etc.

7. Do you get the items/underlords that compliment your teamcomp? 

8. Who you get matched against is also down to luck. I got matched against the same guy that was countering me 3 out of 4 times in quick succession out of 5 remaining players, seriously draining my HP pool. Likewise, you could just lucky and avoid him altogether.

Even if you do everything right, RNGesus can just say 'nah, nope, ur not winning'.

I've been camping this game for the last 2 days, playing non-stop and I can establish that it's around 40-60% luck. I get a fair few first places, like 30-40% of the time (out of 8), but I could be doing the exact same thing in 1 game and get completely fucked or roflstomp the enemy depending on how much my luck holds out.

Like I said, an extremely elaborate game of rock paper scissors. All you can do is pick your alliances, which you will do in the first 5 turns based on what is offered and try to execute it as best as you can. Since there are 8 people in the game you can't exactly counter-strategise against any of them, all you can do is adjust your formation once there are only 2-3 people left to try and shield your most valuable assets. By that point, you would LIKE to counter specific things, but you already spent hundreds of gold on your team and can't afford major alterations, so you're pretty much stuck with what RNGesus offered you.

There are also things that are OP:

1. Druids are broken, especially early game. I once had double 2-star druids on turn 3, meaning one of them turned into a 3 star, when most of my opponents haven't even had 2 stars yet. Having druids early means you can get win streak money AND interest and snowball out of control. Very late game they are more manageable, but even then, your opponent could have 4 3 stars while you have 1-2.

2. Brawnies are the opposite of druids and are broken late game. I had brawnies with +7.5k HP EACH, and I was able to beat a guy that tried to counter me with voids (that do %HP damage). If the game goes on long enough, brawnies just win by default. I only ever lost with brawnies once late and that was due to:

3. Hunters, especially with Terrorblades, are insane. I had a terroblade with around 2k DPS. They are batshit insane.

4. Luna. She single-handedly makes knights viable (still not on par with the other 3)

5. Bloodseeker is broken early-mid, late he can die to the AOE clusterfuck, but if your opponent builds around him he can kill your whole team alone.

Some stuff is underwhelming:

1. The 'dragon alliance' doesn't really exist. It has 2 dragons that don't fit together (unless you're doing a brawny comp, you get the other dragon just to enable your brawny dragon, Snapfire). There's a 3rd one that's T5 and you'll never get him.

2. Savage is crap, because to complete it you NEED a T5 guy that's pretty weak.

3. Insects: same as above.

And when the game is already an RNG fest, being offered these awful choices makes things even worse.

It's a fun game, but as I said before: it's fancy rock-paper-scissors. Can be entertaining, but not for the competitively minded that like to be in control of their game. Frustrating more often than fun.

3/5"
4803,I like the ease and casual gameplay.
4804,Видеоигры были ошибкой.
4805,Perfect game. I used all my lucky ...
4806,"Best chess battler IMO.  I enjoy the complexity and the different strategies you can use to win.

Only criticism right now is balance.  Mage, summoner, warrior, and savage are pretty weak compared to the other ""carry"" alliances: void, hunter, heartless, and brawny (to a lesser extent).  I think the easiest thing to buff without ruining the meta is warrior, because it is worthless as of this post.  Maybe give it % damage increase along with armor?  Probably would still be too weak."

One of the reason that valve doesnt put more effort in this game might because this game wasnt that easy to make money compare to dota2 where people buy items and battlepass.

Trust me, this game would survive if there is The International Underlord."

"
4855,"Great game mechanic that doesn't allow pay-to-win. Generally good balance of heroes and build styles, although each meta does clearly have one or two builds / alliances that are more consistently superior, which may lead to too much competition for those specific ones.

4913,"Primarily I don't recommend DOTA Underlords because it's not the compettetive strategy game I want an auto battler to be. The players that originally popularized DOTA Auto Chess and the autobattler genre were primarily interested in the strategy draft experience, an experience DOTA Underlords no longer does well. The store page calls DOTA Underlords a ""next generation autobattler"", something I don't agree with at all.

I realy liked DOTA Underlords in early August 2019 and thougth it was the best autobattler (as opposed to TFT) for competitive gamers. Now I don't think Underlords is very fun at all.

It's easy for me to think Valve started with a good base from DOTA Auto Chess. Gave it a functional UI and smooth gameplay. Before doing their own thing and deviating away from what made autobattlers interesting. Effectively ruining a good game.

But I don't think thats very fair.

Underlords has been loosing players since it's launch and it's not supprising Valve didn't know how to handle that. The playerbase never settled so Valve felt they needed to innovate.

Regardless I think DOTA Underlords is now the casual mobile cousin of the autobattler genre, with a lot of stuff going on that doesn't help making the game any good."

its fun some how annoying and good for passing time."
4924,:)
4925,"on the one hand, I stand by my original review

on the other hand, that was before the sep 2020 balance pass which I really liked

also I'm a lord of whitespire now, so uh, go me/I liked the balance change enough to grind dat rank

----------------------

Once you hit the Big Boss rank, everyone has a handle on the fundamentals, and it becomes glaringly obvious that every match is 90%+ pure luck of the draw/bad balance (bloodseeker) and <10% skill in knowing how to draft properly.

if the balance was better, MAYBE drafting skill would come into play, but right now it's just like all the autobattler genre of games: overcomplicated poker with a much, much, MUCH lower skill ceiling, and nearly zero social interaction. maybe that's a plus for some people, but it's just such a colossal waste of time that I seriously regret spending so many hours in the proto season reaching high ranks, forgetting this, then thinking maybe season 1 would be better (it's actually far worse balance wise).

I wouldn't say other autobattlers are better since they're pretty much all like this, though admittedly I only played drodo then underlords

anyway, a dumb genre of game, I deeply regret getting hooked and getting coworkers into this game, just uninstalled it and feelin GREAT"

I was really enjoying the game until I realised what was happening with this hero, this needs to be solved or the game will keep losing players. So right now I would not recommend it."

But from my experience, good design, a little bit tricky due to the descriptions of the characters, interesting design of overlords.

Overall, a good game."

Removed like half the heroes in the game, but still left completely imbalanced heroes in it. There have been no changes in over 8 months. Valve doesn't even give a crap about this game. I wouldn't recommend playing it. Feels more like rolling dice and hoping for something good than a game that has any actual strategy in it. I find playing it to be more frustrating than fun. Even when I win, it's bitter sweet. It's never the strat I intended to go and more me just picking whatever pops up a lot. This is what happens when they just rip a custom game off the arcade and put more effort into the single player mode and skins than they do the actual multiplayer gameplay. This game used to be fun as hell, now it just sucks. First guy to get a rank 3 Slark, Terrorblade, or Spectre basically just 1v8's the enemy team. They also limit they amount of heroes in the pool so you have almost no chance of fighting back if someone has something overpowered. What seems like an obvious counter strategy ends up being a trash build Example : You would think that getting a few warrior heroes would be a good front line, but it ends up getting completely ripped apart by assassin builds by round 6. Tons of stuff like this happens in the game. The last major update just removed any heroes that could counter TB/Slark/Spec. Valve removed all the fun and then just said screw it and stopped really updating stuff. No idea why they couldn't just leave all the heroes in the game if they were gonna stop caring anyway. Worst part is, if you try to learn the game in single player, all the heroes are available, so when you get thru the whole learning part as a beginner you're completely shocked to find out that all your favorite heroes aren't even available in multiplayer. 

TL;DNR
All the good heroes are banned except for 3 overpowered ones that are limited to 1 or 2 players per match so you can't even win if you don't get them.
This game didn't make a lot of money on skins so valve just basically gave up on it and hasn't balanced or updated it in ages.
A single standard match is a 45 minute frustration-fest in which you aren't allowed to develop a strategy as the heroes are limited and only a minority of them are good.

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME"

Personally, I found the randomness of your loadout to be a massive turn-off due to the fact that it makes you feel as though your victory or defeat is 100% random.

Never-the-less, I do recommend you try the game. It might do more for you than it did for me."

5167,"Horrible, awful, RNG dependent ""game"".

There are many ""strategies"" to winning Underlords and all of them amount to, how lucky can I get in a given game?

Some people say commit early, some people say commit mid, some people say commit late, they are all wrong considering that if you:

A. Commit early; you will never, ever, ever, in 100s of pages of heroes, find any that match your current build and/or combos.
B. Commit mid; you will never, ever, ever, in 100s of pages of heroes, find any that match your current build while everyone else already has Tier 2 or even Tier 3 heroes, while you have none, since you didn't commit early.
C. Commit late; you will never, ever, ever, in 100s of pages of heroes find any that would've matched your build, because by now, you've already lost.

There is no protection against bad luck streaks, no protection against overpowered builds (such as the current Bloodseeker and run at them build) and no protection against shitty gameplay. 

There is no reason to play this game other than the novelty that it is in the Dota universe, it is awful and worse than Artifact in terms of RNG, and Artifact has worse RNG than Hearthstone."

5183,"It's a pretty well-made for season 1. You can tell that the devs are putting in a lot of work with good communication and bug fixes. Imagine if TF2 was released today xD. 

[b]Disclaimer: I'm reviewing it from an autochess genre perspective. Autochess in general will have randomness to it's gameplay mechanic. I'm not here to debate whether it should be a game genre or not for the general public.[/b]

Scroll to the bottom for TL;DR.

Anyway,
This is a fresh take on autochess genre with the addition of underlords (additional unit that offers offensive and defensive abilities). Each underlord have two variant of spells you can choose at random each game. If you find that the Support variant of Jull doesn't match with your lineup, you can look for another viable underlord. This keeps you thinking about your next move as the game progresses. There's also a Dota Underlord version of Dota 2's Turbo which is Knockouts. Game lasts around 4-5 mins which is great if you wanna game while you are finding your next Dota 2 game. The basic concept of this game is still similar to the original autochess. So if you liked autochess games, this would be fine for you too.

In Dota 2, the core gameplay of the game is basically the same every game. How did Dota 2 survive over the years? Dota 2 have a ranked system that keeps players coming back to grind to be the best. Other than that, Dota Plus provides a hero level progression to unlock rewards, seasonal mini battlepass (i.e. Frostivus 2019 and New Bloom 2020) and once a year The International Battlepass progression bar that gives tons of rewards. HOWEVER, half of it are locked behind a price (i.e. Dota Plus and TI Battlepass). 

In Dota Underlords, these kind of incentives to keep coming back are less money orientated. To start, we have the battlepass. It has 100 level progression with rewards at every level. There are 24 free rewards in the 100 levels even if you didn't spend anything. There are however a long gap in between some rewards but for a free battlepass, it's not too bad considering you get some pretty good effects and portraits along the way. Next, there is the new White Spire City Crawl that gives you puzzles, challenges and street fights. Puzzles will match you against a strong army but allow you to build anything(including upgrading them to 3 stars right away) from the restricted alliances with a limited gold. Challenges are well, challenges you have to do while using a certain underlord. This will force players to try out different alliances and builds which is fun. Street fights are knockouts against bots and its difficulty will be higher the deeper you are in the city crawl. You will get roughly 16 missions to do for each underlord (16x4 = 64) for free. There are more missions if you are willing to pay for the premium battlepass but so far the 16 missions on one side already take up a lot of my time. Did I mentioned that there's ranked as well? And of course, you can even play in your phone when you're not at home which is a big plus. Cross-play is available which is amazing.

On the mobile Dota Underlords, it runs quite bad on my low end smartphone. With all the video settings turned all the way down, i can get barely 20fps in battle and most of the time, delays and freeze. I understand that this is mostly because of my smartphone's specs being bad but i feel like the game is not well optimized for mobile like other mobile games. It is not unplayable as i can still reliably pick my heroes and sell my useless one-star bloodseeker at round 20. It's still nice to play this on your phone just to complete the city crawl especially the Enno's Crew street fight (This took me close to an hour and half to solve). 

Cosmetic wise, it have everything you can put hats on in a board game. You can change your barricade's look, dummy's look, side board props, sprays and lots and lots of particles. You can tell Valve have some experience in making hats XD. It will be interesting to see how the devs will implement new kind of cosmetics (perhaps an immortal for underlords that changes animations). More hats please. However I do want to see better optimization for mobile especially lower end before implementing. 

Overall :
Core gameplay based on the genre itself : 9/10
Incentives to play more : 8.5/10
Able to experience the game even without paying : 7.5/10
Mobile support : Yes , 6.5/10
Cosmetics : DUH, it's valve 8/10
Cross-play : Yes"
5184,I just love this Game.
5185,"As someone who only moderately enjoys mobas but has a hard time investing the time required to play, Underlords has quickly become my new favorite game.  The Knockout mode makes games fast and fun giving you the ability to try out new strategies without being punishing. 

The RNG can be hedged by viewing the field and seeing what other players are buying, so you can estimate the odds of being able to reach 3 star characters.  Kowning when to ditch those early weak characters for newer, lower star higher rank characters and when to press your luck to reroll the buy line is really interesting.

Underlords is essentially everything I enjoy about DotA and nothing I hate (mainly the huge time investment and people being dicks)."
5186,"Play it! Its great on both pc and mobile! Fun strategy game, pretty addicting too.

It has a Duo mode, Vs AI mode, a well priced battle pass, and feels smooth to run and play. I do have one huge problem. Dota is ugly. The characters are inconsistent in the texture quality, certain characters look disproportionate, lighting is passable, some character designs are just  straight up poor, and the animations look eh. Like the game is fine, but I hate looking at it, and the same goes for Dota 2. It is a minor this but HOLY SHIT is it annoying. Also this game feels like a phone game at times (because it is), but does run better here. I do like this game though, it is very casual and fun.

There are some minor bugs and performance issues; longer games on Mobile for example. Fortunately, the dev team has been pretty quick to respond to these issues with the release of Season 1. If you enjoy strategy games, Underlords is definitely worth trying out! It's F2P, so the only thing you have to spend is time."

With the adding of things such as the spirits, the game has gone into a one way luck game. Unless you use an entire board of spirits, you wont win, ever, no matter what you pick.

The damage they do is way too insane, and the cheesing with having multiple of them is also just unfair to play against.

5277,"[h1]Liked:[/h1] Valve's standalone Auto Chess game Dota Underlords is the sequel to the original Auto Chess mod. The game can be enjoyed in an 8 person tournament format which takes place on an 8x8 board. Dota Underlords mixes elements of real-time strategy, set collection card games and gambling together quite nicely. The game has some very basic lore (a quest for the dominance of the city of White Spire) and is now monetised through the tiered battle pass system, meaning that you can either play for free or enjoy additional content with a paid battle pass.

[h1]Disliked:[/h1] The scale of the UI elements were minimised after the beta had finished to cram more distracting and obtrusive elements onto the screen. This severely  punished anyone with a smaller display and reduced the need for player engagement to find out important information needed to help win the battles. General prayers to RNGesus are very much needed for the game and although Dota Underlords is more than competent as an Auto Chess game, I find it has very little spice and innovation when compared to the original."

5303,it fun
5304,"A garbage game in which they made an update a month ago, they brought in imbalanced heroes that are collected even without alliances. And instead of releasing a patch every week with updates and hero balance, they suck dicks and do nothing. I hope this game will die as soon as possible, because those who do it deserve only to clean up the shit for the dogs.

UPDATE:usless update for players usless nerf spectr zero new content not have shop not have new battle pass.Just delete usless trash game"

5331,"I like Underlords.

Underlords has some balance issues, especially during shake-up patches, and it won't hit that sweetspot of RNG vs Skill for a lot of people.

But you know, that's cool. It doesn't have to be The Next Big Thing. As far as F2P PvP games go, this one is pretty comfy to me. The pausable bot games and new singleplayer content help it to that end, shoring up the learning experience and letting it be a more idle sort of game if I want it to be. Also, it can be goofy as hell, and Enno is a cute animal."
5332,"go for it, just improve thee graphics."
5333,"Fun auto-battler. Helps to have some good luck on your side. The updates have proven to be great, with new modes and new cosmetics. I enjoy the new challenge system/PvE mode as well. 

Because it was intimidating to me at first too, no, you don't need to know the DOTA world to understand this game. It is independent from DOTA."
5334,I think that the new update has made the game a lot more fun and accessible to newer players and the city crawl gives a sense of progression that wasn't there before. This makes the game very fun and great if you don't have an hour or so aside to play a game of DOTA. Highly recommend especially if you are already a fan of DOTA 2.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

The building blocks are there to be a great auto-chess game.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

I see how great this game to be, but it falls into the same trap as other games - units are completely unbalanced.  No question on which heroes you should use when.  No question which units you should use and when.  Since units are a shared pool with players, it's whoever gets those units first wins the game.  I've died so many times to the same low-level unit it's not even funny.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

It's good for the auto-chess genre, it just needs to be better balanced.  If that happens, I may come back.  Until then, I recommend trying other games.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!"
5361,kel!
5362,"Fun and enjoyable game. I wish you had more than 4 bosses, but it is a fun game to play."
5363,love that its on moble aswell
5364,"Was decent at beta turned into bad game. but now almost  good game ,
Emphasize is on RNG instead of strategy ,position of pieces still not as important ,camera zoom is on fixed axis  so u cant zoom in if u playing on big screen . game speed is too fast and combat gets blurry"
5365,"very fun
"
5366,"Ever been in the situation where you were playing a game and then you find out that while you thought you knew what was going on, it's actually far from the truth.
I just watched a DOTA Underlords video yesterday that highlighted that I had probably only understood 1/10th of the game. Any success I was having was completely coincidental and by no means amounted to strategy.
Wow!

The gold mechanics, interest and economy side, I had no idea about.
The alliance bonuses, I had no idea about.
The level access to stronger units, I had no idea about.
I'm still wondering if there is any impact of having units on the bench.
I was just amassing 2-3 star units and hoping for the best. I could get in the top 6 most games like this, but almost never top 3.

Watch some videos as the mechanics are far from simple, and aren't explained."
5367,its fun
5368,meh
5369,"I never really thought about playing the game at first, never really interested me. Although i did enjoy a bit of Auto Chess, but eventually i came to hate it; you just go on and on playing games non stop for that perfect run that you had before, that satisfaction - but it rarely comes.

I started playing this game because i saw the one and only AdmiralBulldog play it with his ""friends"" and i can't lie about the fact i got hooked on it. Games seemed fun, smooth and rather balanced. So i gave it a shot and it was as i expected, Auto Chess; but so much better. In this game your satisfaction is fulfilled in most of the games that you play. Alliances seem balanced, gamemodes are enjoyable + bots, and the idea of a hero type piece is rather original; and commendable.

It's very unusual that i fell in love with this game, but it does stand strong. With all the hate and criticism it proves otherwise, the rng element that i hated in the original Auto Chess is changed to a more enjoyable level.

This is Valve and not some Chinese people making an arcade game in the DotA 2 community so you can expect quality.

And finally, it's on mobile. While in it's current state is very laggy in terms of fps loss, it's probably the only mobile game that i really enjoy. When you're offline and you didn't manage to update your game; it just let's you play in the older version, offline. And so many fucking mobile games don't do this making the game end up unplayable because you didn't install that 5mb update. Who plays mobile games at home anyways ? PC, consoles etc exist, who would want to play on a phone.

I do recommend it, of course if you're the more ""strategic"" type of player (since this unlike Auto Chess actually involved strategy and game knowledge) then you should enjoy it."
5370,kkkkkkkkkkkk
5371,Still a little early to be fully fleshed out as a game but the updates are coming thick and fast and are a great improvement. A fun game to wile away some hours on and relax with.
5372,F this game. Why they get better stuff tan me? Why no 1v1? Bad stupid game HMPH
5373,Season 1 made it a pretty solid strategy game.
5374,"Killed a lot of alliances. Out of 50 or so games I have not seen anyone going for warrior strat or assasins strat or scaled strat. Im sure I have missed some more dead strats. Removed a bunch of cool heroes and added not so fun ones. Another annoying thing is battle pass. If I dont have one, I would like not to get a reminder after every game  of what ""cool"" cosmetics I would have gotten if I had one."
5375,Why you no let me find match.
5376,"Played it during beta but currently seems to be full of bugs and crash issues after official release do not recommend trying right now

Edit: bugs seems to have been fixed by recent hotfix and is up and running well now"
5377,super buggy matchmaking. terrible network connection. couldn't find match at all
5378,Can't even play
5379,so mobile and pc battlepass need separate buys to active ? abit anoyying

5381,nice
5382,please 1v1 me. this 20 game 1st place winning streak is so painful. PLEASE SOMEONE END IT. I CANT TAKE IT. THIS GAME TOO EZ AXAXAX TRASH TACO.
5383,"it will get boring in 2 or 3 days, it has zero depth. but it kills time :)"
5384,Many instances where I didn't get the units that I wanted though no other players had them. Broken.
5385,"not advised on 4gb ram phones
must be 6gb ram and up"
5386,Dota Underlords
5387,The reason i don't like the game anymore after it came out from early access because they put a paywall to unlock all rewards with battle pass you only can unlock some rewards for free thats why i don't like it since it doesn't feel progress unless you pay makes it feel like a normal loot box game thats why i wish they sold the game for a price and i don't like that they remove the creeps between battles for me it makes playing the normal mode boring thats why i only play the knockout mode more now just to finish the daily missions fast .
5388,good game 5 stars my dudes
5389,"I really want to like this game, but the tutorial is poor and the battles are too confused...
I think most of new players will give up way before start to enjoy it

Edit:
After played for a while now I can say this game is pretty fun! 
But it take a long time to start to understand and enjoy it."
5390,seems to be cool and fun but need to work more on content and make it more excited

5403,A very complex chess version of DoTA

5405,"Knockout mode = good fun
Regular mode = ResidentSleeper

Game was better before they added the actual underlords.
Still was playable but they decided to abandon it completely.

5415,Great fun with epic strategery.
5416,fun
5417,"Beta was better.

This game is now full of incetives to spend you real moneys. The balance is overall the same, a couple good combos like spirits, sometimes hunters and now summoners. Its just about who gets one of those 3 first.

One match per day is the rate at which this should be played."
5418,"Excellent concept, polished game
"
5419,gg
5420,it could be fun but then come the hacker
5421,this is a good game. its different then other auto chess games or etc. the devs really put succeed on giving this game its attraction. this is where you will really test your iq and skills. it is a slow paced game in my opinion but will really put your brain to work.
5422,"Quite fun. Could be played both on PC and Phone, same Steam account."
5423,nice
5424,Great gameplay with a lot of variety!
5425,"Finally Valve delivers full Underlords experience and it is great! Aside from autochess clone mode, we now have Duos, Knockout - nice fast version of the game, and even City Crawl - an incentive to complete achievements and get cosmetics."
5426,"Very good upgrade from the original auto chess in dota 2 custom games, feels very smooth and fluid, VERY FUN AND ADDICTING"
5427,"This is literally the best game to pick up and play.  Both on mobile and Steam, after Season 1, this has become my go-to auto battler"
5428,this is fun
5429,"This game is so dumb, get bloodseeker and win is all there is too it."
5430,its fun
5431,"Please help me, I get stuck in the toilet for two hours playing this."
5432,"Underlords is an excellent game if you're looking for something casual. It's a bit similar to TCG games, but there is no tiring deck building or any pay to win mechanic. The development team listens to feedback and makes changes quickly. Not enough games have this much active development."
5433,垃圾游戏只配吃屎
5434,Best Auto Chess game out there.  Easy to learn...Very Hard to master.  Been playing since open beta and always come back.  Updates have been timely for balancing and new content and quick hot fixes for bugs. New City Crawl mode is great way to learn game and And new alliances pairings.
5435,best time waster ever
5436,ill do a review when i sink 1000 hours into this game
5437,This game just nice to play :>
5438,I waited with playing until the game was out of beta. Works great on Linux and I find it casually fun :)
5439,Best auto - chess game out there. Addition of underlords has given it a good amount of depth. Also the presentation is awesome
5440,"I've played this since Launch. The progress it has made since launch to date is amazing. I love the new edition of the city crawl and more story based play. You would think it wouldn't make sense in an Auto-Chess game but it works well. 
The graphics and animations are great! The characters are very entertaining. This game is very enjoyable.
If the PVP gets frustrating you can always play bot matches which are fun to experiment with new synergies.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game.
the newest edition of the Battle Pass is only 4.99 and adds only cosmetic items to the game."
5441,I don't know what the hell is going on but hot damn is it fun
5442,This is awesome
5443,good game
5444,"This is probably THE WORST game from this genre. It is free and you will feel that. Game has been going downward ever since the alpha. Imbalanced as it can be, filled with russian mobile gamers and non-responsive developers. Community has been pinpointing improvements that need to be made and the devs never listened. Well now this is the result. If you are looking for a free game, I advice you to play LoL (and I hate LoL - this is how bad this game is)."

5460,"Played this game through several updates. I loved it when it first came out. Over the course of the updates they have removed one positive after another. I don't even bother to play the longer version anymore, unfortunately. I would pay a large sum if they'd let me buy the earlier version from last summer. Knockout is still mildly fun but even that game is different since the latest update. The longer version is tedious to point of being almost unbearable by halfway through the match. Why make characters that can reach level three if the game play is such that it's nearly impossible to level them up. Part of the fun of the earlier versions was figuring out which combinations of alliances would win. The game has no consistency anymore. They need to bring back the level ups every five rounds. Bring back the fifty coin max out. if they are going to adjust anything reduce the level ups from 9 characters to 6-7. There is no middle to the game. If you dominate early you're almost sure to lose in later rounds. If you can get to the later rounds it's entirely random whether or not you will get the promotions to actually come out on top. The ability to actually use any strategy, as before, is almost gone now. I wish they would consider the earlier versions and revise accordingly, it really was a fun game, at one time.  March 18 update - Just deleted this game. I don't know what the hell they did to this game but it's like they looked at it and thought how can we get rid of everything good about it and turn it into the worst possible game. They punked us.

Update: I have continued to play this game, too much it seems. While I am enjoying the game more than previously i still have a hard time recommending it. For one reason, it's still not nearly as good as it was in the  early BETA versions. Sorry it just isn't. The only rounds I play are the knockout rounds. The longer normal rounds are still monotonous and awful. I don't mind playing a long game, what I don't like is having to trudge through the game just to get to the later rounds with 6-7 two star characters. The ability upgrade the units is ridiculously inaccessible. Seriously, the developers really need to reevaluate this game. If they went from 9 gold to 6 or 7 to reach three stars that in and of itself would make this a better experience. Bring back the scrappy units, period. Bring back the level up rounds, it breaks up the monotony. I just can't recommend the game. Knockout is fun because you can consistently get a lot of high powered characters in the later rounds and really watch the fireworks, having said that knockout should be five health, instead of four."
5461,The game looks good. That's about all.
5462,Makes no sense.

its also free so thats great."

5471,"This is a game of both luck and skill in equal measure. Good if you like gambling like me, but it does get somewhat stale after a while."
5472,If you played Dota this is also cancer
5473,"fun, strategic, and addicting"
5474,10/10
5475,"good game, but ugly odds
"
5476,"Yea so long as you don't get popped in a game where every man and his dog is doing some sweaty knights build this is fine. You can waddle your way through the games trying your best but always coming 2nd to that one 6 year old on his phone who wins with a mage line-up and some 3-star KOTL that he pulled out his arse. Good game would recommend, also it helps to line GabeN's wallet which is a big selling point (help the poor man out)"
5477,I feel this game has some potential but i also feel like its very unbalanced as its very luck based you either get lucky and get the heros you require to upgrade to 3 star and win or you simply dont get them in which most cases you lose this leveling up system needs to be changed somehow to make it a more evenly based system then it would make for a good game but as it is now its very one sided and unbalanced and wouldnt reccomend playing unless you feel like getting very frustrated all the time ebcause 1 outta 5 games youll be able to upgrade 2-3 of your heros to 3 star
5478,"After playing many hours of both Teamfight Tactics and Underlords, I find myself coming back to this one. The direction Valve is taking the game is going to increase its replayability, with the addition of the city map, achievements and the Underlords themselves. I hope they continue to bring good seasonal content to the game, and continue to rotate the hero roster!"
5479,"Fun game, not super hard to pick up the constant changes force you to keep evolving your strategy and its all META based."
5480,"Lots of fun, constant balancing and new content being added."
5481,!
5482,"It's good but I'd like to see more game types. I got the battlepass to venture into the city further but it's the same drab over and over, getting a bit harder (AI strategy quality) as you move on. There should be more than just ""beat the warriors,"" ""now the druids,"" ""oh and now beat the-..."" ya' know?

Knockout and standard are fun (duo is a waste of time unless you play with a friend) but I'd like to see perhaps a goal / challenge type of game mode(s). There's tons more I'm sure you and/or the community can come up with. Maybe you already are? ^.^"
5483,unbalanced
5484,"I have bad impression about auto chess world, but this games changes my mind quickly. The battle so intense and teach some of us about patients. The heroes are good but still need to add some of them and also the percentage of legendary heroes to pop out is still rare . Overall this game is good than the others auto chess."
5485,"good enough
"
5486,"Rather repetitive after ya get the hang of it - it's just RNG based with some strategy and tatics style gameplay; though it looks turn based the battle happens without your direction past placement and unit choice - the AI takes over.
It's OK - i wouldn't recommend it or rave about it; though it is an interesting take on some old mechanics. 
As the game progresses it could be quite a hit.
I quite dislike how the game is 'free' yet you're constantly berated for not having the 'battle pass' and you're often show what you're missing out on; all the perks and prizes you could have won for winning battles, but nah you didn't fork over 5USD so we're keeping them."
5487,"Make the most of what you have.

The cartoon antics are fun to watch,
while you search for just the right upgrade.

I'm addicted to the adrenaline, chance-based draws, casino bling, and choices-matter consequences.

This game will elevate your ""mental agility"" to a higher, faster level.

In an age of data-overload, this puts your analytics skills to the test;
attempt to optimize in the fog of war, while under pressure from time and money constraints.

Colorful, funny, sexy, imaginative, multi-cultural; it's an enriching experience
(at least, until they start selling wins)

5500," Fun game to play, great acts. But the release and further on was to buggy for me. I kinda just go bored by the bugs from the game. if i can say it like that lols. deffo worth buying for story run trough 

5/10"
5501,Absolutly not recommending.
5502,better than auta chess boiss....
5503,..
5504,"Remove Hero / Underlord system from this game. Pace of the become game become alot longer which makes game become way more boring. Hero retaliates alot , some Hero like Jull even really tanky  which the biggest reason why pace of the game become way slower. I used to play this game as a  break between work but I can't do that anymore, this game can lasting as long as an hour especially if stalemate."
5505,"After entering the season 1, everything change, even beta season was better than current game. Have been playing tons of hour on this game after new updated found its so hard to form a good alliance and current meta only left those alliance that can grow small troops. Before the last few update those heroes like arc waden and Nature's Prophet are really good in dealing damage but now? Arc Warden damage was neft and Nature's Prophet is sucks. Ohh, tier5 hero arc power removed is also an dissapointing point because we used to get tier 5 hero to power up our alliance power and how tier 5 is basically useless. Conclusion I found this new update does alot impovement on increasing the style of playing it but the system on forming alliance and getting hard or abit weird for want i felt wheni play few previous season!!"
5506,Nice chess game
5507,I like this game very much!! so much funs. stress release.!
5508,nice
5509,This is boring..
5510,Good one
5511,Really cool game with Strategies involved must play :3
5512,I mostly played on tablet and was fun but got bored after awhile :(

5520,THIS GAME IS SO FUN I CANT STOP PLAYING IT!

5522,Hello if you ant to stop playing DotA2 this is the best game. just delete dota2 and start play Underlords.

5526,Cool-Dota 1 is back
5527,AWESOME GAME
5528,Nice
5529,"Fun, strategic, visually pleasing, and plenty of variety and board combinations."
5530,"Fun waste of time, good graphics, lots of builds to choose from and constant updates to keeps things fresh. All in all its a fun auto battler to kick back relax and put some roster's together :)"
5531,Not bad actually ~
5532,Valve refines the Auto Chess genre. The Duo Mode is great fun with friends and Knockout makes the game great for fast paste matches on mobile devices.
5533,fun game
5534,sdce wnaLÇK RFT
5535,"Veru fun yet complex, seems more complex than other games like that"
5536,"Dota Underlords is a good take on the Auto chess genre that captured the hearts of many players of the original mod on Dota 2.

Unfortunately the game packs on even more complex comps and feels like you have very little time to consider what you're doing.

While it suffers from becoming stale over time the game takes a lot of steps to reduce this by offering customization of characters etc.

Reccommendable as a fun game to jump in an out of for those interested in Strategy-based games."
5537,"Luck based game and like most people say, unbalanced as well."
5538,its fun :)
5539,"Best rendition of Auto-Chess

"
5540,nicee
5541,"Fucking RNG maaaaaaan, neveeer luckkkyyy"
5542,"Horribly cluttered and busy UI, this game is worse in almost every way from dota 2 autochess.  Only re-installed to play PVE, and can't access it without playing PVP.  What a joke.  Valve, just stop already; the game is dead and your updates just make it worse."
5543,Mehhh..
5544,"""In Dota Underlords, strategic decisions matter more than twitch reflexes"" ... so a game for the elderly"
5545,.
5546,"goood game

5547,Very nice game
5548,This game is fun but I don't see how they can have a competitive mode and charge people for it. Luck is a major factor.

5563,such a boring stupid game with many cheaters.....well its a free game no wonder there is so much hacker but seriously you got to be a real wussy noob to hack this kind of game damn boring player
5564,"A ton of fun, with the official launch its so polished and a great game that is easy to pick up but hard to master, so rewarding if you start to get really good. Highly recommend"
5565,The best!

I do wish buy time was 50% longer in the standard mode."

5582,Fun game. Addictive
5583,Honestly very relaxed but fun
5584,"The game has changed A LOT from the original version of AUTO Chess, but the mechanics of the game have been greatly expanded into what I would consider the best of the different versions. It's very obvious that the dev team loves this project, and they do a great job delivering quality content and balance changes again and again."

5589,Cool Game!
5590,Dota underlords is finally mature enough to wholeheartedly recommend. Give it a try!
5591,Yes this game is good it just shows how much effort has been put in to this game!!!
5592,hi
5593,ez
5594,The underlords team has done a fantastic job with creating a deep & complex game from the autochess genre. It's worthy of your time.
5595,Dota Underlords > TFT
5596,What a great 1.0 update. Love the new gameplay changes so far.
5597,"Game could be fun, but it's so imbalanced that most wins are determined by RNG and not strategy. You can easily win by just clicking random shit."
5598,sering dc dc ga jelas
5599,nice game
5600,"Honestly, there is no tactical depth here and it relies heavily on familiarity with the DOTA universe. It's basically DOTA autochess"
5601,El modo Knock Out esta buenardo por que dura 10 min.
5602,Highly RNG oriented which pisses me off at times. Not to mention the technical issues such as random crashing or the times when the game won't launch at all.
5603,Its alright
5604,Lot of fun!
5605,ez rng
5606,"nice and competitive. yeah, i love seeing dota heroes are fighting over the chessboard."
5607,"75% of the battlepass is locked behind paywall, the story is locked out by the battlepass so can't even do the pve side, this is a pass until they figure out a better way of making money off the game without locking players out of even playing the game to figure out if they want to spend money."
5608,Highly addictive!
5609,"Its good
"
5610,"First season just releasaed, the game is awsome and fun to play."
5611,Fun game
5612,Better Than AutoChess !!!!
5613,good

(this was my go to game for a while... im salty)"
5620,noice
5621,good game
5622,Have become quite polished after launch. Knockout mode is perfect for a quick game while not focusing 100%.
5623,Its amazing and fun!
5624,Good game.
5625,Best auto chess game IMO
5626,Sadly changed from semi bad to even worse. I wish it was a better game but it just cant compete. Rip another IP that could have been a great game
5627,"Good game, even if it is too RNG dependent"
5628,"Fun to play. Very good for a casual evening, where you are not in a mood to play and follow a story game."
5629,great strategy game

5637,KEKW
5638,"Bad overview, boring gameplay... just another bad game from Valve. after Half life 2 this company produced just BS.
destroyed dota with there damn community. money ruling there minds."
5639,*vomits*
5640,It´s cool.
5641,Very entertaining and fun experience!
5642,bes gaem
5643,after a beta early access now the season 1 is here with better rewards and better gameplay
5644,"noiceee, the game updates regularly to balance the game mechanics. There are still few room for improvements but we'll get there eventually."
5645,good gem
5646,A fun game that is easy to learn and has enough depth to keep you playing for a long time.
5647,"I don't know how to say honestly,just because it is has word dota in it and i like it
"
5648,Very addictive game!
5649,"Best Auto Chess out there imo. Easy to learn, clean graphics and pretty deep gameplay.
I liked it more before they removed creep rounds tho, this way there is barely any time to build something up and use a late game build...
That being said, its still a great game and I enjoy all the changes they continue to try out!"
5650,trash
5651,Cool!
5652,I like this game. I only downloaded it because it has something to do with dota 2 and its also the recreation of dota auto chess.
5653,"Really enjoying the full launch.  I had an issue buying the Battle Pass because I didn't have steam overlay enabled, but the error the game gave didn't initially say that.  This has been corrected in most recent patch, but customer support (thank you btw!) sorted it out in hours and I was toiling away at unlocking all the stuffs.

The game is constantly being tweaked and balanced, which is great.  I really like a live product that get's that kind of attention, and it's made the experience pretty great for me as a player.

Also, love being able to cross-play w/cross-save on my phone."
5654,nice autochessssssssss
5655,:):)
5656,Yup. I would reccommend this game to other players. Well designed with an interesting progression system. It's like valve learned from the mistakes of Artifact and successfully brought DoTA Autochess to a standalone game.
5657,:P
5658,"More addicting than it was fun. It's a good game, but it's as addictive as masturbation"
5659,Yeah
5660,"solid game, bought season one, hope its worth it"
5661,another atuto chess game
5662,Great game
5663,It was fun when it originally came out in the beginning and now it's just an annoying game.
5664,"Smooth and easy-to-understand user interface.
The Underlords are lovable, interesting, and dynamic characters.
Fast-paced action with lots of army compositions possible in terms of alliances.
A wonderful introduction for any novice player into the Auto-Chess Battler genre."
5665,There are some alliances that are way overpowered to win from but the Game Developers are always improving it's gaming experience so overall it was a 'not so easy to win' and VERY GOOD game.
5666,"This this official release the game was so much fun , and i love the battle pass very much and also badge achivement system"
5667,ntapsss
5668,"It's got feelz<3

Some good. Some bad.

Some awesomely feel-good good. Some ""how on earth did I win everything up to this point and now get slaughtered by the same people??""

#nuffsaid #betterthanteamfighttactics"
5669,Knockout is an awesome addition to the game and the Season 1 content is great!
5670,"Please fix the HUD scale on Samsung Fold!!! The ""sell zone"" is too close with the last cell on the left. Great game! Thank you!"
5671,great game
5672,Probably the most fun you're ever going to have playing a mobile game.
5673,"Very much improved from Beta. Love a lot of the new features. Duos is good fun. Suffers from some tuning issues and OP combos, but I'm sure they'll be patching given the giant influx of data. RNG is decent. Bought the Battle Pass, and so far I'm very happy with what I'm getting for $5."
5674,hahahah
5675,Welcome to gambling.
5676,boring and slow
5677,"The game reeks of poorly balanced ""i don't even know what just happened"" Auto chess? more like Auto crash. this shit is a failing number jumble. take it off the fucking store."
5678,Good game
5679,im really liking the game so far but i feel it would be more fun if there was a way to make load outs and get collectables that are more then visuals. Id love to see more mechanics based around skill rather then RNG.
5680,"Originally it was a pretty nice Idea, there was a strat to beat everyone that didn't know what to do and rng would finish the game. Now you have to pick a certain way to win, there is no freedom left, Anyone who played beta lost everything they struggled for and were left with consolation prizes after release."
5681,nc game
5682,"pay to win game, to level up dificult they just give you terrible pieces or block you to evolve your better pieces, just trash gaming"
5683,great
5684,This is fun for mobile gaming...
5685,not bad overall . could be better
5686,A lot less infuriating than actual DotA.

5689,HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?! Part 2
5690,its ok
5691,"After couple of minutes playing this, I felt bored. This game somehow inspired other persons but not me. Lack of helpful instructions and notifications so I won by random, not by strategic mind. Not recommend to others."
5692,"This game has invented the concept of battlegrounds, 
and it is pretty nice. You can also play it on your mobile device.

very nice, interesting mechanics and good animations. And all of this was present right from the launch of the game.
and imagine how much stuff they polished and added since the launch. It oughtta be awesome now. 

BTW, monetization of the game has already been implemented."
5693,"game is good, reasonably balanced, free, better than the competition, since tft is far more rng, i also love how they got rid of neutral fights
"
5694,"instead of improving the game to an expected border they just release it with like 4 main character and a ludicrously terrible premium  season pass thats even worse than the dauntless passes, they improved some things from their start but overall this is a dissapointing turn to throw out like a release"
5695,good game
5696,It's not fun and I like fun games
5697,"Very addictive game. Confusing at first but rewarding once you get past the learning curve. Season 1 packs a ton of content for a f2p game, a ton more fun than the beta. I just wish they had put the same amount of effort and ressources for Artifact."
5698,so good that a dog like me can play it
5699,if you enjoy having things you unlock taken from you play underlords...
5700,"Honestly, when this was in the beta it was fun trying to figure out strong army compositions.  There were some problems with balance that ruined that fun, but they at least addressed those balance problems relatively quickly and all the changes they kept making helped make the game interesting.  I often found myself just picking two random factions and going all in wondering ""will this work?""

That's long gone here.  With the release of the actual game, not only did they eliminate everything you might have gained in the beta, they replaced the entire progression system with a horrible gated rewards program to try and get money out of you.  There's genuinely no reason to play this game if you aren't paying for it.  The army composition aspect of this game is wildly different from the beta, but not in an interesting way, because the balance is so messed up and some factions just don't work well together.  This just isn't fun anymore.  The novelty is lost and what's left isn't really worth playing.  I'll probably play the campaign for a bit before uninstalling it.  If you want a free time waster, there are better ones out there, don't waste your time here.  This isn't a beta anymore, if this is the game they're releasing, just don't bother."
5701,"Changed my review to positiv due to performance improvements.
the small bugs and personal preferences aside , this game is the best autochess out there.


Got a few things that annoy me very much since release:

sinergy Summoners: i dont know if they are the main problem but this sinergy/mechanic was removed and it was good like that.
To much summoned creatures... matches are even more unpredictable, long and than accelerated at the end because of this.

Poor performance:
improved 

STRESS:
They either accelerated the game or the new summoner sinergy BS return causes this , but lots of times there are still creatures fighting and the match is over, you have no idea what happend or why you lose/gain points.
The endscreen after the match is also changing so fast that it is annoying. (why 3 screens in 1 second, the match is over ... no stress)

No after round screen bug still present:
dont know if it is overall since i mostly play duos, but every 2nd game the end of round screen is missing where you see the points added / removed from teams .... all beta long since duos exist.... still present.... 

creature ability cant be read:
since release the screen changed somehow in DUO mode, when you select a creature to read its skills all is hidden behind the buttons for selling or transferring units.....

Thats it for now, if things change i change this review..

Status 01.03.2020"
5702,"An under appreciated gem, Give it a chance and you'll be surprised. Screaming at your partner in duo mode as you're losing your mind with a full bench is reason enough to play it."
5703,no
5704,AUTOCHESS NEVER FORGET
5705,Snoozefest.
5706,Like this game more than Dota 2 itself.
5707,This game was great in the early beta. Once they implemented the actual Underlords it ruined the entire experience. Also taking out the neutral rounds has made the game uninteresting. I also miss the perks you could get from the neutral rounds that gave you additional bonuses for some alliances. Now the game is kind of a boring shitshow.
5708,boring
5709,*Happy Tweet*
5710,Game gets old very quickly and is just RNG based anyway.
5711,BERRY COOL GAME :)
5712,Nice one!
5713,TFT but wayyyyyy better
5714,"in the beta it used to be fun, however the patches made it worse and worse for me, wouldn't recommend it over other autobattlers."
5715,took 5 minutes to lose interest.
5716,BEST
5717,is good
5718,It was good in the early beta. Now it's a clutter fest.
5719,no 1 vs 1 amongst friends?
5720,not gud game
5721,NICE
5722,At least it kept me from gambling with real money.
5723,I recommend this game!
5724,"Basically autochess with updates, city crawl mode is cool, duos mode is fun with friends, takes strategy but is also kinda like a game of poker. Reccomend this to anyone even people who dont play dota can learn the heros, if you do play dota youll feel right at home, ive played all the auto battlers this is the best one. Give it a shot and try it on mobile!"
5725,Very good
5726,like it!
5727,"What on earth have they done with this crap-game?????? Can't see shit whats happening, they've turned the speed up on everything, nothing makes sense. This game gives me aids..."
5728,"I dont need sex, I only need dota 2 nd dota underlords"
5729,simple and dinamic
5730,(y)
5731,My favourite out of all the auto-chess spinoffs.
5732,It was a good start with auto-chess played it a lot. Then they added Underlords.
5733,Fun
5734,The game just isn't fun. Don't bother.
5735,瞎几把改
5736,.
5737,Good!!
5738,the game was fun because they keep improving on the game for us to like the game
5739,"It was fun at the beginning but it turns out to be repetitive and boring. lots of bugs, visual effect bugs. TFT is an overkill compared to this"
5740,nice game
5741,Random Lucky Dota Chess Simulator
5742,BETTER THAN AUTOCHESS
5743,good stuff
5744,Great!
5745,It was a pretty good autochess game at the start. Then each patch made it worse and worse and with 1.0 it's a completely different game. Shame that Valve killed yet another good concept just like it did with Artifact
5746,"Its way fun. I would recommend a quick read of the ""Heroes"" and ""Alliances"" sections of the rule book followed by a few practice matches against bots. Despite being a simple concept in terms of gameplay, there is actually a surprising amount of depth in the decision making. Balancing gold per turn and building an effective team each game is enjoyable and challenging every time thanks to the random rolled hero selection each round and the shared hero pool across all players. 

20+ hours in and I am just starting to get a good feel for it. The learning process is fun, and if you enjoy watching a well formulated squad destroy other groups round by round, definitely give this game a shot. Nothing to lose since it is free to play! Battle pass is a $4.99 in-game option but is purely cosmetics. Nothing pay to win about it."
5747,na
5748,"server lag, bug everywhere, zero skills required, only luck.. what a sh*t hole"
5749,Nah...TFT is better.
5750,good game
5751,Dislike
5752,"It's slow, it's boring, it is %50 luck based. I never understood what was liked about AutoChess to begin with."
5753,I liked it
5754,good.
5755,It's a meh game.... not as great as autochess but has it's potential...
5756,best autochess

5758,"Had some what fun while in beta. It was luck dependant, but ok for casual fun. Now with season one, your luck is diluted even more with larger champion pool. Now luck is the largest part of winning. If you like skill based games, look elsewhere, but If you're a gambler... seek help. Also elsewhere."
5759,"Not a big fan of Dota. But I love this game. It is the perfect amount of strategy, chance, and cheeky humor. It is addicting. I actually switched to playing this from TFT because I found this to be a more polished game. Very excited for the release of season one. They have release so much new content, and it is all good. Brilliant job devs"
5760,nice concept. hope this inspires more dota lore
5761,"Do you like Chess?
Do you like DotA 2?

If both yes, play this game."
5762,Great game
5763,"Ну збс для челиков которые не особо активные,мне лично быстро надоела,но понравилась"
5764,Used to be fun when it first came out. Now it is even harder than dota. Complete mess.
5765,Sometimes better than dota :*
5766,"The same worthless gameplay as a stupid mobile game which is now all around in dota, lol and everywhere. Good job on creating more space to stupid, casual games that essentially just rip off existing franchises' fame and fanbase."

5790,just nice
5791,UwU
5792,"Played this game since they started beta, ruined it the past few months and the changes on release unbalanced things even further. The game had promise, but they made too many heros, too many alliances, and didn't check their balance before release."
5793,i think this new update iss so cool and the map of the game is cool as update
5794,"I'm trying to think of a worse way to structure this game....whoever's in charge of this project should be fired for wasting the hard work of all the other developers.

It was a great game...they updated it...it was still pretty good....they updated it... it was still playable, a good time. They RELEASED it...complete... unplayable... garbage fire. 

I hate this game now. It gets worse with every tweak and adjustment.

5804,Challenging and the meta is always evolving. Added bonus of being able to play on mobile while on the go. The launch of the game added a bunch of great new features and I'm excited to see where this game goes.

5807,"To me, this game is hard to master in the beginning. I don't understand the mechanics yet. But it's fun and addictive. I would recommend you give it a try."
5808,"The Underlords team put a [b]ton[/b] of love into the game and is super active with the community. The price is right, and you'll definitely want to get the battlepass, not because of the rewards (which are nice), but because you want to support this lovely game. My wife and I have played the crap out of it.

If you're worried about game length, the Knockout mode is 10 mins or less and is honestly perfect for someone like me who usually doesn't have more time to game these days. 

Congrats on 1.0! The new update is super fun and I love that summoning was brought back."

5825,"This is the BEST autochess!  This is my favorite game at the moment. I’m not sure that it will become super popular, but I hope that Valve will support her for a very long time. I advise all fans of this genre. 
Thanks Valve for the great game!"
5826,it's ok
5827,"Its an extremely well built and well priced auto chess.  Its free, play it.  If you like it and pay the 499 for the battle pass. If you don't uninstall it. What more of a review do you need to know that playing for free won't tell you.  If you don't have time for that, then this game definitely isn't for you."
5828,great game
5829,"The developers have no idea what they want to do with this game, giving away that all they simply wanted to do was bandwagon the genre. The Underlord characters that were meant to bring something new to the table was met with community backlash, but instead of trying to improve the concept, they forced them into a meaningless role. Valve put zero passion put into this lifeless project, but when was the last time they had any to use?"
5830,total shit game. waste of time
5831,This is everything my brain needs for a good tickle. Big ups to lifeforms at Valve.
5832,Meh...... decent game for mobile.
5833,very nice game
5834,"Im not usually into these games but some of them are quite good. This one however was boring and repetitive, and I suppose you have to be a fan of the Franchise of DOTA to truly enjoy. I found the visuals were pretty good and the way it ran on my i5 with a simple Petium iNTEL 3d graphics card were good, but Meh, not for me."
5835,"only 20k max players on its official release date because this game is shait. First time writing a review, but this game is a joke, they are stuck in a loop of having 1 alliance considerably better than the others patch after patch. instead of trying to work around ways of buffing nerfing alliances they just remove them. it is a joke  game."
5836,Fun little game to play!
5837,"I see a lot of reviews nagging about their favorite hero/alliance being removed. I don't think these people realize that Valve does that when something is too powerful. I can point to many examples where certain hero/alliances were so powerful that shoving them into your lineup regardless of what you were doing before would result in positive outcomes. That's not balanced. There was many a time that going (BLANK) Hero/Alliance would be an auto win. I applaud Valve for the balance in this game, it's never perfect but hey the game just left early access today. 

I recommend this game if you like Auto-Battler/Chess games. It's polished and it's free. If you already have familiarity with DOTA heroes, then this should be your auto-battler.

But with that said I do have complaints:

A standard game takes about 40 - 50 minutes. Sometimes I want to play but don't have the time to invest. Valve probably agrees that the standard game takes a little too long so they added Knockout, which is a turbo mode of the game that only takes a fraction of time. I love that Valve is trying new things with Knockout but I feel Knockout is too RNG based. You start with a set of heroes that can't be sold which prevents you from hard pivoting to different heroes/alliances if you find yourself losing. In a standard game the damage you take at the end of the round is determined by how many of your opponents heroes are left standing, so you could lose by a lot or lose by a little. In Knockout, you have 4 lives, if you lose a round you lose a life, no losing by a lot/little. 4 rounds of losing your eliminated. I find in many knockout games whether I win or lose is determined solely upon if I get more of my starting set of heroes. If I do, I typically win, If I don't, I lose. Knockout feels like flipping a coin, not enough time to recover from poor RNG. I love the concept of Knockout, but it needs more work."
5838,piece of shit
5839,fun game!

5845,"I've played 7 different iterations now to date of this game and everyone single one they change what most of the core casts abilities and factions are and how they function.
It is ludicrous.
Can they make up their bloody mind what faction Bloodseeker is?!

5852,"This game was good, because it was based on auto chess from dota2. But Valve ruined it, because they added underlords, and every update add even more and more stuff. So in the end, I really dont understand what is happening on the board. No more game about strategy and math. Complete feeling from Dota is gone. I dont know why Valve decided to change it so much. You didnt change Dota, you just created copy of dota (dota2) and people like it. You created copy of Auto chess and people like it, but you decided to ruin it. I dont recommend this game, better play auto chess."

5869,"Had fun playing this game but I was pretty disappointed when I realized you couldn't keep any of the proto pass items you earned from beta.  So everything I earned for 100+ hours is gone besides my rank. One reward, the last in fact, was even labelled ""A reminder of simpler times"" and I have to ask how so if it no longer exists?

That doesn't mean that the others are bad (Teamfight Tactics, Might & Magic Chess Royale, etc.), I just feel as if this is by far the most polished one in its ""genre"", even more so with the clear vision of what it wants to be judging from the recent patches (especially with Knockout and Duo's Mode being incredibly fun).

Best part, it's free, so you might as well give it a try."

5911,It's a really fun auto-chess strategy game.
5912,"I miss this game.

First and only auto-chess game I've played. Used to be a pretty good game at early beta. Became even better when underlords were introduced. Although I was sceptical about the jail-mechanic at first, it grew on me. These two elements did require you strategize and vary your setups from day to day, which gave the game some variety. At the time, team synergies and builds could often stand up to sheer luck, while currently it's more the reverse.

I can see the want for faster matches, and RNG-dependency is a fix, but again it's one that alienates the existing players that enjoy the more strategic elements (or myself at least.) It is a little selfish, but I cannot recommend it due to not enjoying it myself. Although I do wish the developers all the best. I had a lot of fun during the first months."
5913,"dear dev,
please stop giving sudden change(updates) to the game and let your players enjoy the patch before patching it with stuff that  change the whole gameplay, i personally love balance patch more than additional gameplay like new underlords system or new alliance"
5914,i have literally never won against anyone with chinese charaters in their name

5924,It's an overrated RNG fest. Do yourself a favor and play Pokemon Final Defense.
5925,"It's a lot of fun to navigate between all the different options and to play with ""calculated"" risks and rng! Best game mode: Duos!"
5926,"This game change the pace of the tactical turn based gaming genre.

The combat is real time, but quick.  

YOu have to fight 7 other players.  Each player got 4 life, each time they lose, they lose 1 life.

Before each fight, you have to choose some creatures.  They range from level 1 to level 5.  Each level of creature cost 1 gold.  

For the KO Mode, (my favorite one) you have to double the creature to make it rank from copper to gold.  So to get a gold creature, you need to buy it once for copper, twice for silver and twice twice for GOLD.

When the fights end, its another match incoming so another chance to level the rank of your creatures or buy a new one.

Each of them got alliances, that when you stacked properly give bonus to your team.

Add items and Underlords into the mix,  the strategic game can be complex.   The balance is pretty good.  Doing something for one game that work, don't means it will work on another game.  It all depends of your opponents choices.

It become wise to follow each players choice to adjust your group combination to win the match.  

Fast Q,  fast games.  The same pace for each fights.  The tactical game is real time,  the turn based aspect is limited in time.  So  the timebox for those KO matches is really to make 1 or many games and forget the time passing away...

...  it got into my skin, like the ""last turn"" itches we got with TBS games.

Battlechest or Auto-combat genre is widespread right now.  The Valve Underlords twist bring much more into the depth of the game than his competitors.   

The Season 1 is starting next Tuesday,  the game will get way more competitive and the match making will improve on this tremendously.  Actually, some players had farms millions of points..."

5933,I've played multiple auto-chess games at this point. Teamfight Tactics (League of legends) auto-chess (The mobile game) and so on. Dota underlods is that one auto-chess game that has it's own formula. Constant updates and patches to the game keep the environment fresh and you always have combos to try.

5949,"I consider this a valve failure equal to the failure of artifact, but somehow this one upsets me more. Before underlords were introduced to the game, the game was competitively viable and fun to play. Player agency allowed multiple strategies that were all capable of winning. The current state of the game is way too watered down to what the game used to be, and the introduction of underlords and the subsequent changes have only been negative to overall enjoyment. It also doesn't help that Valve has let the game lay completely unbalanced.

If I never experienced the game in its early stages, I might have a different opinion of this game. However, since I've seen what the game used to be, I cannot extract any enjoyment out of the game as it is now. After months of waiting, I no longer have confidence that Valve will make changes that are good."
5950,Pretty fun AutoChess variant.  The Underlords make it a blast!  Love the graphics and all the little extras.  The options to fight bots is great too for learning which alliances you like.
5951,good

5955,Very easy game
5956,"Good game to kill time with - it's fun experimenting with new comps/strategies and seeing what works and what doesn't. My only gripe is that it is VERY meta-heavy. Everyone pretty much just tries to emulate the same highest tier comp in accordance with the patch they're in and it becomes very... uninspiring. 

In other words, I wish Valve would even out the meta and flesh out a more robust hero selection system because as it stands simply buying the heroes that fit with the meta and crossing your fingers that they come across your selection screen more than they do on your opponents' is rather lackluster, IMO."
5957,Amazing Game so Far! Better than TFT in League of Legends by far.. There needs alot of work for more heroes and items ect. but so far i am liking
5958,Super fun
5959,this is not balance! NO BALANCE AT ALL!
5960,"Played the original mod and after that Underlords when it came out. Had quite the hiatus and recently came back to the game.

5971,"I'm new to the auto battler genre but I quite like this game. The graphics and models are pretty, the voices are slick and the combat is fun and addicting.

Unfortunately when I started my enthusiasm waned in the first few games because the tutorial explained nothing. I had no idea why I was winning or losing, nor when I had made a good decision. When I had started playing a lot of the information in the guidebook and store page was outdated regarding the new patch, so I didn't know what references to the jail system, picking talents, creep rounds and certain missing alliances meant and what else I should research to improve my knowledge of the game. This information can also be improved with some alliances, like Assassins. They can sneak to your back-line but the alliance description doesn't mention this.

The knockout mode is really fun and fast-paced, which definitely suits the genre. It is also recommended for new players but I found the game too fast to learn what was happening. Maybe it's because I don't play DotA so I didn't know the heroes. I do appreciate how the two game modes offer variety, so you can play quick, fast-paced rounds with a modified rule-set, or a more in-depth style of play.

I also think some alliances and characters need balancing, but that's expected for a preseason beta.

The battle pass system is nice and I'm excited to see what rewards come out. I'm unsure if skins should be added, because the game can be confusing for new players and skins would make it visually messy unless it had an option to disable them. It would be nice if there were more ways to earn XP too. Hopefully we get to keep all or some of our beta rewards and I hope the new battlepass is reasonably priced.

In conclusion, this is a great title, pleasing to the senses with its eye-candy and addicting gameplay that offers both action and sophistication. It just needs to work on its communication with players and offer clearer guidance.

EDIT: The new update (Season 1) is even better! Lots of rewards to achieve and a PvE mode!"

5984,"EDIT: With Season 1 released today, they have seemed to have fixed the broken part of the game..however, (coming from a huge fan of Dota 2) this game is just boring and not fun....theres little strategy involved and lots of RNG luck that your heroes with attack the right person and use their abilities...wouldn't waste any time on this"
5985,"If you like League's TFT, you'll probably like this. This is generally faster paced, and balanced better. Character models are nowhere near as nice but... BUT, the gameplay is far more fair than TFT. You get to choose items if you pass the monster fights. Even if you don't pass, you get something. 

Riot needs to take a little lesson from DoTA on this, make it feel more rewarding and you'll be rewarded with more players. Keep things balanced and people won't get bored of it. This is a sensational game that doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is DoTA chess. Easy as that."
5986,slow and unbalanced
5987,"Definitely the best autochess game/mod so far. Could change if Valve desides to make it pay to win in the future, but so far really good."

- Hard to pick up if you aren't familiar with DOTA.

6007,"They really fucked it up with the changes to the gameplay in the last few updates. What once was a game I was really hopeful for and excited to see where it would go (one I poured almost 200 hours into), is now a game I can't squeeze a single drop of fun out of no matter how hard I try. They sucked all of the old fun and strategy out of it, made it too fast in my opinion, and ruined the originally pretty neat underlords mechanic. A real disappointment. 

That and the last few times I've opened the game have been misclicks when I'm trying to open Dota 2."

6020,"Since they changed the game to no longer have PVE rounds it scks so much. So much of the early game depends on what units the rng gives you as options now. You get good units = easy win streak bonuses, if not you're behind the entire game... No more customizable Underlord, no more clear level up breakpoints, a lot of the good units got removed etc etc. I tried to give it a chance on several occassions after but it just does not manage to entertain me anymore. Do yourself a favor and try one of the other auto chess games instead."
6021,"I used to play the hell out of this game.

But since they haven't updated the game in like a year, I jumped to TFT."

6043,This is a video game. It has many video game-like qualities.
6044,"I guess for some people this game is very good. To be honest it is not my type of game. outside of that the progressions seems pretty good and you have a choice of how you will attack your opponent each turn. There is def. a learning curve for this game. :)

6054,"12 february 2020

A game that relies on RNG to win and basically nearly 0 strategy.

What's that? You picked a good combination of heroes? Well, too bad, RNG will get into and will not let you rank up your heroes while meanwhile (and it also happened to me), let me give you 3 of the same hero to your adversary for him to rank him up fast and not once.
What's that? You received a shitty opener while most of your opponents received overpowered openers? Too bad, play again.

Sorry boss man, but no. If I want RNG I would either play Hearthstone or real life slot machines.

This is just a game for Valve to get into the mobile ""gaming"" and it will add micro transactions to it (skins, effects, etc) to get the big bucks like Blizzard is doing with Hearthstone.

Lately, a Valve game does it mean no more it is a good game.
"
6055,Quick and easy to understand. been enjoying this. thanks valve!
6056,Like
6057,"i played dota for decades and now i am not that free to play or it might be a reason.. cuz there are so many cancers in my 3400 ranked area and now underlord makes me feel better...
it's not that easy to understand the game but 4/5 matches will make u understand and 
hope u enjoy!"
6058,"yes
"
6059,"Edit: The game has gotten a lot better and has really addressed all issues I had with it. The game is good and I definitely recommend it.



As of right now, I would not recommend playing. There are a large number of really bad units. A lot of the alliances don't make sense because every unit that is part of that alliance is also a different class, so you can't even be strategic about it and combine them. And again, so many of the units are just useless and no one uses them. A lot of the alliances are useless. You basically just choose the best units, and forget about the entire alliance system because if you try to focus on getting alliance bonuses you're going to be forced to pick trash units and lose.

I suggest waiting until they add more units, and replace the bad ones with just whole new ones instead of trying to fix them. And they really shouldn't add any more alliances until they add more units, because there's a billion alliances, and only a tiny amount of units can be part of them which means you have very limited control over the core part of the gameplay.


There just isn't enough game there to justify playing. Maybe further into early access they will fix those problems."
6060,"very chill, calming game, would recommend to anybody"
6061,NICE GAME
6062,yrrt
6063,"Don't waste your time on this poor parody of a game. It's just another proof, that current Valve totally sucks at making games. They completely screwed up with Artifact. They ruin Dota 2 more and more with every major patch. And they did the same with Underlords. It was really fun and understandable game at first. But now it's poorly designed, overcomplicated, unmanagable, unbalanced sh!tfest of randomness, that gives you nothing, but frustration."
6064,enjoyable!

6080,Is something.
6081,great game
6082,Good game recommend for players who are tired of toxic team-based games. This game is really developing in positive direction.

6085,Fun
6086,"best game of 2019/2020.
constant developer's update and support.
its free!"
6087,it got a pattern of hero. Its the same pattern will come out but they got several group of hero.
6088,"Thank you Valve, very cool."
6089,Ranking system is terrible. Makes it not worth playing.
6090,"It takes a little bit to learn the flow of things, but picking up how to play is pretty easy, its fun to experiment and try new combinations and see how far you can get!"

6093,yes

6095,its a fun game & its hard to get master!

6098,Great addictive game. Ranked standard mode is amazing.
6099,great game
6100,"made this game too boring, deleted a lot of various heroes, alliances, items"
6101,good story line and character developement 86%
6102,"Great F2P casual game, knock out mode makes it possible to play quick matches while giving you some time pressure and you have less time to plan.
No need to hold off items like in other auto chess games, better option.
Underlord hero is a cool concept, now that we have 4 of them, I can better see that they are more unique and work better with diffrent builds. Mobile versions is quite nice as well.
Did I metion it was free?"
6103,this game is neato burrito
6104,Excellent
6105,"This game is practically addictive, especially it's knockout mode. I was already drawn in by Mattjestic and other wholesome Underlords players with lots of tips and tricks (check them out by the way), yet everything else about the game sucked me in, from the underlords themselves to the euphoria you get with an insane delta slam. i cannot wait for the official season 1 release."
6106,Good AutoChess game. Easy to go into from Dota2 Mod
6107,fast paced
6108,Unbalanced. low player base. not very fun
6109,"not fun anymore, not balance.
bye...."
6110,Awesome fun game with enough complexity and balance updates to be interesting and fresh enough to keep playing it in the long term.
6111,"Good fun
"
6112,Awsome game
6113,This games rules
6114,GJ Gaben
6115,Fun game to play casually.
6116,"Not very fun or easy to understand for casual players! I only recommend if you're a ""hardcore"" gamer. 

I played the LoL version too and it's pretty much the same game."
6117,"A game of skill, strategy and mental endurance.

Or you just roll the shop better than other people!"
6118,"If you've been waiting for a good time to jump into the game or you left part way through the beta season, I would recommend jumping back in. In my opinion the game is in the best state it has ever been in. The Beta season got rocky when the first 2 Underlords were added and their systems were still being thought out, Each game began to feel stale. However, with the introduction of Jull and Enno and  a revamp of the Underlord system has brought the game to its most varied, yet balanced state. If your willing to learn what each alliance does the rest comes easy and you should have a good time. If your looking for a more pick up and play experience go elsewhere.

TLDR:

In my opinion the game is the best its ever been and now is the best time to jump on
If you like strategy heavy games where you're dealt a random set of cards and have to make the most out of them this game is for you
If you want a more pick up and play experience look elsewhere
Jull is the best Underlord and anyone that says otherwise is wrong"
6119,Can’t recommend this over TFT.

6142,Best game
6143,"TBH i'm not playing Dota2 at all, but this game has really good vibe. Your aim is clear, to assemble the best combination of heroes and beat every other team. Besides, awesome graphics, cool underlord designs and easy interface. Would recommend it 10/10!"
6144,If youre into strategy. This game is ideal for you
6145,Good game
6146,"Here's something you should know about this game especially after the last ENNO update:
-The game is riddled with bugs, game breaking bugs at that.
-It used to be an amazing game, but unsurprisingly after every patch it gets worse!
-Very unbalanced heroes and alliances. If you want to win, there are few alliances that will ensure that for you.
-Heroes strategies and logic is very weak, any developer with minimal skill could develop such logic.
I've played this game for 276 hours as of now, Lieutenant 3 ranked, and my 2 cents? If you want to avoid headache and rage, don't play this game.. at least not seriously or ranked.
If the game developers don't act quick, this game will easily be overthrown by a new competing game of the same genre.
I'm going to keep on playing though, It's a good waste of time between work breaks.

Edit: The game has improved over the past couple weeks, rarely would you see a bug in the game.
Here's my opinion about recent changes and what's still there and what's fixed:
-The game still has few bugs, but nothing concerning or game breaking afaik.
-It's back to being something to enjoy, unless you're very competitive and don't want to lose.
-Some alliances and heroes are still unbalances and that hasn't changed much.
-Recently there were some alliances added to the game, which was a nice change, but they can do better.
-I mentioned how game and heroes logic is weak, and it still is. This is probably why the game is not trending and this proves that Valve isn't putting any effort whatsoever in their dev process and team.
Since last review I've played around 54 hours and now I'm Boss 1, and my 2 cents? The game is a bit better now, play it."
6147,"Best game for Dota lover, this can play via mobile and its fun strategic game to play."
6148,"Probably the most pleasant of the autochess games I've found so far. 
Worth trying, but as any game of this genre, it's way too random and gets a bit boring pretty soon..."
6149,"Love the fact that I can play it from my cellphone, very addictive game recommend it."

Other than that, the game is great. 
And the DUO play feature is really nice."
6162,"a good auto batller, a ""exactly what you expect"" whit some moba and RPG features, really good"

6177,"knockout mode is perfect for fast games, when waiting for your wife/gf doing shopping I recommend playing the standard mode you wont really notice how long your wife/gf take their time shopping. Don't play this while on trains/uber/angkas as you can really hurt yourself or worst can kill you. This game replicates real life luck, when you lose because your not lucky not SKILL but LUCK which is fun in life sometimes you.sadlkfjpoas;kdf..s...as.djf..."
6178,nice!
6179,"Solid Auto-Chess game, frequent large updates make major changes that are always fun."
6180,Completely unbalanced and random.
6181,"Crappy basic game where you just watch dumb AI enemies attack the other dumb AI enemies at random until they all die. Sure, it gets a little harder but you have no idea why you're losing  and have no chance to actually ""Strategise"" because you get so little time to change your setup... The placement doesn't matter, since the dumb AI just does what it wants. You can't even use abilities when you want to.

This game is complete crap. Play proper chess."
6182,"I would have continued playing the original game (Dota Auto Chess) if not for frequent matchmaking problems and poor performance due to being a custom game inside of Dota 2. In this regard, Dota Underlords is an excellent game that fixes these two major issues.

I'm content with the changes made by Valve in order to deviate from the original game. It now has a distinct playstyle, but I suppose that if you didn't any games form the Auto Chess genre you won't enjoy this. Right now, this game and Hearthstone Battlegrounds are my two games I'm constantly playing."
6183,fun
6184,ez and stuff
6185,The New Leader thing is broken
6186,best game ever
6187,I like the game play as well as the graphics. I think they have a great job on the game.
6188,"rip those updates, heroes are just imbalanced and some unit just too weak"
6189,its a phone game
6190,Its So Good
6191,"So....about this game...
1. it's fun and addictive to a point
2. It's accually garbage
3. Game is heavily RNG based, RNG>Skill
4. Basically, if you don't get top 4 meta comps, you are gonna lose, unless you snowball hard with 3 star units to knock the meta build out before it becomes unstoppable.

So, if you don't like to win or lose because of RNG, then stay lightyears away from this game.


Garbage version of teamfight tactics."
6192,"A great little Free to Play Auto-chess style game that's getting bigger and better with each update. As per the Auto-Chess genre, luck still plays a fairly prevalent role, but strategy and planning can usually mitigate the issues with luck, usually. Has a surprising amount of players and good enough matchmaking that even for Duos Competitive my duo partner and I rarely wait long. And that's right, this game has a Duo setup, something I haven't enjoyed in Auto-chess games until now, which is quite a fun gamemode to play and learn alongside a friend. Overall Dota Underlords is a fun strategy game to try out by yourself or with a friend, and hopefully it'll keep getting better as the Devs make more additions to the game."
6193,Recomended game LIKE CHESS
6194,"I love Dota Underlords. The developers are so actively involved in making and updating this game. If you like auto-chess, I strongly recommend this game, over its counterparts. Will take sometime to adjust to the new game-style, but its worth it. 5 stars, no less."

Would love to have matches history. Right now this game is playable but lacks a lot of stuffs."
6213,asd
6214,"Trash.
Cool idea, with lots of mechanics to learn and get into but ultimately none of it matters as its 100% luck dependant which heroes you get. Even the fights are completely luck dependant. You can probably do the same fight 10 times and the winrate would be around 50%.

Even winning isnt any fun in this game."
6215,"Gotta learn what teams work and which don't.

50% luck
50% skills

If you like to gamble, feel free to play this.
If you don't like to gamble, steer clear of this."
6216,completely recovered and actually fun now.
6217,"It's fun because they mess with the balance and available heroes and core gameplay ideas every few days so it's always fresh, especially because I basically just play against bots. Super chill game to play on my phone when I got a few moments here and there, or when I'm watching TV or whatever. Would not recommend playing competitively."
6218,Great for wasting time on mobile or the PC. Knockout is an absolute blast!
6219,No longer updated. Don't bother.

6229,"Liked it when it came out, mainly because of tthe duo modus. Now they gutted neutral Rounds, at least they found out that their ban system sucked so thats something I guess. Now it feels like a cheap mobilegame with cheesey animations and basicly no gameplay. Thanks for listening to my TED-Talk
"
6230,Competitive gameplay!
6231,no...
6232,"This is a bad game for many reasons. It presents itself as a strategy game, but it's primarily a slot machine, where chance plays a way bigger part than any moves you can take on your own. The devs keep nerfing dynamics that actually let you play strategically, and generally make the game less fun, rather than more. And out of the 4 available villains, only one is a women, so it's just straight up sexist. Don't waste your life on this."

6275,"I've played this game a considerable amount of time and even though its had its up and downs, I kept returning. The games mechanic is an addicting part of its game-play and leveling up your units and watching your team become stronger is satisfying till the very end. The only downside to this auto chess gem is it's game-play time. If you're striving to achieve the top spot in your game, games can last up to an hour almost. Yes, just one game. So it can really take away from the experience when you want to keep playing to level up your ranking or just to enjoy a short game session but only having a limited amount of time. If you lose your game and get 8th place, a game can still last about 15-minutes. Though the idea is to take your time and think about what your building, I feel like they give to much time for player in-between battles and drag out the game. Great experience, but must dedicate to much time to actually enjoy the game. 7/10
EDIT: Developers made game shorter and are updating it regularly giving a sense that they care about the community. Improving the game each step of the way! 9/10"

6278,Great game. LOL sucks.
6279,Extremely fun to play. Totally recommended.
6280,"fun, alone and with a friend"
6281,asd
6282,you click here. You click there. You click around in despair. Then you buy your dudes. And buy more dudes and go around again. for hours. Time is endless here.
6283,I love this game!
6284,have fun
6285,"Takes some time to get into (I didn't play Dota 2), but once you know the champions and the alliances it starts to click and is a really relaxing game."
6286,"hello

"
6287,Good game.I like the fact you can play it on phone and on PC.Hopefully we get HL1 port for phones.
6288,"For any fans of strategy games and Dota, this is a must have! This game is fun for those looking for a casual experience but enough depth to keep you coming back!"
6289,Best game ever!
6290,Amazing game!
6291,Super good
6292,Great game. Easy to play. Good time killer
6293,"F it, no neutral round = no fun
bring back the old lord system and i'll be back"
6294,Gucci Mane
6295,LOVE IT
6296,is good
6297,Yea idk what im doing and somehow i win
6298,fast and fun with familiar dota characters - especially the knockout mode
6299,fsdf
6300,prefer the gameplay of Auto Chess but this game has undeniably better production values.
6301,clueless game
6302,"Game was ruined after adding the 2 player characters.

Was a fun little game before,"
6303,"It has a steep learning curve, but its very engaging and makes you want to play more even when you lose!"
6304,"Tried it, went back to dota, not bad though"
6305,"If you want to play Dota 2 relaxing way, Dota Underlords is the way to play dota! pick your heroes and auto battle. kind like football manager style"
6306,"Great, fast fun"
6307,wowwwwww
6308,"Underlords is free, has an original concept, easy to learn but hard to master."
6309,its very cool game
6310,good
6311,sadsadaw
6312,they stopped updating this game years ago.. you guys shouldn't bother to install this game.. time to move on to different game..
6313,boring
6314,GOOD GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEE
6315,Fine RNG sh1t
6316,"This game is really fun! My only complaint is the negative feedback loops are too punishing. Once a player starts to lose, the general trend is to keep going down. Introducing a slightly more positive bonus for losing a match so that the player can have a chance to turn it around since it seems that the shop is highly dependent on a RNG. Also, many of the descriptions read ""Missing Description"" but that can be fixed (by the player) by leaving and clicking back in. Though it has a few flaws, it's still in development and that is totally expected. Despite that, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this so far and highly recommend it!"
6317,nice
6318,"It's a pretty cool game which require mind set and high IQ, unlike some other games require action skill like battle royal games and csgo. etc. Plus, this is a relaxing game where u can sit down and have a nice coffee while enjoying the game! :)"
6319,Hate it
6320,i down loaded this onto my phone and fell asleep with it open and then silently closed it and never played it i have herd from several friends that its not very good so unfortunately i have to award the thumbs down to this clunker
6321,dota underlord is lyfe
6322,"Well well well. What started as Dota trying to make their own auto battler, quickly went to shit with each update. Bugs after bugs with each update. Annoying features like damage not being able to be seen between rounds. And everything changed when they removed the Underlords that you enter the rounds with and turned it into a random shit show during the match. The one interesting feature of building your character and choosing your own skills during the match was removed for a dice roll gambling cluster fuck. 

Game used to have instant queues and playing duos with friends was so fun. Now the game is dead AF, have fun waiting for 10 mins to find 1 game only to get buttfucked by the unnecessary RNG throughout the match thanks to the changes they've done. OH AND IT'S A MOBILE GAME LMAO DO NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS!!!"
6323,"If you like DOTA but don't like (or have time for) the length of a game, then you'll like Underlords."
6324," FORGIVE ME FOR ERROR AND MISSPELLING 

This game was great especially playing DUOS with a friend, but with each update they have done it slowly became less and less fun to the point were sometimes its unplayable skills on the Heroes are now randomized like wtf? it takes forever to find a match most likely because the game has lost its way and noone else is playing. How is this even still going on? oh yeah i know how because its a bloody mobile game! they don't care about there day one players at all. i don't care if you don't agree with but until they fix a lot of the issues in this game ME AND MY FRIENDS WILL NOT BE PLAYING IT EVER AGAIN ps 10 min wait times are never fun"
6325,E
6326,"Leave it to Valve to take a good idea and turn it up to 11.
DOTA Underlords is the super addicting evolution of the auto-chess/auto-battler genre.

Duo mode alone will keep me and my friends playing this game for a lonnggg time.

If you enjoy DOTA chess or TFT, you'll love DOTA Underlords."
6327,"very noice :) i likey
"
6328,"It's free, better ui that the dota mod.

Though balance is F'd up.

I down voted this because they can't fix the balance with heroes."
6329,"Great game to play on mobile, the lack of monetisation so far and the gameplay is amazing"
6330,wellplayed
6331,"everything
"
6332,Autochess with regular updates and interesting gameplay.
6333,.
6334,wowzers in my trouzerz
6335,it's good
6336,"decent
"
6337,It's pretty good.
6338,"Ay its quite fun
"
6339,good game
6340,very recommended for the players who like open world games
6341,So shit TFT better
6342,"Auto chess mod + polish, so yeah, perfect."
6343,appreciate the updates
6344,dfsdfsdfsdf
6345,good game
6346,A suprisingly enjoyable and highly replayable game.  Doesn't need to be played from PC. Once your familiar with it just as good on mobile IMHO
6347,dis sum gudsht
6348,Fun game
6349,fun and chill strategy game
6350,"quite fun and free
just give it a try
(getting sick with the ""other"" auto chess tho)"
6351,Very easy and quick learning curve. Insanely addictive.
6352,"This game is like playing poker while being forced to change hands, tables and rules every round."
6353,"If you like trying to battle bad luck RNG and try crazy builds this game is for you. The game becomes much more fun in my opinion if you play with a friend, and without the need to win matches entirely. The reason for this is that there is usually an ""In meta"" build that is much better than many other builds, so if you want to experiment around with what you like best you very well may not win much.

If you just want to have some fun, possibly with friends I think this would be a great game for you.

if you want to be serious with it and the ranking system, you may find yourself very frustrated until things are more balanced."
6354,Tactics and luck mixed together which makes a very fun game.
6355,Definitely my favorite auto-battler!  The option to play ~10 minute matches or ~45 minute matches makes it perfect to play no matter how much time I have.  Highly active developers keep the game fresh!
6356,"Dual mode for autochess-type game. Amazing. Only here I think, at least so far. Check it out."
6357,"This is a pretty good game and i like it
but i suggest to bring match stats and previous match results or a profile system that has some medals or something else.
bring market or bring a really good game pass"
6358,"Easy to play,hard to master.
"
6359,"its good enough to kill some time, better than LoL counterpart"
6360,gud
6361,idk
6362,good
6363,fun
6364,"The patches have their ups and downs, but i think most of the patches have been enjoyable, and if you don't like one you can just wait for the next one because they don't last too long."
6365,Not Me. Us. #berniesanders2020
6366,muitbom
6367,"Although its almost 'dead' with only 7k concurrent players left, its suprisingly rare for me to wait over 1 minutes to find a standard match. Updates are quite frequent and most of them are small balance updates and bug fixes. Although i still want more new content but these updates are often shaking the meta here and there.

Overall, 4/5. I will give 5 if they completely optimize the mobile version bcs its literally unplayable on my potato phone. But by now, its perfectly fine in my potato pc."
6368,i like game
6369,its lit
6370,It is really fun.
6371,"Game turned bad after the ""lord"" units got introduced."
6372,"For everybody who likes strategy, fantasy and Valve."

6374,Prety Decent
6375,"A fast pace game
Very attractive game play and great characters inherited from Warcraft movie. I will highly recommend this game for friends"
6376,"fun game, when you need to rest from dota 2
"
6377,sick
6378,i hate the fact i have this downloaded on my phone already ....... and have to jum through the same shit to play on desktop.............................
6379,"I like how this game requires you think fast, but isn't about twitch reflexes.  Having a great time."
6380,I like it.
6381,the game is too random for anyone wanting a skill based result.
6382,"Seems to still be trying to work out balance and what it wants to be, but it's a solid version of auto-chess that's unique enough to stand out in the genre. Nice for people who like a bit of strategy but don't want something as complex as Dota or Starcraft 2.

Games are a bit long for mobile play, although the new knockout mode is great for 15 minute fun games. Unfortunately the shorter games feel more random and less satisfying when you win."
6383,"It has been weeks and the awful decision to remove the jail hasn't been reversed. In case any devs are watching these reviews... the only thing that kept interest from one match to the next was reworking your strategy taking banned heroes into consideration. There's nothing to react to without the jail, players do the same winning strategy every game every day. It's inventor/scrappy by the way."
6384,not bad
6385,SHIT GAME
6386,good game
6387,Bring back the fucking demon build and fix the game please it became an rng to the point i dont even understand why i'm not getting level 2 at round 9.
6388,GOOD
6389,muito loco tendi nada
6390,white spire will be mine :-)
6391,great game
6392,"This game was fun until the last big update (Jull Tide).

The devs decided to implement a poker machine style RNG system while taking away many strategic elements that made the game fun such as underlord talents, of which one used to be able to choose to customize their build, which was replaced by a pre-determined build that you don't even get to choose as its now been RNG'd.

Furthermore the jail system, which wasn't perfect but promoted different play styles, was removed along with a huge list of previous heroes where all it did was force everyone to try and get the same meta every game to win. This was the bigger kicker for me personally as I am one of those people that liked to play something different every game instead of the same thing over and over.

Its become apparent that due to the ever decreasing player count that the devs are focusing on the casual mobile market with this game which should tell you everything you need to know about its future and why, I believe, one should not bother with this game until it comes out of 'Early Access'. If it ever does."
6393,"I enjoyed playing Battle Chess as a kid. This is like Battle Chess, but with a different flavor. A good flavor."
6394,Dota Chess
6395,fun
6396,This game is really unbalanced and all about luck. Do not waste your time...
6397,Yes
6398,daed gaem
6399,Its okay
6400,FREE TIME KILLER
6401,"You can judge a lot by a multiplayer game by the feeling it gives you when you lose to other players. Victories in this game feel like hollow dumb luck, defeats leave me feeling confused, wondering if there was anything I could have done to win. Mostly I think this game is posing as a skill based game, but is actually mostly RNG."
6402,"Used to be good. You could plan a few different strategies based on what pieces were RNG'd to you, and work on levelling them up. Now, there are so many pieces it's diluted far too much. I almost never get one to rank 3. The economy also got nerfed. You used to try and keep above 50 gold to get max interest of 5, but now it's capped at 3, so less income to re-roll the shop, which again is diluted. I play this only against bots to pass time while on the bus, would not recommend to anyone in it's current state.

They also removed the fun neutral rounds, which is where you got equipment from (winning those got better items than if you lost) and added in the 'Underlords'. You choose one of three 'hero' type pieces that have one of two skill sets randomly applied. You could end up with all the wrong sets, instead of being able to choose one to compliment the pieces you have."
6403,keren
6404,Very cool game:)
6405,"Nope. I would play traditional DOTA. This is fun though if you want to kill like 15 to 20 minutes, since you will not be penalised for leaving game in between."
6406,Very good game
6407,Great game that they keep improving!
6408,This Mikael guy always beats me in this game
6409,Wh are you ?
6410,"Mindless fun, some tactics, but mostly you are at the mercy of RNG. Still fun though"
6411,"When you're tired of micromanagement in regular Dota, don't want to alert yourself too much before going to sleep, but instead are up to some more strategic thinking - Underlords provide you just that. Pretty fun and engaging. Don't forget to check the clock, you might find yourself in-game for couple hours instead of just couple rounds."
6412,"Just like other have said.. ""Great Game!.....Until the Jull update.....now its no strategy, no planning"". I am keep getting back every 2 - 3 weeks in hopes that something has changed. Unfortunately, at its current state the game is a waste. I just hope that this state is not what Valve hoped of this game."
6413,"Pretty much unplayable, due to continuous crashes"
6414,Game could be better but its not bad
6415, iiiii
6416,good updates
6417,fun
6418,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND UNDERLORDS IF YOU LOVE STRATEGY AND CARD GAMES LIKE MAGIC OR EVEN TEXAS HOLD EM POKER! 

Underlords is a fun and challenging game. It's epic when you win and rewarding when you get in the top 3 in a match. It's part strategy, part RNG, some luck, and almost like playing a hand of poker (in the way you match your characters and upgrade them by getting two heroes of the same type, etc.). It's easy to learn and come back to for a match or two without having to relearn a bunch of stuff; but it is difficult to master and even when you think you have it mastered, you can't win every time. That's my advice... don't focus on 1st place...focus on top 3... focus on making the best team with what you are given. Be ready to change your tactics and strategy mid-game. IN otherwords, don't get too attached to your starting team as you might have to change it up. Once you've played enough matches it does get easier as you learn the hero abilities, understand good placement, and understand what abilities work best. See what others are doing... you have the details at your finger tips.  

Rating 9/10 - This is an excellent strategy game where you are the coach and minions are your team! Go and show the world you can be the top Underlord on the leader board. May the Underlord gods be with you!"
6419,good
6420,Dota Underlords is a fantastic auto-chess game by Valve. It is a difficult game to learn at first but eventually through trial and error you will be able to start winning games. I recommend looking through Youtube tips and tricks if you are a rookie.
6421,Mobile-10minutes-crack
6422,"About 5 months ago, I'm not sure when was the UPDATE ... the game was playable  .... as the UPDATE was released .... This game became a f-ckin trash ... they doubled HP of the heroes ... for no actual reason .... did nothing to dps ... MOREOVER, Now you cant choose the UNDERLORD u wanna play and the abilities of it u wanna play ... u r just given a choice after round 9 to choose from 3 UNDERLORDS which abilities are already composed... So, it happens that u can get UNDERLORDS that r not suitable for ur crew ... Less usable items ... Less usable heroes.... For example ... Usually if u didnt play brawnies... u could've remove beastmaster as he was really weak in hunters .... now u have 2 useless garbage (beastmaster and weaver) and u can remove only one of them  .... now Sniper cant kill most of lvl 2 heroes with assasinate... Slark is so damn retarded  ... if u dont get MOM for slark  ... u probably wont win with assasins. No abilities that summons additional crew ...   
SO YEAH THE GAME BECOMES F-CKING HELL .... AND now there is no creep rounds ... so at the beginning everything depends on heroes u get ... whether u lose 15 hp for the first 4 rounds or win all with a strongest crew... BTW u cant save FREE ROLL if u dont wanna use it ... thats really stupid ... because not every time u have money to use FREE ROLL really efficiently... GG DEVELOPERS .... GG"
6423,"Even though it had it's up and downs balance wise and scared away a lot of the initial playerbase the game is in a really good spot atm. Lot's of stuff is viable, the devs are constantly on tweaking it. If you played this game and stopped, due to the 6 warrior or 6 warlock meta, give it another shot. This is most likely the best auto battler out there.

// nvm ded geme no more patches for some reason"
6424,"As someone who never got into standard LoL or DoTA, I can't believe how fun this game is!  It's the first time in a long time I've found myself staying up way too late and wondering when I can jump back into another match while i'm at work lol!"
6425,"This game provides an easy and addicting entry in strategy genre.  The characters, design, and story keep the game alive and fresh.  I enjoy the game and only hope they add more diversity to the meta and increase the overall strategic nature of it.  Overall a very enjoyable strategy game."
6426,"This game is underrated. If you enjoy 'autobattle' style games, then this game is worth a look. Valve has done a great job supporting the game through the beta process. The balance has been good, and the patches have been frequent. Graphics are pleasing to the eye and there is a good variety of characters."
6427,Creative One and I played mostly Knockout in these days. Very Fun.
6428,Really fun engaging game with lots of options. the Duos mode is amazingly fun!
6429,It's completely bullshit and full of bugs ... DONT PLAY THIS SHIT EVER
6430,shit game its boring at one point you dont have what to do and its repiets it self so many times try to make it blue and trow it in the sea XD
6431,imbaalaance game
6432,It's pretty good.

6441,Fuck off
6442,"If you're scared of insects: beware! 
SO MANY BUGS! BUGS everywhere.
kinda fun otherwise, but the bug garbage is very frustrating to lose rounds where your ranged hero decides it's a pacifist now and won't attack for the whole match, or when your full-mana-not-silenced-hero dies after saying 5 seconds full mp without casting a spell (not on cd either)."
6443,Good game
6444,"This game has me addicted. I can’t stop playing it. The RNG can be a bit frustrating, but there’s a fair amount of strategy and technique to it once you dig in. Way fun and accessible.

Oi!"
6445,There is another.
6446,It's like TFT but better
6447,Good
6448,dont play it

How the fuck i know i am not playing with bot if i cant talk to them !!!!! fuck you stupid developer with no brains . o0o"

 edit: steam asked me i played more after this comment and do i want to change it . yes i change it to 3/10 extreme RNG this game is really bad

my girlfriend and i really enjoyed with playing this in different hemispheres
but recent update is truly bad, especially after when you can pick 3 heros at beginning 
you cannot just assume that everybody enjoy game like fast food
最近一次大改逼的人几乎要弃坑，之前是很好玩的
现在吸收了快棋元素真的不好玩了，如果所有的模式都用快棋风格，那要那么多模式干嘛
也没必要用那么多模式，那么多天梯+休闲来分流玩家
我可能不是核心玩家，但也不是随便玩玩就来评论的

6479,ah ah ahhhhhhhh
6480,lotsa fun. and keeps evolving
6481,"The game was changed so much post 'Big Update' that it's a completely different game.
And the new changes appeal to middle schoolers jacked on adderall ; big flashy icons, shitty animations etc.etc."
6482,Good for your strategy setup. It will let your creativity to grow in every situation.
6483,good
6484,"used to be fun, abandoned game. had a great interface and very user friendly. if only TFT was this intuitive"
6485,good
6486,Fun game but makes you so angry sometimes.
6487,"Nope. Since Jull update it is a rng fest. If you stomach that kind of thing or you are a masochist, go for it, it's fun for a while. The meta is stale as fuck since the update.

They got rid of daily rotation to have in place some sort of monthly (dno the period) rotation of heroes. Brilliant idea. Someone get that guy a raise. 

They also made a game mode that's FAST. For mobile people of course. Ok, it's a game mode, diversity is always welcome. Then decided to make the standard mode faster, dumb down stuff, increase rng (by making it last less turns => more random shit).

And they seem happy with this, hence the thumbs down."
6488,"The different teams that you can command can get nuts. Very fun.
"
6489,"It's a fun game to play on the side whilst you're listening to a show or podcast. No one should be taking this game super seriously- it's a game you pick up and put down a lot. Come back to for updates, new heroes etc."

6505,Fun with friends.
6506,this is dotaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
6507,good game. the auto chess blown out 2019. New meta every big update. o0o
6508,"Dota underlords was one of the best games when it came out even the best auto chess game ever.But as time passed the game got many updates that were clearly meant for balance but the domino effect was that underlords started getting boring and purely RNG based.The game just wasnt fun anymore.Then i started waiting for the big update.But it was a disaster.The underlords they added in made the auto chess genre game something odd and weird,like it felt they belonged to an another game."
6509,"This game is fun, whether with friends or randoms. Keep in mind though that it involves 60% skill and 40% luck in my opinion, unless you play Knockout mode, which needs 90% luck and 10% skill. Play this if u have no life

Edit: The devs don't actively update this game and the seasons are too long. In my opinion they should eliminate the ""Stars"" system of upgrading units as it is too dependent on luck. Instead it should be focused entirely on picking the right units for each fight and setting the optimum formations. Changing my review to Not Recommended now as I am tired and bored of the game."
6510,"A F2P game which runs smoothly, receive updates regularly and doesn't try to put micro transaction into my face. Not necessary a great game but fun to play none the less."
6511,"damn good

6530,"I will never not love this game. Most of my 800+ hours were spent duking it out in the duos mode playing with a wonderful friend. The adventure was a roller coaster ride. Figuring out what synergies worked best with each new update proved to be as challenging as it was rewarding. Together, as Lords of Whitespire, we clawed our way onto the leader boards and had a heck of a great time along the way. This game turned my ""I'm not a gamer"" friend into a gamer. I wish Valve would give this gem a bit more elbow grease and love, but even as it is the game is great fun. The graphics are wonderful, the heroes and underlords are endearing and amusing, and overall the gameplay was highly rewarding. 

Having ventured off to play alternative games along the same vein, I still find myself wishing they were more like Underlords. That edge of the keyboard feeling of rolling away all thoughts of economy in the hopes of getting an early 3* Warlock, as my partner's panicked screams of ""my board is full STUFF, STUFF"" filter through my headset. I was there for the rise and fall of scrappy/mechanic. I remember the chickens. An early adoption of the 3* Warlock/Demon build made sure ""Smells like Axe,"" would be the last name one our opponents would see. 

It's not Underlords, it's UNDALAWDS, and I don't regret a minute of it."
6531,"a great explanation of how you can win a teamfight in dota, worth playing just to learn that

6547,"PVP is Awsome, Multiple Strategies and mostly balanced, very detailed even on cellphone. only problem is the removal of pve NPC's, wish there was something more along the lines of random enemy encounters (optional mode) where you can just grind out things like acheivements and/or special character skins that does not require internet connection... i would have played hundreds of hours more but in NYC the train systems drop internet and hardcore is not as much a challenge with no rewards."
6548,
6549,I love this game! Can't get into DOTA because it's not for n00b babies like me but this is the DOTA fix I needed.
6550,"Because AutoChess isn't available on moblie, 5/7"
6551,good and flexible play styles
6552,better when you aren't playing
6553,"consistently unbalanced, underlords do more damage than regular units which breaks the game, stale metas, swim left"
6554,Perfect game to play when you browse the web or watch Youtube videos.

6561,"After the latest patch which pretty much made the game luck/rng dependent I cannot recommend this game. Was fun during the beta period I guess, where you could slowly pick out a strategy, even swap it out a few times, and build your champion from the beginning. Now there's a lot of luck involved and they removed a bunch of heroes for no reason."
6562,Nice
6563,gmae speeed is good
6564,"It's a fun and addicting game to play. Takes a good amount of strategy and it has a learning curve but doesn't take long to learn at all, and a quick tutorial on YouTube can help if you're struggling. Also the devs are constantly updating the game and buffing/nerfing the characters, underlords, and alliances all the time. I recommend it."
6565,good fun. good brain teaser.
6566,Pretty good game.  I recommend it.
6567,"really tactical, lots of fun. Little bit of rng but its fine"

6573,"This game used to be awesome, and the concept was somewhat addictive, however, this game is not longer fun, i'd rather re-install DOTA 2 to play the old mod version."
6574,There are much better games of this kind out there. The UI is just one of the worst I've ever experienced and overall visuals of the game make it very cramped and chaotic. Too much going on.
6575,very good game...and is only the begin!
6576,"I liked this game a lot. But at the current status the game is just not fun anymore. 

Team variety:
There are currently ~5 viable team compositions out there. The rest just does not compete. So you end up playing the same teams over and over, which is just boring.

Drafting:
If you get lucky early drafting, you just stomp everybody. The game is just too fast to perform a comeback without insane luck.

Heroes (Underlords):
At the current state the heroes are just too strong compared to normal untis. Due to bad balancing some heroes are just overpowered. On top of that you must choose the hero from a random sample of all heroes. So sometimes you are just screwed, if you got unlucky in the hero roulette.

Game pacing:
The removal of the creep waves and hp reduction speeded up the game a lot. For me this just feels too fast. There is no time for overthinking the stategy anymore. You are forced to braindead click the units for your build and place them on the board. For the rest there is just no time anymore.

Possible solution:
-Better balancing
-The jail was a nice idea to increase variety. Bring it back until you found something better.
-Heroes should not actively participate in the battle as a attacking/attackable unit
-To give more control to the palyer, the hero should give the player the ability to participate in the battle via skills (eg casting a fireball on a unit that the player selects)
-You should be allowed to choose among all heroes
-Bring back creep waves
-Increase hp of the untis"
6577,ez game
6578,Tried the three big auto battlers and like this one the most so far.
6579,its a fun and cool strategy game!
6580,"With the new update, game started lagging on intel i7-5500U cpu and nvidia gtx 950m gpu. Seriously was the new update necessary? devs need to learn to keep up with backwards compatibility. Perfect work valve"

"
6582,sure
6583,It's fun!
6584,"This was the best auto-battler. It had the best UI, the best balance and was relatively simple and easy to understand, without sacrificing much depth.

Then they introduced the UNDERLORDS... completely trashing the UI, the balance and the elegant simplicity.

They've recently launched a Knock Out game mode, which is a somewhat simplified, fast paced short session mode, where players are knocked out after four losses. It's actually a lot of fun and has reinvigorated the game for a lot of players, restoring it to its place as the best auto-battler, imo.

Even if it's thrown away some of its original potential, the game is still free to play (Yep, I received this product for free, like everyone else) and pretty fun."
6585,Really fun tactics game that keeps getting support making for an interesting and dynamic metagame.
6586,"I came from Drodo Auto Chess so there is a decent foundation but I still find it moderately difficult to learn all the new Alliance from scratch. 

I started playing just after Christmas last year and climbed to Lieutenant II over couple of weeks. Maybe 4 or 5 games per day. I can say that people bad mouth this game have very little idea how to play this and fails to learn new build and diversify during the game based on the chess pieces that are offered to you at early game. If you force 1 or 2 build every single game then you'll lose a lot of games. 

There will be times when certain players have better RNG luck and high-roll but that won't stop you rank 2nd or 3rd in those game. I've ended as 8th or 7th maybe in 3 or 4 games since started playing and mostly at beginning because I was still learning how to play the game. As I'm more familiar with the Alliances and meta builds, I'm constantly ranked between First to Third in most games I play. 

I felt like the Discussion boards and Review for this game are unfair because a lot of people are not playing this game right and when they lost they blame it is RNG or other people high-roll and I can definitely that is a very incorrect statement."
6587,"Still can't figure out how can I be a better player, but the game is awesome!"
6588,"Nop. The lastest patch removed so much stuff that made Underlords Underlords. Now its just a basic auto-chest with nothing special and doesnt look like they will revert back to when we had lots of stuff.

So the last big patch, they removed:
Underlords: Fun units with talents and ultimates, that you could build/spec like you wanted, gone! Making every game different if you wanted. Also making you wonder now why its still called Underlords if those unit a just like an higher tier of unit, nothing special about them. And before, you were starting with them at round 1. Now you only get at round 10 i think? So again, just a generic unit that we dont care about unlike before.
The creeps wave: Yea... its gone. Also mean we get less items.
Soft gold cap: From 50 to 30. Mean we get less gold in general, so less gambling to get higher tier of unit, and leveling slower in a way.
Game speed: With creeps gone, games are faster... but they Just included a faster game type... so you got 2x fast games mode now... instead of 1 fast and one slower.
Prison: Removing a few heroes for 24h, so 1 meta cant always be present... With that gone then back to 1 meta that can rule them all, any time.

If you want a basic auto-chess with nothing special then sure, try it."
6589,"good time killer

6590,i disliked the lack of social communication enter phase of the game... thanks
6591,once the pride of auto battlers... now just overloaded and uninteresting
6592,"What happened to Elves is a GENOCIDE! I don't know how it happened but they are gone somehow. Also i like knockout mode good when you have limited time, but hella return the old mode as it was.

6621,This is a review on the auto chess not dota 2s game itself. They really did a mess on this game. The originally mod for dota 2 is way better than what they did to this last update. Recommend going to play that or play the league of legends version.
6622,Butts!
6623,"What did you do Volvo? What the actual intercourse!?! 
I stopped playing for a bit (right at Jull update).
I come back and it's a clusterintercourse of a game?!
Do you even know what direction you are heading, or are your lead designers just fanboys of other autochess games and try to copy/paste/think outside the box.
Everyone should boycott your rear end and stop playing for like a week!
I used to love the strategy behind this and it looked like you were going for strategy, not RNG... I'm very sorry to say, 'tis not the case anymore..
I can't pick my underlord's skills? WHAT?!!!!
Are you just going for the casual 10y/o audience with 0 patience and everyone else can go f**k right off??
You can do the same Volvo if you continue this path..."

6627,easy to pick up and have some quick fun with your favorite Dota 2 characters. idk its not that much fun when i really stop to think about it but i always find myself coming back to play on most days
6628,"Good, addictive and balanced. They should add random rewards/season pass."
6629,"There must be a reason for the large loss of players.

For me, the problem of disconnecting is really annoyed and disturbed. Yet, it hasn't been solved after so many versions and updates.

Btw, imagine how few people are willing to play such a game based on the background of another dead game, DOTA, on a platform where games are almost too rich to play."
6630,"Game doesnt know what it wants to be, keeps changing everything about itself each update and causes the battle system to not make sense. Game is also STRONGLY about RNG on getting the right heroes. 

Just like artifact, this is another Valve game destroyed by not know what people want."
6631,Its like Dota but then with shorter matches and uhum on a chessboard. Its the combination of heroes that will make you win or lose this game. Seems alliances are important and sometimes not spending your gold helps to. Fun gameplay but not sure for how long it will remain interesting.

6641,GG bois
6642,"This game is about managing RNG. The skill lies in making the most out of the cards (heroes) you are dealt. 

Sadly, this provides an easy excuse for salty players saying this is ""nothing but a slot machine"". To them I say there is a reason why I or any high level player will never lose to you. Its because we know how build an army out of what we are given, even though it is different each game.  

I've played each patch iteration and the recent one is by far my favorite. The pace of the game feels great."
6643,"Great chill game, Low investment in terms of time, has rewards for your progress, different game modes depending on what you're looking for whether quick, solo, or with friends.
"
6644,good
6645,"Like other's have said, before the JULL update, this was a great little game to hop on and kill a hour or two with but now, they have removed so much good content from the game it is now some turbo-fest poker machine and it would bring a tear to a glass eye...

Before it had strategy, player choice and customisation for underlord's, and the jail system forced different compositions.

The newest update stripped all that and just chucked in a ton more RNG.

The developers are'nt listening to feedback or even reading the posts on the forums only Reddit and catering towards mobile users.

Sorry but in its current state, i do not recommend the game which is unfortunate because before the Jull update, it was a real little gem of a game."
6646,amazing game
6647,great game Gg
6648,Its fun :)
6649,just play tft instead
6650,gut
6651,yea sure play it

6653,fun with friends
6654,"This was one of my favorite games until the recent Jull update. I enjoyed the slow pace as it felt a lot more strategic and actually used to feel like i was playing a form of chess, however, it feels far too fast now and almost feels chaotic, right off the bat your either losing health or winning. You have no time to think anymore and your choices seem far more limited now especially with the removal of a lot of the heroes, knights and trolls still seem to be the most broken alliances even with the removal of many of the aces yet troll warlord still remains?

The Gold system has been tweaked. You can only gain 3 max interest gold instead of 5. So saving up to 50 gold is pointless, just save up to 30 now. Plus, instead of 5 base gold they upped it to 7. Which makes saving up gold not feel as strategic as it once did.

Creep rounds are now removed and instead you fight people. Which i don't really care for since i was able to take my time and kinda see how i could better improve my guys, like seeing who i could put where or just finding the right item for the right unit. It was like a nice little pause where you could clear your head and really focus on your team comp and the alliance synergies you had going.

The Jail has been removed and replaced with a new idiotic system of flat out removing heroes for an entire season instead. The jail system worked so much better, it kept you on your toes and meant that you'd be building something different every other day which kept the game feeling fresh and prevented it from stagnating.

The new underlord system is also different, they have removed the underlord progression system in favor of a system where you reach round 10, select your underlord and then get a have a random set of perks that you wont be able to change offloaded onto you that may or may not even work well with your comp.

I sincerely hope that they either revert back to how things were prior to the update or at least introduce some sort of wild or 'Classic' mode for those that enjoyed the old style of play?

Some people like the faster pace but I hope those of us that liked the old style of taking our time to strategize don't get forgotten about, very disappointed."
6655,"While this game has its flaws and balance issues, and the novelty of the genre has worn off, I still consistently enjoy the gameplay. Considering it still hasn't had a full release, if Valve doesn't lose interest and keeps working on it - and advertises it for the final release - I think it'll have decent longevity. It'll never live up to the hype of the initial autochess genre explosion - nothing ever will, and you shouldn't expect it to - but if you look past those inflated expectations, you'll find a solid game. Personally I love to play it while tabbing out to watch or read something. It also runs well on mobile."

6661,"Gets worse with every update :<

Update Season 1:
The update is really good, BUUUUUT

developers: hmm bloodseeker is okay-ish for a tier 1 unit,
                    let's buff him so he heals whenever the unit dies (he doesn't have to kill it himself 
                    anymore)

What happens: Bloodseeker 2 star 16k dmg, any 3 tier unit 2 
                         star 5k dmg

developers: hmm that's not enough, lets make him deadeye right from the get go

What happens: bloodseeker 3 star kills your whole team no matter which shitty units ur 
                         opponent puts with him, because he just feeds on your summons (even the 
                         fking anessix minion). Every game 4 people play bloodseeker combos. Its the 
                         most ridiculous broken tier 1 ever.

developers: hmm something is wrong about bloodseeker. AHH now he doesn't lose life anymore!!!!!!

HERO CHANGES
Bloodseeker:
Bloodrage:
Now reads: As Bloodseeker's enemy's health drops, he gains attack speed, up to a maximum of 500 at [25, 30, 35]% health. Whenever Bloodseeker kills a target, he regains 35% of their max health.

HAHAHAHAHHA what are they doing????????????????????????????????
A fking tier 1 unit destroying every team comb!!

I stick with my opinion: developers never try their own changes. Even a blind player would win as long as u gave him a bloodseeker."
6662,"It wasn't as good as the original dota autochess from the beginning - there were some weird item choices and the meta was very narrow, but it became even worse with the introduction of underlords. I wish they were not at the board alongside other units or never introduced in the first place."
6663,good
6664,A challenging thinking game
6665,Fun and easy to learn!
6666,"Great, until Jull"
6667,"About a month ago, this game would've actually gotten a thumbs up in my opinion. However, I feel that the last major patch when they removed half of the units, neutered the Underlords, dismissed the neutral rounds, and kicked the jailbreak system to the curb really killed the things in the game that made it fun. Here's hoping that someone that has any say in the games development reads this and takes it to heart. Please just put it back to how it was!"
6668,Valve fucked this game up so bad with the latest big patch update. Not recommended in its current form.
6669,"The latest patch has ruined everything that I've ever enjoyed about this game.

I still feel the same. Overly cumbersome interface when trying to load the game."
6670,"As a whole I really enjoy this game and it is still changing, so I would say give it a chance. I see a lot of negative reviews of people saying it is just rng, which is not the case. Of course there is rng involved and at times it can be a problem, but in general your choices are what makes the difference in the outcomes of whether you win or lose. I really find the gameplay much more enjoyable than say Teamfight Tactics or the original Dota Autochess. It is more streamlined and there are many different modes to enjoy."
6671,EZ Clap
6672,"Knockout mode needs work, Tested through 50+ matches and displayed chances of units appearing does not match results"
6673,This game is just a throw down game. It's not much strategy just throw things together and hope you get what you need in a roll. Games are short and boring. Played about 5 games and was done with it.
6674,"Game has had it's ups and down through some pretty radical patching, but the knockout mode is particularly fun as games are quick and there are a lot of viable ways to approach the game."
6675,"They fixed it. The bullshit is out of the game. 4 heroes replaced this skill system quite well, although the randomness is still a bit mind boggling. Stupid combos were nerfed. LC can be powerful, but is not broken anymore. Blood cyka is strong early but falls of pretty rapidly. So everyhing is fine. Game is fun again.

Everyhing I wrote relates to standard games. Turbo is nothing I enjoy. It is just a crap shot version. Fast and lacks strategy. 

old review:
=====
Jull-Update-Review:

The game was great. Than the Jull Update arrived. Why they dumbed-down the game so heavily is far from understandable. They turned a strategic relaxed game with many many working combinations (forced by the  jail system) into something very dull and ""UH I READ LEDDIT AND I KNOW THE IMBA SHIT NOW"" like.

The removal of the skillable hero system is one of the worst things of this patch. Before you could decide which hero you pick and how you wanna play it. Now  you can choose at round 10. Either you are lucky and you get the good version of the hero, or the game gives you the utterly useless version. If you are lucky you get that for each of the three heroes.

The second worst thing is encouragement of the Open Fort strategy. In the Big Boss bracket at least 3 players at the start of the game chose to not put any unit on the board for at least 10 rounds. By choosing this ""Strategy"" you exchange 30 health for 10 rounds losing streak gold plus a free reroll each round. A system like that should neither be encouraged nor even be possible. I wish everyone who decides to play this style that their psu fails and sets their house on fire.

The legion commander bullshit got nerfed slightly. It is still meta, it is still broken and it still gets abused. An alliance like this should not exist. Period.

I am out. Will probably reinstall the game once a new update arrives. Historically speaking each update completely changed the game. Next time it hopefully take the right path.
"
6676,yes
6677,"Make Underlords Great, Always"
6678,"Excellent time pass game, specially on mobile device."
6679,"Fun strategy game, love the cross platform play. Does require some thinking"
6680,"DUOS: 
This game once required strategy, where complete alliance builds actually meant something, saving economy meant something, longer games which allowed you to have a comeback.

Now it's become a sudden death match with a race to how many 3s you can get and it doesn't matter what alliances you build, anything goes.

The game is so fast that you've taken away strategy, you've taken away the purpose of complete alliances, you've taken away economy, what's the point in having round 10? no one ever reaches it anyway.

Thoroughly disappointed with the latest patch. Have been playing it since day one but I think it's time to put underlords at the bottom of the list for now until you fix the game.

It's become more of a kids game more than anything. Too simple and too fast with no strategy.

Jail was fun because it provided a fresh take on what builds you can go each day. So what if it prevented tryhard noobs from going the same build every single game, it encouraged you to try something different.

If you want quick and simple games then play knockout, but don't break the game for a few nerds.

Will be back once you tweak it again. Otherwise, great game prior to this patch."
6681,"WOW EPIC GAME THANKS VALVE SO MUCH FUN GAY BEN IS SO FRICKING EPIC FOR MAKING THIS GAME WITH HIS OWN HANDS OH YEAH THANK YOU GAY BEN THIS IS SUCH AN EPIC GAME I FUCKING I MEAN FRICKING LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I WANT TO MARRY IT AND HAVE KIDS WITH IT COS AS PEOPLE SAY ""IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH, WHY DONT YOU MARRY IT?!?!?"" AHAHAHAH SUCH A FUNNY JOKE I LIKE IT. THANKS AGAIN GAY BEN YOURE SO epic"

6684,"It's a very simple game to learn, easy way to pass the time for certain."
6685,A shot of DotA for those times you don't have the time for a full cup
6686,"Great game, I love it and i am hooked. My only suggestion is to stop changing the game so radically with every update.  I get that its beta and you are trying everything out. I have been gaming forever and I have never seen a game get manhandled with every patch as hard as this one."
6687,Nice game
6688,"This whole game is about knowing some alliance combos and RNG. Pray to your gods like infinity times if u wish to play whatever combos u want. I guess ""jail"" mode was better becuz it made the game less rng and created almost no meta alliance in the game. Now this game is just totally a cancer."
6689,"Great game, worth the money."
6690,more polished version of the original
6691,goood gammmmeee
6692,Its a good game. Perfect for short stops at coffees and etc.
6693,"Fun, classic auto-battler. If you enjoy the formula of Auto Chess and TFT, and similar games, you will enjoy this one as well."
6694,"Great & addictive game!
Since the Beta, this game has only kept improving which show the devs are putting time and effort in it. I wouldn't play it for 10hrs straight like other games since each game can take quite some time to finish. Expect to lose most of your first games has there are quite a few mechanics to this game thus i recommend playing against bots which imo is still very fun. There is more strategy to this game than you can first think of..."
6695,fun.
6696,Valve should have fired the artifact team instead of having them ruin underlords too.

6709,"The most recent update has made the game unlike any autochess game, in a bad way. Gone are the days of long term strategy or switching builds when yours isn't working. Now you spend fast and if you get a bad few starting rolls you may as well abandon ship."
6710,"learning curve is huge
extremely not friendly to none-fans
time of preparing stage is too short. players don't even have enough time to read description of every token.

"
6711,"it's simple to pick up, and satisfying when you improve. I'm into dota 2 though, so i already knew all the characters. For someone coming in fresh, it might seem a little jarring. Good strategy and constant quick thinking as well. Solid A"
6712,I like the game. But I like it better before the jull update 'cause there are lots of the underlord's abilities to choose from.
6713,"It's a pretty good game so far (Jan 2020). I started playing after I played team fight tactics. This game has a few more champs. I'm not sure about the new changes they just implemented. The game may still change significantly before it comes out. There is some item RNG, but IMO it's way worse in TFT."
6714,"dota underlords so fun rALLY ITS JUST LI9KE A PVP
"
6715,it good :)
6716,Fun autochess style game. The developer is clearly attempting to keep it a) up to date and b) fun. Only time will tell the lifespan of the game
6717,+
6718,"A little of underlords, a little of alliances, unbalanced, mostly boring after some hours. Bring in more lords, alliances, units, rework random mechanics to be more friendly to players stack (this will be more fun to play if there are many options to choose from units and system will approve unique path of army building, to avoid cloning builds like these days), bring back underlords leveling like a unique feature of this product (it is good to choose a bonus creep that affects your army. but it is not an underlord anymore). IMHO overall score is 3/10"
6719,"Eh, it's alright"

6721,ja leuk
6722,Fun easy games which you can relax and play
6723,It spoil my love life.
6724,This game rivaled some of my favorites a few months ago. Now it is unbalanced and over complicated. I hope they decide to go back to how it started. After 45hrs over these past several months of enjoying this game now its towards the bottom of my list.

6755,"nice game

6756,too much bugs. play with android phone
6757,"I really liked the game and I could live with the fact that nearly every Update completely change the whole gameplay. Some of the updates were really good, a lot of ideas also were awesome, compared to Auto Chess:
- better item system
- no hp lost to creep rounds
- Underlords are a nice concept 


But the last update completely broke the fun for me:
- Underlords are picked and completely random. When you play one style of combo and you get the right Underlord, it‘s auto win - because after that you one hit everything with one ultimate.
- No Creep Rounds
- removed a lot of units (yes, they will come back)
- Unbalanced. On higher ranks everyone is trying to play the same combo. Win-Streak at the beginning is almost Auto win at the end.


But I can‘t recommened the game in this current state. It‘s not fun at all.

Jull Update - The update where we took away the fun, the tactics and made Underlords a pure gambling game."
6758,"When I was actively playing this game the meta would have huge shifts from week to week. I had to relearn everything so many times I just got fed up. It doesn't seem to be doing very well so I'm doubtful I'll ever go back. 

When autochess games initially started gaining popularity I was excited to play something strategy based, an alternative to card games. I've been pretty disappointed with them so far. They're far too RNG based, and give you too little control. I don't think this genre is going to grow past it's current popularity."
6759,niceee
6760,it good
6761,I like it.
6762,"Nice stretegy game, its good to see some new gamemodes and how the game changes from time to time to keep it fresh"
6763,"Needs a lot more information in the tutorial, tooltips and elsewhere.

Start by telling me what Armor does. No, not that it reduces damage - but how much damage *precisely* does one point of armor mitigate? If you're going to offer me the choice between X damage and Y armor I'd like to know how to make that decision, especially if decisions like that are basically the whole game and there's no mechanical component. Don't make me look it up elsewhere. You're not worth it.

Because the whole game is just decisions between units and their stats and abilities, I should be able to mouseover anything and you tell me what it does with mathematical precision. I'm not going to refer to a wiki for help. Right off the bat I feel like I have seconds to choose between units and abilities with zero information to help me make the decision. This might be fine if I could control the units myself and get a feel for them but again there is too little to this game to not give me all the information I need to feel like I'm actually participating. 

I'd wager that at some point there might be better in game information. As is, I'm just picking guys because they look cool and then watching them die. Can that even be considered a game?"

6801,yes
6802,"After playing about 10ish hours of the Jul update I have to say that my enjoyment level of the game went from an 8/10 to a 3/10 practically overnight.  

At first when the update came out it felt like an entirely new game and I was convinced I would ""get used to it"" I didn't and in fact every subsequent game I played (mostly casual) felt very random, like none of my choices mattered.  In previous patches I felt like I was the one playing with strategy and skill albeit in a very random game but it still felt fair every match I felt like my choices impacted my win or my loss and not the game playing itself saying you win or you lose this time.

that's my two cents at least"

6811,so far so good
6812,Ok
6813,"""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" - a term completely lost on valve and the developers of this game. 

Did you enjoy that mechanic? Patched out. Were you starting to appreciate a particular characters balance? Rework. Get into a particular flow of the game? Completely changed. 

This happens with every patch. Of which there are often several patches in a single WEEK! 
Bug fixes are welcome.
Unnecessary reworks and balance changes are not."
6814,"I feel that this game is making too many drastic changes to get invested. At best, just wait for a full release and see if you like. At worst, it's dead before then. Either way just play tft or battlegrounds for now."
6815,ok
6816,zzz
6817,"I was really sad that a lot of the core mechanics were changed around the ""jull-tide"" update period of development.  At this time, the game was gutted/changed to the point where it felt unrecognisable, and honestly I felt like the developers had come along and taken my favourite game away from me.  I stopped playing for ages and left an angry review.

Classic mode was added now, so thanks for doing that.  Not gonna lie though, I am still bitter about what happened."
6818,nice game to kill the time！But you still to think it over in a limited time！
6819,not a real chess

6824,Fun!
6825,Jull update made standard too fast and it feels awful. What was the point of knockout mode? Only 3 gold max so now economy is virtually useless. Feels like a cheap phone game now. Won't play anymore until changes are reverted.

6831,"A month ago, they drastically worsened the game. They removed the jail component of strategy, which forced players to adapt to changes and played off strengths and weaknesses created by the Jail system. They changed the level-up system and revamped the original two Underlords in hopes of making 'customized' play, but instead what they did was remove the personal care a player takes in crafting their army. Now the Underlord is an afterthought, with half the powers and abilities, and all the capability to feed your opponents kill counts. WHICH let's not discuss the new items, most of which are good. They add something nice to the system and feature a call to more of the familiar DOTA items fans of the MOBA game might recognize.

I think what is most distressing is that they without reason, drastically changed the game and without reason, removed all the expertise players had built up to this point a month ago. Now I can firmly say after the new year starts, I will not play DOTA Underlords ever again. I don't know why this game has changed for the worst. The developers seemed to care a lot about the game and it was getting good updates of love at the beginning. It's like CORPORATE came in and say ""THIS GAME ISN'T MOBA enough for MOBILE, reduce the learning curve, reduce the strategy element, and increase the random brutal slog.""

And now we come to the level up system, which is a pain to understand. You have THREE different ranks, one for Proto-Pass, one for Knockouts, and one for Regular Ranked. ALL OF WHICH get you not a lot of anything. HOWEVER, if for some reason you are a mid-tier player and you can't seem to get over the hurdle, it's probably because you have no idea you're playing against severely over-ranked players compared to yourself. There's no information immediately to learn when you play online, like there used to be, to learn the capability of your opponents. THIS GAME LITERALLY USES A SYSTEM THAT LIKELY FEEDS THE BEST BY FORCING THE WORST TO PLAY THEM. AWESOME.

0/100 is not the meme, but I will not play this game again. I'm sad and disappointed by the fact Undertale went from a solid 8/10 Autochess to a 0/100 MOBA Call of Duty Simulator."

6835,"The game changes a lot, which takes some getting used to, but all-in-all it's a great way to kill some time. A lot of it is luck, often times you see opponents who get a whole lot better rolls, but that's the name of the game."
6836,"RNG play big role. Sometimes you feel bad, other times you win."
6837,Ruined my life after I recovered from Dota 10/10
6838,"Really enjoyed this game before new 'knockout' mode added. Personally I prefer the standard mode however most players now are enjoying in rush knockout hence it takes forever to be matched to a standard/duos ranked game now.

Knockout is a pure RNG instead of strategy... Always, at least one of your opponents would line up a 3-star hero or 4 alliances after 1st round pick. smh."
6839,its a great game that keeps getting better and better
6840,veri gute nibbaplibba
6841,"The official Valve take on what started as a DotA2 custom map (a lot like DotA2 is the official Valve take on DotA, which started as a Warcraft3 custom map). So how does it hold up?
Not particularly well; less build variety, items still dictate 99% of the games (""Yes, this claymore is real sweet, but I could've gotten a Stonehall Cloak that would have given one of my guys about +2,000 life by the endgame. So how does +30 damage compare again?"" - and yes, both can be rolled on the first round if you're playing Knockout).
You're still reliant on rolling the guys for your composition, if you're playing Knockout and selected a team and just don't see their units for the rest of the game - tough luck. Lose a bunch of rank points.
Oh, and the game is absolutely brutal on letting you, as last place, fight first place, second place, first place, second place and then first place again to boot you out of the game. Then, the game is handling you with kid's gloves giving you all the units you need and letting you fight last place, second to last place, last place, second to last place and last place again, so you keep that win streak going and grow rich and powerful. But you're not having fun in either case; the first is frustrating, the second is boring.

So overall, meh. Unless you're playing on a Dinosaur (like I am) DotA2 Autochess is just strictly better in every possible way."

6864,"This game is really difficult to review.
In the beginning it was awesome!
Then they updated the shit out of it and it became unbalanced and strategic thinking didn't play a role anymore. It felt like you can only win with pure luck.
Now, after months of not playing and trying it out again, it still feels that way (less strategy, more luck) but for two or three matches it's still fun to play. So, if you wanna play: Go with the flow, don't think too hard and enjoy the battle with friends!"
6865,Man i love this Game :)
6866,Fun game and the devs care. Its being updated all the time.
6867,RNG
6868,very good
6869,"Before this latest, Jull-tide Greetings, update I would have easily recommended this game.  But they broke it and turned it into a HUGE RNG fest of a game.  Before there was a little bit of strategy involved, but now it is 99% RNG.  The only strategy is picking your underlord, and even then it is too much RNG because they might not have the abilities you need for your build.  It is in a terrible state right now, and the only way to wake the devs up is if people stop playing.  So NO, right now I do not recommend this game AT ALL!!"
6870,GREAT
6871,"Great game, a lot to learn though."
6872,Recommend to all !!!
6873,fun
6874,"auto chess was way more fun. I don't like how it feels so ""cramped"" due to not being able to move camera freely, it was much more fun seeing all the other boards on an open space, the way valve implemented boards make it feel cramped any annoying. Speaking of annoying: way too many balance changes that removes a huge portion of strategy. Everything positive about the game is due to Auto Chess and everything negative is due to Valve's incompetent changes. Hundreds of hours of fun in autochess, yet Underlords bores me to death after just a few rounds."
6875,relaxing game
6876,Well made.....
6877,"it good

6878,I like their frequent updates. Knockouts was the best thing added cuz normal game takes forever to finish. xD
6879,"Had to edit my review for this game.

Originally I had given it the highest of grades, however, seems this game has been abandoned and is no longer being updated.

Find a new show."
6880,One of the best strategy game and also the best chess.
6881,like
6882,"Pre Jull update I would have highly recommended this game to anyone, and had even introduced many friends to the game.
However the most recent update has ruined many aspects of the game and has become simply unfun to play. The removal of jail ensures the game will see the exact same builds every game with little to no variation. (The Jail system was a 24 hour ban list that would randomly ban x amount of pieces so they could not be found in game. It would prevent you from going the same build day after day, and was a fantastic way to keep the game fresh.) Yes you can win with unmeta comps, that is how pvp games often go, especially one that is this heavy on rng. However, there is little to no incentive now to play any comp other than meta ones. Might as well fill out an excel sheet, because thats what the game has turned into. I sincerely hope Valve re-adds the jail system, along with reverting: 1) Gold/Income changes (the new gold system promotes you to rush to max interest more than the old system because it is less of a commitment now to get to the max interest threshhold, which gives the player less variety in what they can do), 2) The Underlord Changes (Getting a random underlord with a random set up at wave 10 is garbage. Why would I want to be forced into picking something I do not want, especially when you are not forced to pick up certain pieces... well atleast you were not forced to before, now if you ignore meta picks you are a fool.), and 3) the lack of neutral rounds (The neutral rounds acted as a way to build up the comp you were thinking of going in the beginning, and later acted as mini landmarks to give a sense of progression in a game. Now its just a memebrawler where you just throw pieces around hoping shit sticks until later rounds, which is not engaging or strategic.) 
All in all this game is not worth playing unless they revert the jull-tide garbage. Pre-Jull 10/10, Post-Jull 4/10 at best."
6883,Not as good as the original mini game in Dota
6884,"very good game to play

Edit: Game is still stupid, client frequently freezes right before a round, forcing me to restart the application."
6890,"Imagine happiness, what it feels like, now, stop pretending and play Underlord."
6891,Really fun turn based game!
6892,WHAT A DUMB GAME!!!!!!!
6893,I could say this could be potentially the best auto chess game in the genre. Valve's keep updating it frequently and listening to user feedback. Also you could play it at mobile thats a big plus for me.
6894,Game is good.
6895,"Jull update removed most of what I enjoyed about the game to flatten it and remove a lot of the skill. essentially before you had to make a conscious decision to hold money, for longer, and time your buy-ins. now the money is capped lower and you're just spamming RNGesus to build up units. More democratic, less skillful, less fun."

6901,"The best auto chess battler out there in my opinion because of the vast amount of toons available and the crazy amount of builds possible. I'm not sure how I feel about the underlords themselves yet but I do think they bring a level of depth that the game was lacking early in it's lifecycle. Recently they have made efforts to shorten the games average length which is a positive and removed some the downtime/boring moments where your just battling AI. Overall this game is very fun and easy to get into. They have plans to rotate several characters each ""season"" which will keep the game fresh and fun as long as they can keep it balanced. Would very much recommend to anyone looking for a strategy game in this genre."
6902,too easy

6910,free good fun :) its addictive lol.
6911,"Dota Underlords is still developing. And it is getting better and better.

A simple table-top-like simulation game where strategy and luck is at play. It is like Chess and Poker combined. You have to make the most out of what you draw while other players do the same.

The multitude of heroes and items and Underlords makes the game very complex. But due to the randomness of draws, Alliances encourages players to stick to their plans. Building prominent game metas such as Knight-Troll and Brawny-Inventor. What makes the game beautiful is that the player's creativity can always beat metas. It has the elements of luck, after all.

The graphics are clean, yet combats are wonderfully violent. The interface is quite intuitive. There is still a lot more room to grow. And we can only expect Dota Underlords to be better.

EDIT:
Season 1 has come and the devs decided to kill some major metas and heroes and introduced new alliances. I am expecting to see the full roster of Dota heroes, but I guess it ain't happening this first season of the game.

The graphics and game play are still great, but its kind of hard to adopt to the game changes. The Battlepass is cool and exciting at first, but the effect isn't as fulfilling as that of DOTA 2. I wish all things achieved in Protopass will be carried in Season 1. It's disappointing to have all the time invested in beta stage will only be rewarded with few dull cosmetics.

I hope to have a more customizable Underlord, and maybe heroes. Underlords still have a long way to go and a lot to improve. But the potential is there. The adaptation from DOTA 2 is too huge and there are a lot more heroes to include.

As of now, the game is a balance mix of fun and competition. It is not as fun as DOTA 2, but is also not as frustrating as well."
6912,"Addictive and frequently updated. The game can change dramatically from week to week depending on what the devs are trying out, so be prepared to learn new systems."
6913,Great combination of strategy yet face paced gameplay
6914,"I'm old now, and this game is more fun to play than most others even though I still lose most matches. 4/10, highly recommend."
6915,"This is a really interesting game for first 10 hours, where everything is fresh and new. However, when you try to get deep into the game, you will realize this game's core mechanic is fundamentally flawed. The core idea of rng team building game leaves the player out of control; the micro-economy feature slows the game pace; and lack of comeback mechanic decentivizes player to continue playing the game if they cannot reach certain criteria. 

RNG per round - pure RNG games have a fundamental issue, there's not much control in player's hand if you are unlucky or facing someone really lucky.

Micro-Economy - This is a really interesting concept, you get interest based on the gold you have reserved; and you will need to spend the gold if we want to get better team. However, the always go to strategy is always save the gold until it reaches the cap, then slowly spending it. The micro-economy idea just postpones the entire game into a slower paced. 

Comeback Mechanic - Dota Underlords introduced a really interesting comeback mechanic into the game, offering the losing player a free re-roll. However, after hours of gameplay, the re-roll offered was nothing comparable to the winning streak benefit. Eventually, this have the same flaw as the original auto chess game: if you cannot get winning streak by X turn, just quit. There's no way you can comeback from it. 

Balance Issue - Every continuous updated game have this issue, balancing multiple axis is very very difficult. This results in a competitive game, there's only certain meta. Combining with a fixed pool and rng feature, if you cannot get the current meta pieces, you are in a huge disadvantage. 

 Overall, I would say this is a fun game for the first couple hours. However, not so fun if you are trying to get deep into the game."
6916,"The game is bad.

>Plays game for 1023 hours."
6917,Devs seem to have no direction. Constant poor updates to shake up the game to stem the bleeding.
6918,"The game used to be really fun and was going in a good direction up until the most recent update. It was moderately paced, tactical, varied and ultimately just a great way to relax and have fun. They even added a quick knock out mode for those with limited time or patience (not my cup of tea but a nice option to have). Since the update however, the following changes have been made which in my opinion ruin the game:

>The game used to have a huge variety of units, which rotated on a daily basis. Now instead they've decided to remove a large number of the units semi-permanently, with the aim to change things up on a 'seasonal' basis, leading to a stale, predictable meta and some of the most fun units no longer in the game.

>The game used to have neutral rounds vs AI monsters which rewarded loot items. The first 3 were essentially for drafting purposes while some of the later rounds were quite hard to beat. This was a really cool feature as it gave you a chance to review your team comp and positioning without stressing about losing health. These rounds added a nice flow to the game and I was hoping they would be expanded over time, with additional monsters added and randomised on a game by game basis to add a bit more variety. However, they have been entirely removed. Loot is awarded sparsely throughout the game, every round is a fight with other players, and the initial drafting takes place in a single round from a single selection of heroes and is far less tactical and fun. 

>Round time seems to have been reduced, leaving very little time to think and make tactical decisions between rounds. Furthermore, the maximum interest gained on unspent gold has been reduced and gold gain has been increased, removing a layer of economic strategy.

>Underlord units (a 1 per team commander type unit) previously levelled up throughout the game and provided talent choices which hugely impacted the way that they played. Since the update, you get given a selection of 3 random underlords at round 10 with predetermined talents and skills. While choosing at round 10 isn't the worst idea (allows a tactical choice based on team comp), removing talents and just providing a random selection makes these units feel far less unique and fun, and removes a significant amount of strategy from the game. In their current state the game is probably better off without them."
6919,bad update
6920,Its like Skyrim but with underlords.
6921,"Extremely fun game to play. The only downside is that some of the 'tribes' seem to not be very balanced, and matchmaking can suck at times. However, this is a small part of the game in my opinion."
6922,Done 40 hours in a week... great game but I need a break!
6923,good
6924,"Casual, competetive, and fast paced."
6925,fun

6929,"Very nice

6930,Very sucks new update(jull-tide Greetings) using coin/leval for win no need to keep coin for 50 coins end in 15-20 min
6931,"Edit: So I have played this quite a bit, giving it the chance it deserves and the reality is it isn't fun. The changes don't happen fast enough so the meta is stale within 2 weeks and then everyone is fighting for the only 2-3 playable builds. I get the feeling they don't care about the PC side of this. it looks, feels and plays like a mobile game. I believe that is their audience."

6942,"To me, this is like Dota's version of Hearthstone Battleground. Not so intuitive in mechanics."
6943,"Game is boring. Lacks cool archetypes, and every run feels like youre looking for the same build. Like some of the systems in the game, but the underlords themselves feel terrible.  Honestly the in game auto chess was much better than this game. I played the game for the dota heroes and it feels like barely any are in the game."
6944,"nice game and require more hero and synergy
"
6945,"With the latest update, yes I'm bandwagoning on that, this game just isn't enjoyable to me anymore. The thing is I think the game is fine as it is right now, but from a personal perspective it's moved away from what I enjoyed with the latest updates. I liked the slow-paced build up. The slow crescendo as you build your team and manage the damage you're recieving. The direction the dev-team is heading this is a fast-paced 'pick quickly' while also knowing how everything works together while keeping in mind what your enemies are doing. So, for a mobile game, this is perfect. Fast, frenetic, responsive.

I'm on the side where the Jail was a great idea. Underlords was a game I checked in on every once in a while and if some op team choice was mandatory due to jail, I'd just skip to the next day. I enjoyed picking talents, fighting neutrals, slowly building up my team. It's very much akin to constructing a sandcastle and seeing whether it can weather the storms of the other competing bullies around. Now it feels more like a teacher is telling me to quickly construct anything before she declares it open season, oh wait, round one is open season.

6953,Pretty good since it has offline modes

6962,"Noice game, 10/10 would say fuck to RNG."
6963,"Underlords is easy to get into, but hard to master. In order to be successful you'll have to get the RNG to work in your favor. Having played Dota 2 beforehand is not a requirement, but it sure is useful. Great OST, interesting characters and it's available on mobile where it works much better than I initially expected. So far there's a total of 3 underlords to choose from, but as that number increases so will the strategies."

GOOD Luck"
6975,"Latest update is extremely disappointing - removed talenting of Underlords (now it's one of two preselected ability loadouts which will be offered to you at random round 10) and the replacement of a daily hero rotation with a seasonal one = less individual choice and more dependence on RNG, and a stagnant meta."
6976,"The most recent update to the game killed all the fun for me personally, so I'm no longer going to recommend it. I liked being able to pick my underlord and their talents/ult ability. I think having them be randomized is stupid and just adds another level of rng to the game where it didn't need it while simultaneously removing something that gave it a little personal touch of control. 

The removal of the neutral loot rounds might be speeding things up, but I valued the rounds and really dislike their removal. They were good mark points during the match to assess yourself between games as well as watch others. I think they might have just needed a tweak instead of being removed, because it should be more like a goal of only 50/50 pass rate for the people in the match to pass the rounds so that it keeps things interesting and potentially a power boost to the builds that do well on certain rounds. 

The current system of ""rotation"" has changed from a daily jail to something of a seasonal rotation as I understand it. As a result, some of the alliances/units were flat out removed from the game for the current ""season"" of activity. I think this is ridiculous in a game that is formatted like this. I get the idea of the daily jail making certain builds and metas have to adjust on a day to day basis, and maybe that should have been tempered to reflect more of what people were heavily picking better than a random assortment. However, in a game like this the diversity of the builds and options are what makes it fun and gives great strategic draw. If there is a concise pool of units that won't be changing for the whole season, then there will only be meta gaming going on and that's the sort of action that ruins the fun of making choices."
6977,All around great game.
6978,"THis game is fun, however it is hard to follow casually. There are constant patches and a learning curve that doesn't make sense. I often find myself being in the lead for 4/5 rounds and then immediately losing the next 14. THere isn't enough feedback to help a player learn what is optimal without playing constantly"

7011,"You've broken it (Dec. 2019)

Please bring the jail back."
7012,"I would recommend the version of this game pre-The Jull update.

I started playing the game in beta and had a lot of fun learning the mechanics and strategy, and would enjoy the frequent gameplay and model updates each week. It was honestly what kept me coming back week after week. There was always something new!

The latest big update changed the game too much and without warning, however, and it plays like a completely different game. It relies entirely too much on RNG and there is considerably less time to think about the alliances you are going to build. 

BlameMyPartner wrote up an excellent review highlighting all the changes to the game and I agree with every single one of his points. If the devs implemented a slower gameplay mode similar to the update before they introduce Jull I would come back in a second, but for now I'm done with this game. 

Just a note to the devs if they read this: you guys did an awesome job building a really clever strategic thinker that balanced skill and RNG in a fun and addicting way, and I want you all to know the early builds of the game were my favorite. Thank you for a fun gaming experience this summer. I'll never forget what this game was!"
7013,"Great fun, get into it!

7015,"While it's still tinkered with, it's barely a game right now. Your influence on the outcome is very limited. Every round is a prayer to RNG. It's also addictive like a slot machine."
7016,"Намного лучше чем autochess и teamfighttactics. Несмотря на элемент рандома, в перспективе все зависит от твоих способностей. Очень приятный глазу дизайн, опять же, чего не скажешь о выше перечисленных играх"
7017,good
7018,not as much maggot gooks on here as there is on dota 2 an theres no chat so the sad cunt gooks cant open their mutt infested mouths
7019,Its good but I think It just needs more variety. The matches kinda start to seem the same after a while
7020,"An excellent game, both for the casual and serious gamer alike."
7021,"It used to be my favourite game from starting when released in June but now the game is so much different from the original auto battler concept. Now after the Jull update i.e their new underlord the game is not playable to me anymore, no more loot rounds meant less time to think. Its sad to see that the auto battler concept born in DOTA 2's custom game and underlords its own core auto battler is totally different. Sometimes too much changes can lead to confusion.  I dont mean to offend anyone here as there are many people who like these changes but its a matter of perception though. I had played all the top auto battlers DOTA UNDERLORDS, AUTO CHESS & TEAM FIGHT TACTICS. AUTO CHESS is closest to the auto battler concept as it is made by the original creators of this concept i coundnt play it much as it had many game breaking bugs and still lacked polish . Underlords is the game most far away from the concept, each update took its concept far from the original one but its the most polished game among the three and its also more accesible as it has cross platform with mobile. TFT is somewhat a hybrid and i have shifted to it its the most enjoyable auto battler among the three for me. The most appreciable thing about Underlords is it is the most polished among the three and the KO mode is very much enjoyable to play. Although i dont like underlords anymore but still then i recommend to try all the three auto battlers as all are free. Try all the three for yourself and see which one is to your liking....."
7022,good game
7023,Knock-out mode is a great features for busy person like me. love the game!
7024,"What I liked was the game before this patch, regardless of how unbalanced it might have been sometimes. There was a direction, it was a strategy game, a very complex one. When the 'Primordials Patch' came, it was unbalanced and boring, but playable. Now it's unplayable. Now it's slots. Whoever gets upgrades first wins. You can stay with 20, 30 gold till the end, doesn't matter anymore. Synergies? Meh, everything kinda works together because everyone relies on upgrades. The whole community went nuts, they all asked for a rollback and for a further ignore of the reddit group by the developers. What did the developers do? Came up with an update nerfing Hobgen and... that's it. So until further notice, I would never recommend this game to anyone who actually wants to strategize and win in a fair way in any game. There is a better one: TFT. Till they roll back, that's what I recommend."
7025,simple
7026,enjoy the game w/ out preasure :D
7027,I play League of Legends and this is better than their version (TFT). No item stacking and more diverse situations makes the game less stale and more fun.
7028,"I LOVE this game seriously. Probably play this as much as i played ESO. The devs are great and always updating shit, its competetive, hard to master. Fun with friends, it defenitely is not something you can jump into and be good. it takes research and knowing your shit and it makes it fun for experienced players, you get a sense of accomplishment from winning every game too."
7029,love it.
7030,Good Game especially if you wanna just spend some time while waiting. :)
7031,"God DAMN I love this game. Valve has been knocking it out of the park with communication and bugfixes, and this game really comes off as a labor of love for them. There are a bunch of different viable builds and comps, so theory crafting is always fun, and the different game modes are all great in their own right. Hop in with a friend or play by yourself. A lot of people complain about the the different iterations of the game, but i really have enjoyed all of them, so take that with a grain of salt."
7032,it's neat
7033,Best version of autochess aka RNG: The Game.
7034,"Yes, a lot of chess :v that is automatic"
7035,fun
7036,Valve seems to love RNG games which need little to no imagination in creativity and are repetitive and boring
7037,"Interesting game, more polished and smooth than most other Dota chess / chess-style games and definitely cool for being totally canon with the Dota universe. Underlords addition weakened the game a bit since it detracted from unique hero builds and made battles more one sided, but in consequence allows for players who are behind to catch up better than previously. This game will receive a TON of updates, since it is run by valve, the money making machine, and you can be sure they will add new heros as they are added to Dota2 moba game. Completely free to play, although I posture that microtransactions may make their way into the game."

It had so much promise..."

7051,It's constantly updated.  Feels like a newer better game every few weeks.  Much better than League's version.
7052,Wish this had more support.
7053,The game is good. They have added a bunch of new content from the time that I initially started playing up until now.
7054,"This game has been changing constantly. This is a revised review which is more on the positive side (previously I stated how much RNG created issues with creating good squads) & this has largely been balanced. Ongoing balancing focuses on increasing the # of feasible options and getting more players to Level 10 (10 heroes+ underlord on the board)

Deciding to roll for upgrades or to add levels *is and should* be a tactical decision, but the strongest decision is going to be based on what alliances you can create. If you aren't used to auto chess games (as I was starting with DU) its going to take some time to understand alliance synergies, the best status affects and which underlord to roll. DON'T WORRY!! Spend the time to learn it and you will get better and improve your game performance. This isn't a game where you always stomp start to finish; sometimes you will lose rounds consistently then get the right roll, then reverse. Its an excellent game you can pick up once in a while and feel like you are getting sommewhere.


Works well on Galaxy S8, Windows tablets. Some earlier tablet models (android) I've tried out on appear to have memory leak issues & struggle when there are a lot of particle effects going on. If i'm commuting and killing time with a bot match, shutting down the game & any non crucial processes makes it perform MUCH better."

7058,"The hull update is the worst thing to happen to Underlords. So much removed, so much nerfed. On top of that the new underlords system is just terrible."
7059,Jull Patch destroyed this previously brilliant game. Dumbed down now to rng. 12 hours into Jull and still hard to believe how much a patch has ruined this game. The tempo of the game is gone. The creep rounds and the ridiculous fast battles have killed it.
7060,omg omg omg this is like a game if you played games before and like playing games it is the game for you. Do you like playing games and using units to do stuff with then this is the game for you!!! do you like playing games and playing games with other people then this is the game for you!!! do you like watching the movie mars attacks? then awesome.
7061,"Constantly being updated and improved. New game modes offer a variety of options including quick games that get right into the action, or the more traditional, slower-paced and tactical mode. All in all, it's come a long way since beta and has improved immensely."
7062,yay co.op
7063,"After looking at old videos from 2019, the game seems to have devolved quite a bit. Personally, I find the older UI better looking, but that's not the major thing. 

The game has become so simple. Back in July 2019-pre end of August, we had IMO the best build for Underlords. 

Creep rounds, fail for worse items, succeed for better. 3 item choices. The items were much more interesting and fleshed out, unit kills for gold, helm of the undying for some armour and unkillable for three seconds, early desolator and more. 

We also had passive items at this time. Smuggler, increased the level of the items you could choose from, another one gave you an extra item to choose from. Others, affected entire alliances such as Dragon's Hoard which gave 3% extra damage per gold you had for the Dragon alliance. Also had other tactical fun stuff such as Desperate Measures which increased damage for missing health on the player.

Rounds lasted much longer, no 3 star meta. The meta was level 9-10, not level 5 roll for 3 stars as it is now. It was often quite rare for three stars to be in your build, as alliance bonuses, items and high tier units made a huge difference. 3 star sniper with MoM was bae. 

Ace units are gone, tier 5 units which gave bonuses to the entire alliance, making them the final end level piece for your build. RIP Troll Warlords glory days.

Most of this have been removed rather than changed, they did some changes to alliances instead of just completely removing the passive items but removed the tactical aspect of it. Those items could even make you go for that alliance in the game, being a tactical turning point for you. 

Even the underlords have been over simplified, rather than having skills to choose from on different levels, they just get a loadout instantly.

The game has been so simplified that it's so obviously a ""Oh, I want to play for a little bit before bed""-game. 

Looking at videos from early 2019 and thinking they look like an upgrade is not good.

TL;DR: Most things in the game has been removed or simplified. Degradation of the game rather than improvement. I have no clue what the devs were/are thinking."
7064,"This game was by far the best Autochess for the last 3 month since the introduction of the jailsystem and underlords. It gave hard interesting strategic choices with the underlords+talents and forced the player to adapt to an ever changing game environment thanks to the hero jail.

Sadly, all the things that made it stand out over its competitors have been removed in addition to significantly reducing the impact of economy.
Since the latest patch a gutted dumbed down version of underlords is the only thing that remains.
I guess they are trying to appeal to the mobile audience, but with this update the PC version can't compare to the other autochess games which it previously outshinded.
(Just make knockout the standard mobilemode and let pc gamers play the original)"
7065,"The game was quite fun, after the roller coaster that was e.a. for this game, but now is filled ( at least in ranked) with cheaters and hackers. people with 6 lvl 3 characters between the duo teammates at round 6, with 30 gold each. impossible things happening, and when you spectate them, you see their gold just climbing for no reason, and the only way to report is to sit through 20 mins of waiting, watching hackers hacking. no point in playing anymore. Sad, cause it was fun that me and my gf could  enjoy."
7066,NC chess
7067,"At first I really liked this game, however the last update just turned this game around 180 degrees. 
It made the game way too fast and way to much dependent on luck. Before this update you had a mix of different ""alliances"" you could play, so different strategies where possible. Especially as the game got into the late game. Now with this update, you just can't do that. You are forced to choose between 2-3 Strategies and hope that you get the right pieces. No diversity, way too much luck involved and just unfun. It's a shame."
7068,The game started very plain as chess. now has a completely different beauty and origin.
7069,good
7070,"The new patch is less enjoyable compare to other patch before the new underlord come (jull or whatever his name). If you want to remove the jail please nerf some allience (like warlord, scappy, insert) or come up with other alternative to (like jail) to change the pace of the games."
7071,"this game is very good if u want to play some strategy and mind game stuff
"
7072,das is gut
7073,strategy was great and the new update and adjustments just loved it even more
7074,"Very enjoy .. . . but, I really want to have Ban heroes function back in the game. i thought it's very challenging to play not like newest patch."
7075,awesome probably one of the best auto chess or is the best auto chess out there
7076,nice game
7077,"just like dota, it came out of arcade, has chinese version"
7078,trash
7079,good
7080,"It's amazing how quickly Valve has tanked this game. There were a sharp few months where it was a lot of fun, but now Valve's gotten into the same issue that ruined Dota 2 - making weird sweeping changes without rhyme or reason, leaving you playing an entirely different game every few months, or even weeks, where lack of testing or consideration allows certain strategies to run rampant uncontested. There was always an element of luck in Underlords, but now the game is so absurdly based on random chance that there's little point in playing rounds out. Every change makes it worse. Avoid."
7081,.
7082,nice game
7083,The best modern role model for a genre defining game. Fast updates always keep the game fresh. A type of strategy game which is equally fun to play on phones. IT'S FREE. THERE AREN'T EVEN MICROTRANSACTIONS YET. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
7084,"This game is extremely addicting, can play for hours trying new alliances and different stuff, HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
7085,Yes.
7086,Undertaker
7087,"This game just keeps getting worse as the developers have gone totally around the bend in making tweaks that make the game no fun to play.  No matter how carefully you build your team you will eventually lose not for lack of skill or bad luck - because the developers decided what the game really needed was a, ""Land War in Asia"" mode.  A successful player will be capped at a team of four.  Less successful players will be able to grow their team to 8 or more slots.  The skilled player will eventually be overrun.  After a few more losses he will start adding slots to grow his team, but he's at a disadvantage because the player with 8 slots is improving his team faster than the skilled player is adding slots.  The only way to win the game is to manage losses to grow your roster.

There's also a luck element.  If you start the game with a bad draw of characters YOU LOSE.  Originally, players would draw one character in each of three rounds before having to play against another player.  Now you select the best three out of five characters in one round.  If you're only offered first-level characters you're going to lose to the player who draws two second-level characters EVERY TIME!  Unless you like losing you're better off just starting over if you're offered a bad draw.

Starting over would be bad enough but the navigation is clunky and there's no way to quickly restart the game if you find yourself in a bad situation.  The developers have apparently never played a fun game before and spend their time either making the game less fun to play or focusing on things most players don't care about like letting them choose a non-aligned character in round 10."
7088,"
was kind of fun before the most recent patch Jull tide.  Made the games really dumb."
7089,Fun and Awesome!
7090,"The new patch removed a lot of the strategy of the game. Talents for underlords let me customize my build more, having some breathing room between rounds let me plan my build around my foes, everything is so fast now. The jail was great, I don't know why they removed it. Removing the creep rounds was a good choice but everything else was a step in the wrong direction.  I'll update my review if it improves but right now I don't enjoy playing anymore."
7091,good for ur health
7092,Fun game.. need to add varieties of heroes and maybe new class??
7093,like
7094,"I really enjoyed the game until the Jull update. The game previously required pacing yourself and being thoughtful on your build as you determine what's available to you. I compare pre-Jull to a well-made thriller movie. It suspensefully builds throughout the movie until the climax of the end-scene. 

Now it just seems like it’s an RNG based fast paced mess designed for a generation of players with an ever-shorter attention span. Once intricate alliances and builds are being simplified and characters previously loved dropped entirely. This all occurring as a new host of items are added and others removed. The sad thing is there was already a mode already designed for quick games. 
Additionally, rather than just including a new starting Underlord (Jull) in the existing format which allowed you to grow with it as you play it more, the existing Undelords were taken away and instead you're given an RNG mixed bag option of Underlord-ability mid game. Another feature removed was the Jail (that banned random characters for a day) which use to challenge individuals and keep each day fresh and unique was also removed.

I cannot find the possibility that the game designers included any player feedback in for this game altering Jull patch. Its aftermath leaves me very unlikely to return to a game I and my friends very much loved."
7095,"200+ hours, still pretty fun"
7096,It´s good.
7097,Great game - knockout mode is a blast to play and a round usually takes no more than 15 minutes
7098,Zach is terrible at this fucking game
7099,Still garbage. Concept of autochess is just dead to me. HS battlegrounds is way better
7100,wtf is this update
7101,Стаа
7102,Why bother to update this garbage game
7103,
7104,Good game
7105,上瘾、爽！
7106,thumbs up
7107,I hate it. It makes me so mad. Sometimes I want to punch my monitor. I had to go get blood pressure meds because of this game. I highly recommend it.
7108,"Fun and very chill game, fun singleplayer and with people."
7109,"recent Jull update kinda killed it for me, feels like the new gameplay should've been a different mode"
7110,NICE GAME FOR BRAIN. ONLY FOR PLAYER WHO HAVE BRAIN AND MENTAL
7111,"Game is definitely fun, but it keeps changing drastically because it's still in the early stages. With the proper feedback from the community and Valve's team, I think it has potential to attract new players and solidify it's position in the auto-chess realm. To keep it simple, I think it is definitely worth a try. Watching streams really helps with improving your game."
7112,00
7113,i was really enjoying play the game until the jull update. yes you must put more underlords in but you removed the skills choice from underlods which i found really enjoyable (also the effort to unlock all the skills in the underlords was for nothing it seems) you removed some heroes for no reason at all and you removed the neutrals which was a good break to save some gold. you made a huge change with the last update and you ruined my experience with it!!! i really hope you fix it.
7114,"Pros: It's like Dota

Cons: It's like Dota"
7115,just try
7116,amazing game
7117,"I loved this game, but JULL patch ruined gaming experience. 10/9 --> 10/1 nice patch i deleted game..."
7118,"DotA Underlords has incredibly satisfying gameplay.  Unlike your typical competitive shooter or MOBA, this genre does a great job of keeping you engaged, even when you are losing terribly.  Underlords trumps competitors like AutoChess and LoL Tactics by removing a lot of the elements that make the genre rather clunky and slow.

The new Knockout format is a breath of fresh air.  You can get more matches in less time.  It's way more satisfying than the usual mechanics you expect in this space.  Upgrades happen faster and you really notice the impact from changing up your team comps.

Like most entries in this category, there are some serious balancing issues.  Some comps are just drastically better than others.  I'd like to see more RPS and less ""meta""...  That said, even with glaring lopsidedness, this is a really fun game.  Give it a real go - it will grow on you!

Also, now that there are actual underlord options to provide generals on the field, the game has really opened up.  Previously, they were not even in the game, but now we have some great options for suiting different playstyles.  A little more tweaking and we'll see some unconventional game play options and a whole lot more variety.

Really digging this game... And it's multitasking friendly so that is inherently better! ;o)"
7119,.
7120,WTF! I WANT TO PLAY DOTA UNDERLORDS BUT THERE'S A MISSING FILE AF!!!!
7121,fun stuff
7122,"Very fun game, full of good old dota characters and awesome game mecanics, need more characters and new things that makes it more interesting"
7123,good gane
7124,good
7125,"Great game, pretty addictive!"
7126,i love this game
7127,"Loved this game before major updates hit. Use find it simple, relaxing and rewarding for making right decision in game. But now it become a cluster of different mechanic not meshing well/overly complicated, difficult to make come back and poor pacing."
7128,"Since its latest update Underlords is definitely my favorite ""Draft"" style game!"
7129,OK
7130,"this game is for autists and idiots, best to be left as the equivalent of back ground noise the video game."
7131,"Really fun game to play! Has a learning curve like all Dota games, but it's free and well made. I recommend it."
7132,+
7133,"Game actually improves and more than once a ""season""."
7134,Its really fun and great
7135,1212
7136,This game was good when it was released but it has steadily declined in quality.
7137,"For me the best auto battler :) Jailing system is pretty cool, aliances are all interesting and pretty viable and bz far the best thing is he Duo mode!"
7138,"The Jull-patch killed the game, totally in the wrong direction. Impossible to balance and bad game design"
7139,"Since coming back, it's pretty good"
7140,"Very fun, and engaging. Surprisingly high skill ceiling."
7141,"Best autochess so far. TFT has a long way to go as far as ease of understanding, balance, and gameplay is concerned"
7142,Fantastic strategy game. Devs are working really hard and updating frequently. Looking forward to what is yet to come
7143,
7144,"I don't know why I enjoy this game so much, If you like bejeweled and having something to click on while watching YMH highlights, this could be for you. I give it 5 gold coins and a Big-Time Contract with my soul as collateral"
7145,So they made few cool things and scrapped them all few patches later? Nice nice.
7146,"A fantastic entry in the very infant auto-chess genre. The addition of Ranked Duos and experimental nature of Valve changing things up keeps me eyeing the updates and trying things out!

In the latest December 2019 update, the game's pacing has gotten a bit faster than it probably should- However, the large hitboxes of units, transparency and ease of learning abilities, alongside the high level of visual and audio differentiation help a lot.

What started off as a game too similar to the original Auto-Chess seemingly has found its own identity and is pushing forward fearlessly. There are definite ups and downs to some changes, but as a whole- Underlords is moving in a positive direction and the variety of modes has also been great fun to tinker with."
7147,It's a little easier game than Auto Chess. It's a little bit of pleasure. So you don't need to know the characteristics of the characters. I would definitely recommend playing Dota 2. Because it has more successful graphics and gameplay than League of Legends.
7148,"Spent a great time with this game, devs working on updates almost every 14 days and game. Prolly best autochess at the moment."
7149,This game changed constantly before my eyes with every update and I think that when they have a fine collection of Underlods it will be in it's full potential.
7150,"This game is game of the year 2019 for me cause it is easy, does not require asian skill to play like the normal dota and since Knockout mode came out a few weeks ago I can play for 20 mins each game. Really addicting and highly recommended."
7151,yes i like
7152,Nice Game.
7153,!
7154,"The new patch made this game a pure RNG fest. 
Way too fast paced with less hp units, and without creep rounds. This is good only for mobile players whose want to play something fast. So sad.
Alliances barely matters anymore. One thing matters, push to 3 star units fast. (Which makes druids so powerful)
Jail system was completely fine, pushed players to adapt new situations....
Random Underlords system is just RNG again. Mindless.
If you have luck at the first 7-10 rounds you won the game. At this state I can't recommend.
"
7155,pretty good game
7156,"Great game, the devs release updates and hotfixes constantly updating the game and tweaking the gameplay experience. I don't play Dota nor like that style of game and really enjoy this.

If you like strategy games this is a good one."
7157,wow
7158,"good game
"
7159,"keeps improving from time, more updates to come"
7160,New update so fucking trash
7161,Good germ.
7162,easy game
7163,"really bad and disappointing update, making this neither funny nor strategic.
it would be much better if heroes are banned weekly instead of by day.
in 'autochess' like game, every player shares the same decision space, there is no IMBALANCE due to prison stuff or what."
7164,goog
7165,so hard
7166,"Good twist on the Auto Chess genre. The Duo modes really makes this version stand out compared to games like TFT. Hard to learn, difficult to master."
7167,The auto-chess to beat them all.
7168,"I would have rated this a 5 star game until this ridiculous jull update that completely changed the game for the worse.  They are ruining the strangely addictive formula of Dota Auto Chess. ADD to the game, DON'T try to FIX what ISN'T BROKEN."
7169,something about something
7170,"i u suck at dota 2, then play this awesome shit"
7171,fuck this game honestly
7172,"every update make this game better, fun to play"
7173,"It's Free

That being said, it's undergone changes since I started...it's becoming a 'Clicker' game more than a strategy game.
If that's what you're into, you'll probably like it."
7174,"I feel like the current update dumbs the game down way too much. Jail made it where you had to get creative on alliance comps. And they took it away. Straight to level five without being able to really plan out a good comp and item builds. No more creep mobs make it feel like the game is all battle. Quick battles. I like the original standard mode because it was longer and more drawn out. If I wanted (or needed) a quick game I’d play knockout. This current update make the game kinda boring and bland. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but before the Jull update."
7175,"idk man kinda confusing dudez
"
7176,"Chill fun game for everyone
"
7177,"Greeting new Underlord, If you are looking for strategy game, this is your choice. You gonna get a ton of different experiences in game play. Let me classified this pro and con with my EXP:
Pro:
-Great art work
-Resources management
-Tactical positioning
-Absolutely different game play in each match
Con:
- Massively absorbing your life

"
7178,Game was great new update removed all soul
7179,Jull Update ruined anything unique about this game and fun. Find alternatives that do better than this game is now trying to be.
7180,you can use gas station and elon musks tesla cars to burn em
7181,Since the last patch the game not only crashed a lot but seems completely different from what it was at the beginning.  It also seems like the Devs are unsure about where they're going with this game as after every major patches the game changes almost entirely.  I was shocked when they added the Underlords unit and now the new patch seems to have removed them at the beginning and you get them later in the game.  It's getting confusing and to be honest I'm getting tired of re-learning the concept of the game over and over.
7182,nice game
7183,okok
7184,"If you like the auto chess type of games then this is a good one to play,
few points i like:
- Bot games
- Works offline
- Cross Play with mobile and progress cares over.
- Constant updates ( some change the game a lot )

give it a try :)"
7185,"Sei la, bom eu acho.
"
7186,free game no bitching
7187,Feeling like life is not fair enough? Underlords takes it to the next level. 9/10
7188,Keep the updates comin'!
7189,new update ruined the game. Everything goes way too fast.
7190,"Keeps getting better. This is how you do early access. Starting with fewer features, putting out quality builds and adding solid, new features over time, based on feedback and game performance."
7191,so ez for me
7192,"I was really enjoying this game until the Jull update. I enjoyed the slower paced more strategic thinking of the normal mode. Now it feels too fast, right off the bat your either losing health or winning. Not much time to just think. If you want faster paced matches isn't that what Knockout mode is for?

The Gold system has been tweaked. You can only gain 3 max interest gold instead of 5. So saving up to 50 gold is pointless, just save up to 30 now.  Plus, instead of 5 base gold they upped it to 7. Which makes saving up gold not feel as strategic as it once did.

Creep rounds are now removed and instead you fight people.  Which i dont really care for since i was able to take my time and kinda see how i could better improve my guys, like seeing who i could put where or just finding the right item for the right unit. 

Jail is also removed. At first, I hated the jail because i had an alliance that was always my go to but sometimes my units would be end up in jail not allowing me to have that alliance. Later on though, I actually started to enjoy the jail system because it allowed and forced me to rethink strategies and try out new alliances.

The new underlord system is also different, instead of choosing which perks or powers you give your underlord you just choose which Underlord you want at round 10 and theyll have a random set of perks that you wont be able to change.

I really wish they would revert to the previous update. It was much more enjoyable.

Alot of people seem to enjoy this update, but for people like me, just add like a ""Classic"" type mode. Tthe slow paced mode with jail, creep rounds and what not. Something for everyone."
7193,love it
7194,"FORGET ABOUT BRAIN,,, ITS GAMBLE GAME"
7195,mantapu jiwa
7196,ok
7197,"I really like underlords. Been playing since like 3 weeks and i got to love the complexity and diversity of builds.
Up till yesterday. Do you really think removing complexity is the way to go dear developpers? 

-Removing jail (and creating that dumb rotation which takes out about 14 heroes, removing shaman, elusive completely). With jail you had a mechanic that made building by guides almost impossible, cause there where always some important parts missing in most cases. With jail gone, what we will face now is a few guides with op builds which 90% of the people will copy. Thanks a lot on that (People already start spamming scrappy insects). I stopped playing hearthstone actively because of the netdecking culture.

-The removal of creep rounds seems minor, but i liked that you had to readjust and the possibility to lose if you didnt do so. it was also a punish system for losing streakers or just comps that excelled in lategame and sucked in early game.

-The underlords feel a lot less cool since you dont have much decisions to make in terms of passives.

Please give back the pre 19th December version :-/"
7198,"Super fun - I like how they are balancing the game. Very strategic
"
7199,"easy to pick up and the cross mobile play is the cherry on top
"
7200,"Hey maybe you fucking retards could work on the netcode so whenever I get into the top 3 it doesn't just constantly disconnect and causes me to lose the game.

You stupid fucks stole this game from someone else, the least you could do would be to make meaningful changes, the people who work on this game should have all been aborted."
7201,"Started out fine, seems like every update has made the game worse and less balanced in my opinion.
Taking away a random rotation of heroes is lame, now you can't fast forward through the early rounds anymore.  Challenges won't refresh half the time. etc."
7202,Fun game a little hard to pick up on at first but nice to play even when you lose lol
7203,Abandoned.
7204,"I have been playing this game literally since the day it came out. The fact that its on PC and mobile makes it accessible at any time as I play on my PC on the weekends and my phone most other times. I'm gonna be honest, as a professional with family obligations as well, although I LOVE this game, I don't know all the ins and outs as far as being knowledgable on every meta and change but despite that, like any game, with time comes mastery. I'm at the point where I am a fairly high level. When the game first came out I LOVED it, then they changed it to where you battle everyone in the lobby 1v1 and I started getting DESTROYED and tbh I still don't know what about that change caused me to shift from literally getting 1st place in most of my matches to getting utterly destroyed and knocked out in last place. Fast forward a bit, despite playing now more than ever, I'm still not able to get first place wins as frequently as I used to but I have adapted to changes. I'm gonna be honest, with the new update I  am LOVING the game even more, I love that they got rid of the jail system, I love that they have made matches shorter. Unlike some other people the addition of underlords on the map doesn't bother me in the least and is a welcome addition in my mind. I love this game, its a great game, it always has been. Try it and see for yourself."
7205,"So this game was an improvement on Auto Chess in just about every way. Before today.

It was making great strides to becoming it's own thing... Then it took a giant, sudden, and horrible step in the wrong direction. It seems like they took input from their Knockout mode and turns out it was used to influenced the mode that at least I preferred.

This might be a knee jerk reaction, but it feels worse than before."
7206,just bad
7207,"It was a great game, which i played almost every week, but the last patch, with its whole game owerhaul, made the game just no fun anymore. They removed all the mechanics that i liked, and made the game too fast and more RNG based."
7208,"I wish there is a game mode called 1 vs 1 like in offline mode using mobile phones can play and connect to each other using only wifi hotspot or bluetooth, something like in mini militia game."
7209,is dota but not
7210,Good game.
7211,"It's like playing Dota but you control the whole team of 10 players but instead of playing them you're picking the team composition and managing economy.
It's neat."
7212,"Pretty much the same thing as TFT, just Valve cares less than Riot."
7213,"Game was great. I played it when it for a good bit before it was released as it's own client. Everything was great got back to big boss and enjoyed every update. With them most recent update """"December 18th"""" the game has drastically changed.

I don't mind content being added/removed or different concepts being test. The changes made during this patch ruined the game state entirely. Players are punished for ecoing early and taking losses. Some alliance combinations are now missing core units for either dps or cc due to removal of so many units. 

They increased damage taken and lowered overall health of games. This makes the game speed up by 25-35% depending on who is in the game and what rank the game is. If I wanted a shorter paced game i wouldn't load up underlords. I expect a slower strategical game rather than a faster paced game drastically changing the way it's currently played.

If you wanted to update a game with changes such as this you need to ease into them before just overhauling a games playstyle entirely just to see the more casuals players happy."
7214,"This game is getting battered into oblivion by bad design choices , it is free so there is no harm in trying it but there are better options for competitive play or quick casual sessions out there.

Content updates are scarce since Valve seems to be focusing its attention on Alyx. Balance patches are frequent, the game direction is terrible balance wise often breaking more things with each patch until the idea is scraped and content deleted - constant shuffling of unit costs and aliances.
UI/UX design could use some improvements but the latest update was a huge step in the right direction and fixed couple of major issues.
Animations , especially Underlords animations - as the others are pretty much exact copy from Dota2 which is nearly a decade old game by now , could use some improvements.
Instead of adding content in terms of items and new aliances the team seems to be focusing on Underlords which are a cool idea that is terribly executed. The internal play testing leaves a lot to be desired as the patches are shipped out broken often introducing glitches or game breaking concepts balance wise.

If you are Dota2 fan give it a try during the ques, you might enjoy it. For everyone else , this aint it chief."
7215,lol @ the new update
7216,FUN. GAME.
7217,Game has been absolutely abandoned. Not a single update in about a year.
7218,so the game was fun. And then the latest update came out. They kinda killed the game for me. Taking out the creeps and now you only choose your underlord at a higher lvl. I am not a fan
7219,This game is Amazing!
7220,autochess is dead
7221,"Would have been a thumbs up before the new update, not very enjoyable compared to before.....    :("
7222,The latest patch that changed the Standard game mode is shit. Please revert it back to old playstyle and rounds and take out the knockout feel and also put the creeps back and put back the level 1 1 unit start thing. the new items and heroes are awesome but please revert the other functions....
7223,"good but easily get bored with, basically good"

7243,"8/10

This game comes on phones so it is a great time spender through out your day!
For those who love ""Dota"" it is a nice alternative when you feel tired of the original way of playing ""Dota"".
It stimulates your brain as the core playground appears to be a chess table where you collect your ""figures"" to fight others.
It also consists of a bit of gambling and luck, so it is possible to win for anyone in different situations(shared heroes pool).

-
The game doesn't exactly tell you which strategy to go with, so it is frustrating for someone who is distant to these type of games to actually win straightaway. (But it's got ranks so you have enough time to learn)
Sometimes you catch yourself doing the same thing over and over again, but maybe it is just me =/ because what game is not the same thing done over and over again?

Overall:
As a ""medium"" ""Dota"" player this game is a nice time-to-time game in my pocket for me and I enjoy it."
7244,"Great game, I play it every day!"
7245,"Tirando os bugs que acontecem raramente, o jogo e muito bom, bem complexo e bem viciante pro iniciante mas, não e dificil de aprender mas tem uma linha de aprendizado muito longa, fazendo q o jogador jogue bastante para ficar o mais flexivel possivel para se virar com as alianças que o jogo oferece. Muito bom, eu jogo tft e tals, eu prefico Underlords, msm Tft tendo mais conteudo, Underlords tem mais modos eu formas de jogos nas partidas diferentes, itens bem autenticos e logico, usa os Heros do dota, que são na minha opinião muito mais legais. Se vc gosta de Auto Chess, vc não perde nada em baixa e experimentar o Underlords :D"
7246,game is fun for short turn based strategy.  level heroes with skills and battle on a chess style board for some epic fights.  save gold or spend early and snowball.

7271,it was fun to play hard to master so if you want a challenge go for it
7272,Nice strategy game to pass some time
7273,Love the game.
7274,I think this game was best when it came out. I don't like having a static character from game to game. It was better when it reflected Dota and each game was a unique and separate experience.
7275,"Good game although I think it took a turn for the worse with how the Underlords were implemented.

Pros
When everyone has roughly the same luck on getting units and items they want, the game is super fun.

Positioning units is REALLY important and gives you a lot to learn even if you insist on playing the same build every match.

Freestyle mode lets you practice builds against literally anything else in the game. Here you can see how position affects the round outcome.

Really relaxed gameplay style. You can be watching other things like YouTube or reading things online while playing. A nice change from other games that require all of your attention. You can even go to the toilet or get a drink inbetween rounds.


Cons:
Anessix was OP for a long while with insane healing which left Hobgen in a really bad spot. Now Anessix does pretty much no healing due to lots of nerfs and Hobgen has been buffed to hell and does insane damage. You go from everyone picking Anessix to picking Hobgen just because one is objectively better than the other. This might be fixed with more Underlords being added, but with only 2 it feels really bad.

Sometimes RNG can really screw you over and no amount of skill will save you, it's just how the game plays and it can get really frustrating sometimes. Playing assassins but get bad items, You lose. Playing any alliance fine until mid-game and then the game just never gives you anymore units you need for that build (even after 50 gold+ of rolls when you're about to die), you lose. Playing a normal game? Get rekt by someone who high-rolled to hell with insane luck. Sometimes RNG is so bad you don't even get a single 2-star by round 10 and sometimes it's so good you have a 3 star before round 10.

Some alliances are just pointless or have issues where most of their units are really expensive so you can't really go for them unless you're lucky early on and get a solid winning streak (scrappy/inventor for instance).

The balance patches are so drastic that they cause meta shifts pretty much every update. It's really frustrating when you think you've learnt how the game works and then suddenly everything just changes.

Prison sucks, though I suspect this will be good when there are a LOT more units for each alliance. Sometimes the whole lobby being forced into only 2-3 builds is pretty meh.

---

tl;dr - I miss how the game was before the underlords came around; Hobgen and Anessix change the game into something completely different. The game can still be fun but with balance patches being so wild it feels more frustrating than it probably should be."
7276,"This game really is not fun or competitive. I am a heavy DOTA player and even liked Artifact, and it is sad to me this is the game Valve devotes their time to. Its routine, random, and boring. The meta seems to be figured out quickly, and it is formulaic to just follow it. Besides that it is all RNG."
7277,这太难了，我沉迷了那么久，却失去了那么多，这太难了，建议大家不要沉迷下棋，打打麻将就不错
7278,"This game is MUCH more pleasant to play than doto 2, I highly recommend"
7279,its a good game to play in the shitter
7280,"Great game for both casual and ranked players that is constantly being updated. Has low framerate on macOS, through, I can not play with best graphics on a MacBook Pro mid 2015 (AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2 GB)"
7281,Well balanced and peaceful game in comparison to the DOTA.
7282,"more clear guidance needed on roles you can just get dota chest and use it here like more or less like it is,  it is hard to do follow up about each hero info should be added directly during the selection not when you click (?)"
7283,naisuu :)
7284,"Playing the game through beta they've mad many updates and created a fun auto battler.  I will say that with the introduction to the underlords and health adjustment, games take much longer to complete.  I have been playing the new knockout mode (you can only lose 4 times before being eliminated making it a quicker game) and it's been a lot of fun"

7300,fun
7301,Very nice game.
7302,All the fun of Dota drafts/team composition with none of the micro.
7303,"I wanted to like this game, as I've found the idea of a 3d battle chess where your decisions matter more than your micro to be an interesting idea....

However, that doesn't seem to be the case here. Most matches end up being RNG based entirely, and have very little to do with your choices or positioning. If you don't get the right RNG in the shop, you spend gold to try and resolve it and put yourself further and further behind....

If you like the board game monopoly, or RISK,  and like the idea of a battle chess game then this might be for you. If you hate the fact that Monopoly is trash because of RNG, and that Risk is a great concept of a game ruined without using house rules (in theory roll a D6 forever and never lose 1 vs 50) then steer clear of this game.

As it stands now, the game is 90% RNG and 10% your choices.... that's simply not good enough in today's gaming market."
7304,"This game is so simple to start playing, but incredibly complex in its details. Often, I win without really knowing why. The game does a huge dis-service, by having multiple modifiers, because to the newbie I consider it confusing. I'm sure some would argue its simple, but they probably spent a lot of time on reedit researching the best modifiers and units. Once you get the hang of it, you can go for certain units, but I still don't know whats good, and what beats what. This is chess without any of the rules or an explanation of the pieces."
7305,TFT is trash compared to this
7306,"Very, very fun gameplay, and a very fun two-person per team mode where you can play with friends."
7307,Unusual and entertaining game. Curious what they will add to it in the next year.
7308,AutoChess with a twist. Even if this type of game isn't your cup of tea it's worth playing a few rounds because it's free.
7309,"It's hard to tell what's going on, I don't have enough time to figure out what to do, and the visuals seem outdated. Even if I learned this game it would still be boring."
7310,good
7311,"Really fun game, cutting back on RNG with recent updates is a great move. Also Knockout is where it is at!"
7312,wow. Good game.
7313,"Just download it, play it, read everything, remember every structures, play for fun or make it serious up to you, but Im sure this game is not for someone who wants an easy game!"

7317,the game freezes when I try to run it
7318,
7319,Yeah this game is fun! I recommend trying it! It's not for everyone though. Kind of a mash up between gambling and a puzzle.
7320,nice
7321,"Consistently fun, always striving to make the game better and runs/plays really well"
7322,"Short version: Amazing strategy game, best auto-chess game, and its free.

Longs version:
I have played all of the main auto-chess games, becoming addicted to the DOTA mod originally. Safe to say, Underlords is by far the most polished and most enjoyable of them all. It is a shame that TFT gets so much more publicity when Underlords blows it out of the water. 

Positives:
-Multiple games modes that allow for short or long games
-Duos Mode: Play with a friend against other pairs - by far the most fun I have had in any strategy game in awhile
-Bots: Playing against computers has decently competitive gameplay and allows you to pause the game, making it great for casual users
-Constantly updated
-Many in-game statistics 

Cons:
-Frequent updates and constantly changing ""jail"" system require a bit of time to keep up with in order to stay competitive in the ranked ladder

"
7323,I was super excited about the launch of this game. On launch it was a bit rough but valve has smoothed out the rough patches. I am still waiting on the proto-pass to be released to see if the game becomes a pay to win or not. The game is super enjoyable and pretty easy to pick up!
7324,great game!
7325,"This game is addicting and fun, and the matches are very quick. It has a decent learning curve, but overall not too bad!"
7326,pure skill required !
7327,good
7328,way too random and complex. not a fun one valve nice try.
7329,the rate of dropping card is very suck

7332,"I play this game casually and it is a fun game to play to unwind.  I am by no means an expert on it, but I love the themes and the constant development the game gets.  Writing this review makes me want to play the game a bit more."
7333,the new update is so boring and maybe i will uninstal this game

7341,no
7342,"This game is addicting. It's strategic with an added element of luck. It's my first game in the auto-chess genre, and I am very impressed"
7343,Super addicting
7344,Definitely the best version of auto-chess out there!
7345,Awesome game to pass time
7346,"a pretty well pulled off clone of auto chess, this game has a good depth to it despite being a turn based auto battler."
7347,The new 10 minutes mode is amazing! K.O. your enemies and don't lose a lot of time. :-))
7348,"Like DOTA but smaller, faster, and different.  But the players are the same.  Only emote chat is a HUGE +"

Dota Underlords is a unique merge game where you find and manage your army. You can upgrade legends if you find a duplicate or, if you dont like the legends on your team, you can discard one in place for a new selected legend. Rounds will start and your army will start fighting other contestants, rounds that give you extra gold, and rlly hard levels that reward you in getting a good army early on.

Listen to me, this is a unique game, amazing as it is, I am positive they will release updates. Unique ideas like this are always excepted. Don't forget this game.

7381,"Its a game of luck, and i hate that. Its very basis is RNG dependant, in where theres a pool of toons you can 'randomly' draw from, and if you dont get the toons that you need and somebody else does, they will win and you will lose, just because they had more luck. For example, if i wanted to go Warrior Warlocks, but i only get a single rank 2 by mid game because somebody else was getting luckier and picking up the ones i wanted, then im screwed, and if i wanted to instead go for a different combo, id likely still be screwed because someone else has gone for that one. I dont find anything fun about having my playstyle dictated by a RNG, instead of being able to influence my playstyle directly. So, its a no from me."

7383,love this game didnt really get it at first but now that i understand it better its so addictive havnt been able to put it down

7402,gg
7403,this game good
7404,Fun with a friend @zitten
7405,"RNG = ""wait for my blessing"" system

This game is RNG hell. It decides when you win. It decides when to feed you to enemies. And if you play this game, there's nothing you can do but watch the fate the game has decided.

You will realize it when you play the first games, and how much you enjoy it.

But when you get into real multiplayer matches, you'll notice how truly unfair it is. Watching people upgrade their champions to level 2 and 3, but no amount of hard work, planning, or foresight on your part will make you have better results with your champions. Now you simply sit and wait while the RNG describes your fate in slow motion.

The gap is just too big not to notice. How does your RNG system decide whose turn it is to win?

A curse on devs who use RNG rewards. You're killing our tomorrow.

7406,its ok
7407,nice
7408,"suddenly i cant access my underlords account, it keep saying that im not connected into my steam account"
7409,I play bot games on mobile because I can pause them. By far the best mobile strategy game can you can play 15-30 seconds at a time then put back down.
7410,Just keep playing until u win! :)
7411,really fun great support from the developer with constant updates
7412,ggwp
7413,"So I haven’t played a lot of this game after they committed to adding the Underlords as a mechanic, reason being that I really didn’t like the changes. I think that part of the beauty of the game was how simple it was, so when Valve went ahead and added a ton of new content to the game, I wasn’t too elated with their decisions. Overall, I think the changes they made are probably better for the longevity and balance of the game, but I was not a fan of them as I felt as though they added a lot of clutter and unnecessary mechanics. I have plenty of friends who really enjoyed the changes, and still play the game to this day, but they lost me at the Big Update.

I think the biggest hurdle for me to overcome was the addition of the two Underlords, as I personally don’t like the pseudo-hero unit feel of them and think that they’re an excuse to push cosmetics at some point in the future. While again, I acknowledge that there are people who enjoy their addition, I am not one of those people. I also am not a fan of the hype mechanic as a resource meter for the Underlords, as I feel like I was comfortable (and happier) with where the game was before then when I only had to manage regular units and their alliances; for me, it kind of felt a bit overwhelming having to keep track of what abilities everyone was picking for their Underlords (though I concede that this did add more diversity to the game). I understand how a person reading this might say to themselves, “Wow, what a rather petty and unfounded reason to dislike the game,” or maybe, “Wow, this guy is fucking retarded and can’t keep track an additional 2 or 3 mechanics.” I don’t think that this is unfounded or baseless counterpoint, I just feel like it’s more of a matter of taste (then again maybe I’m some out-of-touch soon-to-be boomer who just can’t keep up with the times).

I think it’s also important to mention that the game was not in a perfect place when the changes occurred, and plenty of people felt as though it’d gotten stale with Knights having a persistently over-centralizing place in the metagame at the time. However, I ultimately feel as though the changes made weren’t for me and discouraged me from playing the game any further. I would like to say that the negative taste that the changes left in my mouth doesn’t negate the other 119 hours of rather fun strategy gameplay that I had enjoyed until then, but I am so disenchanted with the changes that I really wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone. There are unquestionably worse games, but I feel as though this is a great example of less being more.
"
7414,.
7415,"Entertaining game, really good to spend hours having fun, even if you lose the match it's still fun. You keep learning how to combine underlords with elements and items to get better, basically. Everything happens fast, so you always have to pay a lot of attention to do everything as right as possible."
7416,"Great team builder game that pretty much plays itself.  RNG can be rough, as long as you realize you'r not going to win every game because the troops just don't show up then you'll enjoy it.  This happens to everyone and there is always the one person in the game that just hits the primo troop combination and waxes everyone, but that will not happen to you every time.  Deal with losing and enjoy the game."
7417,This game will boom soon!
7418,pretty good

7440,good
7441,"Fun and always varied in how each match works.  Make sure you're willing to enjoy the randomness of RNG, as some games will have a person who simply succeeds with it every round.  A great concept and can be deep if you let it."
7442,"Strategic with a lot of depth, yet easy to learn, with the awesome DOTA 2 heroes."
7443,My experience with underlords has been from the beginning of the game. And I believe that the game has just hit its stride. The current Training Mode is an world of infinite possibilities. The speed with which the game changed and players adapted and were considered for changes continues to be incredible. It is more than worth your time
7444,Not an easy learning curve but a great game overall

7463,"Dota 2 and Dota Autochess were amazing and led me to this game. Based on Dota Autochess but with different alliances and Underlords as well as other feature like Knockout and Dual mode keep it fresh. The game plays great and there are constant updates and bug fixes.

I wish there was a more thorough tutorial (when I started playing there was none) as it makes it hard to bring friends to the game, especially those from non-DoTA/Warcraft background. The turn times are also really fast, it could be nice to slow it down for lower ranks and increase it as you progress. 

Despite it being a hard game to learn, it is kind of what is to be expected from a game based on DoTA2, very challenging and entertaining."
7464,Pretty good turn based game of RNG. It will make you wanna try using different combos to see what works. A game that can be played with one hand when you wanna relax.
7465,"Game itself is kinda cool, but it runs on wooden servers. The lag is unbareable and makes the game pretty much a crapshoot. The player with best serverconnection wins. Little embarrasing to see they cant even get the game stable enough to make it playable."

7501,I like it.
7502,The game if full of strategy and luck. It also makes you have the need to rethink of your plan. Like say you're rocking a play set and now that set isn't working that well because of the bad luck. You'll have to try something new in order to keep yourself in the game. You should try if you like a challenging mind game. If not then this game is not for you.

7504,Love this game.
7505,Great!
7506,very addicting. this will surely ruin your school grades kids. its fun but don't exchange your future with just computer games.

7519,really fun game and is free! gets a little stale after a while  but definatly worth playing/
7520,Really fun and easy to pick up with depth to the gameplay as well if you really want to get into it. Would recommend to people who havent played Dota as well.
7521,actually good but in phone kinda lag
7522,-
7523,love me some auto chess like games!!!
7524,"Even though I'm much more familiar with the characters and their abilities in TFT, theres just so much more to this game that I like- especially duos. I hope they add more main characters besides Anessix and Hobgen in the future"
7525,"great gameplay and good update , and can make you enjoy this game so much"
7526,Great game. Super fun to play alone and with friends. Really great if you have a lot of time to kill or want to chill before bed or something.
7527,better than little legends
7528,"A good mobile game, i guess"
7529,its a fun idle game
7530,Fun time with friends
7531,fun
7532,"The new game play update just ruined the game. it's look fresh and all, but it didn't feel like auto chess anymore."
7533,"Great little game, requires no dota knowledge.  Good bit of RNG with some planning involved."
7534,"fun, chill game play time 30-60mins per game"

Sometimes it feels a little too luck dependent, but that's what people say about poker too."
7550,Very Good
7551,垃圾游戏 平衡性太差了。
7552,Almost as good as Artifact
7553,"Part card game, part strategy.   It's quite engaging.   Games can take a long time to complete though.   Still enjoyable however."
7554,:(((((((((((((((((
7555,"I really wanna like this game :(

It just gets old quick, because if you play it enough you'll realize all the depth is gone at this point, and it's basically a ""Just try to 3 star as many heroes as you can"" game now.

Ironically, I struggled to get hooked initially on release, because my dumb brain felt the game was overwhelming.
 
The game has swung totally opposite now, and is just so sanitized and simple. It needs more of that complexity back.."
7556,Great game with a small learning curve. Great to play during downtimes and breaks from work.
7557,"I would write angry, mean things here. Like, I mean, a - ""GAME OF THRONES SEASON 8"" Reddit rage thread! Some of that next-level fury and bitter anguish that can only truly fester in the mind of a person that voluntarily goes to Trump rallies to stew in the base hate present there. I swear, I tried to tap into the rage, I actually did, but I just couldn't. Any such commentary in a steam review would be pretty drab either way, I suppose. Like, who reads these silly things anyway? Why do you care what random people on the internet think about a game you've not even played? Do check the previews before buying cup noodles too?

Because, in truth, that is the comparison. This game is the cup noodles of free games. It's okay, I mean, it's not bad per say, but honestly, you'd rather have pasta. The only reason you aren't having pasta is that you're too lazy to boil the water. We've all done it. It would take you 5 minutes to have something better, but no, you're having cup noodles.

Dota Underlords is bland. A meta is established with every update and some internet Twitch queen in a glittery dress or whatever the kids put on these days to attract their banshee following... Wait, no, sorry, no rage... Anyways, patch notes are autistic-level scanned, the statistically most reasonable top three builds of the week are conjured. They are posted to Reddit for internet fanboy points. The aforementioned fanboys’ gorge themselves on these like flies, because who doesn't want to win at internet noodle cup games. The builds are further distilled. 21.3 minutes later. Everyone is playing the same builds with slight variations dependent on luck and availability.

Add to that, that a game lasts for an ungodly hour, who eats cup noodles for an hour? The game is a time sink, and my gripe here is primarily, just that. It is a glorified slot machine and it is easy to get sucked in by it, but in truth, you do very little actual playing, especially when ultimately you're likely to copy down builds that someone else produced. So little time is spent thinking while playing, rather, you're rolling for new heroes hoping to upgrade what's in your deck. That's my concern, I suppose, it's easy, accessible, free and requires very little of the player. None of this are bad qualities in and of themselves, but, I suppose, like watching reruns of Friends, there's better ways to spend your time.

My point is this, I've spent 125 hours playing this game, and I deleted it when I realized this one sad fact: I don't recall a single game I've had. They've all been so uniformly dull and uninvigorating that I barely recall playing the game at all. I suspect that when, or if, I do, it'll be like remembering having had cup noodles. When this happens, I will have the sad realization that my mind is empty of fond memories. Devoid of pleasant things and happy experiences, a right void or vacuum, so much so that the only bitter little recollection I have left, when late at night I slip to bed, is the taste left in my mouth as I had cup noodles rather than pasta.

Don't be like me. Don't have cup noodles."

7560,its pretty good :)
7561,addicting gamble-and-fight system
7562,"I played a few other auto chess game, but this Dota Underlords is the most polished and very quick to update with new stuff, bug fix and balancing. Some players might have difficulty catching up with the updates if they don't play it often, but it should be quite easy to catch up the changes after a few games and reading the patch notes/in game guide."
7563,pray your RNGesus
7564,"lag, bug"
7565,"You should play this game because it´s very good!

But be aware of some annoying stuff: 

1) seems like valve stopped supporting this game
2) it is absolutly normal and possible that you have zero 3-stars but some of your opponents have 4 3-stars, the same lvl as you, same amount of gold. 
3) you will never see 3-stars of tier4 units in normal matches
4) 3-stars more valuable than high level: that means you will hardly see yourself reaching level 8,9 or even 10 in normal matches 
5) if you like to bite in your table from time to time then there is no problem

"
7566,Great fun. Fast rounds
7567,good game
7568,/
7569,They should put the last two underlords jull and enno next patch
7570,I think it's... pretty cool
7571,Very good time waster and you aren't completely obliged to give away a lot of your time to play a match since leaving a match doesn't completely ruin another persons time with the game.
7572,Awesome game for mind.
7573,nice if you have time to play

7575,"this game is vvery addictive

Totally 100x better than other autochess stuff."
7579,GOOD GAME
7580,it grew on me now I cant get enough love it
7581,"Not great, not terrible. Relatively polished, but RNG sometimes a day ruiner."
7582,so good
7583,win 3 match and get 20 points lose 1match and lose 15 points fuck this game
7584,Rolling dice is more fun.
7585,"Pros: Nice game play.  Intuitive interface.  Feels like I'm winning because I did the right things or losing because I screwed up.

Cons: Dated graphics.  Only two underlords."
7586, vvzxczvxcvxcczxvx
7587,lovely one
7588,5*
7589,"This is a fun game and certainly worth trying. There's no grinding required to get the best of it. You'll know if it fits your taste from the start. 

Pros: 
zero pay to win features
almost everything is unlocked from the start
fun 
feels like it's ok to not perform well
relatively simple
mobile-pc cross platform
can run on low-spec PCs
late-game comebacks are possible

Cons:
is in active development and things change too rapidly
some mechanics are too experimental
cosmetic rewards don't feel satisfactory
almost no in-game communication 
too many characters/factions/abilities to remember
matches seem too chaotic in long games
feels like there's too much luck involved at times
for an auto-chess game, matches in the classic mode can drag on for too long
"

7604,Nice addition to Dota community.
7605,> Artifact
7606,I actually like the game. I like the strategy and the critical thinking it involves.
7607,same as dota chess
7608,"Was a good game, they made into trash with the last update ..."
7609,not fun at all
7610,Great Game! Just read why heroes enter the jail.
7611,The OG and the best autochess game out there
7612,Remember Auto chess died for this!
7613,"it's GOOD and FREE, just try it !!"
7614,"i suck at this game, Bow."
7615,A great game except when you get crushed by hyper-rolling monkeys.
7616,its like the league on i guess lol
7617,dope game
7618,nice game2
7619,kinda good but it take too long to play a single match
7620,"Positives: I really like the game, it's fun and addictive. Cool characters with imaginative design. I like the balance in both planning the alliances, but also having to adapt to what characters become available in the shop.

Negatives: AI is no challenge for the whole game and then when computer players starts to get knocked out AI suddenly kills you 100%. It sucks because it's impossible to adapt that late in the game and go all single-star characters. Multiplayer against humans is also broken. Since there's no ranking to pit equal humans agaist eachothers one either get how the latest game patch works and win 100% or one is a noob and loose 100%. I don't like that at all."

7636,Like dota Auto Chess but for everyone o/
7637,you need to know strategy to play this game. its not for itssy and bitsy crowd.

7647,underlords forever！！！！
7648,ok
7649,"A fun but well-balanced game. This game of course inspired based on well-known ""Auto-chess"" game but due to new game play mechanic and new game  rule, this game is far better than the original. The new game mode makes game shorter so it is not too boring and more balance as you don't have to worry about upgrading squad size. If you are Dota 2 fan, you will able to learn how to play this game in no time."
7650,You can play this steam game on your phone! I think its a great Evolution for steam!
7651,better than tft
7652,"It's free without much getting between you and the gameplay, it's well paced, chaotic, and is interesting to learn though does take a bit to get the hang of it. If you've not played one of these autochess games this one would be my suggestion."

Visually, looks nice. The UI is simple, mimicking the Android UI~"

7672,It's fun while its last
7673,good with friends

7675,rrrrrreecomeeeeen
7676,"Started playing this since it was launched as a mod in dota2. I had a lot of fun playing it at that time. For some reason, I played a lot less when it became an actual game and eventually stopped. I still go back and play 1 or 2 games and it is still a fun game to play. They added many features to the game. I am glad they didn't tweak the core mechanics a lot."
7677,"Teamfight Tactics with less stuff and more complicated, still fun tho"
7678,"It was a pretty good game in beta phase, nice dota-like style and enjoyable path to Big Boss.
Then the update came and it branched out too much away from dota style, trying to look differently and meanwhile lost the initial appeal. Not playing it any more."

7692,"I had never played autochess before, but this is the best way to spend my long commutes to and from work.. just a few games and I´m home and I don´t even notice the ride. 

Super fun, Super addictive, 100% recommended"
7693,Cool
7694,A very good adaptation of Auto Chess
7695,such a great game to grind your brain
7696,"Hire a crew and destroy your rivals in this new strategy battler set in the world of Dota.
Recruit heroes and upgrade them into a more powerful version of themselves.
Play on your platform of choice and battle players across the globe in a hassle-free crossplay experience. Running late? Start a match on your PC and finish it on your mobile device (and vice versa). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices, so no matter what you play on, you're always making progress.
Everyone starts at the bottom, but by playing against other Underlords you'll climb through the ranks and prove you're worthy to rule White Spire.
Offering a sophisticated AI with 4 levels of difficulty, offline play is a great place to hone your skills. Pause and resume games at your leisure."

7746,Like
7747,"As someone who doesn't have the mechanical skills to play a MOBA but still enjoy the complexity of the combinations of heroes and items, I really appreciate the emergence of the auto battler genre. Dota Underlords is well supported with weekly updates, some of which shake up the meta regularly. Also, the addition of the shorter knockout mode makes this my go-to mobile game."

--------------------
Original review: 

I did not play the original Auto Chess, but was directly introduced to this, mainly because of the Dota IP.
I must say that I thought I would probably not enjoy it, but boy I was wrong. I don't know what it is, but Underlords is just an addicting game; especially when playing duos, I just don't want to stop."
7781,"В принципе,игра неплохая
Портирована на мобилу
Лучше играть в шахматы,чем в артифакт
11/10 украинских названий героев"
7782,Still better than Artifact
7783,I usually play a game a few days and never go back. This game I keep playing day after day. New updates keep it fresh. Never the same META.
7784,"If you have the Time to play the game, i'll recommend it"
7785,"I really like playing this game w/ a friend/friends because of the duos mode. That mode really makes it stand out from other Auto Chess type games (TFT, Auto Chess itself). It has decent variety in the combo of alliances you can go that you can actually win with, but the only thing I don't like so far is the Underlords. Some buffs/debuffs can be difficult to see because of multiple effects on your heroes at once. They also either feel really weak or really helpful to your team, but other than that, I enjoy the game."
7786,Honestly was better when released now feels so trash
7787,Also available on mobile!
7788,It's alright for a quick game every now and then
7789,good
7790,Having single player with shared achievements is a huge plus. Cross platform to mobile.
7791,good
7792,good
7793,ggggggggg
7794,"Innovating from the original Autochess, Underlords is bringing a lot of cool new things to the table. Very enjoyable. Easy to learn, hard to master."
7795,The game started really good but with more and more features it becomes hard for new players to get a hang of it. I love to play this game but its learning curve is getting higher than of dota
7796,good game
7797,gud
7798,"its a fun game, strategy. love it!"

7815,"nice game
"
7816,gud
7817,The Hud is terrible in this game.  On one hand unless you know all the characters you won't have enough time to figure out who does what and on the other hand you sit there and wait forever.....not very fun like other auto chess type games.  It is free though soooooo there is that.
7818,k

7838,Great fun! Hard to master!
7839,"Excellent, simple, strategy game. Been playing since it started and, so far, it has come a long way. They keep adding more characters and abilities at this stage, so it stays fresh and exciting for me.  Its a good balance of active thought, but at the same time, there is down time while your pawns play out.  I play one game (at least) a day just to stimulate muh otherwise melty melty brain."

7855,"It was a fun time sink. Something between a CCG and RTS. Plus, it's free."
7856,"Very interesting and strategically-based game. A little too much RNG for my taste, but certainly a fun game if you have a friend to play duos with. The devs are passionate about the game, which makes all the difference."
7857,nice nice nice
7858,They got the board right but it doesn't even have the standard chess pieces
7859,"First of its kind, Dota Underlords was a precursor to many games of the auto chess genre. We will always remember you as the first of the bunch even if TFT stole your spotlight :("
7860,"Interesting mechanics and many opportunities for strategic decisions, but has huge variance with RNG and way too much visual clutter."
7861,cute game. requires good knowledge and strategy
7862,void broken in 2 volvo game
7863,"A game that is changing and adapting to its players, a fun unique game that both takes its time and keeps a fast pace. Big recommend if mobas are too fast for you like they are me."
7864,"Ha some pros and cons to it, basically a copy of league of legends tft, but had some features tft did not so that's a plus I suppose."
7865,Game is fun but takes longer than an actual DOTA game.
7866,I don't get it

7889,"While when the game originally came out it felt like an enjoyable clone of Auto Chess, it has since diverted in ways that bring interesting new mechanics to the game. This is the only Auto Chess game I continue to play."
7890,Great take on the Auto-Battler genre. Also the dev's keep working on & improvingg it.

7897,This game is getting better and better
7898,"Dota Underlords is a very polished and well thought out auto-chess game, it's it's own unique thing in the dying genre of auto-chess battlers and it manages to stay fun even after 100s of hours playing it, The game is cross-platform as well so you can take the game anywhere you go and continue matches you were playing on your PC over to your phone when you're going to work or something
It's fair, fun and is MUCH more easier on the eyes unlike TFT, also.. it runs on SOURCE 2, so it can still run on older devices pretty decently but I wouldn't say the same thing about the IPhone ports of the game."
7899,Best card game
7900,Great game but genre still needs more depth to keep interest properly.
7901,"I love everything about dota, and it says ""dota"" underlords... so i guess theres no further explanation needed."
7902,"100% Opinion, 100% best Autochess"
7903,Нормуль игра
7904,Worst game!
7905,"This game started good but now it has so many issues that I have to give it thumbs down. It’s unplayable on an iPad, it crashes all the time and has to reconnect to the game. By the time I reconnect I don’t even have time to arrange my heroes or start a new strategy, not to mention the blank screens I get while playing on an IOS device. Also, the game feels very unbalanced. Alliances don’t seem to matter at all and the crashes... it’s just unenjoyable."
7906,Strange game.
7907,ok game
7908,Just sad this had to be at the expense of Artifact
7909,Decent so far but needs more time to develop.
7910,With the addition of knockout it's finally a good game when you have a little time on your hands.
7911,"Not good, not bad, it's acceptable!"
7912,nahhhh
7913,"Played this game in the beginning and stopped when Contraptions were introduced, Disliked the idea of placing items in the Battleground and felt the game was better before for its simplicity. Just entered game two months after stopped playing it and i cant even recognize its the same game, There is Player Heroes which have tons of abilities that are hard to get into them, and these two new Placeable Hero Units feels totally out of place to me. The new additions only complicated something that was much better in the original concept. Still think its a good game but just not as fun as it was."

7931,Great game to play 1-2 rounds in the evening
7932,"Another Valve brainchild that was born from a custom mod.
Developed from scratch, the gameplay is completely different from most of the games in the same genre of turn-based strategies and it can be safely called a new genre."

8025,Good game !
8026,"Dead game. Valve doing same with all game mechanics they got: DotA, Artifact, now Underlords... Patches 1-2/month, no tournaments, no game development - nobody cares about quality and interesting gaming. 
P.S. writing it after 800+ hours - now it's totally full of random and most of all - no interest at all: you got top combo (like warriors+warlocks and knights+trolls, spirits+mages) and just roll. If you get your units and items = you win. No need in player participation, no need to change formations and try something = 3* units rule atm. 
Drop it before start play or you burn your nerves for nothing, thx Vavle-killer-of-games"

8075,"Underlords, currently in early access, is heavily based on Dota Auto Chess, a mod in which eight players purchase automated units and try to outdo each other in a mini-tournament of 1v1 duels. It may not sound like much, but it’s easy to learn, and once you’ve let your brain marinate in the intricacies for a bit, it’s addictive as heck. Steam users are pleased with Valve’s faithfulness to the original mod, as well as the subtle quality-of-life improvements and item changes that streamline some of the mod’s sloppier elements. Some people, however, are wary of hero and synergy changes Valve has made, while others just don’t dig how RNG-based the game (and genre) is. For most, though, Underlords is hitting the spot."

8117,"After the failure ""artifact"" crashed to the ground, ""Dota Underlords"" is the solution that valve comes up with trying to imitate the success of then rampantly popular dota arcade blackhorse known as ""dota auto chess"". While this one is slightly better than valve's previous release, it is not by much. It's obvious that valve gives it a lot of support, as seen by the frequent update, but it's just not fun. Whether it is because auto chess already exhausted players' curiosity with this type of game, or underlord just lack the kind of design that captures people. This game is mundane, as illustrated by its players online statistics."

8180,"By far the best autobattler currently out. The jailing of a handful of heroes each day keeps the gameplay fresh and the combinations ever-changing for a meta that doesn't ever get stale. Plus, the way that item drops happen after creep waves is done RIGHT, which is hugely important in making the game more about your decision of synergies instead of who can get the most/best drops after the first set of waves. I'm excited to see how much this game will change and improve over time."

8218,"November 26 update forces you to use the latest version of the Steam client in order to play.

Errors with ""You must be logged into Steam"" on launch if you're forcing an older version.

Everyone using the pre-library update of Steam can no longer play the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjN6-e3nlPE 

Thanks Valve.

I will never update to the new library until it's vastly improved, which Valve doesn't seem to want to do despite the overwhelming negative complaints.  As such, it looks like I'm uninstalling Underlords and finding a new autochess game to play.  No other Steam game I've tried is like this.. and I own over 2,000 games.


I was already annoyed at the ""Underlords"" update which drastically changed the UI and added so much clutter all over the screen and made everything so much harder to parse (and quit for a few weeks to see if it improved after a big feedback report I gave; it didn't), but this arbitrary requirement put the nail in the coffin."

8302,"When you start playing, it’s an enjoyable nightmare. Enjoyable, at least, if you’ve already battled through part of it before. Dota Underlords takes simplified versions of Dota 2 heroes and pits them against each other in automated multiplayer battles. You’re pitted against seven opponents, fighting in a series of clashes against each of them while they also battle each other. Your aim is to be the last general standing: each loss punches out some of your lifeblood, based on the stage of the game and how hard you got hit. Heroes are recruited from a selection of five at the top of screen, but you can always spend some gold to spin the hero wheel again if you don’t like what’s on offer."
8303,nice game for enjoy
8304,Fun game :)

8310,a very fun game to play
8311,nice game
8312,"Not a big fan of DOTA(or any other MOBA for that matter), but this game is great. It's easy to play, but difficult to master. Of course, there is RNG involved in the mechanics, but don't listen to people saying that RNG is the deciding factor of a match. The decision making (what to comp to build, when to switch builds, when to commit, when to spend gold on slots or reroll for units, etc) is much as important, if not the truly deciding factor, for wining or not. Like a trading card game(MtG for example), RNG can make your life either easier or harder on a match, and for the latter, the decisions you make can really turn the tide. Henceforth my POV: Easy to play, difficult to master.

In the current state, things are changing very fast, which is expected for an early access game. This can either be great or bad depending on how you see these things. Anyway is a game worth checking out.

8371,Nice Game <3
8372,Good Game to kill time :)
8373,I’ve only scratched the surface but so far pretty meh and shallow the strategy revolves around having lots of units from the same class for the buff. its ok for a f2p strategy game it’s still in early development so hopefully the game gets better as the updates are pretty fast. It has its fans so maybe with time there may be something here i don’t currently see

8415,Better than TFT
8416,wow
8417,Fun game that actually has some complexity if you want to get really good at it. Every major patch has completely reset the game so far.
8418,it's too addicting to play. Not recommendable.
8419,tft is better
8420,nice game..
8421,Unique take on the Auto Chess/Battlers game mode. Devs are constantly updating the game (typically weekly) and since release have added 3 new game modes

8435,Good game!
8436,"Fun , on of the best chess strategy game in the world. keep updating and patch frequently, Make player must learn and adapt patching after patching"
8437,much improved
8438,"DOTA Underlords is a game that mixes skill and RNG with the rich lore and flair of the DOTA universe. The game plays itself after you make decisions about your heroes and items from a randomized selection each round. It's not fully random as there are rules governing each portion of the game. Learning these is how you rank up, which is dependent entirely on your match outcome and not on the ranks of other players.

It's available on mobile as well and your data is shared between the 2 for unlockables and future items/cosmetics. If you're looking for an autobattler/autochess game, this is the best one period. The updates are consistent and solid so expect it to be active indefinitely."
8439,Not for the weak minded. Enough combination of risk management and team synergy analysis to give this game a very high skill cap while still being fun for those less inclined to think too much.
8440,"low pc requirment
good game"
8441,It's not a bad game from a casual perspective.
8442,i recommended this game for my friend
8443,Awesome game. Updates keep the game feel new.
8444,Nice
8445,ok
8446,"steam bullied me into writing a review, but the game is chill"
8447,"An interesting, strategic game that relies on some luck.."
8448,Mages OP
8449,This is the game that shown me that probability classes taught in school is useless when there are RNGesus in the game. 11/10 would sacrifice virgins for luck again.
8450,This is immersive game to play with
8451,"its fun to play game, i think"
8452,"Only played the single player mode. 

A very nice draft game, lots of possible strategies to win and the constant updates add a lot of value and balance to the game

After the jul update the game got really bad for a while, but they recoverd from it and it got very fun to play again."

8468,just play it

8470,"[list]
    [*]Great on mobile, an example is I play on the bus on my commute to work.
    [*]Strategy with an anti-meta mechanic, jail.
    [*]Latest patch, 11/27/19 is fairly balanced.
    [*]Games can take 30 minutes if you're placing top 3.
    [*]I don't love the level up mechanic for Underlords but you can win with just playing the right heroes against your opponent.
    [*]Mobile play links to your Steam account so progress is cross platform.
[/list]"
8471,Juego divertido cuando salió pero aburrido a largo plazo.
8472,"A fun chess battle concept in the Dota lore. On long term the skill is the main factor, but some games you can really get unlucky drops."
8473,"good game needs more underlords tho
"
8474,just completing my task
8475,its an amazing game
8476,Fun game. It's like a polished auto chess using the DoTA IP. I have never played LoL so this is the superior option for me. Definitely would recommend. Great integration of pc and mobile.
8477,"The recent update to the game made the game much better. I enjoy that you are in a ring with many other online players battling it out to see who is best, not to mention it is that good ol' dota style where most matches can take up to 30 minutes and more. So I guess you can say it kills quite of bit of time if your looking for something to do."
8478,bem bem bem
8479,"Okay, after the last patch it was confusing at first to understand the new stuff, but as I played it got better. AI more balanced and I've won several matches now. New Underlord though needs a lot of work for a tank he's VERY weak, lost every match as him. New ways of getting your Underlord is depending on mode chosen, Knock out, match 2 you can pick your Hero and match 10 for the modes. 

So, as it stands it's improved greatly but it can still revert back. So far so good with this title currently, also valve is actually ""Understanding"" our requests."
8480,cool
8481,1+1=2
8482,"Playing on mobile is great, just wish the games weren't as long."
8483,Just a wonderful game.

8486,"[h1]Perception is reality.[/h1]

Skill is what you make of the hand that life deals you.

...squeeze it into the eyes of your opponents."
8487,"Rounds are lengthy compared with auto-chess alternatives such as Teamfight Tactics. Solid experience overall, though user interface could use some simplification."
8488,"The gameplay is fine, but for some reason it melts my CPU, and GPU is running very hot also, not really acceptable for such a simple looking game. Also the controller mode is terrible, could really use a proper control scheme rather than emulating a mouse with insane sensitivity and no options. Could be better."
8489,Fun pass time game
8490,i like it
8491,8/10
8492,Good shit
8493,Nice
8494,"This is an autochess game, and that loop of trying to pull synergistic order out of randomness scratches an itch in my brain.  Now that they've added KO mode, I'm much more likely to load this up on my phone (that's right, it's cross platform with mobile) when I'm commuting or some such.  The base game is great, deep, takes longer, and I kind of suck at it.  Recommended, and hope that with some more underlords and maybe shorter load times, it will only get better."
8495,"A great simple RNG game with pretty graphics and some tense gameplay. Learning it is simple, but mastering it..."

8538,"This game very fun, yes"
8539,"very briefly:I like this game :)
I have not tried other autochess games, so I have nothing to compare with, but overall I do enjoy this game. It's changing with updates, new stuff, new possible tactics, balancing. Games could be shorter overall as wait time between rounds might be long. Anyway, the game has its cons, but surely worth a try :)"
8540,alright game
8541,"Highly recommended. A lot of effort is put in by Valve to making it a unique and fun game to play.
There should be a single-player mode coming soon which should be great."
8542,A fun game with friend hehehe
8543,"Love the game, it's fun!"

8559,Fun and challenging
8560,"Once a polished and official ""clone"" version of the Dota Auto Chess custom game, it's since branched off and has a bunch of different units and mechanics. It's actually very actively updated for a Valve title, for now at least, though it also feels like the game keeps getting more complicated with each big update. Either way, it's interesting enough to at least give it a shot for a few rounds."
8561,Very fun and relaxing game with ever changing mechanics.
8562,"yeah, but no."
8563,Its a differrent experience every round
8564,"I recommend this game! For the price of nothing it has given me hours of entertainment. It's a strategic game where both knowledge and luck plays a role. It's a lot of fun every time you make one of those wacky team compositions work.

Update: 
The game is no longer being developed or updated. This is a shame cause these type of games require updates to stay interesting. While you can play for free still (and I do sometimes), I still can not recommend it as it has been abandoned."

Please stop doing this to your games Valve."
8577,Addicting XD
8578,"This game is interesting. It's not for everyone with its unique gameplay mechanics and I don't feel as though it is very user friendly, but if you spend time getting to know each character, I would give the game a 7/10"

Мэдээж хэрэг Dota Auto Chess-ийг огт тоглож байгаагүй , сонирхолгүй хүнд таалагдахгүй байх нь аргагүй л дээ.
Гэхдээ л Dota Underlords нь ""Valve"" студийн маш зөв шийдвэрүүдийн нэг байж чадсан."
8662,"Interesting game but has a better alterations, unluckily for this one"
8663,ok game
8664,Its okay
8665,very good
8666,"This game was fun for a bit, but randomly generated fights can be a bit frustrating."
8667,k
8668,"Interesting game, on the other hand it's strongly targeting dota players.
Existing tutorial only shows the most basic concepts of the game and then leaves the player to guess the rest on his own.
On the other hand for fans of original dota 2 everything will be familiar. Obviously heroes/items had to be reworked and tailored to match the mechanic of underlords, but stil the basic characteristics/skills are the same.

I know that it's basically also a remake like dota itself, yet it lacks the polish dota reveived. The concept is nice, it's just not newbie friendly. If you don't have anything agains looking up more details by yourself, you'll probably like the game, otherwise the learning curve might be a bit too step"

8697,Really Suck Dick
8698,this game is good
8699,so nice to play
8700,"Auto-chess should be simple to understand but have levels of complexity. Over time this game has changed and forgotten the simple to understand aspect. The design direction isn't one for me. If you want a game with an increasing barrier to entry then this is most definitely for you. If not, look to the plethora of other similar games."
8701,This is a game
8702,Good goofs and gaffs
8703,good

DOTA2 NEED SOME LOVE"
8705,"Stand-alone game derived from a mod of a stand-alone game derived from a mod of a stand-alone game.

This genre appeared only one year ago, so such games will attract players for a long time.

As for me, sometimes I feel bored there, but im not sure, mb its my own problem.
I reccoment to try this game or this genre at least and then it depends on you. GL

8726,This game is excellent. The devs are always keeping the content fresh and they listen to the players opinions. They give it to us for Free too. No complaints!

8754,"It gets more horrible and more complex from update to update, certainly not what it was before and certainly not what I was hoping for this game."
8755,A fun game has multiple choices of play styles and strategies. U can decise your champion team depending on either your luck or joy of heroes in the game. dota underlords (UD) also support party player and mobile platform so you can have fun with your friend at any time and place.
8756,its for nerds who see dota 2 isnt nerdy enough . FACT
8757,После релиза игра умерла :(
8758,eh

8763,Hard to win when everybody is higher tier than you. But it enjoyable and challenging
8764,nice game
8765,"Good game and the devs are really active. The game is (still) constantly changing and so it can get a bit rough if you just figured out a patch or don't have enough time to follow just one game.

Keep in mind that it is still in early access and the devs try many different things. Oh and it's free to play, so just give it a spin!"

8783,shit game
8784,this a very good game
8785,"Sophisticated auto chess interpretation with the characters you love from Dota.
Distinguishing mechanics are the underlord which is a preselected more powerfull unit you have from the start and ""item units"" like barricades or healing wards.
If you like the genre, give it a try - it's free."
8786,"For single-player mode, there is too much randomness. This does not mean the game is bad but a bit unbalanced and less competitive. In contrast, the game does excellent in multiplayer mode and it is much more balanced. However, there are very few players in multiplayer mode and it sometimes takes a long time to wait a game to start.

Although there is a crash per game in average, I am very glad that the game supports Linux. This is the reason why I write a review for this game."

8788,not bad :/

Featuring the all-well-known characters from Dota2 universe."
8798,rounds generally take a bit too long (up to 1h) but the new knockout mode only takes about 10 min. great game and keeps improving!
8799,Good game
8800,One of the best game for playing with friends.And its changes are always adaptable
8801,"good game, innovative gameplay
"
8802,Nice
8803,"This game has undergone so many significant changes since release, that it is impossible for casual players to keep up to date with them. Changes to hero powers/balance are applied in every patch multiple times each month. Major changes as how alliances work, hero mechanics and the whole game design occur so often, that if you didn't play for a month or a couple weeks, you would have to read up on these changes for at least 1 hour in order to make intelligent choices ingame. Seems like the designers had no idea of what to make out of the game, after they copied the game design from the original version, of which many other games also exist. Could have been fun, but bad game development prevents me from further playing the game (I got 100+ hours into it)."
8804,Good game
8805,"very fun with the mobile IOS/Android app!
great way to play offline during a long-flight or when you want to kill time.
AI is okay and pretty challenging.

8844,rng fuk
8845,"Great extension of auto chess. Besides the cosmetic and stylistic differences from others, Underlords adds an 'underlord' piece which has its own abilities and gets stronger throughout the rounds"
8846,Good Game :D
8847,awesome
8848,Yes.
8849,Kekw
8850,its a nice game
8851,"This game is actually a lot of fun

Very simple to learn but very hard to master. Pitted against others in pvp action. Every round is different and the flow can change in a single round from you dominating to losing.
Also you can take it with you on the road because you can play on mobile.
And its free and thats a good price."
8852,Un vrai auto chess n'en déplaise à certains

8866,it s ok
8867,GGWP! GLHF!
8868,"It was good and I played it a lot when it was first released but I don't like the new rotations and Underlords, seems like it takes away from the essence of what the game was supposed to be in the first place."
8869,Time well spend with this game
8870,required brain LOL
8871,"Easy to play, hard to master"

8905,the new update about death match is great. no need 30mins play anymore
8906,the best game makes people who don't play MOBA games recognize characters in dota2 that are lower and more likely they are interested in playing dota2.
8907,"Inspired by dota2's custom game Autochess, this game uses a variety of heroes, items, passives, and abilities to battle against opponents on the chessboard. There are various variables to make the game fun to play."
8908,be good nice to play this

8994,"Fun game, its good when you are looking for a game that is about strategy and luck.  It's a good way to start to learn hero roles for DOTA as well if you are newer to the game or are getting in late.  You can play against bots to unlock the perks too if you want and you can also team up with another friend to strategize together as a team.  Especially for a free to play game, this is one I would definitely recommend to my friends.  Warning though: a short game is about an hour.  Unless you are playing with bots, do not plan to be done with the game before at least an hour has passed."

a time sink for a bit at times frustrating. won't live long"
9014,"What can I say. This game is both incredibly simple and complicated. It is hard to win but also hard to lose. Good with friends and quick enough to play a bit here and there. 8/10 would recommend (I mean it's free, try it)."
9015,batscho
9016,yes
9017,"Overall ok, but Game is mostly based on luck. The adding of underlords makes it so all boards feel more or less the same, either a fire burn board or a healing board. Needs an option to turn them off"

9060,Nice Game!
9061,"Addictive gameplay, randomness of encounters. Gameplay is pretty balanced for new players. Mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master. Easily it's one of the best f2p games for peple who like semi-turn based tactical combat. But still I also recommend to try chinese auto-chess."
9062,game gets boring after a while fun nonetheless.
9063,Entretenido por un rato pero es demasiado aleatorio como para jugarlo por mas tiempo hasta que lo afinen un poco

9085,good game but feel like i never know what im doing... need to play more
9086,"Pros 
-Strategic depth
-no pay to win
-free to play
cons
-learning curve.

If you enjoy dota autochess or other similar games you can get a good deal of enjoyment out of this game. Dota underlords like many other autochess games has you start with a small amount of gold and has you buy a single unit to put on your board. Every round you will Have the option of buying more units > randomly get paired with a player in the game and watch your units battle their units > Get gold after the fightings over (you get bonus gold for winning) > have another opportunity to buy units before next round. The tricky part is figuring out how to build a good team so you can keep winning and make your way to victory.  Theres lots of strategic depth in teambuilding buy figuring out how to build a decent team throughout the game takes a bit of learning."

9234,good game need big brain
9235,"Taste like DOTA, play like a chess.
It is complex, and sometimes overly convoluted.
Jail system is great to keep the meta fresh even though regular balancing is a must.
RNG dependent...

Nonetheless, still a good time waster if you are a frequent traveler (can be played offline with potato phone as well :D )"
9236,very fun
9237,best game you will ever find better than hearthstone and artifatc :)
9238,well norm game

9257,This game is great!
9258,This game was better before  the underlords update!
9259,"Although I don't really find myself compelled to learn the various intricacies and interactions Dota Underlords has to offer, I do find it to be a relaxing enough time-waster in the same way that good idle-games are. That combined with its pristine presentation is enough to get a recommendation from me. It has depth for players who seek it but also works well as a casual experience for players like me who prefer to play it at their own pace against bots while focused on something else entirely."

9270,Help.
9271,"Really fun take on the auto chess genre. 
It adds with duos and placable barricades or puching bags that allow for more tactical gameplay. 

It's also the first one to introduce a faster playing mode with knockout that does more than just crank up the gold rate. 
It still needs balancing and even more important - Good PR so more player jump in, but what's there is a really well done start!"

The devs are extremely dedicated to the game and want to make it better. Constant updates and the meta shifts daily."
9334,"With the new Duos mode - great fun with a friend - and even newer Knockout mode - blazingly fast! - Underlords should be the undisputed king of its genre. If you're at all intrigued by the concept, you should definitely try it out."
9335,A HOT GAME AFTER ALLL...

9400,Review for task lol
9401,"I initially went into Dota Underlords having an idea what an auto chess game was. And a while later, I'm still sure the craze. If it were just Dota Underlords, sure, why not, but there's been Auto Chess, Chess Rush, Teamfight Tactics… That's a lot of games in the same vein popping up at the same time. Dota Underlords sure did a Great job!."

9480,"This game has one of the best dev teams in the industry, they release good fair content.  That being said, some of their ideas have vastly ruined this game.  The addition of overlords is not fun, they are not easy to balance and they only serve to highlight underlying problematic abilities.  The amount of CC in the game is extremely high, building tanky/healers has been (too) strong since the second patch of the game.  When a match lasts upwards of an hour in this genre it simply is not worth playing...

Knockout mode is fun for bursts but lacks depth; in its current state i cant recommend that you invest time in this game beyond the 10 minute knockout modes here and there."
9481,"This game is great; I loved the intro, when you come to from the rocking of the horse-drawn wagon.  I could tell there is a lot of attention to detail in the scenery, between the snow-covered trees and mountainous path, even though it was obscured by an ominous fog.  The voice acting is excellent too, as a gruff ""Hey! You're finally awake!"" made me realize that I was a shackled prisoner about to receive his fate.  As our prisoner wagon rolled into a Nordic village (great cobblestone details by the way) and we disembarked into the hands of the Imperials, the tension felt real and compelling."
9482,"Mostly rng, but fun if your winning."

9492,i have no idea whats going on
9493,"Game has a lot of rng, and it's pretty much nothing like dota. But overall it's ok i guess."
9494,The best game in the word
9495,Very Zajebis Game
9496,yes
9497,"Amazing game at first, adding walls and dummies to the loot pool was an odd choice, adding hero commanders made it a completely different game, now if you want to play autochess as it's known anywhere else you have to go...anywhere else to find it. Still somewhat fun but Valve tried too hard to innovate in the Cave Johnson style of throwing ALL the ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks. 50/50 on whether I can actually recommend it."
9498,"Nice upgrade from dota auto chess, with regular updates"
9499,this is good game
9500,I suck at this but it's good.
9501,"Very enjoyable if somewhat hard to figure out initially. You'll find the strategy curve very steep against experienced players, much like Dota 2."
9502,POG AUTOCHESS BUT WITH BUDGET :)
9503,berry c00l game
9504,I like how involved the devs are. The game always feel like a new start everyday =D
9505,ok
9506,hey i LIKED it
9507,Ever changing game at this point in time. Not always in a good way.
9508,"Very nice game as well as Dota!
The last update its great!"
9509,LOW
9510,"If you're a fan of auto-chess games, you should to sink your time into this one."
9511,"Dota ""Not quite Dota 2"" Underlords"
9512,"Kinda like autochess
"
9513,"Very fun and addicting, just gets a bit redundant at times"
9514,"FIrst time maybe hard to understand how does it work, but if you like the mind games and have enough luck its your game."
9515,It's pretty good.
9516,"great game always changing
"
9517,"Its like Team-Fight Tactics, 8/10 not as good"
9518,"I used to like it before the huge update. Still, you might play this as a time-killer or something."
9519,fun
9520,Gg
9521,great gane
9522,very addictive and challenging
9523,Co-op was probably the best decision they made for this game
9524,"Can be hard to get into, but a fun game nonetheless"
9525,!
9526,Its decent but requires a lot of time investment
9527,The more you play the better it becomes.
9528,a good game with new gameplay and the update always balance.. and addicting
9529,"Yeah, I suck at this... :)"
9530,"Dota Autochess made in to a proper game.

After playing the Autochess workshop map for Dota 2, I was expecting this to be just a polished version of that. After some of the updates the team working on this have proven to have plenty of ideas of their own outside of what the original Autochess team worked with.

Every update they've done feels like it makes the game better and more interesting. I feel that the development team has also been unusually responsive to feedback and active with the community unlike with some of Valve's previous projects.

My only issue is the odd choice of changing voice lines and style for some of the characters which feels weird coming from years of playing Dota 2.

It's not just Dota Autochess made in to a proper game, but a better one!"
9531,Casual and slow-paced enough to play while watching a stream. Deep and complex requiring quick thinking and fast actions if you want to climb ranks. This game can be enjoyed in multiple ways and different playstyles.
9532,not that cool.
9533,fair decent
9534,все еще нет
9535,Great fun
9536,addicting
9537,Even if it's not that famous like Teamfight tactics it's still easy to understand and fun to play autochess game and I would recommend to everyone who loves autochess
9538,Very fun game worth your time.
9539,"Good game, and the mobile crossplay is really good, sometimes luck isn't on my side, but sometime it is."
9540,fun
9541,Good Mobile game
9542,"fun, like dota but easy"
9543,Polished version of battle chess and it plays well on both mobile and PC which is the best thing as achievements and etc are all sync.
9544,very addictive
9545,"I think I need to leave a review for this but I've hardly played it.  

From what I've gathered, you press buttons, and then stop pressing buttons and hope for the best."
9546,freaking awesome
9547,modern chess
9548,Really good game with plenty of content updates.
9549,"Dota Underlords seemingly re-invents itself every month or two, making the game feel like a completely new experience."
9550,"
This games that sharpen the brain, interesting and of course make us better understand how to choose the right hero with the choices that have been given in order to win"
9551,KEKW
9552,good n fun to play even on mobile
9553,fun game just sit back and relax and let the minions do everything
9554,"Great game, for me seems to be the most balanced of the auto chess type of games. The daily jailing feature keeps the game fresh without the need to constantly add in more units."
9555,nice.
9556,Keep updating like a badass!
9557,"Всё было хорошо до BIG UPDAT'а. Потенциал был,но его уничтожили."
9558,Joguei para experimentar e estou gostando do jogo.
9559,I don't know just try
9560,Better version of auto chess
9561,A fantastic game
9562,"This is a fun game! Not knowing the dota units isn't a huge deal. You draft line units of units o varying strengths and synergies and make strategic decisions about which units to try and integrate based on what you get and what other people are going for. It's fun and fairly chill, check it out."
9563,Less rage inducing than Dota 2! Then again you can really only say YO!
9564,never liked a card game .
9565,"Very cool game, I always beat all the easy bots. :P"
9566,The most lovable strategy game based on dota2 that many improve in this game and make this so complex
9567,Such a fun game!
9568,"Wish to see some progression like gain items, skins or something that can make us feel we are acheiving something other than playing dota chess."
9569,Typical autochess game
9570,daas
9571,nicee

9595,"For being Valve's only game released in 2019, it manages to pack a punch compared to Artifact which fizzled out last year. The gameplay is basic Auto Chess with a Hero spin - the Underlords. The newly introduced Knockout mode is in my opinion the most fun you can have in this game. And it's FREE!"
9596,"I only tried Autochess in Dota once and didn't care for it, but this one has enough extra polish to make it fun. Also being on mobile is a huge plus. Good time waster."
9597,meh

9621,"First ever auto battle format, but getting outpaced by TFT and Hearthstone"
9622,"First of its kind, illuminated by mod makers, this game is a firestarter, and has a good reason for it.
If you like playing Dota, and if you like chance and strategy based card games, such as ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" you will like this one aswell."
9623,"Good Game




100% not for nomination"
9624,"Really good game, love it"
9625,NICE
9626,"Game is a blast, I typically play solo against bots in protopass or with a friend using the duos game mode. It's somewhat difficult to get the hang of, but once you understand it, challenges become super easy and when not doing a challenge, against bots at least it is super easy to win overall if not close behind in 2nd."

9631,Best game in 10 years time!

9633,Fun and addictive without being too serious! It's a great game to sit down and just unwind playing. With the new DUO mode adding a friend into the mix makes for some interesting strategies.

9652,its a fun game
9653,Startet playing this when it came out. Since then i havn´t played that much and i have the feeling that u need to play on a constant basis to keep up with the chances. Still a very good auto chess game tht i would recommend.
9654,Good free game.
9655,Frequently updated gameplay with a nice duo mode to play with a friend.

Sent from my Iphone X"
9661,"Are you someone who still battles in video games by using your fingers to directly input commands, like some kind of barbarian? That’s old hat. Today, auto-battlers are all the rage. Simply buy some guys, arrange said guys, and they (the guys) will do the battling for you. With Dota Underlords, Valve rushed to capitalize on the trend that began with a user-created mod of its own game Dota 2. So far, Underlords’ speedy turnaround seems to have paid off"
9662,Underlords
9663,Good ok?
9664,really great game

9693,A chess with extra steps...or it's fewer?
9694,"I hope there's an auto guide first so that I would learn how to play this game.
DUMB at first and I noticed that I became dumb for 2 hours of playing.
So, I uninstalled and quit the game."

9703,Even more cancer filled then actual Dota
9704,"I played this Dota Underlords as soon as it's released. It was barely a half-finished game at that time, so I gave it up. After quite a long time, I am very surprised to find out now that it has turn into a new game! So many great changes. If Valve really decides to make a game, it will be great for sure.
2020.11.26 第二次回坑，快速模式真好玩。和大半年前相比没太大变化，但是手感好了很多，引导也做得好了"
9705,Addict game
9706,yesssssssss
9707,It has the letter U in the name
9708,It is okay I guess?
9709,Valve makes this game become garbage. Trash Valve?
9710,Cool Game
9711,"Innovative, fast and fun!

Gets repetetive after a while"
9712,Knockout mode made it more interesting!
9713,Good for dota players but it is like a chess game. The learning curve is easy so newer players do not have to worry about previous dota players. The new update changed the gameplay  a little bit but still it's good.
9714,Much fun but i do hope they keep adding new stuff before it gets boring
9715,шашки
9716,Its ok
9717,Nice chill game

9720,"Very nice, muchos updates at a good pace"
9721,The game is very good
9722,it okay
9723,hey its pretty good
9724,RNG god
9725,"It's a game.


Edit:
It's a match 3 combined with an auto-battler, two things which have existed separately but were put together successfully by the devs behind Dota Auto-Chess. This is Valve's iteration on the original design after Riot remembered how to get 'inspiration'.

Not recommended because of dependence on RNG management. They've added more things to mitigate it but I haven't played since those updates so I can only not-recommend based on what I have played. If you like card games this could be quite appealing to you."
9726,nice game
9727,this game is cool but i dont like chess kk
9728,yes
9729,"Love that it's free, very challenging. Need RNG and skills. Visuals are OK.

9737,"A pesar de ""colgarse"" del exito que tuvo Dota Chess, realmente supo tomar la idea y llevarla mas lejos agregando cosas que pueden parecer obvias pero que se necesitaban, lo que a su vez logar una excelente rejugabilidad, sumado a las constantes actualizaciones que recibe. Realmente lo recomiendo y mas aun si lo juegas con amigos"

9753,It's a good game but it's very hard to play
9754,"It's becoming more and more complicated. I'm wondering if I should turn to others. New alliances and Lords and Jail... I just wanna play a game and have some fun, not be played by producer. Weekly update looks like a DLC..."

9805,"A perfect time-killer for your boring desk job. It has shown itself to be different from the initial idea of Auto Chess by Drodo with its own color and honestly, even if some of the function in the game is still the same as its predecessor, the game has become much more distinct and that's definitely a good thing."

9864,"It s ok, to waste some time."
9865,Really good and fun game to play when you have apsoultely nothing else to do and you want to remind yourself why you stoped playing Dota 2  in first place. But still good to kill time. And to remind you how Dota 2 become bad even if you dont play dota 2 any more.

10025,"Underlords, is a really fun game that is a creative new spin on Auto-chess. The 2 characters they've currently release are both quite fun and they both have fantastic voice lines. This is game you can casually play, in fact its so casual, you can essentially leave for half the game and come back and still win, because no one really understands how to get a good economy. This game is fairly balanced and when you start to find really good loadouts the game becomes easier, however, this can lead to the game getting stale but other than that pretty top notch game. Love how it gets updates unlike my favourite game TF2. 

All in all 8/10 a bit easy and some things aren't that fun but, totally give it a try"
10026,Love the changes as games like this  would die without exciting huge updates
10027,Good Game play easy to understand mechanics but heavily rng based game
10028,Pretty neat game
10029,After they added Duos the game became 1000% more fun. Being able to team with a friend and try different comps are what keeps me playing this game. 10/10 would recommend.

10049,"Really great game overall, already a lot of fun. Constant additions and balance changes, as it is still early access."
10050,good game
10051,"FINALLY! We get what we call ""Knockout,"" which doesn't take 30+ minutes to finish a game! Now that this has happened, this is by far one of the BEST Autochess/Autobattler games out! I love this game! I find it very hard sometimes because the ""luck"" part of the game is kind of annoying but it's always fun and I love that they are constantly changing things! Keep the updates coming! It would be cool if we could customize our chess board though like the other ""Autochess"" games out there. Dota Underlords is amazing and ... it's still in Early Access. I'm impressed. Thank you.

Also, I am a huge Autochess player, I have put many of hours into: Chess Rush, Auto Chess, AOE: Red Tides, etc. And I think Dota Underlords is pretty damn great! Plaaaaay it! Don't let the luck make you quit. You'll have your good games and your bad ones. That's just how it works!

I do recommend."

10104,"Great game, developers keep iterating during beta based on community feedback"

10106,Latest updates have made game way to RNG dependent. It really hurts the gameplay experience to go undefeated until round 20 and then lose because the free rerolls gave another player everything they needed to win.

10345,"Sometimes less is more. This game was better and easier to figure out back when there was far less going on. There's so much visual noise on the board now.

One thing that makes these kinds of games good in the Dota Chess genre is that you can see the actions, power, and shortcomings of your individual pieces. I.E. you see that your choices matter. This has now basically been ruined in this game.

For context, the recent update has added the Underlords, which are essentially a Hero unit. The problem is these guys (only 2 in the game right now) have like 10+ abilities, and you can't tell when they're triggering or what they're doing in a visibly noticeable way. It adds way more noise to the board, and it's generally just a pointless feature. The game was fine without them, they feel super gimmicky, and it erases some of the cool parts about the game, like having each game and team feel different.

Additionally, Underlords have extra abilities only unlocked if you're already doing really well in the game, so that's something else added to snowball early success and prevent come-back victories.

Additionally, the recent update has destroyed the existing, simple, readable UI to accomdate the Underlords' extra features and stuff that just the amount of screen the Underlords UI takes up is almost as big as the entirety of the old UI. The whole UI now is very clunky, things moved into very un-instinctive places.

I doubt that any of this gets reverted. But the game was better when it was leaner, simpler, and easier to read. While choices you make still matter, it's way harder to see that difference play out.

Additionally this recent update added a load of new chess pieces, a couple new alliances, and shuffled/changes almost all the previous ones. I'll give this the benefit of the doubt and say it's okay because if you play long enough you'll learn them, but many feel very unintuitive. While on the surface, adding more chess pieces seems like a good thing, it just ends up clogging up your draws and decreasing the chance you have of getting the specific pieces you want for your composition. If you were already not jazzed about the RNG of whether or not you drew this certain hero to round out your team, just wait til there's 20+ more heroes that you can possibly get on top of the existing ones that will come up instead."

10367,best auto battler 2019
10368,"Good game, something that is not Dota Artifacts, but to me may still become stale pretty fast as the gameplay is much of the same over and over again, but that might just be because i am usually not the 'board slash card game' kind of guy. Furthermore it is good to see all the love it gets from Valve's side in regards to the amount of updates and how they sometimes are tied to their other games like Dota 2. 

Valve originally made this game as they actually wanted to hire the modders who made the original concept as a Dota 2 mod, but the modding team refused to work together with Valve on a standalone version and instead got hired to Tencent, so Valve did what else was possible and made their own version of the mod, which is what we now know as Dota Underlords."
10369,died too young
10370,meh
10371,Nice game
10372,Great game with weekly updates. Very clear the devs care about this one. Also its free so what have you got to lose? give it a try

10381,"Absolutely amazing and addictive game play. Easy to pick up in quick games and new game modes are constantly being put out for variety as well as new champions, alliances, items and more. Underlords has a ton of depth and strategy mixed in with quick game play. This game is so amazing that even the bot game play is very well done and can teach so much by just playing against bots and you can even earn XP for cosmetics through bots! When you've gained enough knowledge try out online vs or even competitive, they are a blast! 10/10 this game is worth it and it is free!"
10382,good
10383,"I may get boned every other game but that's not too different than how I go about life too. Sure it hurts a little to sit down after, but boy do I love the cuddling afterwards. 11/10 would recommend everyone give the game a try at least once. It's also free, unlike my time which I keep using to play more of this game."
10384,"This game is a love letter from Valve for those who love to play games in Auto-battler genre. People coming from the original Auto Chess hugely dislike the game, however; the game gets better each week with many updates as well as with experience as you play. If your initial reaction to the game is to dislike it, I highly suggest that you stick around and play a couple of games before deciding the fate of it in your mind. The game has a lot of potential and more depth compared to the other Auto-Battler games in the market."
10385,Good stuff.
10386,Great game a little confusing at first but you get the hang of it.

10436,"i can't see it   
it was invisible"
10437,"Game has potential, there is something addictive, but also kind of boring about it.

Let's try and elaborate.

Mindlessly getting better will always feel good, and that will happen in this game. Now, when it comes to consciously getting good, yes, you can put effort into that and you will be rewareded.

I can tell they have tons of plans for this game, characters they want to add, game modes they want to balance, etc. And I do believe the game can be pretty fun. I played Auto-chess, it was more complex and harder to pick up, some people who like challengues and being preassured may enjoy that, but, for the casual players that picks this up every now and then, it's a chill time. The game will capture your attention when you let it and each game you will keep learning about cynergies and all that stuff so you can keep improving. Worth trying out I'd say."

10442,I've been playing this game almost every night before I sleep. I wake up and feel tired but i still do it everyday. I always expect a chill game but every damn time it gets me pumped which results in me sleeping for 4-6 hours every night.  I may have a problem but do i care? nah. Gonna continue playing this before i sleep.

10474,"First of all, the game is updated frequently, so the gameplay doesn't get stale and it is always exiting to play for a casual and an invested player.
Secondly, the atmosphere of the game is great, as you get emreged into the game. This happens due to great style and graphics, alongside a pleasant UI (user interface).
Also, commanding a lot of beloved DOTA characters and combining their powers to make awesome synergies is a lot of fun.
To sum it all up, the game has a nice style, easy and relaxing gameplay, rewarding for mastering. However, you need to invest a significant amount of time into it, which can be hard for a lot of people"

Would that be a turbo mode? How about make a longer strategy time every 5 rounds, for formation; but make the strategy time a lot less, for a quicker pace? Players could draw cards when the autoplay is on anyway."

10703,"A great fun ""Auto Chess"" game but more than you think; dota 2 carries over its charm and world with unique characters and this quick strategy game can start to get challenging and intense at times, but the humor keeps you playing for days on end."

10705,OK.. i want not good at this game hahahaha
10706,"Great pastime, especially on mobile.

High luck factor, limited skill influence.

However, well-maintained and updated from now and the RNG factor is successfully straddling the line between being overbearing and keeping the game fresh and replayable."

10719,"Excellent game to spend some little time, it's easy to pickup but hard to master"
10720,why not
10721,"Played it since it was a custom game on Dota 2, it was the only reason I kept the dota 2 on my PC, when I downloaded dota underlords, I simply removed Dota, pretty fun game, still in it's early stages, but the updates are amazing."

10747,Pretty fun!

11123,The main feature i like about this is that it is connected to your android as well. you can play it on your phone or pc for the same profile. But it would be really better if they improved the UI for the game on android.

11153,"This game is best with friends who has microphone because dous mode is really good
"
11154,"This is a solid entry into the ""auto chess"" genre (I suppose it has it's own genre now). I enjoy the item strategy in the game with the ability to swap between champions at will. It has continued to be updated but at it handles the core gameplay well since the beginning and will continue to be a quick fun game to play during your downtime."

11169,"more fun than dota itself tbh. started as a mod, turned into the real deal. with permission from the original creators ofc. also has a lot of potential to be monetized, without affecting gameplay, exactly the opposite of artifact.
underlords is what artifact had to be but failed."

11213,good
11214,"I felt like updating this review, and unfortunately, changing it to a negative one. The game has been abandoned by the developer and no longer receives any updates whatsoever. Not even minor ones rotating the factions available, which is a shame since there are several that used to exist and have been removed back when it did receive updates. Meta is very stale and ""figured out"" nowadays as a result. Still a fairly fun game for what it is, probably still has the best duo mode in the genre, but no longer a worthy competitor.

It's a real shame since, in my opinion, it had a lot of potential to stand on its own and was a very fun game when it was actually receiving support. I guess Valve disagreed, I don't know, I can't see their financials or player activity.

Either way, the game is hardly worth getting into anymore. Just play TFT or Auto Chess instead, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a better experience in the long run with them, albeit Underlords can still be fun for a couple of games here and there until you get bored of what's there I guess.

Old review can be found below the line, albeit it is now outdated and no longer accurate. Sadly.


----------------------


Polished, currently receiving regular content and balance updates, has systems in place that allow for complex gameplay and decision making as well as systems in place for shaking up the gameplay and meta on a daily basis. Pretty great, it's like playing a virtual deckbuilding cardgame crossed with a tabletop board game. It's also available on mobile, where it currently works alright depending on device, meaning you can bring the game and your progress wherever. If you like strategic but somewhat relaxed gameplay that feels a bit like playing a card/board game, then give it a shot."
11215,Very interesting auto-battler with lots of original features

11274,Better improvements but needs fairness somewhat.
11275,"Dota characters without the click-heavy gameplay of original Dota.  Fun auto-chess.  Nice variety of combinations, from early dominations to late game heroics.   Recommend you give it a fair try.

Edit: I have to admit with the latest Outlander update, the extra number of heroes adds more randomness to the character levelling pool as others have mentioned. But I've found that does not detract from the fun factor."

11323,"Very intricate game with a lot or replayability. Constant updates keep mixing things up. This will be your new addiction, provided you stopped playing Dota 2. This is a full game derived from a mod which created a new genre. This game is a mixture of an afk clicker game, a slot machine, and a excel spreadsheet simulator with the added tension of a timer always pushing you to think ahead and act as quickly as you can. It's a ton of fun and addicting. Highly recommended."

It is much more complex and in depth in game built mechanics than other automatic chess game. It pushed you to be much more flexible, changing strategies from round to round, while other similar games may work with just one build using one ""class"" or ""race"" to gain a winning streak. Overall it's a good an still developing game."

11520,"Kinda boring, not gonna lie."
11521,fun to playy
11522,cool game
11523,i guess its noteworthy in that it set the stage for a new genre? but yeah it's fun. addictive. changes a lot which you might see as good or bad.

11548,the best auto chess
11549,"Есть ты понимаешь как в него играть,поздравляю ты аутист"
11550,Pretty good as a fill in to pass some time
11551,"I had a blast playing with friends at a gaming party this past summer. The constant updates (very frequent still as of the review date) make it less appealing for me to play right now, although in the long term, the additions and tweaks should be great for the game."
11552,Muito bom o game! Viciante! E roda liso no Ubuntu 18.04!
11553,Enjoying tihs game so far.
11554,"I was a HUUUUGE supporter of this game for most if not all of the pre launch stuff, but now that is in season 1 I have many, many issues with the game. All of the effort put in by those who played during the proto pass has been completely removed, and all the items we had received are no longer part of the game. It feels like I've wasted 100 hours and received nothing from it. The whole reason I completed the pass was so that I'd have the items for when we reached season 1, and now that I have to start from scratch again it really makes me wanna not touch the game again. I was fully prepared and had been hyped to buy the Season 1 Battle Pass... but now I really doubt I will. Will the season 1 items just be removed when season 2 rolls around? What's the point in playing a game if there is no withstanding progression through it. None of my issues with the game from pre-launch were addressed within season 1 and I really feel like I have no reason to come back and re join the community. Unless they undo their ridiculous decision to remove all of these proto-pass items (which I doubt they will), I probably won't be coming back to this game, which is very sad for me because I did enjoy it for a while there."
11555,Nossa.
11556,game was fun until it wasn't
11557,Very fun auto-chess.
11558,RNG garbage

11562,great game its better than TFT in my opinion
11563,"Although it has a couple issues here and there (i.e, matches are a bit much long...), there are many updates and improvement being made and there's alot more communication from the devs compared to the other Valve titles. Plus, it's f2p, which is yet another reason to at least give it a try"

11581,Great game! Appreciate how the devs are so transparent and updates are very consistent. The proto pass also helps in making the grind more fun.
11582,need more major update
11583,"Little known, niche game worth your attention."
11584,ok
11585,"For me Underlords is the best adaptation of auto chess. I like that you can chose item from neutral, there is a lot less RNG then in other adaptations.
Big plus is also that developers communicate with players and trying to listen to them. (other Valves division should take this as example of good work)"
11586,its ok~
11587,its cool
11588,我是傻逼
11589,fun game that has a focus on strategy and knowing the meta that is a fun game. rounds last 30-45 minutes but that time flys by like nothing

11605,great game i like it too much
11606,pretty guud
11607,"It's difficult to write about one autobattler without comparing it to its rivals (Teamfight Tactics, and the original Dota Autochess mode), but Underlords is a great solo game in its own right. Your job is to fill up the chess-grid battlefield in front of you with heroes from the Dota universe, hunting down multiple copies of the same character in the hero shop between each round of fighting to level them up and beef up your team. The beefiest team knocks out the other 7 competitors and wins, although there isn't much of a ranking system as of yet to track how much beef you've wrangled. 

Yes, you are limited to watching the AI fight with these heroes (and sometimes the AI can be very bad at fighting), but as their 'GM' you have a deep level of control over equipable items, positioning, composition and economy management, so you never feel powerless. Each round pits you against a different player in a little self-contained duel, and over time you develop organic rivalries with other teams as you take turns smashing each others faces in. Those emergent stories and desperate shop rerolls are what breathe life into the game, and this is twice as true in the inspired Duos mode that lets you share economy and heroes with a friend. 

Much like Dota, it's a very obtuse and complex game to the outsider, but you get the hang of it quickly. Grab a friend and get in on the autobattler craze while its hot."
11608,"The game feels rushed, like they didn't had enough time to tune it to its perfection. Too much luck based for a game that is carrying the name of DOTA around which is like the ultimate skill based game ever. Though, it is bringing a new type of game to the market which seems accepting. Worth a try."
11609,Gitgud
11610,typa lakat matatag

11626,"Good autobattler, still rough around the edges, expected for early access, but a great game to play. Hopefully the mobile Ui continues to improve.


UPDATE: Game is dead now. No updates will ever happen again. Still a decent autobattler but you'll only be playing against bots."
11627,Is gud
11628,Nominating because of Steam awards Lucky you I picked you!
11629,"Pokemon custom map, DotA 2 edition, plus some nice mechanics added. But seriously though, I f**king hate RNG."
11630,"Dota Chess was far better, but i can see the game improving with a little more dedication..."
11631,Bad.
11632,Fun game to play on the go.
11633,"It's like auto-chess and DOTA, but worst than both!"
11634,Good game during work
11635,"Usually I wait to finish a game before I review a game, but with [i]Dota Underlords[/i], there does not seem to be an end in sight. And I have accrued more hours playing the game than any other game on Steam (other than [i]Final Fantasy XIV[/i]). [i]Underlords[/i] is the Valve offering in the ""auto battler"" genre where you recruit armies that battle on your behalf: auto battles are a bit like automated games of chess. [i]Underlords[/i] is a fun, fast paced strategy game that draws direct inspiration from the large pool of heroes from Dota 2, and in 2019, the game continues to undergo constant development and improvement. This is the game I hoped [i]Artifact[/i] would be.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
In Valve's version of the auto battler, you recruit heroes for your army that you pit against against an opponent's army one round at a time. Whether you play against human or AI opponents, an entire match of [i]Underlords[/i] begins with eight teams. You start with limited resources which limit how many heroes you can recruit for your army each turn or how many available slots are in your army. Over the course of the match, you strategically spend or save resources to expand your army size, buy heroes that complement each other through alliances, or upgrade heroes (e.g. if you purchase three copies of a one-star hero, the hero is upgraded to a two-star hero). Winning matches typically gives you more gold resources, while losing costs you life: you start the match with 100 life, and if your life total reaches zero, you lose. And if all your opponents' life totals reach zero before you, you win the match. That is [i]Underlords[/i] in a nutshell, but over the first few months of the game's existence, gameplay mechanics have changed, itemization has changed, new heroes have been introduced, hero abilities have changed, hero alliances have changed, etc. For example, the game recently introduced two ""underlord"" characters who lead your armies by boosting or assisting the armies through various abilites. 

One thing to note is that each round, when your are recruiting heroes, you will be present with five heroes at random, and they may not be the heroes you are looking for. This introduces an element of chance to the game, which can help or hurt you. Also, every few rounds there is a ""neutral"" round where you fight a group of monsters; at the conclusion of those battles, you get to pick from 3-4 items or global powers that improve your army. Which items are available to you is also dictated by chance.  Finally, as the size of your army grows, the recruitment rounds are more likely to present higher-level heroes for your consideration; there are currently five tiers of heroes, and generally speaking the higher-tier heroes are stronger than their lower-tier counterparts.

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
The large pool of heroes used in [i]Underlords[/i] is based on the heroes from Valve's Dota 2 game, and they are a big reason why I consider the game a success: they just bring the game a lot of character. The gameplay itself revolves around the art of creating an army with heroes that complement each other, carry the proper items, and who are positioned on the board in a way to best overtake your opponents' armies. As you accumulate experience in the game, you also acquire some cosmetic enhancements for your army and your board, such as banners, lighting effects, and so forth.


[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
No story here. The atmosphere is based on the fantasy setting derived from Dota 2.

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
The hero animation are largely borrowed from Dota 2, I would imagine, as are probably some of the audio clips. With the introduction of the Underlords characters, there is some original content as well.  The main item of interest as far as graphics are concerned is the user interface. It has also undergone some changes during the first few months. Presumably the changes have been driven by qualify of life improvements for the sake of gameplay.  I have actually played the game on both PC and on Android, and I will say that I enjoy the game much more on my widescreen monitor than on my smartphone screen--it is playable, but there is much less room for error when using the smaller touch screen as opposed to using point-and-click or keyboard commands on the PC. In any case, the user interface continues to evolve but, honestly, has been in a pretty good shape from the very beginning.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] Yes. An [i]Underlords[/i] match takes about 30-35 minutes. Each match will have 20-30+ rounds of battles versus opponents. Obviously, the better your army, the longer you survive, and fight more rounds.

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 9/10.  There are other auto battlers out there on PC and in the mobile world--I am quite fond of Supercell's [i]Boom Beach[/i] and [i]Clash of Clans[/i] prior to that, assuming they qualify in a roundabout way.  Since I have not honestly played other auto battlers on PC (aside from the Heartstone offering), I do not know if [i]Underlords[/i] is the best of these, but I definitely love playing the game. At any given point in time, whether I win or lose a round or a match, the game is a 10/10, but I am hedging my score in case the developers make a wrong turn somewhere during this indefinite beta phase. Most of their changes have been for the better, but every once in a while, they make a change that makes me sad or introduces a bug--although most bugs are squashed within a day, if not hours.

[i]Played in 2019 - .[/i]"

11680,They took the Team Fight Tactics game mode idea from Riot.
11681,"Well, a lot of people are criticizing the game for it's visuals, but two things need to be taken into account before making up your mind.

1) The game is early in development. Alpha and early Beta footage of Dota 2 looked nothing like the modern version of Dota, so it should be expected that Valve will improve and polish the look of Underlords with time.

2) More importantly, Valve seems to be developing Underlords under the “mobile first” principle. This means that people are in reality playing the “mobile version” on PC, and the final PC version will likely look different."
11682,better than artifact
11683,no updates :(

11726,"the changing meta is not the bad side, it gettin slowly better"
11727,Exceedingly fun and Valve is constantly pushing out fresh updates. While I was initially disappointed with the Underlords feature they have since been fixed. Worth checking out with almost every update.

11798,Good game
11799,"Though there have been rough patches since its initial launch, it is a good feeling knowing that the game continues being worked on. Looking past its somewhat lack of polish gives you the same addicting game of auto chess that you are looking for. If an unpolished or perhaps incomplete game bothers you, you might be better of looking at one of the other Autochess titles. 

One of the biggest strengths of Dota Underlords is its accessibility to those who are not well versed in its original title, in this case being Dota 2. It is easy to pick up. Not only because the core gameplay of Autochess is so straight forward, but also because the developers have put great effort in making everything easy to recognise and understand."
11800,The game is quite addictive when we start playing into it.
11801,Really enjoy this game and i'm not even a Dota fan.
11802,This is just gambling with extra steps.
11803,6/10
11804,The game is enjoyable sometimes. More of this is based on RNG and hero type. Need to learn more.

11811,"O game é legalzinho, não é muito meu estilo, mas não deixa de ser bom!"
11812,"Once spent tens of hours in it. It still started with a custom map in Dota 2. Perhaps, during this time, there were many controversial updates. But I am still pleased with the perfectly working synchronization between the PC and the smartphone. There aren't many good games on a smartphone, but this one is a great option."
11813,Dead game
11814,meh?

11840,"It keeps some of the same fun tactics of Dota while giving it the relaxed play style of auto chess. I've had hours of fun finding new combos, and ways to win. I'm also beyond pleased that it's still free to play and updating fairly consistently all things considered."
11841,Looks like a great game but i am bad at it
11842,Was better without Underlords to be honest. Still fun though :)
11843,is okay
11844,I like this game because you can also play on your phone
11845,Game not bad
11846,"Nice games btw.

11872,"Pretty good. Can seem very random and it is not always clear why you are losing.

Knockout mode is great for quick games.
Underlords is sorta meh, needs more work."

11881,perfect game for perfect time
11882,"Fast updates, good gameplay, so far 10/10"
11883,"It's decent, but the Underlords and long main game mode take too long. They should get rid of Underlords and replace them with a Rune system like LoL has."
11884,good game
11885,"If you're a fan of DoTA this is for you.
if you aren't but you enjoy solid gameplay this game will scratch a unique itch.
you may not care about the characters but the engine, the UI and the VALVENESS of it all really allows it to shine. it's like a mobile game that doesnt feel like a bad mobile game"

11948,muito loco é tipo hert stone
11949,"Even tho it's not my cup of tea, it's still a great game. You need to think a lot on your next move, because of the complexity of the characters, abilities, and the opponents' characters."

11957,Good
11958,One of the better Auto Chess. with a Dota twist. But the seriousness of the game really intensifies and makes it more unique than rest of the auto chess  based games.
11959,Boring
11960,"Auto chess is a fun game, generally as mechanics, nothing new or special. Problem is it is based on rng, so you can go pretty good early, or pretty shitty till the end. In that case end comes very fast. If you like that type of games then sure play. I not stay away, you are not missing."
11961,"Yup, is good"

11968,nice video game made by vulva e-gaming company
11969,a not good game for no brainer
11970,It's fine but it looks like a mobile game. The UI is no as i wish but its a decent game. 7/10

11997,"The creators of this totally f***** the game sideways with all of these changes being implemented at once... Terrible idea. Whoever pushed this game that far should be fired. It's totally unrecognizable and bland now. About 10 of us went from playing daily, to not playing at all, and none of us talked about. We just all collectively stopped playing within the last few updates. That alone should tell the story of who you guys should fire and what parts of the story should be rethought."
11998,"Wake the fuck up devs
"
11999,greattttttttttttt
12000,It's auto chess but with a sort of hero unit that grows through the game.  There's a mechanic where a certain number of units are missing every day.  Removing those units stops one specific meta build from getting too strong.  Overall - fun
12001,its a yes from me
12002,Why is this stupid automatic non-game so addictive?
12003,Very good game
12004,"I don't know what I like better, TFT or Underlords. They are both okay but this one is the only one playable on mobile."

12012,"THis game was so good til the big update happened ..it ruined the game
"
12013,"Is good. 
Let's just see in which direction Valve is going to pull this."
12014,"Its free, the dev team updates it 2-3 times per week bar none, and they are very passionate about it. It isn't even monetized in any way at all. It changes a lot right now because they are laying the framework for what the game is going to be going forward. But I play this game every day, its my constant go to when I want to take a break. Very grateful to the devs on this one for all their hard work."
12015,Its nice to see a valve game not immediately oozing with microtransactions and skins. well maintained and updated regularly. love love
12016,Jogo muito bacana!
12017,"It's gambling, nothing more, nothing less."
12018,Kills Lots of time. Gud game is gud

12026,"Fun. IMO, it's much richer and balanced than the auto chess. Also got updated nearly daily (with Jailbird, it's absolutely change meta everyday). I doubt all the devs from dota 2 have moved to here, there's no update in dota 2 since TI 9, at all :))"
12027,I rarely enjoy strategy games but somehow Dota Underlords managed to consumed me 4 hours straight

12033,"it is a nice, good balaance and update, it did grow good job, at least the meta is not fix and the rarity of a hero. it also with the original and its quite good. recommend"
12034,"please adjust the quality for games on mobile or iphone.
so i can play the game in my iphone without crash in the mid game..."
12035,Fun and addictive but I feel hollow and unsatisfied every time I finish a proto pass game.
12036,"I played many autochess games. Every one of them is unique, but this one fits me the most."
12037,ye
12038,Good Game
12039,Fresh meta keeps it interesting
12040,"I enjoyed having something that scratches that real-time feeling, w/out the reflexes needed in a proper real-time game."
12041,NICE GAME THAT WE CAN PLAY CASUALLY
12042,It is constantly being updated. Love the mechanics and visuals.
12043,"they may have royally fucked up artifact but they've managed to not fuck this up so far. Valve also has decided to address player concerns now (omg). So far its pretty good, balanced, and not buggy. Hoping that holds up. oh be warned that match times are roughly 45 minutes in case you thought you could just slam out a game of underlords on the toilet and then get back to the office."
12044,Good
12045,Lovely and fun!!!
12046,THIS GAME IS THE F*CKING NUTS
12047,"Its not bad, but its not great and I enjoyed the LOL version of this game better because of the item combination mechanic. Overall just kind of felt mildly satisfied when I won and lethargically frustrated when I lost."
12048,I'm horribly sceptic about this game.. sure its fun if you know what the hell is going on. but to jump in and expect guidance and help with what needs to be done it lacks
12049,"This game has so many one-ups on other Auto Chess games its unreal.

there is a fun and engaging story, lots to unlock and customise and the gameplay is really solid, its also quite amusing at time with some of the emotes."
12050,.
12051,Solid shit.
12052,Great
12053,"nice game

12054,"amazing game you will love it or hate it there is no in between.

12055,"Incredible strategy game that beats out all the other auto chess titles. The DOTA2 franchise has been a powerhouse in the gaming industry and Underlords is proof of that. Consistent updates, balance tweeks, addition of Underlords bosses added to your army, and zero monetization as of yet. When they decide to add content for purchase, it will be an easy decision to support such a creative and highly intuitive game for the casual and professional player. This will easily be an esports title in the near future. Highly recommend! 10/10!"

12060,"Started playing this because i played dota 2 in the past so i chose it over tft and other competitors. Realised that the game was declining fast instead on increasing in polularity and most streamers moved out of it.
I guess there is an isue where games are too long now compared to the beggining which beats the purpose of the game . Im not sure underlords and jail helped the game but i know for a fact that after the big update most players left . I guess there is also the issue of needing a good pc to play this where as competitors can play on pretty much anything. I would not recommend this if you are looking for a game with a future. 
Maybe this will change later but for now this is what it is."
12061,"Really nice autobattler, with great development team."
12062,"The DotA manager. Pleasing visuals, works even on mobile if you want to switch between devices. Mix of strategy and random aspects. Enough strategic options (alliances, unit levels, unit classes) to find your play style. Never won so far :)"

12085,I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
12086,It's good.
12087,"As someone who played a fair bit of the classic Dota2 Autochess, I was quite interested to see how Valves’ take on it would be.

First off, the game is fun. The alliances have been expanded quite a bit since classic, and it offers a nice mix of old and new factions that you have the opportunity to get. It’s fun to mix and match different alliances together, although if you stray a bit to far from the current meta, you do tend to get punished heavily for it. Thankfully, with the Big Update, having random units ‘jailed’ and unavailable to use for the day does make experimenting a bit more necessary than before. The same strategy that dominated yesterday may not work nearly as well when you play the next day.

I have a bit of mixed feelings about the UI especially with the Bug Update. In a game where you have to keep track of potentially up to 18 units on your team, Underlords does make it easy to keep track of your factions. Whenever you hover over an alliance icon on the right, you get the ability that that alliance gives you, as well as your units of that alliance, what units you are missing, and which units of that alliance are jailed for the day, all in one popup. 

However, ever since the ‘Big Update’ came out, the rest of the UI feels much more frustrating to navigate. Before, it was easy to tell how you were doing, because everyone’s health was displayed on the top left, ordered from most to least health. I mostly play team matches with a partner, and now, the top left scoreboard is pretty much useless. The team positions are constantly changing, and your health was shrunk in size to make it harder to see at a glance. In a game where you have limited time to prepare between rounds, I don’t want to spend half my preparation time figuring out what my standing is compared to the other teams. That, and the skills for my Under lord being hidden away at the bottom right. In short, whereas before the UI was simple and intuitive, after the Big Update, it makes some information unnecessarily hidden, and some area of the screen could trade unnecessary information for useful info, (like instead of the Underolords’ portrait taking up a bunch of space for no reason, use that space to better explain their abilities)

Speaking of the Underlords, by far the biggest change from classic Autochess is the addition of the new Underlords units, introduced in the Big Update. I have mixed feelings about this, as before the main focus of the game was collecting units of different alliances, now it seems that a large part is hefted over to the Underlords units. They seem a bit unnecessary, like adding a game mechanic for the sake of having more game mechanics, instead of fine tuning and expanding on other game mechanics. However, it does make Underlords stand out a bit more from other Autochess titles, so it may pay off in the long run.

In the end, I still think this game is worth recommending. If you’re interested in the Autochess genre, this is certainly a good attempt to take the core aspect of classic Autochess and expand on it. Although it does have some issues, I feel the rest of the gameplay more than makes up for it.
"
12088,It's a lot of fun!
12089,NICE
12090,"Good autobattler... they are doing a nice job of balancing the game and support and development for a free game....
fun to play"
12091,"Compared to other similar Autochess variants, the amount of micromanagement is low and has a so-so number of players, matchmaking is decently quick."
12092,okay :)
12093,"Game was awesome, still good.. but lost a lot of playability fun for me since the ""big update."" Still evolving though, games just taking too much time and the new mobile UI feels cluttered on my device. PC version UI update are better. Game just lot something, hoping for that fun to come back with updates soon..."

12095,it good
12096,222
12097,nice and simple tactical game
12098,I mean
12099," A great strategic game with moderate learning curve. Very good for spending some chill time and relaxing. Also really fun to play with a friend due to the Duos game mode. 

P.S. Plays fantastically both on PC and mobile phone (Android). The UI and design is on point and very carefully built."

12106,pretty noice
12107,"very good game, a little confusing at first but you get the hang of it!"
12108,Love the game play and graphics. It's challenging enough to make you want to keep playing but enjoyable enough not to rage quit every time I play.
12109,Still a lot of balancing to be done and RNGeezus can be a real pain but all in all quite an enjoyable game.
12110,"Completely unique take on auto-battler, but still remains to be seen how good Valves changes will compare to the original mod and other titles."
12111,love it
12112,"Fun to play, shorter version of Dota when you dont have the time."
12113,broken game
12114,good game
12115, a great more polished autochess
12116,"I like the fact that you can pause bot matches. Suits my play style (and limited skills) where I cannot commit to longish multiplayer sessions, and like to take my time making decisions. I get a challenging match against proto pass bots and can make progress in achievements, and this keeps me happy. 

I love the graphics and effects and the way your strategy needs to evolve as the game progresses. I would recommend this even as a paid game. As a free game, I can see no reason why you should not try it."
12117,issa gud game i guess
12118,good
12119,Fun
12120,"Well made, really like the ""new"" duos option. Also having relatively well developed bots with the pause/hurry up options is a welcome option when you want to unwind and you dont have time for a game in 1 sitting."

12130,Fun new game mode
12131,Interesting game based on building combos before each round that are then played out by the computer (e.g. - you see combat and results but only watch the AI play your combos out). It's still changing and growing as of today's date and I'll probably still be checking it out for a while.
12132,w0w
12133,"This was a fantastic game before they added in the overlords, new meta's every week - every game felt different. Now there is too much going on, overlords make the games drag on for no reason. 11 man boards are messy. Please.. just bring back the old format with additional classes and scrap the overlords!!"
12134,The game is just getting worse with each patch.
12135,
12136,"This was a great game for several months. I played daily and have many hours in the game. Then they came out with the 'Big Update' and it basically killed the game. 
Underlords just don't add anything. There is really no place in a draft game to start with powerful units on the board. It's completely counter to the idea of the game. 
Then the visual clutter is horrible. The graphics were fine before, but after making everything flashy it is just hard to look at. 

I hope they just revert to the previous version and I would be playing instantly again. Would pay for it also. I doubt that will happen though."
12137,No carousel

12173,Great game
12174,"Its a decent game, if you dont like riot or their game this is a good substitute to tft."
12175,depth
12176,pretty cool
12177,delete lords pls
12178,Cool
12179,This chesslike game is so gud and addictive
12180,"This game should not be taken seriously since its too much RNG based.
Still a neat game tho."
12181,awesome game
12182,Really interesting fighting system
12183,awesomeness
12184,i never get the third kunka in my previous game...... i did 10+ and never get it
12185,"Ну раньше было лучше, до этого чуда обновления с L0RDAMI PIDARASAMI
Хочешь побеждать смотри кто в мете, то все играю крысавчиком то бабой - от меты зависит. Поиграл крысавчиком побеждал - все круто было, потом не поиграл неделю - заходишь и сосешь одну за одной за красавчика потом смотришь а он уже и не побеждает и все за баб играют ну и короче такие дела. Вот бы баланса и мне кажется можно выкинуть второго лорда в зависимости от меты. САСНОВАЯ ИГРА Я АХУЕЛ"
12186,fdssdfg
12187,"Good strategy game, I play but I don't really understand, but hey atleast I have something to do in life. Vote for this game in the Steam Awards"
12188,wow big gaming i like to learn and win if you can do both you can enjoy Life and Love the game please give it a try
12189,Fun game for dad gamers
12190,"Love this game, every game is different and the meta changes every day."
12191,DOTA + Auto Chess? What are you waiting for? This is the best game
12192,"I played this game when it had just come out, and it was a lot of fun.
And having just played again after a few months I can say: What an awful direction to take this game in.

Underlords are presented as the main attraction, but they feel out of place in a game about improvising a team out of RNG.
Heroes dropping out of rotation makes sense balance wise, but keeping track of which ones are out (even if the game does it for you) doesn't really add any fun.
UI is still bad and the game as a whole feels unpolished after ~6 months, especially the sounds.

Overall, I would say the release version felt a little bandwagon-y but had enough potential and was fun enough to be genuinely interesting. This new gameplay makes it clear this game was and is just a cash-grab for a FOTM game formula, like Artifact was, and likely whatever Valve tries to copy next will be the same."
12193,"The best way for use your free time.

1 hour in Dota Underlords = 3 days in real life."
12194,valve abandoned this game
12195,goog game
12196,"A fun game to pick up and play. Not complex enough to scare off new players, but deep enough to keep coming back to. Main complaint is that the game balance is very dependent on what alliance the devs chose to work on for that update. Overall, a fun game that can be a bit frustrating at times."
12197,"The ""Jailbirds"" functionality is what makes this game stand out as an auto-battler. Not playing against the same units every day is awesome. There's a fair bit of strategy and luck required to succeed, but it feels pretty well-balanced. Teaming up with a friend in duos is also a really fun addition. I'm a fan."
12198,Gud.
12199,"Games run a little long, but this is BETA and Valve.  All of that can change. Graphics are great, game is fun and the jail system shakes things up."
12200,"Its simple and fun, but hard to master."
12201,"A decent Deck Building game to pass the time. Oh and it's free, so would recommend.
No knowledge of Dota Required."
12202,"(what a nice little game we got here?)
This things was absolutely marvelous when it got out. Great autochess experience with pretty and stylish graphics, nice lore with couple decent jokes and pretty and intuitive controls. At that time, I would rate this as by far best autochess game on market. 

Oh well...

(progress must be done!)
After latest patch, everything is different. Units and their abilities were for reasons unknown remade and (at least for me) made much more blend and boring. Graphics were ""enhanced"" in way there is no way how to tell what the hell is happening on screen which nullifies tactical analysis so fun when the game was released.

(isn't there really better way to make people stay with your game longer?) 
Last straw for me was adding those generic ""hero"" pieces which do some weird abilities whenever they feel like, having some pretty confusing upgrades and do in fact feel pretty much forced in the game. It's even worth mentioning those upgrades have to be unlocked by grinding the games, usually versus people who already have those upgrades. This concept is by my opinion stupid, does not make any sense and makes even once pretty good game like this one really boring and frustrating. 

(lets get all the market by pushing this to phones!)
I've been trying to play this on my pretty big samsung note9. What can I say? This trash! So many unnecessary stuff on screen with vomit-like mess made of all effects at the same time, this does not feel well, play well or even run well (seriously on note9 this does not do 60fps...)"
12203,обнова говно ебаное хуйню сделали дауны
12204,really fun to play
12205,I like the simple the game is to play on a mobile dispositive.
12206,good game
12207,RNG Shit... but its fun
12208,8/10
12209,yes
12210,"Its a pretty good game, its free to play atm, including all the content. 

Only Auto-Chess genre game with co-op atm, which is my favorite feature."
12211,"Игра ебучего дерьма, спасибо что убили игру ебучей каталажкой"
12212,"Autochess better watch its back, Underlords makes some changes to the formula that make it feel less stale"
12213,the good game
12214,Really great game for killing time
12215,bro
12216,The Jail mechanic is very healthy for the game although i feel like it still needs a bit of tweeking. Duos is hilarious to play and i wish it had a ranked as well. This game is ruining my life 10/10
12217,Fun to learn
12218,Great no good game.
12219,plessss
12220,good
12221,"very good game but still need a lot of balancing
"
12222,ok
12223,fun!
12224,"Was fun in the beginning but with each update it feels worse and worse. Some heroes are way too strong and others are practically useless. Queue times are pretty long most of the time too, even for casual games. 
Meh.."
12225,"It is a good thing that this game has died.
Completely RNG, 0 skill.
Extremely frustrating, not rewarding at all, due to the fact that it does not involve any skill but only pure luck.

Stay away."
12226,"Highly strategic and complex auto battler. It's well made, regular updates and runs smoothly. VALVE FIX DOTA 2 YOU FUCKS ITS BROKEN AS SHIT SO MANY SMURFS NO PATCH FOR HALF A YEAR POINTLESS OP HEREOS PLEASE FIX YOUR OTHER GAME AND LEAVE THIS ALONE."
12227,popa
12228,Decent all around autochess.  Game is still in flux so there will be things people complain about but overall devs are doing a decent job of making it fun and balanced!
12229,"Good game, new jail mechanics force you to adapt your playstyle."
12230,"Easy to learn, hard to win. Overall fun but time-consuming."
12231,i like
12232,"Great game, fun and deep strategy which makes it challenging to get good at."
12233,a
12234,I can say only one word: Awasome!
12235,Dota 2 for slow people
12236,fun but i love the classic there not main-hero more
12237,Good game
12238,"Definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested! My fiance and I have played it since release and it only  seems to get better!. There can be a bit of a learning curve, but don't let that deter you from taking the time to really learn the in and outs! :)"
12239,gud
12240,"game is different after the big update, i no longer enjoy it on my mobile. Underlords their designs are unappealing and their voice acting sucks. Who the f would watch this game when you see them on the cover on Twitch?"
12241,Happy with the current state of the game!
12242,Great game ! I really like and enjoy it. Also it became much better after update.
12243,nice
12244,A free game you can play casually and still enjoy after 234 hours? Sign me up
12245,Nice little alternative to original AutoChess and TFT
12246,Fockin addiictive and fun
12247,good
12248,great developer

12250,This didn't do the DotA 2 mod any justice. Dumpster fire from Value at it's finest.
12251,"needs some minor changes, but all in all a great game - just make games shorter and we're all fine (and able to play on mobile phones :)) thx"
12252,nice2 game
12253,"Good Men
"
12254,"Provides an interesting twist on tower defense game-play. While watching your units you will find yourself screaming ""What are you dumb fucks doing?!?"" and you will realize they nailed the DotA experience."
12255,great game!
12256,"I'm a simple man, when I play something fun and free I give it a recommend without putting too much a thought."
12257,"Great game but it's not finished
"
12258,"Not bad brad
"
12259,Best version of these games to date.
12260,"Simple and fun. Easy to learn, hard to master. Doesn't have a tutorial, so that was a bit odd. Can't complain otherwise."
12261,Loving this game. :)
12262,highly recommended  ..
12263,game of the year for me
12264,Nice game
12265,Fun game
12266,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but the devs and their CONSTANT updates killed the experience for me. The meta changes by the day, no joke. I didn't play for almost two weeks because i've been balls deep in The Outer Worlds but came back today, and its like a totally different game. I'm not gonna spend 30min before i play a quick game to learn all the new **** thats been added every single time. The devs are super sweaty trying to compete with Riot"
12267,Good.
12268,"At the actual state I can't recommend. 
Various bugs, the game is unbalanced, the UI feels not finished (the lifebars hurts my eyes), sounds are missing or just bad, achievements are nearly non existent, there's no fast match (almost 30 min each match), units can wear only 1 item (and some are just useless depending on your army). And after all even if you win first place you will feel unrewarded.
There are similar MUCH BETTER games in the Play Store:
- Magic Chess: Bang Bang (I pretty much recommend this one)
- Auto Chess"
12269,"After adding underlord this game is really bad, rng big time. I played like almost 500h in less than a month and since the a version maybe 10h."
12270,meh
12271,AUTO CHESS
12272,great game overall
12273,dfgdfg
12274,dota2 workers sk my dicck.dota2 match system suk as helllllllllllllllll///dota underloads is betteer
12275,Enjoyable. I manage to get a subdued DotA fix that I can pause and enjoy (bot mode). It has many variations that make the game interesting and unique.
12276,GGWP
12277,Very nice adaptaion of dota auto chess with it`s own twist. Definitely enjoying myself.
12278,good
12279,"good shite mate
"
12280,too much rng
12281,this game is bully me
12282,It good
12283,fun
12284,its not strategy game actually but is like a luck game -_-
12285,garbage game. balance is non existent. waste of time.
12286,@-@
12287,like
12288,why not?
12289,"Good till this recent Jail update, making the game anti fun and restricting what you get to play!"
12290,kelut
12291,"Never in my life would've I thought that a chesslike  videogame will catch my attention. But this one sure did. Whenever I feel bored and I don't have any ways to improve my life I simply just turn this bad boy on and play a couple games.
Tldr; -practice management - fun to play , all you do is watching your heroes fight 
Would recommend for all gamers/10"
12292,Very addictive game and better played with friends. Duo mode is so good.
12293,.
12294,"This game moved away from what made it fun (low stress, fairly one dimensional game) to a clusterfuck of visual chaos. Everything has this issue from the underlords on the board, the choices you make for leveling up, to the jail and all the other tacked-on features."
12295,"Fun, fast paced, turn based game. Games are short enough to be fast fun but long enough to allow satisfying comebacks, rewarding smart plays."
12296,Fun and free. Do it!
12297,Yo!
12298,"Great game, but it clearly needs a little of a shakeup once in a while to keep things interesting and fresh, hoping they can address this problem before launch."
12299,fun game
12300,they add the hot babe
12301,It's autochess with neater mechanics. They have done a lot to make this game unique in the genre with inclusions like underlords and the jail feature. It has enough variety and balance that you can make just about anything work without having to adhere to a flavor of the month style meta.
12302,"at last a fun and engaging mobile game, complex enough to enjoy with minimal handholding, devs keep delivering more content, balancing and tuning"
12303,
12304,"Best Auto Brawler Game on the Market
Underlords really add some character to this game
plus I really love the mobile version"
12305,Good
12306,is gud
12307,I deeply hate this game.
12308,"This is one of the worst games I have EVER played.
Everything about this game is RNG, EVERYTHING. You`d have a better time rolling a dice than playing this game."
12309,good strategy game
12310,good
12311,"its a fun casual game , a bit monotonic but diferent ban section daily makes it interesting, wish there was more heroes and underlord for more diferent builds tho"
12312,"constant support and updates, a shifting meta from day to day, fun game play and the ability to play as a team.  its very fun. its also free so thats the best way to try and see if you like it."
12313,nice
12314,a very nice and easish to pick up autochess game. pretty active dev too
12315,"no skill. need only lucky
"
12316,Fun free to play game.
12317,"I really hope this game finds a balance between keeping the fan base happy, and being easy to pick up for new players. The dev team are phenomenal at weekly patches, listening to the suggestions and complaints of the fanbase, and not taking themselves too seriously. 

This, of course, has made the community become a toxic dungpit of entitled bitchy babies, that make long, rambling, entitled posts declaring their departure from the community because of this ONE HUGE CHANGE that has made the game literally unplayable. They inevitably return a few days later to complain about something else as though nothing happened.

The game is a work in progress. It's a fun game to play if you've got 45 minutes to spare, and is going to continue to grow and change. Get on the ground floor, and suggest changes, because it might well be taken into consideration!"
12318,It's a pretty good competitive strategy game that's getting updated all the time.
12319,
12320,"Good Strategy game, recommended for dota character lover's people hehehe"
12321,goooooodddd
12322,Very nice game
12323,yup
12324,brain game
12325,it's autochess but Dota so can't complain
12326,"This game is too addictive. You'll miss assignments, critical deadlines and maybe even ruin your relationships in the long run. I'm serious."
12327,yeet
12328,yes
12329,Great game.
12330,"Good for a casual gamer, although games take about 30-60 mins to finish."
12331,Yahooooo
12332,Funny game
12333,Like dota 2 but less toxic
12334,GIATI ETSI!
12335,I think I'll quit dota2 because of this hahaha
12336,Interactive and challenging game.
12337,Very addicting. Refreshing to play.
12338,เพลินๆ ใช้สมอง เล่นไปกินข้าวฟังเพลงดูหนัง ไปด้วยได้
12339,Feels fresh after every patch. The jail is an ingenious addition.
12340,goood game
12341,Okay for killing time. Devoted developers.
12342,good stuff. also frree
12343,Loving the battler genre.
12344,Oi
12345,asd
12346,Very Easy game to play. A time killer while watching Netflix.
12347,fasf
12348,"Great Strategy Game, especially if you played DOTA 2 before."
12349,"This can be a nice game to play in the background while chatting with pals on Discord or the like, but solo-queuing feels like an enormous waste of time when you could be doing literally anything else instead of watching characters attack one-another with very little player interaction."
12350,good mix of thinky and fun
12351,It's fun.
12352,"It seemed boring and bland at first to me but after playing it for a while, I've found it's a really good game with a lot of depth and skill to be involved. Also a tun of fun."
12353,Why we cant reconnect after 3min ? ARE U BLINDS? u dont know about restart ROUTERS? THnx fix it i lost 3 RANKS BECAUSE I DIDNT reconnect so FAST!!
12354,"It is rather easy to learn, it has good playability and changes and updates keep it interesting."
12355,"Follow the META and watch people win or lose based on random chance. 
In several other auto battlers your positioning affects who your heroes target.
Needs a faster game mode for mobile success.
(This game is free)"
12356,"op
"
12357,Great
12358,"Please cancel the prison, please cancel the prison, forever!"
12359,fun
12360,nice!
12361,Great game to play while waiting for Outlanders update
12362,Great game
12363,"Never expected after the huge change, that was so flat and messin.
1, Bugs and errors in certain details.
2, The control of the game is faded.
3, Constantly making news, yet those were unnecessary.
4, The jail makes narrow selections"
12364,"it is really good strategy games , it's fun and also hard at the same time, the thing that makes it fun is that you can quit casual match without any consequences"
12365,"Its a very fun game , easy to lean ."
12366,nice game
12367,This game is most addictive for me for last 5 years.
12368,Game nya mantul
12369,good game
12370,"Complex and again easy. Funny and again frustrating.
Enjoyable if u play with basic from early and then start doing ur own creativity in the chess field."
12371,creative game!
12372,nice
12373,Badly designed by greedy valve. dying soon just like artifact
12374,"Осторожно, уничтожит ваше время"
12375,i hate new update
12376,Fun game!
12377,"It used to be really quite fun, but now its just. . . ""what the fuck am i looking at""
really messy and all over the place unfortunately"
12378,good game
12379,"I deleted the game , the crazy randomness causes more frustrations than enjoyment on the long run. Game is not dictated by skills but more by luck. Its  not even competitive , whoever is able to achieve top3 is all due to luck of rolls they got on their board.
Not going to play this game again for sure."
12380,"As someone who was initially very hesitant to play this game, as i have never enjoyed Dota, and found the sheer complexity of games like hearthstone and even the original auto chess very daunting, confusing and un-fun, I find underlords exceptionally fun. 

Initial impressions are a bit daunting, as the game has a lot to offer - Underlords, hero's, items, alliances ect - but after playing a couple games against bots, and watching a few hours of some underlords streamers (.tv/TileyTV makes very useful meta builds and game guides on youtube and twitch) I found myself getting to grips of the basic mechanics and the hero's abilities much quicker than I thought I would. 

While underlords is an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" type game, I hope to encourage new players who are like me, to just download the game and give it a try, it is very satisfying, and a lot of fun. Fun after-all, being what video games are all about. 

I really like the Jailbird mechanic, it stops the hearthstone problem of one deck, or build in the case, ruling the Meta for months between patches. The devs seem very active, and the community is one that supports any new players.

Another factor I liked was the interface, it is very uncluttered, while displaying all the necessary information.
There is also a host of in game bio's, simple guides and a Glossary. 

On a whole, I would highly recommend the game. However you're in for the long haul, and if you're tired of not being able to go 30 seconds without a 13/35 year old yelling at you for being shit at something, this may be the game for you. 

10/10"
12381,Best auto chess game in the market.
12382,"Game is in a horrible spot, i cannot recommend it, ill try it out again when it comes out of beta"
12383,What I wished Artifact was like.
12384,"This is a bad auto chess game, even league of legends TFT is better and that's saying something. If you want a decent auto chess game play the original dota 2 mod or it's successor, the mobile game by dragonest. This one is so overdesigned it hurts. Even for someone who knows both dota and the genre its hard to know what the fuck is happening. The game looks like world war 3 when you get enough pieces and yet it never really feels like any piece really does anything since damage is so low, and health pools are so high. Its terribly imbalanced too, and the daily jail system really strangles what you can build. Some really strange decisions like not starting round when everyone finishes, leaves you just staring at your wall since there's nothing else to do for 30 seconds. Can't recommend this, its a terrible version of auto chess."
12385,gg
12386,Revolutionary
12387,nice game lah!! XDD
12388,"I pee here and there, but I sure like to poop. Mostly logs and pebbles lately, but every now and then pure liquid."
12389,My little guy stands up allways when i see female champions.
12390,"Extremely fun, complex and rewarding"
12391,cool
12392,was good now layout is like having issues with my eyes
12393,"This game is very nice and spends time, no need for fps or any aiming clicking skills. Just place the heroes right and let them do their magic.  

One wish though Valve: Make a mode without the actual underlords (just like it was before them anyway). They're quite distracting at times. At least make their presence smaller or something from the screen."
12394,piece of fucking shit
12395,"Wonderful game with strategic depth, infinite replayability. I have to warn you, its addictive."
12396,"To preface this, I have little to none experience playing DOTA 2. I was raised in a LoL family and while I no longer play MOBAs (too boring, took too much of my time), I recognize that DOTA 2 is and always will be the better. 
I learned about Auto-Chess as a genre way later than everyone else. Before Underlords was announced, it was a passing interest that just seemed like a better version of Artifact. I hadn't understood what I was getting into until I first played Underlords. 
For someone who didn't know the rules, the tutorial worked effectively to get the gist across. You stumble around at first, but it only took around 3 games for me to understand most of the complex mechanics in the game. If you think, weigh the risks, and play smart, you will start winning very quickly. The UI is simple and effective, giving you all the information you need to succeed.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I think the game's balance is currently a mess. However, my brain cells that cause addiction *really* like it when I click things on the UI. Unlike other Auto-Chess games, I can trust that no matter how fucky-wucky or un-fucky-wucky the balance is, Valve will deliver a fun and competitive game. It is free so I recommend it. It should be worth your time and more.

Edit 12/4/2019: As the game is in Early Access, I will continue updating this review until the official release. All I have to say now is the Knockout mode is a total blast. Very good if you don't have time for a full game.

Edit 2/18/2020: This game is still good, I am just not sure how I feel about the implementation of the Underlords into the game. It also has a much smaller player base than it once had because of a lack of updates to the game. I look forward to what Valve does with this if anything at all at this point.

Edit 3/13/2021: Turns out the autochess genre was more of a trend than a long standing movement in gaming like MOBA. Game is still good, but valve doesn't support it. Cannot recommend."
12397,Intriguing game with a lot of heroes to combine !
12398,VALVE HAS RUINED SUCH A  NICE GAME!!
12399,Great time waster. I really appreciate how the developers are very consistent in providing detailed patch notes and aren't afraid to make balance changes.
12400,+++
12401,"Played dota alot, found this to be very enjoyable, has learning curve but very fun."
12402,meh
12403,Basically a board game for the PC.
12404,good but should add more effect i think
12405,"A friend of mine told me about the game, but I wasn't all that interested in autobattlers. I got bored one day and decided to install this game and yeah, I'm addicted. Love it!"
12406,The best autochess game on the market for sure
12407,"No Dota 2 player by any means, but Underlords is more my pace: Solo Chess with Tactics. I enjoy building a team to wreck my opponents. The really nice thing about it is that you can lose early and often in a match and never be out of it. In fact, that is a working strategy. If you really know what you're doing, you can get down to your last 5 hit points and then unleash a fury like a ninja on crack. It's remarkable how the game is shaping into something everyone play, and everyone can master. However, things change ALOT during this beta phase, so you have to keep up with all the minute details. Nonetheless, it's worth it."
12408,"It's a fun game that lends itself to limited playtime and in-depth playtime as well. If you want a game you can pick up and put-down or go hard with, this is a good choice. 

Mechanically simple--no fast button pressing required.
Strategically deep--lots of knowledge can be applied to help win
Randomness--RNG keeps every game different, but not so random that skill doesnt matter.

my rating only gets higher as they add more content. Hopefully that trend continues.
4/5. With more content, it could hit 5."
12409,"Fun and exciting game kill time
"
12410,"Play it, it will ruin your life in the best way possible! ;D"
12411,"It was pretty fun when i downloaded it the first time, got a bit repetitive but no matter every game does after a while, now i cant even start it, the last 10 times i have tried to start it, i got in to the game ONCE. even after validating the files and checking for updates."
12412,"Very fun, strategic game. Like that it has mobile and offline modes unlike other auto battlers."
12413,GG

12415,"The developers stopped updating and never gave us loyal players any notes nor explanation.
WORST DEVELOPERS EVER, SHOWS US HOW LITTLE THEY CARE"
12416,"Great time pass, game is quite balanced and handy, you can even play it from phone"
12417,QSSD

12421,D
12422,pretty gut game.
12423,"meh not that fun matches take 1h, and its kinda boring"
12424,"It used to be fun. Now about every second match the game crashes and takes 10x as long as it normally would to start back up again. Doesn't matter if I'm on a really high end gaming pc or on my crappy laptop or even on my phone. Doesn't matter if I'm on crappy wifi or on good wifi or hooked up to the fastest ethernet connection I can possible get. It WILL crash and you WILL lose. And playing a game where you are guaranteed to lose every second match is no fun. I keep coming back to it every few weeks in hopes that the issue will have magically fixed itself (since the devs clearly won't) and then give up in frustration almost immediately. 

Don't waste your time on this unless you have the patience of a saint and really don't care about winning or even being able to play the game.
August 2022 - still randomly crashes mid game all the time"
12425,i can eat and play stress free
12426,IM PRO
12427,Fcking so much good
12428,I played dota since i was a kid so playing the new format with the champions i know is very refreshing and I like it.
12429,A very fun game to play especially if you want to be chill and relax. I'm satisfied just by playing VS the bots and trying out new combinations of units. You have to bring the mindset of RNG when playing this game. The DEV are very active with improving the overall experience and hearing the community feedback. The new DUO mode is very fun to play with a friend. I can only see this mode to improve and becoming the best mode on this game in the future. Overall solid recommendation.

Definitely rate up :)"
12466,"Simple, surprisingly deep, and constantly updated. I'm enjoying this game a lot so far :)

For a while it was difficult to get into due to bugs and network issues, but they've continuously worked to improve it. It's certainly an enjoyable and much less buggy experience now!"

12510,"The good, the bad, and some suggestions for improvement…

GOOD:
1.)	Large variety of heroes and alliances

2.)	Achievement system provides incentive beyond leveling Proto Pass, but would like to see a larger variety of achievements and reward

3.)	Jail system ""mildy"" disrupts meta and encourages trying different builds (although this is still heavily influenced by RNG)

4.)	Each hero has obtained a unique skin to reflect their level

5.)	Casual gameplay mode allows you test out different builds without sacrificing rank

6.)	The Underlords are a nice addition, even if they are still being balanced


BAD + SUGGESTIONS:
1.)	Ranked mode is more for testing the system than for striving towards any rewards (this is most certainly due to the fluctuating state of the game). It would be nice if Valve hinted (if even a little) at what lies in the future for ranked play.

2.)	Three-star heroes are quite rare (even at very late stages of the game).  This is due to a combination of the increasing pool of heroes as you level (less chance of getting who you need) and the limited bench size (at late game you make the decision to either 2-star the stronger, higher level heroes or try and 3-star the weaker, lower level heroes; there isn’t much room on the bench to do both).
   •	A suggestion for increasing the amount of 3-star heroes is to give a second bench (another 8 slots) at level 20 (about the time 3-star leveling becomes more likely).  Additionally, a hidden mechanic to grant a % increase in obtaining heroes already on the playing field and bench could prove very helpful in obtaining 3-star heroes (similar to the mechanic for obtaining level 5 heroes).

3.)	There aren’t many ways to counter an enemy team’s comp at later stages in the game.  For example, if an enemy obtains the insect trait it can seriously affect slower hitting heroes who don’t have an AoE teammate (like Alchemist) to clear out the constantly spawning spiders.  Another example, is an enemy team is assassin heavy but you don’t any high level tanks to protect your troops.  Simply put, trying to change composition is almost impossible and tends to reinforce metas.
   •	One possible way to address this issue is to implement items that directly affect alliance effectiveness.  There is already a 50% healing debuff item which negates the healer alliance, but that’s it.  There are many possibilities for items that could have huge impact on the sway of matches.  For example, using the Insect alliance as an example again, there could be a “Pesticide” item which prevents spiders from respawning / reduces spider number and spawn rate / reduces damage and debuff chances, etc.  Ideally, there should be a counter item per alliance, but the catch is that the effects affect both the user and the enemy (similar to the healing debuff item).

4.)	Smuggler can have huge sway over matches if obtained in early rounds.  This is simply one of those perks that is a 100% pick if it shows up, and that should highlight the issue with it.
   •	A suggestion is to remove Smuggler and introduce another mechanic to neutral rounds.  For example, winning a neutral round allows you to pick an item at the appropriate tier or any item from a tier below.  Losing a neutral round gives you a random item from a tier below; there is no option to select an item unless you picked the perk to give you an extra item to choose from.

5.)	Most low tier items scale very poorly late game.  The choice of items in the early tiers is often dictated by how well it scales late game.
   •	Perhaps the first three rounds should grant Quest items that evolve as you play.  For example, the chainmail shirt gets upgraded to plate (15 armor) after it takes 250 hits.  Additionally, the Sword could be upgraded to a Greatsword (+75 damage) after having dealt 10,000 damage.  This would help ensure that, even if RNG is not kind to during neutral rounds, you are guaranteed several useful items late game.  The suggestion above would also help eliminate some RNG from neutral rounds, if you ended up winning a round and offered items that were not useful."
12511,Like a custom map to some blizzard game or an old flash game in feel. Fun to run a few games and has suprisingliy deep strategy.
12512,"its new, its fresh its something else then a card game ... but basicly its the same.
learning curve i have yet to get following, because at the date of writing nov 13 - 2019 its still in ea.
no tutorial yet, so far if seen. but youtube search away and your up and running."
12513,this game is really fun and simple
12514,"RNG brought to ridiculous levels and very limited player intervention.
Also: one game takes about 45 minutes to an hour.
Not my cup of tea."
12515,It seems like devs don't understand their own game. That's the main issue. Each change just make worse what used to be a good game. Dead game. Don't recommend to inest time in learning it.
12516,i really like artifact its a good ccg
12517,Very dynamic meta due to the rotating jailed heroes compared to other auto battlers. Dev has proven that they are willing to listen to feedback and requests from the playerbase and is constantly updating the game
12518,Famous sequel to Dota 2. You get a team of retard players that won't focus the right hero and feed all game. 10/10 would play again.

12535,"This is a Phone game.  Everyone's addiction to basic Idler / Clicker / Team-Battler / Hero-Collector games lead to this.  No, this is not some ""innovative"" shift for PC games.  This is what Phone Games have been for years and years copy and pasted onto our PCs.  The fact that there's a grid to place the characters on is barely a change from or addition to what Hero Collector Phone Games do.  If it wasn't obvious, I look down on this sort of game due to its greed-addiction-microtransaction-scam origins.  Likewise, it's disappointing if anyone thinks this is remotely innovative.

But aside from my disdain for Microtransaction Cons and non-games that play themselves, the strategic design and graphics are certainly sound.  I wouldn't say this is impressive but it's certainly not terrible.  Maybe you'll attach to some of the characters.  I still can't shake the feeling that this is a phone game trying to funnel me into microtransactions even if that isn't exactly happening.

(To Clarify : This isn't really a Microtransaction Addiction game, it just feels like one due to the hands-off nature of the gameplay and how similar that is to actual Microtransaction games.)"

I played Drodo auto chess for a long while, started playing the mod in january of 2019, played their mobile release for 2 seasons. All the while underlords devs were making changes to the overall formula (they scared me off at first, but I have since come to like the differnece). THe Actual overlord system is decent and i think will only improve as more of the underlords come out. Free game, give it a shot."

12633,This game is bad
12634,Very fun and easy to learn! If you also played dota it's even easier as you can imagine what most heros do. I like the strategy involved too.
12635,Dota Underlords is a what a card game would look like if it were live action. it has many different classes that suit each play style and a good learning curve but still easy to pick up for new players. the UI design is cool and the art style it self looks pleasing and comfortable to the eye. it is a good game to play when you want to have fun while relaxing.
12636,very good for time killer..i love this game

12644,"At release: Excellent version of Dota Auto Chess, with duos game mode; where you can send your partner gold or units. The balance is alright, games are quick and the learning curve is not too steep."
12645,"Artifact's SON in terms of RNG. This game is getting worse update after update in terms of RNG stuff. Is just stupid to see in round 15,  two 3 star units judging they are not druids. Not a single time this happened before. Is unacceptable. In the 1st days of Underlords, this would have never been the case. Never mention that the Bruiser(taunt minion) for Annesix is broken. Sometimes it blocks 0 damage the hero recieves judging that he just needed to move 1 square(empty space), to block the respective long range attack. To conclude, i can't even think about a good thing that recommends this game. Even the  ""shop"" sucks. You want a team of assasins, barely get some, you want scrappy/inventors, you get all needed after you sell the units you already have in order to change into another alliance(not talking about the level you have vs the units you get). IN THIS STATE i don't recommend the game. The only good thing lately, is that they added Underlords characters."

12657,"In Conclusion,

Dota Underlords is nothing like Defense of the Ancients. It is a completely different game which uses the skin of Dota, but without the core elements of laning, farming, vision, and team fighting in real time. Note: Underlords is also nothing like Chess.

12659,"I did not recomended the game before, it had numerous issues, but now, i finaly feel that the game is in an interesting state.

Prior to the new version the game was extremely luck dependent, balance was terrible and you only saw the same builds again and again making the game extremely boring.... Well, those days are kinda left behind.


They really done an amazing job in adressing the issues, the Ai feels smarter, the balance is better, the 3 star bonus to heroes makes a huge chunk of builds available and worth to risk for.


Luck is still a major part of the game and will always be, but probabilities now actualy makes sense, its possible to make real decisions now based on then. They also were able to make every gold piece matter, its a choice now of risk and reward, searching a 3 star hero or more pieces etc.

I finaly recomend the game, its fun now, more balanced, and finaly feels like player decisions matter.

The only problem that remains is still the poor exploration of the positioning management, Hopefully they will work around that too someday.


Sory for the bad english, have fun playing Underlords ; )"
12660,"Pretty fun game once you learn the mechanics, and even funner once you learn how to dominate with certain combos."
12661,Very good
12662,if you like auto chess this is certainly that
12663,Good time playing it.
12664,yes
12665,"This battle chess game was fun when the genre spiked in popularity, but then it got kind of stale for me. But my friend convinced me to return once they added DUOs and I must say, its a lot of fun working with a friend to win the game. Way better with two. I hope they get ranked DUOs in the game."
12666,L O R E
12667,"Good flow, i like the pool of pieces to pull from."
12668,"This game is great, play it with friends and then lose those friends because they will hate, But TFT is better"
12669,it's just another version of the game you already know and love
12670,nice chill game after dota
12671,"I expected to spend a couple of hours fiddling with Underlords and then throw it back.
What I got was a great way to while away the hours with low stress combat simulation.
The option to gain Protopass progression while playing vs Bots AND being able to pause the timer is perfect!
I have no interest in playing stressful timed matches vs humans, but I do want to be able to explore the talent options for the Underlords and feel a sense of accomplishment when I unlock new levels in the pass.
Plus, game is free to play (hence the Product Received for Free check)!"
12672,Great autochess!
12673,"Very enjoyable, especially duos. Can't wait for ranked with them as well."
12674,Yes I would recommend this to other players. Fast pace play that anyone can win... with the added bonus that you cannot buy gear or anything to improve your chances of winning
12675,this fun
12676,Duo mode added a new dimension to the autochess genre.
12677,Fine but needs more waifu
12678,Good game.
12679,"interesting changes - a lot of work went into this. Good UI. Even though it's kinda stolen from the original Auto Chess author, it's currently the best game of its genre."
12680,Dota Chess standalone that removed a lot of the depth of the game
12681,guud
12682,Pretty coool
12683,Great game !
12684,55545
12685,LIKE PLAYING IT
12686,!
12687,"really cool game with a steep learning curve to get good, but you kinda begin to figure it out as you go.  Amazing game especially for how new it is"
12688,"There's no reason this should be compelling, and yet I can't stop coming back for a few rounds at a time. Fun even when you're rubbish."
12689,Good team that keeps updates and balancing coming.
12690,Its amazing if you invest the time for it.
12691,Love Hobgen if you play to his bonus on fire damage deadly
12692,"This is simply one of the best games I've played, the system is flawless and the devs are really making things right for the best experience you'd possibly have. Every little detail is surprisingly set for the flow of the gameplay and everything makes you want to replay it again and again!"
12693,..
12694,Thank you for this game devs
12695,Excelent game adictivo
12696,Like gambling! sometimes you win alot of times you lose. But a good waste of time
12697,"Pure example of how community doesnt know what they want and that dev shoud not listen to every single comment on reddit to make the game better

Just to be clear i liked the game for some time, but every time they make an update communty just blacklashes even more, and they make an update again, and again (u see the pattern)

DEVS DONT LISTEN TO EVERYTHING COMMUNITY SAYS, stick to your play and idea for a game u cant be appealing to everyone

"
12698,Coop gave a new meaning to this game.
12699,"Great game and trust me it's not only about luck, it requires a lot for attention to details under time pressure. 
- What units should I take and do not play, to prevent my opponents upgrading them. 
- Is my unit placing representing my armies best laylout? (tanks around, archers inside etc.)
- Am I saving enough money ? 

So it might be a lot of the take in at the beginning, but after 4-5 hours.. you will be one of us.. 

Great Game!!"
12700,good and so many improvement.
12701,fun for the whole family
12702,Fun and challenging. Constantly getting updates to ensure balance between all the alliances and heroes. Offers a duo mode so this makes a great couple's game.
12703,"I still have hope for this game this is a really good strategy game, but it really need more con tent and good balancing"
12704,99% luck 1% skill game BlessRNG
12705,dead game feelsbadman
12706,Time wasting goodness.
12707,"After playing 12 minutes, I really couldn't figure it out how we win or lose in Dota Underlords. Lots of things happen on the screen but it's almost impossible to watch and follow the fights. As a result, it's very difficult to do the right thing in the right time. Forget about tactics and strategy! So, the game seems to have lots of fun but unfortunately it hasn't..."
12708,Good
12709,An awesome game to play and seek the lore of dota
12710,It iz gud gaim

Good Auto-Battler (AutoChess)
Needs more variety in gameplay/starts & greater support for mobile users."
12716,chad but glacials are op nerf yasuo and zyra pls rito sleeping or somethin smh
12717,Great Game.Nc playstyle with good graphics.
12718,"Great strategy game, almost weekly updates, has a bright future IMO. Put in almost 200 hours and still enjoy it."
12719,"If you are good at RNG, you will be very good at this game."
12720,It's good. Just sometimes the RNG sucks balls
12721,fun
12722,awesome~
12723,Has its unique gameplay
12724,"I enjoy the communication from developers. Best of the ""autobattler"" genre by far."
12725,"Just a worse Team fight Tactics that costs money, would recommend 10/10"
12726,very dank
12727,Nice for relaxing games
12728,"Fun game.  Not entirely sure why they give the ability to emote things like ""You were never going to win"", though.  Just want to give players the ability to troll others?  I guess it does make it more like DOTA2, in that way.   I mean, hey, if we can give the players the ability to be jerks, why not!  WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY!"
12729,I don't know what the hell I'm doing but it's fun
12730,fun game when power does not randomly died mid game
12731,best autochess game out atm
12732,Its addicting :D
12733,"it aight
"
12734,was a good game that i still want to play but i know as soon as i login after this jull patch i will just be in game after game of the same builds
12735,gud gaem
12736,New patch made it awesome to play with duels mode!
12737,I liek this gmae
12738,"This type of auto-battler can become addictive; as a former DotA player, this is a fun and simple way to experience the characters without playing the game. Fun game, 9/10"
12739,"It's still in early access and has some stuff that needs attention so it's a good thing that devs listen to feedback and actively try to improve the game.
Very much alive game"
12740,"
"
12741,fun game great time passer
12742,.
12743,"I love the style of game, and how long matches can last."
12744,i like
12745,prety good
12746,"I haven't played other auto chess games but if you haven't tried underlords, definitely try it even if you play others. Gameplay is smooth, and the game is very self explanatory and fun"
12747,Interesting and engaging
12748,Very fun game! The devs are constantly updating to keep it fresh! after the latest update the game became more fun and enjoyable!
12749,"to much change to this game
"
12750,Just turn him into a chicken already!!
12751,good progression
12752,they fucked it up
12753,"Good game, takes a while to know what's good and goes well together. But game is always changing so you always need to switch it up but that's a good thing."
12754,"AWESOMEEEE
"
12755,Fun game. Needs more underlord options. Only 2 right now. Also needs a store with skins for heros and underlords. Needs more camera options as well. Overall I enjoy playing it.
12756,s
12757,"Game tolol, ga hoki kyk anjing, game tolol asu bgt"
12758,Modern Poker on dota grounds ;)
12759,"Please recover my account, you make me like cheater, I have never used Cheat :( Damn VAC


Updated: Done recovered"
12760,The best auto-battler around.
12761,"I played 100 hours.. had loads of fun. The new patch changed the game IMO to worse. No point in Underlord, game now depends on play time, probably soon it will be pay to win based. Shame, deleted. I really enjoyed the prior versions so I'm a bit sad"
12762,Fun and balanced.  Not P2W atm.
12763,i like it <3
12764,"Don't play this game, It's addictive!"
12765,"Es un gran juego, solo le falta mejorar en algunos aspectos del multi-jugador y el interfaz en partida debería ser un poco más amigable para el principiante."
12766,"Never really played auto battlers before. So I picked this one up to see how they are. It seems like a good game and a fun game to pass the time. Feels like a good ""snack food"" game. Nothing I would play none stop. The only reason is for the complexity this game has the RNG can get in the way sometimes and slow you down some. It could also be that I need some more time with it. But for sure a good kill the time kind of game."
12767,"This game is a light strategy game that provides a fresh game-play pioneered by the Dota Autochess, but Valve really took it to a whole new level with even fresher ideas. This game seems to be promising for a competitive game but nonetheless fun to play for casual players."
12768,this is a fun game boys and girls.
12769,Noooice
12770,trash
12771,Good game
12772,Gets boring after a few games. Not for everyone I guess. 5/10
12773,"After the Underlords patch, the game was given a much needed breath of fresh air and surprising amount of depth. It felt like it's evolved into something better. I'm very much looking forward for what's next in store."
12774,good game
12775,"It get's boring quite fast, games take too long in my opinion, and it does not really seem like you can progress much."
12776,great game
12777,gggg
12778,"Great game.  Easy to understand, hard to master."
12779,"Though the game length is about twice what I would like each round, it is a fun game. I would classify it as ""casual"" except for the game length. Recommended. But I'd only give it 3/5 due to game lengths.."
12780,good game
12781,i play this during dota 2 ranked queue cause by the time i find a game in dota i will have already played 2 underlord games :3
12782,"Game is fun, its different now that there have been changes to the basic auto battler system. Its nice to have something that is semi-persistent in all the randomness. Plus the dev team has been very good about updating it. I think is is for sure something to pick up and try out. I would give it a solid 8."
12783,good game mechanics. mini dota2 version with different game play but similar vibe because of heroes and their abilities. nice beep update with UI and overall gaming experience. passionate communities and game developers.
12784,da
12785,nice strategy
12786,this thing makes me more proscrastinating to do my job
12787,Game is entirely luck based.
12788,good combo with luck and skills
12789,GG EZ RNG BLEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
12790,good
12791,fun game very in depth and makes my brain think
12792,its an addiction. one of the best games ive played .
12793,"Good idle games. You can setup your decks and go do something else for a while, return and upgrade your decks, and back to that something else. Unfortunately, there are some big patches almost every week. So it's kind of hard to follow unless you read the changelogs."
12794,"Vavle games are the best, when is next Dota 2 update."
12795,"I honestly really enjoy this game. Being able to start a game on the PC, pause it, and then restart it on my phone on the bus really just makes this game easy to pick it up and enjoy it!"
12796,AutoBattlers are games I play while not really paying attention but I do enjoy them.
12797,"Just like getting drunk in DotA, I'll still be able to ruin it for other people, and so can you!"
12798,underlords > dota > artifact
12799,"this is entirely a type of game thing, and it's passivity. This is essentially a mobile game, like all battlechess style games. In this you make decisions but don't really play, and a lot of those decisions are up to chance. I would not recommends this to others, whom like myself, hate RNG. If you're looking for something to watch that mostly just plays itself, or are into fantasy sports, then this is probably for you."
12800,8/10
12801,Better Auto-chess.
12802,he hee hero fight haha
12803,love it
12804,"10/10 would recommend. It's still new, so hotfixes are coming out and some builds that are overpowered suddenly aren't, so keep up with the changes"
12805,Great game - I love playing it and no other auto-battler comes close for me.
12806,It's over.
12807,"Best auto brawler on market. Deep strategy. You have to manage your economy, luck of hero draw, see what 7 other players are choosing for synergies, and make strategic decisions. Fun that's it DOTA characters. I'm going to put 500+ hours into this game before I put it down."
12808,"Like the strategy of Dota but don't the latency for a good game, Play this!"
12809,lots of war
12810,gudd stuff
12811,"Pretty fun, a lot of RNG. Doubles mode makes it great!

Does get somewhat boring and repetitive after a while."
12812,"Yes it is a great game. I was unable to share my love for DotA with my girlfriend. But with this game, we can play it together!"
12813,nice game
12814,Still requires less luck than CS GO.
12815,gg
12816,It good
12817,"it is starting and growing great.Well, better player care than dota. keep updating and developing."
12818,Good auto battler
12819,"yes
"
12820,"It's alright, for a beta."
12821,good
12822,DUAR MEMEK
12823,dabest
12824,"excellent game , fidel and innovate for the dota mod. love the new addition"
12825,.
12826,all about 1-2 meta teamcom and luck
12827,"nice
"
12828,Cool game <3
12829,great. pure luck. satisfying. hard to win. 10/10
12830,Season 2 has been a huge improvement from Season 1.  The game has a much better flow but there is serious imbalance between playable classes.  A broader range of play for the meta would be nice.
12831,It's a good time pass
12832,"Game is very nice, you should be familair with tft game to play this"
12833,10/10 would AFK again
12834,Nice game
12835,"Solid chess game
"
12836,"dead game, used to be amazing, been ruined by bad balancing and lack of updates.

been no significant updates for almost a year now, so guess its time to accept valve have abandoned this one."
12837,I reviewed this a while back and recommended it. Since then it seems like Valve has abandoned this game. It's the kind of game that requires updates to keep the meta fresh and interesting. Valve hasn't done that so it's now a dying game. I was a Lord of White Spire in the 2 seasons before I stopped playing and it was basically my favourite game. Valve not touching it has killed it for me. It's stale and boring now.
12838,really nice game
12839,best autochess by far
12840,I like this game. I play autochess mobile as well and its nice change from that because the mechanics are very different and it seems way harder to get good compared to auto chess mobile. 7/10
12841,Came over from Dota and Artifact.  It's what I play on a day to day basis
12842,Duos is very fun
12843,"Good auto chess game, games are longer than I personally would like."
12844,Good game
12845,Polished version of Auto Chess. Really like the coop.
12846,"Started out great, but has become confusing and unplayable with the addition of the Underlords"
12847,Just like chess but plenty of strategics and tactics.
12848,Its kinda fun
12849,fun to play since it entirely makes use of strategies
12850,good
12851,Abandoned game
12852,"bad game after add ""underlord"", very very disappointed"
12853,"The recent Jull update December 2019 made no sense at all. They removed some frivolous things but dumbed it down so much it's now just nonsense.

EDIT: I see now the direction they want to take. I think it's a good direction, at the same time, they will get their cash in to support the game - the Battle Pass is a very nice add-on that brings flair to the game.

Can't say much about the metagame that's changed wildly again. To be seen. Right now, I'm changing my review to Recommend."
12854,what an awesome game!!!
12855,like how i could play with my friend and increase the odds of building our alliances
12856,"Pretty good if you want what you want, and what you want is a chess game that makes your moves for you."
12857,5/7
12858,great game. volvo put so much effort into its development considering they're just a small indie company :v
12859,is good
12860,"This, in my humble never wrong opinion, is the best out of the auto-battlers genre"
12861,"its a fun downsized version of Dota2. You get a lot of the fun out of the heroes but dont have to grind away any time, if you like to not have to work too hard and find the grind of all pick too much sometimes, this game is perfect. If you dont feel that way just play dota2"
12862,Went in ready to hate it. Turns out its good.... Wack.
12863,good for killing time without thinking
12864,"The gameplay is both easily accessible and very deep, and eight player matches mean that ladder fatigue is much less infuriating than in a 2-player game. This is my go to game when I want to spend an hour on casual multiplayer."
12865,"You're going to lose. But what makes it a good game is, I keep coming back."
12866,.....
12867,Ez game
12868,Quite relaxing
12869,"Fun game, but you need to practice with bots to get a feel for the strategies."
12870,goode
12871,"Progressively getting more and more convoluted, both visual and gameplay wise, just like dota itself. The ""Big update"" with the new underlords killed my interest in this game completely. Interface is a visual clusterfuck of data and hard to navigate. New heroes and alliances are fine, although I don't trust the game's balance anymore. The two new underlords... not only do you need to grind to unlock all their abilities, it ruins the strategy aspect of this game. I don't want an addition of a 'super piece' to my classic chess game, I don't need any more random elements other than what units and items I get. Game developers need to understand what ""more is less"" means."
12872,"fucking update error in Linux
gaming file missing error during the underlords update fuck
"
12873,:)
12874,i just love this game
12875,Just... boring.
12876,Very addictive game
12877,as
12878,"Do you like 50/50 game? 
Try this game!!"
12879,Constantly updating and improving. Its overwhelming at first but its the best autochess I've played yet.
12880,"A lot like DOTA chess, just better overall."
12881,"Nice time-waster with surprisingly deep strategic options. The dev team has also been consistently updating to add content and shake up the meta, which is always appreciated."
12882,10/10
12883,哈哈哈哈哈
12884,funny game
12885,Very enjoyable
12886,this game so hard
12887,The game is great but honestly it kind of upsets me that they refuse to take my money. I have written them multiple times asking to direct deposit my paycheck in exchange for in-game rewards but they actively refuse my requests.
12888,"game made by dumb cunts, for dumb cunts.

pretty fun tho"
12889,"yeh, it scratches the gambling itch. but its far from best in the genre."
12890,Less random than tft
12891,i enjoy being able to finish quests against the AI
12892,Game plays itself while I watch Netflix 10/10
12893,NEEDS SPACE COW
12894,I like
12895,"Shit's dope, and it's free. Yeah, it has some balance issues, but it's still in beta, and has had weekly updates consistently taking it in the right direction. Very much recommended."
12896,Easy to use a time killer both on Mobile or PC.
12897,It is great!
12898,its aight
12899,Just needs some more balancing.
12900,duo je fajne
12901,chill game with music on
12902,More refined version of DotA Autochess. Now featuring a really cool 2v2 mode.
12903,"After some troubles getting into it, Dota Underlords is my go-to-game if I have an hour to waste. No two matches play the same, the mechanics are interesting, the meta most curious and I love that the smart way to play is not the most intuitive. This game teaches you to restrict yourself, not to shoot for perfect plays and synergies and that soimetimes the best plans have to be thrown away right now.

Hard to get into, if you do not play for a few weeks due to constant balancing-patches, though."
12904,"First it was good, then a little better, then a little worse and now it is completely ruined."
12905,Love the jail system but a lot of balancing left to be done. For example. three mages is no where as powerful as three hunters.
12906,its sweet man
12907,nice time killer :)
12908,very good but can be difficult at time
12909,"Very similar to Chess Rush, fun, challenging, but can be casual as well."
12910,In-depth autobattler gameplay. I have hundreds of hours of in-game time and I'm always excited to log in to see what updates have been made. It's an exciting time to play. Potential to be the standout in the autobattler genre.
12911,"GOOOD TIME PASSS GAME 
"
12912,good game
12913,"good game
balance game"
12914,I like it with the update of Underlord and many class
12915,Fun game. So clean.
12916,Nice strategic game and currently my favorite Autobattler!
12917,Good autochess successor
12918,unbalanced after the big update
12919,game paling kontol
12920,lol
12921,"It's getting better through the updates (so far), pretty unique gameplay imo, and RNGesus is always with you
"
12922,"Uhhh, it's kinda boring and the matches are way too long."
12923,Great
12924,"Fun game, pretty good value considering its free. Highly recommend to at least try."
12925,I like the tinkering and the good bot a.i.
12926,Great game
12927,"its good to see that developers really care about the game and give frequent updates, amazing game"
12928,o0o
12929,"I saw my boyfriend playing this game and was like ""wow that looks dumb."" I started playing it and now I can't stop. It's pretty fun and easy to have on while you're doing something else."
12930,gj valve
12931,the best of the lot
12932,"Addictive auto-chess game. 

Supposed Review bombs because of the ""new UI"".  Maybe? I dunno.  Had game a few days, and got hooked.

So hooked, I watched a few videos, to see what the heck is going on, after losing to Medium Bots a couple times. 

1-- The videos are sadly out of date.  Good thing? Bad Thing?  You decide.
2-- The UI in the OLDER videos is BETTER in some ways, but Worse in others.
3-- I feel that Valve will Fix the broken things, and keep the stuff players like (UI related)

4--- This is an early access game, but unlike 99.9999% of the trash EA games on Steam, this one is real. And it will obviously be updated. I think there is a big future for this game.

5-- As to the game-play, Currently you can get ""Proto-Pass"" free.  Its kind of like Battle-Pass in Dota2. but worse.  Then again, its new, so more will be added, but ITS FREE!!!!!!!!!!!  So good deal (PS- You can level your Proto-Pass against Bots, click the selectors at the bottom of the bot menu, its there)

6-- The game has limited heroes, and it seems there are like 3-4 KEY heroes daily (the roster switches a small amount every day) that basically Run The Board.  It would be stupid to be on the internet and type what heroes are Broken-Bad, or Broken-Good. All that does is invite trolls to say ""nuh-uh,  this one here is way worse/better""  But suffice to say, in probably 25 PvP games (not against bots), I've seen that 95% of the time when a player has at least an average team, and gets one of these 3-4 key troops early, he/she wins.  
7- I expect WAY more hate to come the way of this game in the next few months.  People already have their favorite ""builds"" or ""troops"" to build around. And as Dota Underlords  fixes HUGE imbalances (and does even slight season-tweaking like in Dota2) people will cry ""whaaaaaaaaaa, you broke the game. I cant use <fill-in-the-blank> to ROFLSTOMP everyone anymore"".  So be ready for that.

All in all, really fun game, I predict a minimum of 20+ hours MINIMUM, and its free.  Not bad.  I don't have 20 hrs yet, but trust me, I will. I'm sure.

12935,Best in genre
12936,"things that i liked from this game is.. its really an interesting strategy games with multiple possibilities from making alliances, itemization, talent for ur underlord which is only two for now (i guess this underlord still can improve in number), and theres still a lot of room to improves as well i think..
things that i dont like.. maybe only from the requirements for mobile spec.. if only the developer can make this game run smoothly on low mobile spec,i dont have any problem with the mobile version since my smartphone above average.. but when i invites my friend whos got phone at low or mediocre, they complaints that this game make their phones get heated easily.. aside from that i still stick to my opinion that this game has lot of things to improves.. and i think this game has potential to conquer mobile market as well.."
12937,Its great
12938,"Pick up and play !

Real quick to have fun with it."
12939,Good
12940,"Amazing game
"
12941,I like this game.
12942,"Judged by the size of this games fanbase i'd say it's way too underrated. It's the freshest take on the Auto-Battler genre and since the Big Update is lacking only in the smallest of things. Many people are complaining about the new interface, which I cannot understand, since it's only natural that a new UI feels weird at the beginning. (imo the UI is a massive improvement over the old one.)

Only negative thing i'd say is that the Meta can be kind of stale at certain times if you play more than 5 matches a day, but the developers have proven that the updates they're rolling out regularly enough are giving the game a fresh taste every couple of weeks.

Would recommend strongly if you're into strategy, economy, and autochess games."
12943,bring back old patch!!
12944,Pretty good.
12945,Underlords should not be persistent units.
12946,"great game to kill some time, takes a bit of practice and luck, but you can have lots of funn"
12947,works with my autism
12948,"Fun, still being developed and worked on.

The people that make this seem very responsive to feedback, so I think this game will be even more balanced and polished in several months or a year from now.

I wish play time was slightly sped up by having ~10-15% faster battle animations"
12949,It's super good
12950,kill me
12951,Nice game. heroes have very well made mechanics from dota as we know it.
12952,"Really fun take on auto chess using characters from Valve's title Dota. Valve is constantly updating this game and they are extremely fast with hot-fixes. the game is far from complete and may not be fully released yet, however, it is a fun game to play with friends or alone even in it's unfinished state."
12953,Fun and addictive.
12954,This game is great. I'm excited to see how it progresses.
12955,"Heavy RNG, cheating bots, little to no help for new/bad players, huge learning curve."
12956,"Very good game. Still needs more depth but for a game in BETA its great.  

"
12957,s
12958,It's nice and neat and cool and good.
12959,"After playing this for a while I noticed several things that really stands out.

1. Server issues, several times I have launched a new game ending up disconnected unable to rejoin, losing all my ranked points. This even before I load into some of the games. Sometimes when I finished a game, points are not rewarded and score page crashes. 
2. End game feels too random, pool is just too big when on higher levels. At least the chinese version of Auto Chess has special ""neutral"" monsters (eggs) that can be combined with any monster for less randomness. Would be nice to go into new builds without messing up the comp cause you got unlucky."
12960,top game ..
12961,"Fun, free to play, with amazing devs that listen to suggestions. Can recommend."
12962,I love the chest style game that it is! I'm loving the newest updates with the duos and new heros!
12963,"Wasnt a fan of solo play but the 2 man coop mode is super fun.

Also new heroes and balancing as well as the new game mode."
12964,"If you have one of these days, when you are just sitting in front of your screen and thinking about one of many social faux pas you pulled off this week, just play one more game to free yourself of this burden for another 40 minutes"
12965,Excellent version of the Auto-battler genre - duos is a huge addition and extremely fun.
12966,"A great game must play.
Have capacity to make you play it for hours n hours."

12972,"nice game, always updated by devs"
12973,Nice game
12974,"Fun game with a deceptive amount of skill. Matches are longer than I would like but the core of the game is fun.

Duos is the best way to play."
12975,Variative gameplay with good atmosphere. Good progress in all components.
12976,SMELLS LIKE DOTA DINNER

12991,Good
12992,"Being able to play this game online and offline makes it a very engaging time-killer! The ability to progress whether you're playing against bots, casual matches or ranked, and even with a friend also gives you many different ways to learn and enjoy auto battlers. The humorous, dark theme of the game is also appealing. Most importantly, as a live service game the devs are pushing out hotfixes and updates rather frequently that change the game, even though balance-wise there's still a long way to go (but this is a good first step towards what can be a great game after the failure of Artifact). And it's amazing how there isn't a single bit of monetization compared to the auto battlers out there (Drodo Auto Chess and TFT) which have already begun trying to earn money even in the genre's infancy where its longevity isn't even guaranteed. I think Underlords has the potential to become a great title and I wish the devs all the best in its continued development!"
12993,GG

13003,"The big update adds a level of complexity that makes this game very re-playable. The underlords in particular require a level of experience and mastery which is fun. This will probably never be my ""main game"" (dota is life), but when I am on the road away from my main computer this is my go to on my laptop,"

13012,gmae i liek.
13013,Fun times.
13014,"This game is a good way to kill some time-- you are definitely subject to the RNG gods when it comes to getting the heroes you need to build your army.  And sometimes it isn't entirely clear how the AI is choosing who to attack or why. BUT-- everyone deals with it, and if you build the right army, it feels good watching them clean up.  Would rate this 7 out of 10, and imagine it will climb higher as they clean some balancing issues up (i.e. getting turned into a chicken every 8 seconds)."
13015,Underlord units have ruined it
13016,this shit sucks
13017,Di MOLTOOOO
13018,yes
13019,"Better than Auto Chess on mobile... lol new patch was pretty awesome adding the Underlords

13028,"Probably the best Auto-Chess game right now. Very responsive development team, very engaged community."
13029,"While the meta might currently be a little stale i think the devs are generally heading a good direction with this game. Time will tell. Currently I can recommend this game, even thou the goodstuff meta. The devs showed in the previous balance updates that they are able to shape a more diverse meta game, so I put trust in them for the next one :)"

13040,great game
13041,It is fun.
13042,Pretty fun. Kinda balanced and more accessible than TFT and the original Auto-chess.

13049,"good game, too much rng, but still enjoyable"
13050,This game is great if you have a lot of extra free time. Matches are long and every round is important while still maintaining a casual game feel.
13051,+++
13052,best game ever
13053,Awesome game!
13054,"Great potencial, we will see in the future!"
13055,"A game that's on the move. Also, communication wise it's pure bliss from the dev team!!!"
13056,So fun! It's like a mashup of hearthstone and that tabletop game that Chewie and C3P0 played on the Millennium Falcon.
13057,I like where they've taken this game. The underlords are great. looking forward to more. The Jail is great.
13058,Needs more frequent updates. Steam needs to assign some devs to keep the game alive
13059,Since de update has been a great game
13060,"I like it alot, the Devs have been great at coming out with updates. Whether it's bug fixes, hot fixes or even gameplay changes they seem to be on top of it. Plus the r/underlords community seems to be pretty active too"
13061,"you don't have to do the fight, your team will do everything. need friends for duo"
13062,"Easy to learn, hard to master."
13063,The big update really changed things and added a lot of cool new variety.
13064,"Sucks, they tried to make it revolucionary,now there's just too much , and ain't fun."
13065,I mean in the beginning I was only going to play this with my friends and now I've invested 135 hours into it. It's not perfect but it's fun and that's all that really matters.
13066,nice
13067,"Its like dota meets heartstone meets chess. very nice game.

Edit:  please valve update this game ... just put one intern on this project and rotate the hero pool. With such little effort we can have a good fun game."
13068,Best bodo
13069,"Spent 15 minutes writing a thoughtful review on my phone, hit the back button once too many times and review is gone.

On mobile, play game real goodly one handed, can hold baby or read book or drink cerveza or eat Chinese food or pick nose or poop or pet cat or scratch itches or cook a pancake or ride a bike or shop for used furniture or go to meetings or even play Underlords on a different account and different device with the other hand."

13094,nice

No updates, VALVE killed its own game again."
13098,10/10
13099,"This game is deceptive. It pretends to be idle, while actually requiring a lot of macro-management and strategic thinking. Highly recommended for players who enjoy the management aspects of strategy, while caring little for controlling the combat itself."
13100,I don't know what to write to be honest. I'm just one of many unlucky fellow that fell too deep on dota world.

13109,fun fun yay
13110,"incredible fun auto chess game. constant updates that keeps the meta from stagnating, multiple modes to play, overall beats other auto chess games on the market and its still in beta. also the mobile version is great if u have time to kill away from home."
13111,"Played a little bit, recommend to all."
13112,Complex but in a good way. Seems very overwhelming at first with so much randomness to track but as you keep going and start remembering little pieces it gets cooler and cooler.
13113,Has potential.
13114,"fun game. better than the League version in all honesty.
sometimes you get hit with poor RNG, but that's true for all auto chess games.
new patch is pretty slick, but has forced me to re-learn the game. again. again.
good effort has been made to reduce the impact of cookiecutter builds - a select number of heroes rotate daily as deactivated.
"
13115,"too many bugs, nice game but it'll burn your patience out"

13120,The first auto battler I got into due to it's great UI and easy to understand/hard to master mechanics
13121,Great game. Constantly changing.
13122,"I don't know how to explain how cool the game is. It's a nice blend between fun and competitive. Perfect for casual and hardcore players. The dev team is pretty cool and actually listens to the community. 

Do try out the game. You can also download it on the phone."
13123,a
13124,Fantastic time killer. Late night bong rips and Underlords is a great time for any lonely and depressed person ages 17-35
13125,Much playable like dota 2 !!
13126,"Now that Duos has been added, it has become one of my most played games."
13127,Good fun game to use alittle bit of your time
13128,"Played in the beta and it was really refreshing; a different genre and pacing and playstyle from other games I play.  I normally play FPS and some open world sandbox titles, but this provided a nice change of pace, and has that addictive ""one more round"" kind of feel that often kept me playing well past when I should have been asleep.  On full release, the devs launched so much more content and new game modes/mechanics that it was almost overwhelming, but it feels good to see the devs dedicated to keeping the content fresh and always striving for better balance, and insisting on keeping the meta fresh.  That's how a game stays playable, and doesn't get boring."
13129,还行
13130,good game
13131,"It's fun! Half strategy, half RNG, it's very rewarding once you get to know it well."

13133,good
13134,"it not good at all
the Bad
-enemy can see your board be for you go in play so be ready always be counter picked
-Luck based
-only DPS or Healer who kill them self over time
-Investing into unites Punish you 
-unite tires not clear (and coast goes up again Punishing you investing into stuff)
-lock your powers less in PVP achievements
-good level of cheating floating around so play at own risk
the Good
-only 2 heroes (bad or good but keep some stuff simple)
-still Early access (recommend hold on playing this in till it finish)

in the end play at your own risks"
13135,Dota Underlords has brought this game a long way and i'm quite enjoying it now more
13136,controls are stupid
13137,"Fun game. As long as valve keeps putting in new stuff in the game (i.e new underlords, heroes etc) it will be something that will keep you hooked for a long time."
13138,This game is great! Can't wait for the next update!
13139,"Addictive game, love the addition of duos - hope they expand this feature more!!

Edit:  Game is updated constantly and while some people complain about things getting broken they are always fixing balance issues.  Fantastic!"
13140,fun
13141,the last patch ruined the entire game. its not autochess anymore.. terribly unbalanced metas often. + they deranked the mmr aswell. thats the final time i put in to this game. ruined heroes like tiny aswell. realy realy bad
13142,"Good game, lots of depth and frequent updates."
13143,Valve actually makes a good game for the first time in half a decade
13144,best valves' kid since half life 3
13145,Sometimes.... I reroll..... and get nothing..... and I iz mad.... then sometimes.... I reroll.... and get everything.... and I iz happy

13150,good shit
13151,"good game it is not pay to win at all
luck has extreme value in this game so try to be lucky :) i enjoy playing this"
13152,"it was good game at first but valve made it boring in last updates
"
13153,Fun game but has a strong RNG component. Still recommended.
13154,"Y did Gaben forsake us?

We're still here!"
13155,This game is very fun and easy to learn/play! Awesome to play with friends.
13156,"It's fine, nothing too special"
13157,"I fail to see the the justification for the hype over this game or genre.  Battles are just an uncontrollable, incomprehensible mess."
13158,"This game places a lot of emphasis on making ""alliances"", that is combinations of units that will grant bonuses. It's a neat concept... except I have to click every single individual unit to find out what their alliances are! Within 20 seconds! Until the game shows this info during the buy/setup round at all times for all units this is not recommended (unless you want to learn all the alliances for all units by heart...)"
13159,"pretty good 
try it!"
13160,Frequent patches keep the game interesting. Plenty of engaging game modes.
13161,Under Rated Game. needs more attention
13162,"This game used to be fun and simple to play, but now all these new update make this game more complicated and hard to play. Hero in jail!? This make the game more based on luck than skill. Sometimes, less features is good, but this? This is way too much! Imagine you are eating cereal with tomato sauce, (Yuck)this is how you will feel when playing this game."
13163,"Nice strategy game, the best of Auto Chess, even better it's DotA characters as the unit."
13164,"Fun, addictive. Take calculated risks. Try new strategies. Get lucky. Get unlucky. Try again."

13176,"easy to pick up, very hard to master"
13177,"I know it's early access, but the game was very good, and then they made a huge update that forced the players to pretty much re-learn the game. Incremental patches rather than ones that completely change the game... Please!"
13178,OK
13179,This is the worst game i have ever played! I thought dota 2 was retarded but this beats the meat! DO NOT play seriously. Iplayed once and got COVID-19 from a chinese player
13180,its ok
13181,addictive like drugs
13182,It is going to be better and better，but still need more surprise for players.
13183,I was unfamiliar with Auto Chess games but this is the best of those I've since tried.
13184,the updates are getting better but still need lot of improvement
13185,"It's one of those games that let's you be competitive, if you want that, but you can also be chill and play for fun. I think it's a great game overall and it's still improving, so would definitely recommend checking it out."
13186,Nice MOBA GAME :)
13187,great
13188,hygyh
13189,"Hey~ Clock is ticking!
I like this game overall :)
DU is better after the big update.
I can play anywhere and even play it while watching TV !!"
13190,"Great strategy game, although like dota, the learning curve is quite steep, but it is rewarding. Also, the possibility to not entirely ""lose"" game after 40 mins felt better than actually playing dota. It is nice when you finish 4th you can still get some points rather than lose it (im not Lord yet which uses Elo calculation). Unlike dota where anyone can ruin your game by diving into enemy team 40 mins into the game and insta -25."
13191,"I enjoy the game, the new update is a definite improvement.

I've never played a minute of DOTA but that doesn't matter here, this game is accessible and requires more strategy than you might expect."
13192,Good
13193,Great tactic game
13194,no comment! JUST A GOOD PERFECT AUTO CHESS GAME! WPWP++
13195,Fun auto-chess with frequent updates
13196,"Very good game
"
13197,Greatest chess game!
13198,The Big update ruined already imperfect game.
13199,very nice game!
13200,"This is a really good game, the gameplay is good and the graphics are nice.  I played a lot at release but tapered off a bit after.  This game does heavily rely on RNG as a core mechanic, but its done fairly well.  Definitely worth a shot for a free game,."
13201,"At Launch it didn't quite feel as good as dota chess but now after some massive updates this game rocks and definitely better than Dota auto chess and would recommend it any day!

The game just keeps getting better!"
13202,Valve has good imagination to convert this auto chess into something different than its competitors. And if you are already familiar with DOTA lore than it will be very easy for you to gain good understanding of the game.
13203,its good really
13204,Nice Update ! Nice game !
13205,"Game isn't fun. Changes are mandatory. At the moment inventory space is too low, gold gained is too low and time to think and strategize between turns is also ridiculously low. It should be about having fun and not about who is the best lottery player, yes the game is very random."
13206,"If you like black jack or poker its similar. You need to make the best possible combination of the ones that you got, that's it. Nice concept for a game."
13207,Fun mindless time waster 10/10
13208,"With the addition of duo mode, this game is great for co op. Just as long as you want to hate your friends. 10/10"
13209,Its pretty meh. I don't think Valve understands they need the game to feel fun as well. Games take long. Upgrades are unsatisfying and the RNG for rolling upgrades is very tilting considering how much more powerful units get per rank up.
13210,nice game
13211,Simple Gameplay.
13212,Very fun! Easy to play only use your mouse. Strategic and hard to master but super rewarding and satisfying when you build a winning team! Also Duos are a blast you still fight your own fights but get to help your friend collect troops and vise versa.
13213,At the moment the meta is pretty crappy where there seems to be only 2 or 3 viable builds but I still fundamentally enjoy the game. I think the devs are fairly responsive so I will keep watching the patch notes.
13214,keeps getting better :) dota and hearthstone had a baby
13215,Pudge :) :0 :0
13216,"So many possibilities

13259,Great game with some mindful strategies!
13260,"The best autochess game, I've tried them all and I can safely say that this is the only one you should play.
The idea of auto-battlers/autochess is you build up a army with several sets of alliances. You could go for lots of sets but the tradeoff is that you aren't getting the strongest version of your alliances. But you could also go the strongest of a certain set such as all warriors but your missing out on the other smaller alliance makeups you have.

Then there is how they play together, there is so much variety in this that even if you do something once, there is 1000 other ways to test it and enjoy it.

But every auto-battler has that right? How does Underlords shake it up.
Underlords.

I can safely say the addition of Underlords to the game is the freshest thing I've seen, they dont fit in any alliance and they have multiple abilities. Right now with just Hobgen and Annesix there is so much interaction between them and every alliance that makes every game even more unique

It's fun and casual and it hasn't gotten boring for me."
13261,"Great update!
Waiting for ranked for duo's!"
13262,Relax Games
13263,YES IM LIKE THIS GAME
13264,Latest changes with the addition of Hobgen etc is pretty terrible... They took something that was simplistic and easy to learn and broke it.

13268,game changes meta faster than a bipolar kid changes his mind
13269,best auto chess
13270,"Hi there, I certainly won't see myself as a pro or advanced at Dota Underlords. But I've played a lot of autochess, TFT and the sorts.  If you're looking to main 1 autochess this is certainly one of the top contenders. the best mobile autochess too  (even thougfh TFt mobile is anounced). I could write an in depth review on differences and each games positives but I'll just keep it short and Underlords related only

PROS
-the Underlord units really add another way of playing, can make the same comps work totally different
-can only have 1 item on each unit. imo TFTs biggest flaw is you can hyperstack 1 unit to solo carry
-strong graphics

CONS
-underlords seem not completely balanced, having the wrong UL for the units offered can break your strategy.
-the area items (especially taunt and tomb combo) seem to ruin the experience a bit. if people get offered both rather early they can solo carry games even though their comp might be lacking
-not a huge hero pool like some other autochess, but they will certainly improve this"
13271,"If you like autobattlers, this is an excellent one to play. It's all the fun of the original Dota Autochess mod, but with that extra polish Valve is known for."

13288,Great chill game dont take too much time to learn fun and simple
13289,"The game itself is really good and has potential - the new update has done a lot of things right, and im really enjoying some of the changes to the gameplay. However I cannot recommend the game right now due to the terrible meta (as of 3.11.19)

The big update fucked up balancing hard to the point where only 1-2 builds are viable, and all of those builds use the same units - so you always have to contest them. Anessix's healing is too strong earlygame, Hobgen shines late game but gets destroyed early, which creates a huge disparity between the two Underlords.

Casual players may have no issue with this, however it becomes really apparent when you start grinding the game and want to climb ranks.

From now on I'll just paste a post written by u/megablue on Reddit, which I fully agree on and explains the game's problems:


[i]The early game, some units are way too weak which creates the problem of snowbally early game because some units are simply way too weak and some units are simply way too strong as opener units which create a huge differences in board strength in the early game for those who high rolled good openers compared to those who don't. A 100hp winstreaker could potentially out level everyone else by 2 levels the entire game while remain rich and powerful - they could reach lvl10 before round 25, while everyone else still trying to get to lvl9.

The mid game, it is weird. I think there isn't much of a mid-game with Underlords (in term of current patch). the line is really blur, you just jump from early game to late game almost immediately after lvl6 so realistically the mid game is only like 5-6 rounds. The pacing of the game is also really bad when you don't really have a mid-game to collect 3 cost units. Themed builds are suffering hugely without a proper mid-game.

The late game, some units are outright way too powerful overshadow everything else which create the problem of ""good stuff"". for instance, Arc Warden, Troll Warlord, Bristleback, Medusa, Gyro. Alliance bonus are pretty much unimportant as you can just rush leveling jam those units into your comp - provided you get to find them - which also creates another problem on sole reliance of RNG to win the game provided you are in a game where everyone are at the same skill level. The problems are becoming worse and worse as the weaker players learned that ""good stuff"" still work, how to play ""good stuff"" and how to ""get there"".

Alliances should be the main theme and should be more impactful than just jamming powerful units into a non-alliance focused build - but it is not the case for Underlords. Devs should nerf the shit out of the powerful units - find other ways to activate their power. make all units has a power level closely related to the cost of unit AND activate extra stats when alliance is activated (perhaps even as far as activating per unit bonuses) - they should need more conditions to activate their full power instead of being a single unit that changes everything. this could potentially get rid of non-themed build or make non-themed build highly, highly situational.

Lastly, i wish that there can be more rock-paper-scissor for each themed builds. Something like assassins beating the crap out of warriors. warriors are beating the crap out of hunters but weak against mages or something like that. Instead of simply one or two builds that dominates all.

Also, Hob needs to be on-par with Anes - either nerfing Anes or buffing hob more.[/i]

[h1]TL,DR: Wait for the next balance patch.[/h1]"

1. Constant update and balancing heroes/gameplay which is very good and never get boring with these.
2. Associate with Dota, fyi dota is my childhood game even tho it's toxic i was there for a while. So this game is not really new for me since i knew the source.
3. Multiple types of matches that you can play, Standard, Knockout and Duos. If youre competitive enough then you can proceed to ranked type of match.

And above it all, it's FREE! hehe.. I mean it won't hurt you to try :)"

13349,Very fun game
13350,Great game where every match is different. They update the game constantly and there are no microtransactions!
13351,"This auto-chess genre of games is definitely interesting, and I think Valve has nailed it with Dota Underlords.

While it's still early on, and had a major update affecting pretty much everything you were used to about the game from it's release, it's a lot of fun and seems well balanced.
The offline AI is also fairly decent, with standard play and Duo's available, so for those who like their phone to be on airplane mode, that's a plus.

There's apparently loads more content coming and I'm excited for it. I'd recommend this game!"

13404,S'alright s'free
13405,"Been playing since early beta, probably first week after publication on Steam, it's also first (and only) auto-ches I've played so far. Rules are easy to learn, yet hard to master, and due number of combinations between units/items/aliance/underlords no two games are the same. Currently there's no in game purchases, no loot boxes and other stuff like that - which makes it pure skill + luck experience. I really like the idea that I don't need to be 100% paying attention, as units fight themselves - this makes this game a perfect to play e.g. during lunch at work, as I can eat and play at the same time. Also the availability on virtually every platform (PC/Mobile/Tablet) makes it very playable. One more prop for a lot of updates, which means devs take care of this game.

Please bear in mind, that minimum required time for match is 40 minutes, it would be great if there was a mode of faster game play. 

Anyways, highly recommended!"

The concept of duos is amazing, the jail also brings life to the game. Constant updates also. Then you have ""freestyle"" where you can play with different lineups and test strategies exactly how you want (vs yourself with infinite choices).

All in all it's really good fun, its well made, its alive, and it's one of the rare games I would give a solid 9/10.

He took Ed there but refused to go in
The boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your soul, now come with me Ed
I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again
Dig up this grave, the old lady said
The thing we need it lies there dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free"
13486,Good fun game.
13487,the best game ever
13488,"Better than its counterparts, more micro involved than the other games"
13489,It's fun
13490,Why play chess when you can pick Dota characters to bash it out with items and equipment loot cards too?!
13491,is good :)
13492,stop banning my slark and u cool
13493,fun
13494,y
13495,new update ruined whole way the game was played. Welcome to dota underlords 2 Can we get a classic version
13496,This game is very competitive and addictive
13497,is a great game if you like to strategies and great engagement
13498,"Good clean fun. A bit repetitive, but when played casually that doesn't really matter."
13499,for all of yall out there who suck at dota2.
13500,good
13501,the best!

13504,"Dam i love this Game , play it ! Dont forget the income !"
13505,ok
13506,Great game and it's free.
13507,nice gameee
13508,"This game, for the most part, is just RNG. You are completely at the mercy of luck to even build a decent squad.

Pros:
- Nice to play a spin off game to DotA 2 which is not Artifact
- Interesting list of heroes and abilities

Cons:
- Mostly RNG
- Dated graphics and animations
- Painful to deal with UI
- Art style of Underlord power up cards look pale and uninteresting

I may play this game again after it is out of Early Access but, for now, I cannot recommend it."
13509,"A very interesting game to play. However when played on an ipad, the game is quite unstable and i have experience unexpected crashes. Overall, I would highly recommend the game for those who have no time for real Dota."
13510,I'm still trying to win first place but I love the game!
13511,keren gan

13513,good game

13516,i could play it all day
13517,cool game haha lol
13518,another addictive game
13519,"Really enjoy this game, way more than I thought I would; it's a multiplayer game that's not twitch-based but also not a card game, which I really enjoy.

As Valve keeps tweaking the ruleset I find myself appreciating theme, and overall I find myself enjoying the mechanics and meta of the game just for their own sake. The cosmetic (and, with the Underlords, powerup) rewards also are engaging enough to keep me excited about achieving challenges without feeling in any way like a grind."
13520,!
13521,is gud
13522,good gam
13523,good
13524,Yikes
13525,"Game is phenomenal. It's my most played game right now, it's just that good. Afer 7k hours in dota, I have finally found something else I enjoy as much. Great job Valve."
13526,Fun
13527,"Good game, has potential to be great.  If valve gets the balance right it will be a classic."
13528,It's fun

My review to Dota underlords
10/10"
13530,"You can play while drunk and only fuck over yourself, unlike DOTA"
13531,very addict with new UI
13532,"I really like this new auto-battle genre. Its really fun to see what kind of synergies and units the game throws at you to try to make a good team. Leveling vs rolling for ***, saving for interest, counter-play (when you get to under 4 players), and some RNG make the games competitive and fun. It is annoying when you're the only person on a build and you don't get what you're looking for but the variance doesn't last long if you're good."
13533,"When I first started playing this game, I thought it was pretty easy. It's basically an autochess game, where your only involvement is the purchasing of units, the placement, and the leveling up. Yes, I was winning alot. I thought I was good... Then I met the Chinese. I quickly realized I wasn't good. In fact, I was trash. I still can't comprehend how they managed to get 3 3star units before round 18, yet I was struggling to get even 1.  

Well anyways, It's a fun game, just avoid the people with asian names kuz you'll lose. I'm afraid my asian like name was not enough to infiltrate their highest levels of dota security, enabling me to discover the secrets of how to actually be good at this game. Perhaps in a future reincarnation, I will be blessed with the asian genes, and complete my long lived quest."

13629,Update gradually. Potential.
13630,Game good :)
13631,Valve actually managed to take the successful concept of the dota mod autochess and improve it. I am still surprised that they managed. Also worth mentioning they devote enough attention to bug/glitch fixing
13632,GG
13633,I think this is a good game for playing and talking with my friends.
13634,.
13635,So polished. Great fun and every day is a new experience with the innovative Jail feature.

Pros
+ Nice Strategy game with lot of depth 
+ Can be played with mobile phone 
+ Challenging but quite easy to get into 

Cons 
- Meta is changing pretty radically with some of the updates
- Legion Commander is a trash can"

13645,"the more it updates the worse it gets
"
13646,"Cool Autochess game with a lot of variables and daily refreshing due to heroes jailed.
I recomend to give it a try if you like TFT or Autochess games in general, personally I prefer it to the above mentioned."
13647,Better than TFT by a mile
13648,This is fun!
13649,pretty interesting I should say. the fact that you can build so many combos makes the game really fun
13650,"Great Game, frequent updates, better than tft"
13651,"I like:
Easy to learn
Strategical depth
Constantly surprising content

I disliked:
Playing it in mobile phone
Barricades
Evasive being kinda useless..."
13652,GG RNG game
13653,fun
13654,"More than the present quality, it's the potential of this game that excites me.

As the game is still in Beta, the experience varies from week to week, but the core gameplay and the developers' vision makes it work perfectly. 

Definitely recommend it to everyone into strategy games. Game is free and there are absolutely zero pay to win feature in it (and should never had some in the future)."
13655,good stuff
13656,"nice major update, new hero and aliance"
13657,Just awesome !!
13658,Addictive and somehow the games are as long as a normal dota match
13659,The new mechanic is quite refreshing for auto chess game genre
13660,Not bad.
13661,"Auto chess is sort of a hybrid between card games, and small board tactics. Has rng when buying units from shop and some units abilities, and good comeback mechanics rewarding risky plays and using health as a resource. Constantly making decisions and evaluating the strength of a board-state or bench, as well as monitoring your opponents build or strategy and playing around it rewards the player similar to an RTS or Moba. With the constant developer updates and high level of polish, as well as the new duos mode, this game is vastly superior to teamfighttactics.

EDIT: I do not like this game anymore. Having underlords forces players even more to go for certain builds, bans/jail is basically useless. I liked it alot more before the big update. The new UI is nice. Would no longer recommend.

EDIT2: New fast mode is very nice, short games, and you can pick alliances to start off with so don't feel too gimped. On the fence good for now."
13662,"Loving it. It replaced Hearthstone for me.

Edit: Damn I wish the game wasn't dead :("
13663,"Honestly this game was better with the previous update. Why would valve add ""Underlords"" into the battle. With so many thing happening at once it's hard to keep track with all the spells being casts. Not to mention, The previous Interface was so much better giving that vibe feeling when finding a match."
13664,ezgg

13677,nice quick fun games!
13678,"just leave everything to RNGsus, need lots of skill and destiny draw."
13679,"Was a decent game. Than they updated it. U.I is absolutely aids, HP bars look like shit, spamming units is the only meta now. It's an absolute trash game. Until revert or major re-skin, stay away from it."
13680,better than TFT
13681,"The recent big update changed a TON of things.
Graphics and UI/UX are clearly better now.
Gameplay is changed with the introduction of the Underlord which is a mechanic that makes sense but it's in an early stage and requires some adjustment. I personally like the new alliances, maybe the insect one it's a bit useless but i like the thought behind it.
On a technical side i'm playing this on linux (ubuntu based distro) and sometimes it had some random crash and problems with the inputs, but it seems that they have already fixed a lot of problems.

Totally suggested to all the people that want a semi/static strategic game with cool graphics and animations and considering that we are talking about a beta, it has a lot of potential."

Composition can be countered and the old underlord feeling is back.

13693,its big brain time
13694,"Not enough fire and burning yet, But their getting there. Top notch patch titles too"
13695,"This game is really good. If you are into card games, I definitely recommend trying this. Out of the auto battlers, I definitely prefer this one the best."
13696,One of the better games developed by VALVE
13697,kk
13698,Very good game. Not too challenging and addictive. Would recommend it gladly! :)
13699,Everything
13700,While this game is overwhelming at first (especially since the addition of actual underlords). It's incredibly addictive and great fun when you finally get to know what you're doing. Really recommend the game but also would strongly encourage new players to read around and about the game first. After 5-6 games it should all start to click and full into place.

13732,"It's fun already from the start as a chill no brainer game where you watch things kill each other, but the more you play the more you pick up possible synergies which makes the game design remarkable. You can even monitor opponents moves and deny them access to upgrades. Easy to pick up but very deep if you want to dig in."
13733,"This game is amazing. Looking forward to its Launch date with bigger Update than this ""big update"""

13742,Highly Recommended for all that love tactics game. The developer put a lot of care into the game here.
13743,if you want play game with fully your skill strategy i'm recommend this game because  your victory it from your skill no team no toxic (except DUO mode)  and no mercy for your mistake/failure
13744,wow

13751,"Fun, excellent time waster"
13752,"This is a great take on auto-battlers. The randomness helps guide your strategy but doesn't feel restrictive, and hero choice and positioning enable deep strategic play."
13753,love this game its easy to play but yet hard to win and actually gives your brain a challenge.
13754,FUN
13755,Very addictive to play. The games are fun and never repeat themselves.
13756,Great turn based strategy game with a mix of match 3
13757,"The devs are lightening fast with hotfixes throughout the week and have been trying all sorts of things throughout the beta period.  There's been some mis-steps here and there design-wide but they keep what works and move on.  The recent jail feature is excellent for keeping the game fresh.  The game itself is fun, though sometimes games last a bit too long.  RNG doesn't ever really feel too bad, though item balance isn't great right now.  There are some alliances that probably need some fine-tuning with the way the jail works as it can kind of make them unplayable (scrappies being the biggest offender).  The game will probably be out of beta by the end of the year and with the way the dev team is working it will hopefully be in a great state with the two extra underlords."
13758,better than crack
13759,Best autochess game imo

13761,YO!
13762,"Yo, 2019 is wrapping up and this game is the tits.  I'm real bad at it, and I invite you to come whoop my ass and stomp all over my bare ass."
13763,This is game is fun and balanced and different concept with the other autochess type game. it has its own uniqueness
13764,Duos update is a lot of fun with friends. There are some ongoing balance issues but overall they seem not to afraid to shake up the meta.
13765,nc game
13766,good for potheads

13769,its way better that LOL TFT at leat i dont have to worry to much about items cuz thats all TFT is dont matter the champ.this is more chill and does worry about how your TEAM is set up .. i would give it a try

13802,Outstanding! The Competitiveness is perfect!
13803,"30 October 2019 - The game has now had a significant content patch which has massively over complicated the game and added too many variables to manage. The game is no longer fun, and feels like Artifact all over again. Really disappointed as I was really in love with Valve's interpretation of the Auto Chess genre. 

I'll revisit this review and return to positive if/once the game has been patched. If you're considering trying the game for the first time now; I'd wait, the current state of the game is not reflective of it's best."
13804,A very well designed game with infinite amount of posibbilites to end the game.
13805,Cool game
13806,New complex genre for people tired of the same type of games
13807,solid free to play game.
13808,Fun autobattler!
13809,Cool game that can make you rage within minutes.
13810,.
13811,Really well thought out =)  Quality game that will make you happy and enrage you at the same time.
13812,Best Game Ever!!
13813,"Easy to play, but there is a depth to it. I don't win very often but I'm having fun!"
13814,Awesome Auto Chess game!
13815,8228
13816,Sim. Bom.
13817,"Berry nice, would play again. Although I still miss the time when all the players had their boards on a single map, so looking around was very painless. Also. while duos is great with a friend, the game mode itself sucks in the sense that five gold units are impossible to get and so most of the interesting end games combos are not present in the mode."
13818,"Havn't tried Riot's version of this, but I like how its trying its own thing separate from Autochess on Dota 2"
13819,"Update for Season 1 release: Hope you like Bloodseeker.

Original review: Recent changes have made the game even worse. It's completely unbalanced with only a few viable strategies. I've never gotten so frustrated playing a game before, and it's all due to RNG and balance."
13820,its fun
13821,Great for playing on a tablet while doing cardio at the gym :)
13822,Good game
13823,"The game is very polished atm and the team working on it are doing a really nice job of keeping to add a nice mix of qol, new features and content."
13824,"Nice game! Like Pokémons in a board game, cool!"
13825,GG
13826,"Fun game, great devs"
13827,It's cool
13828,"I'm having a lot of fun with this game. 

coming from league of legends, It almost makes me want to play Dota 2, but for now the autochess is fine. 
I highly recommend it to anyone."
13829,pretty good
13830,"Simple UI design, Easy to learn mechanics. The different types of characters and their synergies really make this game fun and enjoyable. I have played hundreds of games at this point and love trying new comps. 

Almost all of my time is on Mobile and I have never had an issue with the client or performance."
13831,"fun game, strategy always changing
"
13832,"Guaranteed losses, and rewards people for googling the meta. The game is on rails and takes you for a ride you probably don't want to be on."
13833,"This is fun mainly because I use to and played many hours of Dota. I like that you can jump in and kinda draft heroes and try to make alliances, it's kind of a way to gamble without paying or winning money! Very fun."
13834,You're more of an overlord than an underlord but this chess stuff is fun
13835,"Old DotA players like me will like this game for sure. You don't have to give %100 attention to game, but still can enjoy it very much."
13836,goddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
13837,Full of bugs and need a lot of work super lazy dev team
13838,Free. Fun.
13839,:)
13840,"this is a very good game. A lot of people say its RNG and it really isnt. There is RNG to it, but when you get decent at the game (and itle take quite a while, at least it did for me) you wont even notice it. They have come very far sense the release of the game and I strongly promote this game to anyone who likes what would almost be a strategy battle royal. If you do not have the patience of losing a lot before you figure it out, then this game would not be for you. If you do however this game is really great when you figure it out, and there are tons of people who are way better no matter what so it keeps pushing you to try new combos and get better. I have suggested this game to many friends (even ones who I didnt think would like it) and they have all loved it so far. Again, the begining struggle is realm But when you get past that you will love this game."
13841,"this is hands down the best chest game rn, simply cz im a dota player )))"
13842,"Very good dev team working on it, it is inevitable to just get better and better with each update"
13843,A nice strategy game. Can be tricky/complicated to get started and has its own learning curve. But is never boring or stale once you grab the basics. Especially after the underlords update.
13844,it big brain game no?
13845,gg
13846,"Lots of fun, I like it still after the update."
13847,Good game
13848,Its alright
13849,Fun
13850,"It's free and it's awesome, play it!

Edit: Long since abandoned, sad to see it go."
13851,"Fun game, update and bug fixes are quickly released.

UPDATE:

After the game has been released, the game has seen updates almost every week. Either with fine tuning, crash fixes or or balancing updates. Also updates that add new stuff, like hero and alliances. 

The game feels solid on steam. But the mobile version of the game does not run great it's extremely graphics demanding so only high end mobile platforms can run it decently without lag."
13852,after the update the game is insane
13853,fun with the new duo mode
13854,nice
13855,Me like
13856,"like dota, less cykas"
13857,"Great and fun game. Devs are very active and frequently communicates with the community, takes their feedback seriously."
13858,highly addictive and a easy to learn game that anyone should pick up and give ago.
13859,"this is a good alternative game to play if you just want to relax or burn some time. it can also be a great escape when you are having a losing streak in dota or other games. and last,  you can also play this game with your friends for more interaction. :)"
13860,"Very nice, very good"
13861,"Mostly OK, nice UI. But it takes quite a long time for one game, sometimes you just wait the results and nothing to do."
13862,Amazing
13863,I fun time waster of a game. The best part is I can play it on my phone too!
13864,gucci
13865,A better game than Artifact
13866,It is excellent for one the road or at home. It has become a great game with later updates! Recommended.
13867,Addictive Game. Got to to watch guides to get good though.
13868,"the Big Update was HUGE. Puts this game miles ahead of other autochess style games. Get in here, you."
13869,Love the game.
13870,my favorite auto battler. The devs have put so much love into this game and I am very excited to see the future of this game.
13871,Best game in the current market with a huge dev support!
13872,The game offers a nice strategic depth that rewards smart decisions and game knowledge. Also it's really fun to see how you carefully laid plans either play out perfectly or explode in your face :)
13873,Game is fun
13874,"nice game 
"
13875,"This is, without a doubt, the best version of Autochess. It took the fun ideas of the mod and refined them into a game rather than just RNG. I wish it was updated more, but it's the kind of casual game you can play, wait for updates, and come back to."
13876,Best Autobattler
13877,nice game
13878,"At the current patch of the game, all you do is it destroyed by any healing/damage reduction comps because it literally doesn't matter how much damage you deal they will outheal/DR it"
13879,gg
13880,Solid Game
13881,"Cool game concept, gets regular updates, free to play, can play with friends. Why not try it out?"
13882,Good game
13883,It's getting better.
13884,"Best autochess game out there, honestly this is soo good, im not even a dotaplayer. Just look at my hours"
13885,Good game I like!
13886,ok
13887,chronocube 10/10
13888,"its good game
"
13889,"Lots of fun, interesting mechanics, stuff is still changing a lot since it's in Beta as I write this, but it looks like the devs know what they're doing and yeah, definitely recommend trying it!"
13890,best auto battler
13891,better than any other iteration of dota fax
13892,NIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE GAME !
13893,game chua benh tri
13894,"My favourite of the auto chess variants. Clean UI, tight balance, regular, large updates. I'm very excited to see what comes next."
13895,Trying to survive against the odds of stacked RNG and insults from your enemies is is refreshing!
13896,I enjoy Underlords as it is relaxing and unique each new game.
13897,GGWP!
13898,so nice
13899,nice la
13900,10/10
13901,It was very challenging with the new big update. There was a lot of things that was addedbut nevertheless fun
13902,Many funs
13903,"While I have had my reserves about Underlords to start with, it's definitely coming into its own now with the addition of the Underlords finally being added. As far as Auto Chess games go, this one is definitely currently top of my list as far as enjoyment. It has a smaller learning curve than the other ones, especially since you dont need to worry about item combinations, and is constantly being updated and improved upon. Yes there is a fair amount of rng, which is going to be the case for any autobattler, but this one feels like it hurts you less overall.

Edit: To futher add, the new game mode makes for some great quick bite-sized games that take 10-15 minutes to play though, which personally is the perfect amount of time for me to set aside for this game. It's faster and has it's own strategy, which is great to see. Glad Valve is trying to change things in this genre up a bit."
13904,gud game
13905,its fun
13906,Great game for listening to podcasts/music to since it doesn't demand too much attention. It's also super fun.
13907,"its so great
"
13908,nice game
13909,"It's like a MOBA for people who can't rely on their coordination and reaction time to win the game. A great hybrid of slow-paced, careful planning and fast-paced, automated battles that require barely any control from the player. Great if you're trying to do something while playing a game."
13910,...
13911,asd
13912,gud game
13913,"Fun and addictive. Although there's a large RNG element to it, there's still enough strategic choices so you don't feel you're completely screwed because of bad rolls."
13914,"Good game, tbh."
13915,So good it nearly makes up for Artifact.
13916,"Played about a half hour and was just too hectic.   Nothing is explained well.   You are supposed to buy troops and then place them and pick items and  by the time half of that is done, the next round starts and you can't get anything useful on the board.   They need to give way more time between rounds to actually do anything useful.   At least I think so, but who knows?   They don't really tell you how to play at all anyway, and when the match starts, you can't tell wtf is going on."
13917,good and high af
13918,I love the deeper thinking strategy aspect of the game. The community is great and the devs actually care and keep up with updates and hot fixes. Keep up the great work on this one!
13919,Amazing game way better than teamfight tactics
13920,"Before ""major"" patch it was a good game to spend time in.
Now its just an unballanced, awful looking, bugged piece of poop.
Thinking hard right now on going to TFT or AutoChess.
2/10 visual
0/10 balance
7/10 idea
0/10 realisation of the idea
10/10 ""prison"" idea"
13921,"RNG is frustrating at times but that's the way it is, most players share the same.  i am already hooked - will climb up to become a lord and hopefully join tournments"
13922,nice relax game
13923,Really Starting to Shape up.
13924,addictive
13925,"I was a bit sceptical about this game in the beginning and the only reason I played it was because i was not able to play Dota 2 due to technical reasons.
Playing this game was like taking a whiff out of a empty cocaine bag but after a few games you start to get attached to it when it plays to your ocd and the general satisfying toot when you complete a 3 star unit.
Once the big update came and the duos mode was made public I started liking this game even more, it made it extremely fun to play with your friend who is as enthusiastic about playing it with you and having a voice chat open makes it even more worthwhile. I highly recommend this game to those who have gotten fed up with Dota 2 and have friends stop playing it because they are busy with work.
Pros:
-Can play it both in mobile and pc
-Duos mode( 2 player mode)
-OCD satisfying(if your lucky)
-very exciting
Cons:
-No cute mascot 
-Drains battery in mobile
-Requires dota 2 knowledge about skills and heroes"
13926,everything
13927,Truly easy and fun to play.

13929,ADDICTIVE :)
13930,best auto chess  game
13931,Amazing and fun
13932,eh
13933,I love this game :)
13934,"It's a free and zero tilt game, unless your luck runs out :D"
13935,it's so good
13936,An amazing strategy battler with good game mechanics. People who have played dota before will especially enjoy it !
13937,"I like this game, relaxing"
13938,You need a little bit luck but also strategy. I like that.
13939,Stale meta. Unbalanced. All over the place. Go play TFT instead.
13940,since the big update it gave a new life to this game yet again
13941,good and worth a try =))
13942,Just keeps getting better with every update
13943,good
13944,This is a very good game and I like it very much. The drow ranger is pretty and I want to make love with her and make drow babies.
13945,A fast working development team gives this game a bright future.
13946,Really well designed game and the devs keep making great updates for the game.
13947,It's a lot of fun and the dev's are making a lot of interesting changes.
13948,Best game ever
13949,A great timewaster and a unique take on autochess which I hope will keep evolvin
13950,"Best auto chess on the market. The Underlords do add an element to the game, still enjoyable to play single player vs. bots. How fast you can act can give you an advantage sometimes but not required. There is just enough RNG to keep things fun."
13951,"I played Dota Auto Chess, TFT and Underlords and to me, the king is Underlords. Not even tried duo mode yet and with the new update nothing come even close to it."
13952,"RNG, no thanks. Had a three star hero one time, that was only because of druids..."
13953,"Good game, still on beta but last update was huge and made it actually playable.
Recommended 100%"
13954,"Never played Dota but I picked this up quick, very fun"
13955,fun

13960,"I cant stop playing, this game is awesome"
13961,:)
13962,SOLO STRATEGY GAME AT ITS FINEST...UNLIKE MOBA WHICH I HATE THE OUTCOME TOTALLY FROM YOURSELVES ...BUT RNG GABEN SAMA STILL PLAY A PART SO KEEP PRAY BOIZ
13963,Look at the hours I sank in. Not planning to stop. Awsome game.
13964,Yes
13965,it's all fun and games
13966,"Nice and entertaining game, lots to think of in game."
13967,its pretty fun
13968,"it's a good update, please give more hero ty <3"
13969,"Okay, Valve has no fucking clue what to do with balancing so I just give up on this game."
13970,"constant update but yet to balanced the rates where a person is able to get 3 star unit at round 13 and completely snowball from there
"
13971,a well created chess game with balanced complexity
13972,OOF
13973,This BIG UPDATE is EPIC. Different gameplay everyday. Different strategy everyday. FUN
13974,Easy to get into - but lots of depth available.
13975,"I love to play this in the airport on my laptop when I have some hours to burn. Easy to play, hard to master. You will get hooked to it for sure."
13976,Just one more round..
13977,"Great game, best auto battler by far."
13978,good game
13979,"It's easy to play, hard to master.
"
13980,"Great idea, great game. Probably the best auto-battler game in the scene right now."
13981,"Underlords is unique to other auto battler games after recent big update. They need to work a bit more on balancing but overall, it has the most balanced playing experience comparing to other auto battler + it has the best graphic and effects."
13982,"Its free, go try
Not pay to win just luck to win"
13983,It required luck a lot. Rotating the hero selection is the main thing you do to win the game.
13984,My favourite dota game
13985,Great strategy and card game
13986,"simply put, prepare for ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Just 3 minutes inside a game will make you think i'd rather play minecraft only this time you cant punch a tree... challenge anyone OwO"

13993,Ya
13994,"One time I made a really big ogre. He was as big as the whole screen.

It was from that day forward that I knew this game was worth playing"
13995,is good
13996,better than dota2 itself
13997,good
13998,"I've been trying a lot of different ""auto chess"" game. And this one is i think the most solid one. After the recent updates, Underlords added a lot of interesting features and cosmetics to decorate your battlefield. It's a yes from me"
13999,Good fucking game boys
14000,Awsome
14001,Most fun game on steam
14002,Excellent auto-chess like game with extra gameplay
14003,This game is love.
14004,"Wonderful, deep, complex game"
14005,"Однозначно лучшая игра в жанре на данный момент. Радует возможность играть не только на ПК, но и на смартфоне, а также оперативные фиксы и обновления. После выхода «Большого обновления» стал играть гораздо больше, ведь Лорды добавили игре огромный выбор вариантов сборок.
Любимый сеттинг + хорошее исполнение, что ещё нужно?
Однозначно рекомендую!"
14006,i think it is bad because i cant stop playing
14007,"Pokemon, gonna catch em all"
14008,Its a pretty good game....
14009," Really easy to learn, very addictive and satisfying."
14010,very good and maneiro
14011,nice to play with friends PepeHands
14012,"After the game came out of beta and it was major update everything was ruined.
Most alliances were ruined, Assassins are very low... about Knights prefer to stop here, just play and you will see that you have no chance of top 4
They mentioned that the major patch will come with BattlePass, this was FAKE news!

Edit : Last update 18 Dec 19 they remove so many heroes, I uninstall that. 
R.I.P. Game coming"
14013,"good, i recommend that even people like my challenged friend mikkel plays it"
14014,nice games
14015,DOUS IS THE WAE
14016,the game cut my mmr in half i work hard for that and just for nothing half of them are gone
14017,The duo mode of underlords is extremely fun to play with friends
14018,Interesting take on the autochess genre. Updates are very good and bring refreshing new content.
14019,good game i  am now waiting for full version
14020,Obviously your dad jailed 24/7...
14021,"Good game, and more big updates come soon TM!"
14022,very fun and addicting game
14023,Easy and addicting game. Only downside is that the matches can be a bit long.
14024,ok la
14025,Fun game
14026,The game dev is very responsive and the game itself is very fun and creative
14027,cool game
14028,nice game for strategy and deep thinking

14032,is good
14033,goks
14034,Fun and chill :D
14035,8/9
14036,It's not the Witcher 3 but it's playable
14037,"great adaption to the classic auto chess, valve have done a great job taking the best from auto-chess and continue to listen to community feedback to make an awesome experience for new and veteran players of the genre.

the latest update has added a huge amount of new content and the addition of underlords to the game brings a whole new dynamic. looking forward to what they bring out next when out of beta."
14038,great game to play while watching anime and reading manga
14039,pretty fun game if you like games that challenge your brain
14040,Needs more work but its good!
14041,"This game is a little fast paced for my liking, but being able to play against computers is fun I think :)
Coop is also fun. Once you play for a while and figure out what everything does it gets much easier."
14042,Fun to play but hard to win matches
14043,It's a great game. I really like the recent update. I still can't really figure out if this game is more luck or more skill. I pretty much always place top 4.  Basically you earn money by winning or saving money. Then you use that money to buy heroes to place on the battle field. The Luck/RNG comes when you find 9 of the same hero or a really good item that works well with your team.
14044,"its dota, but instead of letting your team down, you let yourself down."
14045,I like the dota chess pieces
14046,New stuff very goooood
14047,good game gg
14048, The worst update i have ever seen
14049,"Over 50 games, rarely getting 3 stars while my enemies get atleast 4 3-stars. Slark/Spectre/Meepo 3-star gettin rekt by them everytime."
14050,Gives me flashbacks to warcraft 3 frozen throne. Great job!
14051,dasdasdasdfdsgsdfgdfsg
14052,Decent game!
14053,good game
14054,"Not a bad auto-battler. I don't have much experience with 'em, but it's a good game to play while watching bad tv. Matches take a bit to complete"
14055,"All in all, the best ""auto battler""  "" battle chess"" game I've played yet. (the very few dislikes could also be due to beta and having 2 underlords or ""heroes"")

Likes:  Hero is an actual combat piece
           Hero has a talent system to flesh out specific builds
           Items are NOT recipe based and can be moved between rounds no perma equip
           Neutral rounds guarantee an item and give you choice narrowing down 'random' element

Dislikes:
               For people learning, non bot games where you can pause move VERY fast paced especially brand new players.

               Sometimes you lose a round due to something as simple as positioning but it's hard to tell what caused a lost round when things go bad. [readability]

14056,this game fun

14059,Great

14067,"Its fun, simple to figure out and hard to master. Things changing constantly and keeping it fresh feeling. Rarely long queues for playing either."
14068,Great Game!
14069,"if you already killing time before using DOTA 2, then this shit here will good as hell because you can playing it on mobile and killing more time then ever before, but guess what ? YOU CAN PLAY UNDERLORDS (on mobile of course) WHILE YOU PLAYING DOTA 2 at the same time lols. now for the real review, this is gem, like any other gem, addicting, have love and hate relationship with this piece of game, the update awesome, I will give it 7.8/10. ""LETS BURN SOME CHICKEN !"" -HOBGEN"
14070,broken game
14071,nice game
14072,Entertaining and casual style
14073,best from arcade game
14074,Definitely a lot more fun that LoL auto chess. This is a fun resource manager game that has decent comeback mechanics. I'm having a blast with it.
14075,"Horrible game, refresh the ranking system every big update, i was at rank 1,300 with more than 900 hours of gaming, they just decided to refresh and take away more than 10,000 of my rank point. Worst ranking system i ever seen and they won't help, no customer service"
14076,The most responsive devs I've ever seen in 20+ years of gaming.
14077,PLEASE - WE DONT WANT ANY MORE UNDERLORDS UPDATES - BRING OUTLANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!

14089,Updates regulary.
14090,"If you like yelling at your monitor this is the game for you!
Good fun but difficult to rank up because of Streamers telling everyone what build they should use.  I should add, Streamers ruin every game."
14091,Great game. Still in BETA and have spent so many hours playing!
14092,"Good new UI, love the mech, but still... hate the RNG especially when only 2 unit left to be 3 star level. Rarer than Ace unit. But overall, I'm satisfy."
14093,"I liked that it's free and fun, so I'll give them the updoot. Especially since I don't feel like they are reaching in my pocket trying to get me to spend money."

14106,"Update Jan 2021: This game has been abandoned with zero communication about if there's going to be another update or any. There's also a gamebreaking bug that crashes on a battle pass feature. So, while this game had a good run. I'd say its dead in the water atm. 

One of my favorite games all time. Other AutoChess games don't hold a light to Underlords. Looking forward to future updates. Keep up the good work everyone!"
14107,"Absolutely great game.

Gameplay, UI, sounds and graphics are rally top drawer. And it's only getting better. The game has all the core mechanics and some basic or arguably essential alliances of the genre. But from that foundation the rest is very well innovated. As with dota 2, the design philosophy you see when you play the game encourages confidence that it will not stagnate or deadlock.

I see an extremely high skill ceiling for competitive play but also no shortcomings in terms of casual play -- casual mode, the great art and with the latest patch, 2vs2 and daily-banned heroes. It's a game that's easy to learn but very difficult to master. 

While it's all completely free right now, the game is still in beta and the 'proto pass' and 'achievements' sections look very reminiscent of DotA 2's battlepass and Dota Plus. Since DotA 2 has always been truly free to play, I expect Dota Underlords to follow the same path."

14123,NICE
14124,"The new update and UI its great, but some new player may found it rather hard to understand the game play, i give it a 7/10. Just a little bit advice, for the duo's, i hope the field that used for unit can be the same field as my friend, so it really does give a sensation of duo's thing. Thanks

Regards,

:)"
14125,"Just a tad bit addictive, great fun."
14126,"Hard to get in, definitely not for everyone, probably will never be balanced but the more you play and understand it, the better it gets. It can actually help you develop some useful skills such as resource management, strategy, real-time situation awareness, adaptivity. Helps improve and expand your memory! Overall the game has a lot to offer but not everyone will accept it."

14128,"Not the Dota Auto Chess I fell in love with, still going in an unexpected and interesting direction."

14134,"The best autobattler. I honestly don't know how anyone prefers TFT to this game. The UI/UX is far superior, especially for determining your alliances. There is a much lower learning curve to playing the game, although there is a very high skill ceiling if you wish to play ranked."
14135,Fun Auto battler with Dota Heroes. Beautiful animations. lots of updates.

14141,"The big update was really, really, really a big shit.
Thank you Volvo."
14142,"So far I really like the game, and honestly the UI change is excellent compared to before. Granted I am a new player so I don't have to relearn the UI, but still, I believe it is a positive change and I really like the jail mechanic. 

It makes the game have more variability to builds and forces people to change their gameplay.

Cheers!"
14143,Great addictive game!
14144,Good game!
14145,based
14146,Although it's a ripoff (Autochess / WC3 Funmap) Underlords did a good job going their own way. Adding new mechanics over the course of several updates. In my opinion Underlords is a game to lean back to. Nothing too complex. Invest a fair amount of time and you will climb the ladder.
14147,I really like it.
14148,"This game is fun !

14165,"Same meta decks over and over again. Netdecks like hearthstone, lack of skill. Jailing certain heroes block out alliances, thus its the same strong decks at the end of end of every game. Warriors, ""good stuff,"" or mages.

Ladder is also completely meaningless as it's who plays the most since games net mmr all the same in the end."
14166,This game is fantastic. Play it.

14168,Cool game :)
14169,Fix the Bug of Brill Bruiser not going nearby enemy it will just stand
14170,The game play is fun all around. I wish you could actually chat with the other players though
14171,"I really liked this game before the big update. I like that they added the jail system along with new units but the Underlords themselves I don't feel are a great addition to the game as they tend to take a lot of spotlight away from building your comp. Personally I thought that the Underlords were just going to be different passives that could push your build in a certain direction before you even started a game. I also hate the new UI. Everything is smaller and harder to look at combined. In addition the moving heroes on your bench is now more janky than it was before and the units and there health and mana bars look fuzzy as opposed to their straight, clear look they had before. Overall I say this game needs some improvements."
14172,"As of The Big Update I can really recommend this game to folks, with the previous iteration I would play one or two rounds and then be good for a few days, but the addition of the titular Underlords and all the additional/reworked mechanics have made this game into something I'm playing on a near-daily basis now. The duos mode is also a lot of fun if you're looking to add an element of communication and coordination to the game, and with a little rebalancing of damage/health values I could see it becoming the go-to competitive format for the game. There's no guarantee that a given person will like the autochess gameplay or not without trying it first, but this is definitely the best one to try now."
14173,Pog
14174,Good Game
14175,"Very nice and unique approach to DAC games. 

Props to dev team for fast reaction!!"
14176,D:
14177,After latest update game got more complicated and interface got overall worse. If only they would focus on quality instead of quantity of content i could recommend this game.
14178,It is very good game filled with excitement and self loathing about why you rerolled from 50 gold to 0 and you didn't get a single three tier hero upgrade from your 10 level 2 heroes.
14179,Great game for solo but even greater if you play duo which requires constant communication and planing with your friend.
14180,"Fun version of autochess, especially if you already like the dota universe."
14181,everything is fine now
14182,very like all about dota... and this gameplay is out of the box... nice game!
14183,"A truly unique game, within the autochess genre. I've also never seen so much dedication from game developers before. They're trying their best, and it shows for sure."
14184,"The developer team really listen to us.

We are creating the best auto chess game ever!"
14185,yes
14186,"Been playing this for the majority of time on my phone, and I really like it as a time waster at work or when I'm just need to kill some time. The game has a lot of luck, but there's enough depth of strategy here that I have played a couple dozen games and while that isn't a lot, I feel like I am still learning new set ups and strategies. The Steam integration on mobile is much appreciated, and performance and visuals are great. On PC, it mostly looks like Dota 2, which means it is pretty good all things considered. Seeing Valve get into the mobile space with a full fledged PC game with actual depth is great, and I hope we see cross-play with mobile from them in the future. Artifact seems like a no-brainer to expand into that space, considering the popularity of Hearthstone."
14187,"The game was nice at start, in the end was a little less enjoyable for me. With just 2 heroes the game was even much much nicer than when they added more heroes, and I like to have a lot of heroes, just the game and UI got confusing in the end. Sad. It was a nice game tho, I think the game was less nice in the end cause the devs got demotivated or internal issues with each others or just lack of $$. Too bad cause I was good at it=)"

14193,"i've played 750 hour the beta version, now the game not interesting me"
14194,"Sometimes less is more. This game was better and easier to figure out back when there was far less going on. There's so much visual noise on the board now. 

One thing that makes these kinds of games good in the Dota Chess genre is that you can see the actions, power, and shortcomings of your individual pieces. I.E. you see that your choices matter. This has now basically been ruined in this game.

For context, the recent update has added the Underlords, which are essentially a Hero unit. The problem is these guys (only 2 in the game right now) have like 10+ abilities, and you can't tell when they're triggering or what they're doing in a visibly noticeable way. It adds way more noise to the board, and it's generally just a pointless feature. The game was fine without them, they feel super gimmicky, and it erases some of the cool parts about the game, like having each game and team feel different. 

Additionally, Underlords have extra abilities only unlocked if you're already doing really well in the game, so that's something else added to snowball early success and prevent come-back victories. 

Additionally, the recent update has destroyed the existing, simple, readable UI to accomdate the Underlords' extra features and stuff that just the amount of screen the Underlords UI takes up is almost as big as the entirety of the old UI. The whole UI now is very clunky, things moved into very un-instinctive places.

I doubt that any of this gets reverted. But the game was better when it was leaner, simpler, and easier to read. While choices you make still matter, it's way harder to see that difference play out.

Additionally this recent update added a load of new chess pieces, a couple new alliances, and shuffled/changes almost all the previous ones. I'll give this the benefit of the doubt and say it's okay because if you play long enough you'll learn them, but many feel very unintuitive. While on the surface, adding more chess pieces seems like a good thing, it just ends up clogging up your draws and decreasing the chance you have of getting the specific pieces you want for your composition. If you were already not jazzed about the RNG of whether or not you drew this certain hero to round out your team, just wait til there's 20+ more heroes that you can possibly get on top of the existing ones that will come up instead."
14195,"I liked previous iterations of Underlords but really didn't enjoy the Big Update. I also just don't understand where the ""Underlords"" even come from, lore wise, in the Dota universe. The whole thing is just strange both conceptually and mechanically."
14196,Innovative and easy to learn game. Recommended.
14197,Its a fun Auto Chess Game. Good for some casual rounds with friends sitting together in discord.
14198,it's fun
14199,Dota but chess.
14200,best mobile game on PC. well done
14201,"Engaging, challenging game with deeply involved devs and frequent updates. The Big Update completely transformed the game and I feel like I'm relearning everything, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I find this to be a deep multiplayer strategy game that can be played quickly without requiring the twitch reactions of something like  Starcraft."
14202,Awesome addictive game.
14203,"Play it for 100hr 

its a great game and the new content we change the game"
14204,(y)
14205,best chess game !!!!
14206,This is my first time writing a review and ever since the big update. I think this game will go up as one of the greatest game of all time.
14207,"Dota 2 has literally changed my life.  Because of Dota 2, I met new friends, started a business, lost a lot of money, and got into a (hopefully long-term) relationship.  I actually don't like playing Dota 2 anymore, but I do like playing Underlords.  It probably won't change my life the same way Dota 2 has, but I like that I can play it on my phone."
14208,"Just win 4Head
"
14209,"This game used to be quite addictive, but with the recent addition of Underlords, every opponent feels exactly the same. The jail system was a good implementation, but it's overshadowed by the garbage that is the Underlords. If they introduce a mode without Underlords on the board, the game has potential to be fun again."
14210,"Fun, simple, addictive!"
14211,such casual much compitetive
14212,it good
14213,easy to play and its funny
14214,Amazing strategy game. It's free and not pay to win. Over 400 hours and I'm still not bored with it.
14215,Great game
14216,"I actually really disliked Autochess when it came to Dota 2, but once this released I found it to be pretty fun. The UI changes seem pretty good so far as well."
14217,"It's fun and obvious they've put a lot of time into it, and are continuing to do so."
14218,.
14219,Yes.
14220,Simply put the last update messed it up even more than the one that introduced the jail.
14221,"shit game! Now its really a RNG GAME! Ruin a decent game with a patch for kids! Shinny shit but nothing productive and increasing the rng rate by a lot and tactic wise decreased by too much! With recent patch, stay away from this crap!!!!"
14222,"EDIT: They have fixed the problems with Annesix healing as such the battles are back down to a reasonable time so I'm changing my review to a thumbs up. However many of the UI element problems remain but I feel that Valve will eventually give people a way to modify this as its just the UI.

I just went to fire up this game today and for the first time since I started playing I actually closed it down because I'd rather play something else.

Honestly I really liked this game before the big update. It was one of my favorite things to do while chilling out. That might sound weird to some but it really felt like a low stress game. You're mostly making decisions based on what heroes you get and then positioning them and sort of watching everything unfold.

The latest updates has two things that I don't like, one I'm sure will get fixed but the other I am not so certain.

The first flaw is the UI. I feel like this is the smaller problem because I'm sure the devs will eventually allow people to customize it to look however they want. 

The second and larger problem is the introduction of the Underlords. Currently Annesix just makes the game unfun.

Battles before had some surprises but you could normally tell which way they are going. Annesix has a heal that is board wide and happens with enough frequency to not only draw out the individual rounds (and then also the games as a whole) but it make it feel like your heroes are trying their hardest to kill the enemy but they just can't.

I don't normally leave reviews but I like this game enough to do it because I keep seeing all the positive reviews coming in from people who have few hours into it.

That's one of the great things about Underlords though is that anyone can play it right away. Its easy to get into but difficult to master. The game may be going in another direction and that's fine as well I'll just be sad that its not the game I love anymore."
14223,Meh
14224,"It's so good, ahhhh, yes it is.

The developers are super open and communicating very well too"
14225,"Solid time consumer, dope looking art and game design!"

14234,"Amazing game in early access. 
Then the ""Big Update"" with the Underlords came and it fucked up the whole game. :(
The Underlords make the game random and confusing. 
I am sry for the review but the update just destroyed it. Pls remove the Underlords."
14235,"Devs are doing such a great job supporting this game

edit: ok not anymore"
14236,<3
14237,"I feel the need to add a review here. After the latest update, with the addition of the actual Underlord characters, jails, and new heroes, the game feels different enough every day that I can see playing it regularly. 

Before this patch, the meta would be ""solved"" within a few days as people learned the best and worst combinations and alliances. Quickly the game became stale. This is no longer the case as the available heroes change daily. And the Underlord talent mechanic adds another level of depth to each game as you have some direct control for changing your strategy on the fly during the game. 

While I think the new UI is a bit of a sidegrade, I don't understand why so many of the latest reviews are not recommending based on that changes alone. The UI has been changed probably a dozen times in beta so far, and no doubt will be changed again. Hardly a reason to not recommend a beta edition...

The design direction this game is heading is definitely for the best, and after getting used to the Underlords and new mechanics, I find myself wanting to go back and play more--rather than getting bored of the stale, ""solved"" meta after a game or two.

Definitely a recommend here."
14238,Love the game.
14239,"Love the game. Originally hated 'The Big Update' but it's growing on me FAST.

Some of the new abilities / mechanics seem like complete bullshit, like 'bugs' alliance doing 5000 damage per round, globally, with no way to interrupt, while 'Bruiser' 4/4 is tied to the specific 4 bruisers, doesn't even apply on initial hit, and deals a grand total of 200 damage in a round.

I also COMPLETELY agree the new UI is shit, because the #1 thing you need to 'pay attention to' for timings is Gold, and Clock. That's it. And they've made the gold microscopic and buried the clock behind menus / talent selections.

JUST MAKE THE GOLD UI BIGGER.

All this said however, it's a fantastic game, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good semi-strategy game. I say ""semi strategy"" because without some sort of reroll-forcing, even when on near-perfect 100 HP runs, 50 income, going into lategame with a solid strat, it's not just 'possible' it's somewhat normal to reroll 100+ times looking for a single *** hero, not get it, and get stomped by an opponent doing the same strategy, but worse than you, and 'luck rolling' 2-3 or even 4 3x* heroes.

The way the bench works, with your limited slots, you're actually punished harder for getting bad luck, because if you don't roll them in the correct order to combine, you're forced to sell some of the things youre waiting for. I wish you could simply buy bench slots with gold for these situations (usually a very bad idea).


However, over time, there's continually more things to focus on and even more overlapping strategies, that the 'luck' factor falls off at high-end competitive play, allowing the 'better' player to win more and more often, which is the way it's supposed to be."
14240,oh yea *scratches arm with coke fingernail* u got any more of them.... *sniffs extremely loud and obnoxiously* undies updates mmm yea thats the stuff

14246,"Great update comes with great bug. I got the bug that the UI is gone when starting a game on both computer and smartphone, even reconnecting the game didn't help. I'll reconsider a review again when it's fixed."
14247,Fun
14248,"Good replayability, doesn't require any money, works great on Linux with Vulkan. Valve on the way back? Hope to see Artifact get this treatment. And here's an update for an Autumn Sale badge."
14249,It's the most hardcore version of 2048 I've ever played
14250,"Wait till next major UI update to play, this one is spinning my head and making me sick"
14251,Best autobattler. Devs keep adding excellent new content. Don't listen to the crybabies saying that the entire game is bad just because they don't like a UI change.
14252,more depth than the mod. on a good way
14253,"Had fun during the beta but the devs clearly weren't sure what they wanted and kept flip-flopping on balance changes and what they were planning. It seemed to be Underlords - the actual namesake - that ruined the game the most though. When Anessix came out, it just seemed pointless at that point as you had to pick her talents and almost always picked the same ones regardless of your build due to the balancing of talents and abilities.

Adding more Underlords didn't help much either. We've seen alliances and units come and go, but there just isn't much here regardless of what patch you play now. There is still only really two or three main builds you have to go for if you want to win. If there were more varied options for winning like there is in Teamfight Tactics (the League of Legends auto-battler) there would at least be more fun to be had. 

Now, this game is free and at least has some fun to be had in random matches, but do not pay for this game. There likely won't be any new content and you will likely only have fun for about 20 hours max. 

Play it if you dare. I would highly suggest just playing TFT though. Hell even Chess Rush (Tencent though, so beware the Chinese overlords) is a better option."
14254,"I recommend this shit over here. so much fun
p.s I hate myself LULW"
14255,Great game
14256,"Before I get started, devs PLEASE fix mobile, it’s impossible to play with the stuttering and crashing and pure lag. Thanks!

Fantastic game. New update brought in fantastic new changes, but some were bad. But devs have bee making Hotfixes for 3 DAYS STRAIGHT. They WILL update the UI in the next actual update.

Also to the people complaining about the “talent unlocking” for the Underlords, why? It adds progression, and some incentive to actually PLAY the game long term to get those unlocks. It doesn’t give the opposition such an unfair chance if you don’t have the same talents unlocked as them. Besides, they made it really easy to unlock, so stop with the constant complaining.

Whining and ranting isn’t the same as constructive criticism.

TL;DR- Fantastic game, but has some new problems that will get fixed soon."
14257,good
14258,"New update is a lot more fun.

My only major gripe is that the tab (scoreboard) screen doesn't work in duos, which is pretty obnoxious and makes it more difficult to play intelligently.

There are downsides to the new UI, but the previous UI also sucked, so whatever? I don't get why people are complaining so much about a *different* bad UI when the game is more fun and I think it has better longevity now."
14259,"Ignore the hate of the other recent reviews that have been for the recent big update and just download it(as it is free) and make your own decision. It's not a big game to download and it's super easy to get into.

It's a great game, it's free, it's fun and it is super chill. Valve is constantly updating the game, proactively fixing the crashes, listening to player feedback, changing the ''meta'' and all in all building onto a super cool idea that I hope ends up being more popular.

Also, they added Duos which is so great and an awesome idea that I am super happy it's added since playing it solo is fun, but Duos seems to really shine when you have a teammate (or a real life friend if you are lucky enough to have one) and can communicate and share in the horrors of defeat or the wonders of winning.

All in all, i can't recommend this game enough, especially given that it's Free and there is no P2W or Microtransactions in the game and hopefully none other than cosmetics in the future.

Keep it going Valve, don't turn this into another Artifact and keep them updates rolling <3"
14260,not much fun
14261,"Great game, new update adds a lot of diversity."
14262,Great game. Dev team is awesome and the game is in constant development. New Update is awesome!
14263,after a new patch the game became like shit
14264,"Recent patch has changed alot. Now it's a diverse autobattler with plenty of strategies and ways to win. New jail system should keep it relatively fresh and the game keeps developing. Introduction of underlords, of which there are only two in the game at the moment, helps to further modify your strats to fit your playstyle. Being an autobattler it's a partially RNG-based game with little active action by the player, so plays well on cozy lazy evenings. Whoever's not disgusted by the autobattler genre should give this thing a try."
14265,The best game I have played in my lifetime and a top-notch development team willing to take risks and try out new mechanics/ideas.
14266,Could use some work again on the UI departement after the Big Update. The game play is definitely better and more unique with two Underlords actually useable.
14267,Very balanced. The dev team works really hard to keep the game fun and balanced at the same time.
14268,nice game
14269,"I have been playing the game for two weeks now, installed based on the recommendation from a friend and the Steam reviews. I was actually looking forward to the Big Update, but when I saw the negative reviews on Steam I was thinking it's a miss....But what do you know, the bugs that some reviewers mentioned were already fixed by the devs, crashes were also fixed...and the UI...it's not that bad, it actually works even on my s****y phone with no problems...

This is a big thumbs up for the game, as I really wanted a DotA game that I can play on the go!

And a massive THUMBS UP to the Devs of the game for delivering a nice experience and a good step forward for the game!

Keep up the good work guys!!!"
14270,Love this new update!
14271,"The Underlords and the Jail do a lot to keep this game from going stale, as that would be very easy to do. Hopefully more Underlords become available soon."

14274,I am having a great time playing this game. Jail and Duos are great ideas and make the game more fun.
14275,Hands down best autochess
14276,"Not as fun as the original Dota Autochess, but still ok for what it is."
14277,Pogchamp
14278,Better than Artifact
14279,second best game ever after Artifact
14280,Duo mode made this way more fun than any of the other auto chess games I tried.
14281,good game
14282,"Fun game man, free and dota related what else could you possibly want?"
14283,"after the big update it is not fun already, it has too many detail and the interface and graphic is not familiar. I prefer the beta version."
14284,"Easy to pick up, addicting, daily meta changes!
No F2P options, pure fun!"
14285,"Not a game. Boring. Lame. Sit there and watch stuff happen. No input. Don't get this ""game"". Not even worth FREE. I feel ripped off for having spent the time downloading and trying this out."
14286,"its awesome
"
14287,"Great game, very smooth and regular updates provided. Probably the most streamlined autochess style game out there so far."
14288,Best auto-chess game by far.
14289,Best game of this new genre created by auto-chess.
14290,"the game is slowly getting worse over time
it's pretty clear the devs have no idea where to take it and the community doesn't help because it's so divided
I'm still holding out for big changes but overall I think the game is taking huge steps backwards"
14291,"The fact that the reviews have become mixed since the Big Update isn't reasonable or fair. This game has increased in strategic depth, the UI has become more intuitive (yes with some adjustment) and better at showing information concisely, and the new modes have added immense value. It's true that the new Underlords may be in need of some balancing and Underlords are currently lacking in variety. But we are still in a beta period and this update is clearly a step in the right direction for an already great game. This game takes time to master but cracking it is worth the journey."
14292,Good game
14293,Muy bueno. Tiene excelente capacidad para ser un juego muy entretenido. Le falta un poco.
14294,"It's a really fun game, the 'item' system is a lot less convoluted than both TFT (League of Legends) and Auto Chess (Epic Store).

IMO one of the issues with Underlords is that it lacks that constant change/ updates that you see in TFT. Riot nailed the update/ 'set' change frequency, ~3 months is enough time to enjoy and get bored with the meta/board. I hope Valve do something similar.

Overall it's a good game, I'm actually really intrigued to see how this genre will evolve."
14295,this game is swesome.but it has some bad thing .fix it !
14296,Rough around the edges but a fantastic autochess game with a responsive and caring group of developers.
14297,"Constantly updating, adding new features and ranked modes has turned this game into a ""one-more-time"" game. I can't put it down.

Also, who else thinks that Knockout mode is the perfect 10 minute ""sitting on the toilet, I have time"" kind of game? Can't wait for ranked Knockout mode."
14298,"After the update, the game became just awful.
I think that many will agree with me and for this I will put forward a couple of suggestions that the players might like.
- Raise the damage to all heroes so that the game is not delayed for too long, because now I play not 20 minutes, but 40.
- Pull up the graphics of the main menu
- Change the interface during the game to a more convenient
- Revise the balance of the game. Now everything is too random.
Why I like the game? Because I want to play it and wait for its development."
14299,This is a very good game.
14300,A great way to make 10mins turn into 4 hours
14301,Kunkka is back this game is good again 10/10
14302,Really fun!
14303,Last patch completely changed the game. And its fucking awesome
14304,is good game
14305,nice game and also hard
14306,"Fun, and big update is great"
14307,Good ! New update isHOTTT
14308,Sucks all your time
14309,A very fun Autochess game. Yo!
14310,Worse after every update: now you need to farm to have hero powers...
14311,So fun!!
14312,"its good to play when there is nothing to play
best game ever"
14313,this new update has made the game completely unplayable
14314,"Fast patching, interesting mechanic in jail system to keep game fresh"
14315,it's amazing!
14316,"This game literally revolves around RNG. 

RNG > Any strategy

What's the point of having coming up with any strategy if you can't roll the units in the first place. I thought duo mode can eliminate the problem since you have an ally that could send units to you. But the pool is simply too big. 

The new jail system that is supposedly built to counter this, does little to help the issue. It does help sway alliance choice if a ""KEY"" unit is being banned but does not address what it was built to do. 

Instead, you should allow players to ban a bunch of units. That will help eliminate any copies of a particular unit from your shop for the game. Or you could let player select their preferred alliance / condemn alliance so the chances of getting what you want, based on your intended strategy is more easily realized. 

Right now, it's just RNG SHIT-FEST."
14317,"First thing it does is crash, what a fucking joke."
14318,"Не играбельно после обновы. Проторчал 250+ часов, всё было идеально, но биг апдейт разрушил мою любовную связь с данной игрой. Хп бар юнита на доске по размерам как тот же юнит, дисбалансные лорды и ничего не видно, шрифт как кот на**ал."
14319,"I like new changes.

Edit: Some dont like new stuff."
14320,"( around october 2019 )
You like dice game ? that s for you ! 
-pick a strategie hope for the best or die waiting for the right hero shuffle.
-enjoy your rival random sacred relic while you got a claymore
-after a while you understand it s worthless and wanna hang by the balls

(Now)
it s decent , it goes straight to the point now no more creep waves, you pick your hero later on so you can actually see which one would fit best your line up."
14321,Looks very competitive and huge potential to come in so far
14322,"It is hands down the best Autochess game right now.

Devs are awesome and improving the game constantly.

People complaining just didnt get used to the new stuff, but its the most progress ive seen and its awesome!"
14323,"If you enjoy strategy/card games, there are a ton of elements here that you'll love. Interactive dev team, solid updates and transparent about what is happening."
14324,"You are going in the right way of making the game better and more interesting, please continue to add new and cool factions, heroes and sexy stuff!
Cheers!

edit: adding duos makes the game so much more fun! jood job.
will waiting for more underlords,"
14325,Haven't had this much fun with a game in months. The recent big update really changed things up and freshened up the meta. And I'm having an absolute blast with my friends with the new Duo mode.
14326,"Its a great mix of Dota heroes, gambling, and mixing multiple tribe and equipment strategies. The Developers have been actively balancing to make sure the metagame stays interesting. And best of all, there is now a multiplayer mode to play together with your friends."
14327,"Have been playing since beta and the big update is really good. I'm not sure why people complain about the new UX/UI, it's a real upgrade and has all the information you need to play. Things can still be improved but a lot of good things in a short amount of time. This is how game development should be !"
14328,Best autochess game out there for me. The new patch is super fun to play!
14329,"great game, keeps improving ...something something long haul"
14330,"Great strategy game and the devs are fantastic. They are continually looking to improve the game and implement community feedback frequently and quickly. The 1.0 release is fantastic and adds several additional layers of strategy and new game modes to keep the content fresh and exciting. New Underlords, heroes, and alliances in combination with the jail system should keep the game fresh, which is a great improvement over pre-beta where metas tended to get a bit stale once it was figured out (typical of a lot of games). Definitely worth trying out as it allows you to play at any level whether that's single player, casual, with friends, or competitive and there's no cost-to-entry unlike games like Hearthstone (a profit model has not been established, so everything is completely free). I would be cautious about taking to heart too many of the negative reviews about the new UI. This is very subjective and I personally love the new UI, but I can understand some complaints about certain aspects being a bit small (especially on mobile), however this is the kind of things that the Devs have a good track record of listening to frequent feedback from the community and making changes to improve quality and functionality."
14331,"Update with 2 first ""Underlords"" changed game for the better. Still a lot to work on, mostly UI wise."
14332,new drug
14333,Duo is fun =)
14334,Great Auto-battler
14335,A fantastic game that is only getting better with each patch. Th developers are extremely transparent about what they are doing and this level of communication with the community is admirable and quite rare.
14336,great game
14337,"Fun and deep strategic game with a bright future, The Big Update changed the game completely in a better way. The Duo mode is amazing and incredibly fun.
Good job devs keep up the great work."
14338,"Fun game. Specially with the new duos update, you can play with a friend and the mechanics are neat."
14339,"oh hello there, Shrek here, and i'm ticked off! People think that just because i'm an Ogre, I can't dance! Are you kidding me? I can cut a rock, bust a move, BOP!"
14340,Para quem curte um autochess e dota 2 esse game é o prato feito. Ficou muito melhor depois da recente atualizacao.
14341,
14342,.
14343,"This is the best auto chess game out there. The devs are super responsive and update the game all the time. They experiment and listen to community feedback. The game itself looks great, there are many strategies to go for, and the addition of underlords makes the game much more interesting. I highly recommend you to give it a try."
14344,"Where did the old interface go? Why is the new interface so sharp-bright, small and uncomfortable, why do I have to observe a huge low-poly Lord figure and press the mouse on the small statistics button? What's wrong with health, mana, and cooldowns? Why is the graphics so bad, where did the old convenience store go instead of this inconvenient advertising banner that has all the shades of disgusting blue? You even managed to mess up the item selection window after defeating the creeps. Return the old interface and remove the lords from the field, they only get in the way there. Do as in strategies so they can use abilities at the right time, or let the player control those abilities and the game will be much better."

14346,"broken game, since new update it's always disconnected with no reason. i have good connection but server always said there is problem with my connection."
14347,"After the 24/10/2019 update, I do not like the game anymore.
Update: uninstalled."
14348,With the new Update of the actual Underlords It gets interesting!
14349,"If you've been wanting to get into Underlords, now is the time.

With the Big Update and Full Release coming, the game has reached the stage in its development where it is feeling more like a full game than an extension of the mod it once was.

It is fun.

If you like building powerful armies with a friend it's got what you want

If you like the competitive strategy game that requires complex, on the fly thinking, you got that too.

I've played all the auto-battler genre titles and Underlords is by far the game with the most to offer to the people who play it.

Highly recommend."
14350,yo
14351,you either pick hunter or lose lol
14352,This game is just amazing and fun! the newest update changed everything for the better and I cannot recommend it more. please give it a try!
14353,"After the new update, the win is more depending on luck instead of strategy and skill. I NVR lose (at least 3rd) in 4500 ranked match since I had been playing auto chess for a long time. the new update include too many heroes in the pool and the unbalanced hero nature nearly favor the combat to the lucky side."
14354,trash.game
14355,A Different and an interesting version of dota.. Love it
14356,It is missing from my library.
14357,"Just try it, after the big update this just getting better."
14358,"If you're a fan of the auto chess or any card game. Give this game a try!
The underlords mechanic bring some cool changes to the auto chess genre.
While riot's TFT focuses more on few champs and item based builds,
Underlords focuses more synergy between champs and their power-creeps"
14359,Very fun time
14360,"hullo
"
14361,"good game , play this game if you suck at dota2"
14362,Thank you for keeping the game fresh
14363,"Interesting mechanics, fun game and it gets updated monthly!"
14364,worst game update in the world
14365,i hate chickens
14366,loved
14367,"A really polished yet unique take on the original dota 2 autochess custom game.  The Big Update changed and added mechanics that have actually been fun and refreshing.  Also, the duos mode has been a great addition!"
14368,"Great game, fun strategy. Games can run a little too long if you are doing well. As someone who games in quick bursts this can be a con.

Edit: They have added Knockout mode which has addressed the main problem I had with the games running too long. I like it a lot better as it cuts to the chase. You get the same experience of the game in 1/8 of the time."
14369,"lootbox, the game. rng dictates who wins and loses. you can be completely destroying everyone with 50+ gold and you have three heroes ready to level up on your bench, and you don't get a single one."
14370,Not better than Artifact.
14371,Duos mode pretty legit though. IDK about the champs though.
14372,"I don't enjoy the ""big"" update, interface is bad, to much things happening on the board, everything became very small and not understandable at all that's made game pretty unbalanced."
14373,"It's a fun thing to play while watching vids, or just wanting to make time pass!"
14374,Duo mode is a game-changer for the auto battler genre. Well balanced and crazy fun.
14375,Very fast and fluid.
14376,hmm...with latest 'big update'  as of 27.10.19 game lost its former charm. beauty 'was' in simplicity..
14377,game fun but i lose
14378,"Great game, has potential but needs to be balanced more. Only thing you need is luck at this point."
14379,weird
14380,this is the worst implementation of borderless windowed I have ever seen. WHY DO I HAVE TO FIGHT TO OPEN VOLUME MIXER
14381,is fun but pudge bullies me
14382,A creative approach on the AutoChess genre
14383,Really good!
14384,"Gets better with every update while caring about balance! If you're into these auto-chess games you should give this game a go, especially since its totally free! :)

EDIT: 
Gotta say I'm really surprised by the quality of these updates, new heroes and alliances coming out all the time -the best part is it's all nicely balanced :)"
14385,"uninstalled.
hard to play, too complicated, also very messy.
it's even hard to play in ipad pro, impossible in mobile phone.

They're trying to build a ""new + fancy"" game, not a fun game.
"
14386,"TLDR WTF IS THIS: An ""autobattler"" game based on a dota 2 mod called ""Auto Chess"" where you build up an army of units from random draws with shared alliances and races and battle against 7 other people doing the same thing.

We're finally at the point where Underlords is surpassing the old '""Autochess"" dota mod in every way, and their recent huuuuge update should get rid of a lot of the problems people have had with this game. 

The jail mechanic randomly locks 8 or so heroes away every day - this means the meta should never be so static that you can pick the same strong compositions every game. 

The Underlord mechanic adds a tonne of nuance in how you position it and what talents you get. Every player starts the battle with a preselected Underlord unit that fights alongside your army - There is only two to choose from so far but each has a decent variety of playstyles it supports and compliments from what I see.

The recent duo game mode addition (if you can find a friend) is an absolute tonne of fun too and will probably become my main way of playing the game. You share HP and can pass units and gold between you, this adds a huge amount of depth to the way you play and has a nice side benefit of really lowering the chances that bad RNG stops your build from ever finding those specific units you need.

I played the mod for over 100 hours and have played TFT as well and Underlords is by far the closest to a feature complete game worthy of your time investment. We've had a lull of updates recently, no doubt while the team prepared this recent massive overhaul but prior to this the updates were thick and fast. In a game like this where it can start to feel stale without changes this is super important to the longevity of the game and will let this game stand out amongst the competition."
14387,Offers a unique twist on the auto-battler/auto-chess formula. Relatively constant support means that this Dota themed game will be well conserved for a long time. A good game with the characteristic Valve flair!
14388,"I've been playing DU since early days when it came out, and love the new update. UI can do with polish but game new mechanics are a good and needed change. Well done Valve."
14389,"Entertaining to waste an hour in, but could be complex enough to waste your whole day! Depends on what you want. Decent casual experience."
14390,"I have no beef with this game's mechanics and I don't think that its imperfections can't be ironed out during development.
Valve is set on making this game a success, almost desperately so. 

But I've caught myself coming away less satisfied with my successful games then my failed runs in Spelunky. 
It's a light and comfortable slog. I imagine most Auto-Chess games are the same.
Heck, a numbing grind might even be the kind of mental medicine some people need in their lives. I'm not in that kind of place right now, so Underlords and I part ways here."
14391,.
14392,"best Card
 game better than all games auto chess and tecincal <333333333"
14393,"Great update
"
14394,New update sucks. It used to be a great game but now don't even bother.
14395,Remove this game from Steam pls
14396,Its a refreshing new game every other week with constant patches
14397,"This was a brilliant game when it was in Beta but Valve have ruined it by adding in broken mechanics and increasing the amount of RNG beyond acceptable levels. Teams that would have fared well in the beta have now been broken by the introduction of the Underlords, a mechanic that wasn't even required. It was good while it lasted but like with every Valve game they have ruined it due to too many changes."
14398,Better than TFT
14399,"There is a lot I like. However, I would prefer a faster game style, as a single match sometimes takes a bit too long."
14400,New update made the game look like TFT...
14401,"Valve is really passionate about this project and thrives to make it better and better with each update. I am not a huge fan of the Auto Battler idea myself, but I respect this project greatly and would recommend it to anyone into the genre."
14402,"I waiting for that update for long time. After few games I lost hope for this game..New characters don't blind my eyes for more s*it happen...Probably to type of this games is only way to make s*it happen! F*ck rnd and rest of it!


After new path this game is over. New fuckin monkey character, bad rnd.."
14403,"Great Game, when you're fed up of all the noobs and smurfs in dota you come here for a good time. Well atleast until you find a techies in this game and it blows up all your units 10/10"
14404,people are overreacting to the new UI. update is awesome
14405,"Полностью пропало желание играть после обновления с лордами.
"
14406,The Big Update has made what was already a fun game to chill out with into something exciting and different. Definitely worth a play.
14407,"Chessrush? Autochess? go to sleep.

Underlord? WOKE

GO PLAY THIS GAME!"
14408,"Great free game with controversial updates. The current one has some good and bad sides but the Duo mode is a blast. Finally you can cooperate with your team mate, send gold and units to build high level heroes faster. Share victory, share defeat!

The basics are simple, buy heroes from the shared pool, collect 3 same heroes to make a two-star hero (a better version), collect 3 two-star heroes (i.e. find 9 basic one-star heroes) to make a three-star hero (the best version). Put them on the board and see them battle the enemies by themselves. Pick multiple heroes from the same alliance and get bonuses of that alliance like armor improvements, higher attack speed, more damage or healing etc. Each five rounds starting from 10th you fight neutrals and get items to put on your pieces (1 item per hero at most) that improve their stats or grant them new abilities.

The sum of the survived heroes' stars is the damage you make to the enemy player, everyone starts at 100 and loses if their HP drops to zero (it only can go down). You can only put as many heroes as the level you have, you can spend your gold on heroes, rerolls and leveling up to put more heroes on the board. The opponent in each round is chosen at random.

The downsides are not yet polished UI (it was great before the update, now it's sort of overwhelming but nothing unfixable and it's already better than it was on release), a bunch of new content that's hard to digest (new heroes, alliances, Underlords with 20+ skills, updated meta so your old strats are likely to fail) so prepare to lose often, too many effects on the battlefield so it's hard to see and understand what's going on. But the core game is solid, go play it.

Works great on Linux but requires Vulkan, the older GPUs are out of luck."
14409,duos mode is like for real a blast
14410,Good casual game for the whole family.
14411,BIG BOY GAME YOU GET TO SUMMON A LOT SOMETIMES YES PLAY A LOT COME YES SUMMONER BOIS ALLIGN YOUR SUMMONS
14412,"Ok for now.
Have a great potential :)"
14413,"говно, хс лучше"
14414,First of all it is fun. With fun i mean its great to kill time while you think you can't do anything more. Also it keeps getting updated. What could u ask more ? I am playing it from the beginning. And still amazes me. I definitely recommend.
14415,very cool game
14416,Big update ruined it.
14417,amazing
14418,"My first review ever: What the fuck, this is why Valve and Steam are going down. Shit shit shit."
14419,"As it stands, the biggest problem with the Big Update is the UI makes it really hard to track what the hell is going on. It is a problem, and after playing for hours since it dropped, I still find it quite difficult to keep track of everything and the rounds ending a few seconds earlier only compounds this issue. 

This quick round ending also gives players huge advantages if their team happens to be a strong burst team. If your team fights drag on a bit longer, then while you are waiting for the stupid respawn animations to finish, your enemies get valuable seconds to bounce their units between the bench and battlefield. You will not get that time yourself when the game has no delay before the next round begins.

You also cannot turn off the highly irritating comments made by underlord characters every two seconds. Their inane, over-played comments just make it even harder to follow things.

Steer clear til it is tweaked."
14420,Just one more round
14421,duos is good
14422,"The Big Update is a huge step backward.  The graphics are bad, the UI is clunky, and the new hero is poorly implemented.  I hope the devs are bright enough to realize they have made mistakes and will roll some of these game killing changes back to the better earlier version."
14423,"I enjoy the game, it is fun, the developers are very active and updates this game very frequently. You can also play this game on your phone! (do you guys not have phone?). So, just try the game, it is free."
14424,A pretty good Auto Chess game. The Underlords mechanic is interesting and the items are less RNG.
14425,"I like the game but after the big update I can not recommend it. Before it, the game felt a little bit like a real chess but in much cooler way. Here is a board, figures and your opponent - make the most of it. This made me feel like The Underlord. However, now they introduced the underlords - heroes with skills. My guess, you will be able to level up them, buy new underlords and the game will be more about them than the figures on the board. Finally, they will probably introduce a moetization system to get those underlors. 
Probably my taste for games is just different of what valve is doing with Dota Underlords."
14426,Devs keep impressing me; this new update added so much depth and variety. Hope this ingenuity keeps going.
14427,It's a pretty interesting game but my god does it get frustrating quickly
14428,"best autochess game in market with constand updates like dota, changing the meta and keeping it fresh."
14429,it's fine for a mobile game
14430,"If you're a nerd you're probably gonna like this, the UI took a dive with the big update but everything else is pretty cool so far."
14431,"I'm loving this new update, got me back into the game. Looking forward to future updates"
14432,June 21 - October 24 - R.I.P.
14433,Very good game!!
14434,"The ""Big Update"" is fantastic.   I agree with some of the UI complaints but they'll work through those.  The new new update is really really fun!   Well done!"
14435,"This version of Dota Auto Chess have not captured what was actually fun about it.
And they remove option to chat? wth?"
14436,"The worst uptade ever, terrible interface, ability to place a champion on the board after a round and buy new one is broken, terrible new animations, terrible placing mechanics with locking on every square, never seen worse interface, my eyes are bleeding! Volvo killed another game, lol, that was pretty fast xD"
14437,Unplayable buggy mess after the latest patch.
14438,"The game is still great, even after The Big Update. People always have problems with change.
On top of that, the game is still in beta, and clearly so. Don't play if you're looking for a perfect game!
The devs are EXTREMELY responsive to feedback, and all major problems with the game are fixed. Their track record is great.
The most painful part of all the negative reviews is the devs are being skewered over temporary problems that are fixed within a day or two, but the reviewers will likely never go back and update their review.

Don't take the influx of negative reviews too seriously, is my point.

If you like the Auto Chess genre, this is the best one. If you like TCGs, you'll like this. If you like strategy games, you'll find something you like in this game."
14439,Im simple man. I like Duos. I thump up.
14440,"Great game, the new update just made it even more enjoyable to play!

The underlords are a great addition, gives you a reason to grind without getting too OP from grinding"
14441,Amazing
14442,"Great auto-battler, Gets much love from valve - New big update just rolled out.
No P2W.
Visuals are dota 2 like, Which are great imo.
As you learn the game you understand how to control the RNG to your favor, How to place the units right, Which items to choose, And now even a JAIL system, All of these reward skill.
If you like a game where you are less measured by APM but more by strategy and efficiency then this is for you."
14443,"An innovation in the making, great game in general. Having both PC and mobile is cool too. Yo!"
14444,Better than TFT
14445,boring game
14446,Nice mechanics. Kinda confusing at first.
14447,new update is bullshit
14448,"good but not to good XD
"
14449,chill
14450,"Best auto-battler? At least it gets often updates, fixes and balance patches. Works on Mobile phone and Linux. What else you gonna ask?"
14451,gud game i like the lil dudes fightin
14452,"I think this game is evolving and seeing that it has no way of earning money in-game, we can only support the devs and give constructive feedback.
I really don't like the way it is treated lately, and I believe that it deserves more. 
Even just for the sake of Ricky Ravenhook!"
14453,"Dota Underlords is about picking units, finding combinations and saying ""Yo"" to your opponents. The userinterface and the ability to battle bots make learning and adopting the format easy."
14454,"The Big Update is everything I wanted for this game. Good job Valve, keep doing what you do."
14455,sogood
14456,"I wish this game had a better tutorial and way to introduce the game to newbies, especially people who haven't played DotA 2. I know people who don't play DotA and learned how to play this game, but I still think they need a better introduction system for small brains like mine."
14457,"Great new update, dont listen the crybabies here who doesnt like anything new."
14458,This Big Update make this game so far. It's nice to follow and play it.
14459,goog
14460,Great game
14461,lul
14462,"The game is first and foremost a lot of fun. The game is still in testing and the devs have involved the community at every stage, they act on feedback, are timely with updates and appreciate that although the game can get better still, that it is through working with players that this will happen. The genre itself is pretty new, so testing the water with ideas and play modes is the right way to go. I have heard negative comments about the UI, but that is easy to fix, as long as the underlying logic is sound and the mechanics are going in the right direction, which in my humble opinion, they most certainly are. If you are unsure about trying Underlords, give it a blast, it is well worth it."
14463,gg
14464,Good and Fun Game
14465,it's fun
14466,like but this update is a little messy
14467,really nice game
14468,"It was ok before the last update, now it`s too bad.. uninstalled"
14469,better auto chess <3
14470,It's very fun.
14471,"Love this game, especially after the big update, it added another layer of complexity to an already awesome game :)"
14472,Unable to enter multiplayer game after update
14473,Довольно неплохой убийца времени.
14474,Became uplayable after the patch. Uninstalled.
14475,"The new Patch made the graphic's messy and the new ""Hero"" system is boring. i appreciate innovating but this feels unpolished."
14476,P GUD
14477,Love it. Best Auto Chess!
14478,"The game that killed my faith in Valve as a developer.

They had the keys to the kingdom of autochess and got surpassed and undercut by fucking RIOT GAMES of all people.
Underlords is a barebones experience that is only worse than the mod in almost every way possible, updates are slow and infrequent and rarely do anything but change the meta to a new ""best class"".

Bare minimum customization, no player character, trash progression and little game diversity. Grating and awful music, and a TRASH USER INTERFACE that has ONLY gotten worse as time has gone on.

Very little comeback mechanics as opposed to the game's competitors. Very little ANYTHING to offer even if I did enjoy it at one point, it faded very fast as the lack of updates mean the game gets stale extremely quickly.

I genuinely think Valve is dead as a game developer and should stick to steam, but they're getting blasted in that market too so maybe they should just go with the wind and die already."
14479,ye
14480,Well I loved this game. Till this patch. Devs want to have a LOL - cartoon look and the game now looks like a mess with fighting healthbars. You just cannot identify who is doing what. I played Dota cause it is not LOL and now you are getting closer and closer to it.
14481,bde
14482,"beauty in simplicity. after ""big update"" the game lost its former charm."
14483,"This is my favorite of the AutoChess genre, mostly due to the item system (guaranteed and flexible vs. TFT and DAC's random and fixed/stacked) and the Underlord and Jail mechanic. I also have a strong history with Dota, so the flavor of the heroes is pretty spot on for me."
14484,"This game used to be great. It worked well on iOS with rough but manageable battery use. For some unknown reason, they paid a 6 year old to design a ui that is not only extremely cluttered and disfunctional, it's completely unplayable. I only play on IPad, and I have many hours of enjoyment till yesterday when I uninstalled. Will not play until the UX is un-fucked back to a state of usability."
14485,"Love the game, I've been playing for a few months now. The addition to Underlords, new heros, & new alliances this week has been over all positive. 

Only request i have since ""the big patch"". Can Hobgen algorithm for choosing a overpower target be updated? seams each time he casts it on a hero, that hero is either CC'd by chicken, or on less than 10% life. This always just seems like a bust for overpower on that round."
14486,"The prison makes some alliances unplayable so that people all rushing for what are left, makes life so much difficult."
14487,game good
14488,"Fun game, fast update schedule. Will be interesting to see how they monetize it, but right now it's free and an easy rec."
14489,"I play this on mobile and PC.  Its a great game for when youre actually ready to relax and just settle into a little contest.  It's not hyper demanding physically or emotionally.  Overall, its a great side game, even though I do go binges at times."
14490,"It's clear that the devs care a lot more about this game and the community than most devs do.
EDIT: they stopped caring ):"
14491,"The best Autochess I've ever played. The devs are super active, releasing new content and updates all the time. This game has a bright future!"
14492,"It was a great game, maybe there where some minor issues, but after this update everything is worst, everything!
I want underlords beta back!"
14493,amazing
14494,Always changing game that listens to its players
14495,summary of big update : put a hot pile of garbage in a blender and turn it on
14496,The big update has made this game more than just autochess. 100% worth checking out.
14497,"A simplified ""To-do"" list of an average Dota:Underlords reviewer:

- Get over 200 Hours of entertainment FOR FREE.
- Leave a negative review.
___________________________________________________________

Please don't listen to these reviewers, not without a HUGE pinch of salt (and boy there is a lot of it). 
They're either salty because they can't figure out a pretty simple game of chance (MUH STRATAGI VS RNG, RNG BAD!!!111), or borderline oligophrenic with no concept of price\value relation of a product.

This game is clearly crafted with love, and it's obvious to everyone capable of controlling their primal nerd rage - the graphics are slick, the animations are well suited for each hero and help you bond with their personalities, the voice acting is superb (bruh, have you heard the Queen of Pain?) and even the soundtrack (something that I literally almost always never care for) is great. The patch notes are humorous and you can literally feel the dwv team's warmth, pride and love for this product seeping through the lines, and the patches themselves are rather frequent and substantial.

The game is easy to learn but hard to master. If you are planning to play ranked and sweat, you better educate yourself on many intricate mechanics that may not be obvious to an average Homo Erectus, who instead of trying to learn a thing or two about this game are busy tanking this game's reviews to Mixed just because tHe nEw UI iS BaD. Guys, it's been out for one day. Every piece of relevant info is either outright displayed on your main screen, or is accessible within two clicks. The UI is better than ever. It may not be equally appealing to everyone from aesthetic point of view, but screeching how it's literally unusable and that game is unplayable is just childish reaction of accomodation to new circumstances. Grow the F up.

If you're happy to play casual and chill - just download it already. In my humble opinion, this currently is THE best autobattler on the market, and it only gets better.

If you have some questions regarding game's mechanics or sources of relevant info about them,  feel free to add me."
14498,si
14499,"they just fucked it up with the last update why the fuck that hero thing for man
Edit: dead game"
14500,Ignore the boomers who can't see properly and think the UI looks bad.
14501,"Recent visual changes to the game make it impossible to tell what is actually happening. Useful images like ability descriptions and hero alliances have become dull and gray. Important text based information (like how much damage you did or home much gold you have) has been reduced to a pin-head sized font while giant useless portraits cover large portions of the screen. The negative effect of these changes is compounded when playing on mobile screens. I can only assume these change are paving the way for some kind of microtransaction cosmetics. 

The old visual style of the game relaxing, vibrant, and well liked by the playerbase. I cant think of any other reason for them to have gotten rid of it."
14502,"Fun game, I enjoy playing it, current UI needs work, otherwise solid auto battler"
14503,"Incredible complexity, UI could have some work, but everything else is very good, balance, mechanics(very deep ones), items.
Ui is the only thing that makes this game a little bit noob unfriendly"
14504,"Fun version of auto chess, it has some actual new mechanics too."
14505,"From the makers of shitty card games........Volvo!!!

The game needed little tweaks to be balanced. They took someone else's game and turned it into a big pile of shit. 

Let's add a hero, he is mostly useless and annoying, but hErOoOoO. 

Troll is op. What can we do to balance it? Make leveling up insanely expensive, make Troll gold, to make drop rate inexistant, and be sure that the class is completely dead. It's cool, the usual nuthuggers who will eat any pile of shit will call it cake because ""iT's JuSt MeTa, GuYs. GiTgUd, me hardcooooore"".

Achievements and ranks bring me back to really shitty browser games. You killed 5983 of whogivesafuck unit, now you have xp to....something."
14506,Playable
14507,This game is good.
14508,"Super excited with this game, I love playing it when I'm taking a snack or having dinner. 

The Underlords mechanic is very exciting and I'm looking forward to have a good number of them to play around with different strats. There are so many heroes from Dota that have not been ported yet, when everything is finished I'm sure this game is going to be (more) bonkers.

There's stuff that needs some tweaking here and there, just like the new UI (there's just too much info in the screen) and the ""problem"" of making the games shorter (they're a tad too long). But the devs are super active and they are already adressing all of this issues.

Visually the game is looking great, it needs more polish here and there but the game is still in beta.

All in all, give it a try. It's free!"
14509,"People crying about the UI. Game is great, play it."
14510,cant launch the game since the last update. there are a lot of people who are facing this problem. please fix it asap. using a macbook btw.
14511,бля да нормальные шашки че доебались
14512,"Take a good game and ruin it, thanks valve... idiots"
14513,"I had high hopes for Underlords patch, had hoped for new alliances and heroes and all good stuff that comes with it. Instead, I get a slot machine tier design user interface game with animated Joker face that takes 30% of screen space, the board is now hidden behind the battle of green vs red bars, alliance and item icons are tiny. The overall impression is that they overengineer this update and developers do not play the game that they develop. VOLVO is trash tier company, that can only steal ideas but cannot create, only lives from % from games sold at Steam. Blizzard and Epic Games are a better company than Valve."
14514,Same crap as every other auto chess fail.
14515,"Nice take on Autobattlers.

Alot of new content!"
14516,Really polished and fun free game.
14517,Таки за бесплатно почему бы и нет
14518,i have no idea what they have done to the game but i cant even put the units without clicking over them 7 times
14519,amazin
14520,"I was absolutely upset of the latest update of DULords. If i haven`t been playing it from the beginning i wouldn`t do it at all. I understood UI because I`ve played the game earlier, it took time to use to it! quite a time. And regarding game itself i also had the feeling like what`s going on? it`s like useless to build any strategy it looks like its a fortune. I don`t want to spend my time on that anymore. Test better before you`re doing such an update."
14521,Good update
14522,norm
14523,It's the best game to play while watching/listening to something else.
14524,Yes. Despite complaints about the newest update I still thinks its fun.
14525,Very original
14526,best of all autochess game.
14527,"After this last big update it just look really bad. GUI is all messed up, live models of underlords are awful and info about the units on board is really hard to see. I wish everything could rollback to the time before this big patch."
14528,"A really nice approach to F@#* a game up, every new hero is a great adding to the game, even the ONLY TWO underlords (of wich one is REALLY good and the other is meh) gives a new ways to creat a strategie. But oh mama, how does one can make a mistake so huge as of making such a terrible UI, god that is bad! Its really hard to keep track of things, so colorfull that hurts my eyes, really hard to keep track of your enemies and there is so much going on the board that you can only figure out whats happening when you're either about to lose or win because there are fewer pieces alive. 

Don't even try to understand whats going on the duos, that is pure chaos.

I would say to turn the HP's back to original, Go back to the ugly a@$ old UI and either put more underlords or wait to have more and put them all together into this game"
14529,"Initial complaints when the big update launched was the UI: this is too small, that takes up too much of the screen. Over time, people got used to it. I was mildy turned off by the mobile version UI since things got really scrunched up, but event that was fixed over time. The game has gotten much better and more intricate in the gameplay, adding the first 2 Underlords as well as the jail system. Although random, the locked units over a 24 hour period makes team building more on-the-fly as opposed to mashing the same units/alliances together without restriction, so the every day meta changes a little. And duos is way fun if you have voice communication with a buddy."
14530,Addictive. I play it once in a while.
14531,"Okay, I know everyone is not taking nicely to the update. You've got to realize we have played hundreds of games before the update. The old UI was so comfortable and familiar but I'm not buying into the new UI being bad. Give it a week at least, the devs have been really good at taking feedback and making the correct changes. GIVE IT A CHANCE. This game can be a very casuall relaxing experience or you can sink into probability, build optimization, or counter play. Underlords is the same game at its core, and it is still the best auto battler on the market. I know change is hard but its worth it for progression."
14532,"It was a very simple and fun game to play and relax, after the update i played 1 game and i feel tired. I don't understand what the developers are smoking but they should quit it ASAP. What a clusterf@#k of a UI..."
14533,new update looks clean
14534,"Out of all the auto-chess games, this one blows the rest out of the water. The game has depth and is satisfying to play. Developers are constantly putting work into this game and updates are frequent. Looking foward to when the game is out of beta!"
14535,"This game is great - the effort from the devs is impressive and its accessible from mobile devices as well , imho its a perfect fit for a tablet device and i am really hoping for a Switch release as well!

My point in a nutshell is that if you are thinking about getting into auto-battlers i think there is not better implementation than UL and you should really give this game a shot.

Much appreciation for the devs :)"
14536,"We don't have enough time between each round to play quietly. Forced to fully play a little game of relaxation ... It's a shame.

Battle mode in Heartstone understands this and gives players plenty of time to think or just scratch their noses.

In addition, the ""Lords"" bring a very unwelcome complexity. The bonuses of the different families are already very numerous, so if we must also remember those of the ""Lords"" ...

The result is a game ... tiring.

So if you want to relax in front of an auto-chess, avoid this one. Or plan your builds in advance to be able to play without thinking since you don't have time to do it ...

PS: Another game ""relaxation"" that the developers try to ""energize"", but suddenly, they lose sight of the essence of the game. That's what wanting to please the Fortnite generation ..."
14537,"Great game of it's genre. Latest update (The Big Update) bring many great features including jail that should solve stale meta states entirely. A lot of positive changes and game is moving in the right direction. Devs are also awesome, fixing a lot of issues almost instantly and they are really listen to the community."
14538,Still in Early Access but looks very promising so far!
14539,"Ignore the surge of BabyRage negative reviews. This game is amazing. It's going through some major changes, but still amazing."
14540,Highly enjoyable.
14541,Such a pleasure to play a Volvo game without 4 animals in your team
14542,"Easy to learn, really fun"
14543,dis good game
14544,Overall great game!
14545,Volvo delivering again.
14546,"Ignore all the whiny babies giving bad reviews. The UI is fine, and it'll get better because the devs have been giving constant updates since the game came out. A great game that's fun casually and competitively."
14547,"The city of Gotham, but without Batman."
14548,"Update 2021-04:26 (Negative) : In the last 6 months there hasn't been a single update to the game. It seems to have been completely abandoned by the developers and the game is really stale these days with the same meta-builds every game.

Original review (Positive) :
Very fun and addicting, the new update is a bit rough, but it'll even out in the coming days/week and be awesome again. Just hang in there!"
14549,Great take on the autobattler genre with really amazing devs who constantly experiment and tweak the game with bold new concepts!
14550,"Like my pajamas, it keeps growing and growing each day."
14551,"Tried once, got addicted.
Totally recommend it!"
14552,is fun
14553,"Seems like a more complete game since the update. 

Mucho gusto."
14554,Excellent game in the world of Dota. The Big Update is going in the right direction for sure.
14555,"It was good before and it's perfect now, idk how you can improve the game more !!"
14556,A quality game that anybody with interest should at least try.
14557,Fun
14558,Pretty good
14559,gud
14560,"Despite what all the negative reviews say, the game is really good. The UI needs a tiny bit of polishing, but I don't think it's that bad. If you like autobattlers then this is one of the better ones."
14561,Great effort by Valve
14562,"to much bugs in the news update, the bugs is not only for PC but for mobile phone too"
14563,"Recommended because it's free, and looks/plays smoothly. Auto-battlers aren't not my kind of game- not enough control, but maybe they're yours, and since it's free, why not try it?"
14564,Great game
14565,"Was a good game once, but valve abandoned it."
14566,"A little slow to get into if you haven't play dota, but good fun when you get used to everything. Prob not gonna be the game you spend all day every day playing, but it's nice to play a cheeky game now and then."
14567,"Recent UI Update makes my head dizzy playing on iPhone. i used to like the old simple UI. the recent updates had a lot changes and new underlord stuff. 

maybe too many stuff going on is just not my stuff i think."
14568,"This new big update with Underlords is totally unplayable crap. 
Dota autochess is much better than this."
14569,"Incredible Developers, super quick with changes and big improvements. The newest update made it a whole new game, lots of fun and greatly recommended!"
14570,Super Fun. Especially after the big update.
14571,10 / 10
14572,"Love the patch. A lot of new concepts that really work well, and with a few balance patches will offer a much larger number of viable play styles. Duo's and the Jail are amazing ideas that add a lot of variety to the game. The complexity of duos and the amount of min-maxing that can be done will make for great tournament play

The new UI is MUCH better on PC. The only thing I don't like about the UI is how huge the Underlord is, and how he can't be disabled.

The only negative is the particle changes and health bars. There are so many flashy particle effects you can't tell what's happening in the fights, and the HUGE healthbars make visibility every worse."
14573,"Game's great. New update is fantastic, and now this game is distinguished from the rest of the genre in a terrific way."
14574,Absolutely love the game and appreciate all the new changes and updates with the new humongous patch. Crazy that this is free to play... one of my favorite games of the past few years. Still trying to get used to the changes but I find it great.
14575,Fun gameplay. Frequent updates. Awesome devs. Try it out!
14576,"I love this game! I've played a bit of the new update so far, and I really like it! One thing I don't like is the graphics feel more like League of Legends. And I hate League of Legends."
14577,"Really enjoying the Big Update. The new heroes and play styles bring fresh content to the game. Overall I enjoy the new UI, but there are a few things that can be improved. It is still in beta and the developers are very active in the community."
14578,Fun and addicting gameplay. Many great combinations and strategys.
14579,"A great game. Well worth the money.

Lots of fun to be had. 

Not a huge skill curve, but subtle skill needed in important moments, that add up over time."
14580,its great
14581,"Best take on the Autochess genre, development has been great so far."
14582,"nice patch for pc version, like the variance a lot"
14583,This is a great game.
14584,Good core gameplay. Gets better with every update but there are hiccups along the way.
14585,"Amazing dev team, great game"
14586,"Awesome update, interesting new heroes and alliencies, fun and engaging gameplay, thx valve!"
14587,"While the mobile UI could use some work, the big update really improved the game. Definitely recommend."
14588,gud gajm
14589,"Game is complex, nuanced and interesting. Crazy amount of new content in the newest patch. Looking forward to more. People complaining about the UI have a valid opinion, but I don't get the review tanking"
14590,Its good
14591,"
YOLOOOOOOOOO"
14592,"I'm changing my review since there hasn't been an update recently and the ""META"" has become predictable and stale. I think this is a problem with the parent company jumping ship on products that are no longer profitable, go figure."
14593,"Big update, big fun!"
14594,good update
14595,"Best autochess after the big update

toxic/10"
14596,dis gud game
14597,Very good adaption from the original AutoChess. Really good updates and fast development.
14598,"I love this game, the devs are very open for feedback!"
14599,best auto chess game
14600,"People are pretty upset about the new UI, it seems. But it shows you ALL of the information now without needing to switch between tabs. Also, the impact on the actual gameplay is minimal. The new update is great, but reintroduces a learning curve. Lots of new heroes, the new Underlords and their talents/abilities, and new alliances to learn. It is a great boost to a game that was getting a little repetitive and stale. Looking forward to spending many more hours in it!"
14601,"I had recommended this game but I would have liked that that valve fix their ui for small screens and do some competent ui checks before release.

Unfortunately I had to change my review.  A disconnect in the final round while trying to place an item after a 35 min+ game is unacceptable."
14602,ppl are riled up for nothin. the game is the best out there. 8/10
14603,Don't let them fool you: the game gets better and better!
14604,"Pretty good, one of the best autochess"
14605,new underlords hobgen and anessix ruined this game for me
14606,Good game.
14607,ye it's fun I guess
14608,"Early access is fun!
- Survived Arc Warden meta. ✓
- Survived Venomancer meta. ✓
- Survived Lycan meta. ✓
- Survived Blood-Bound meta. ✓
- Surviving Warlock/Healer meta (loading...)
"
14609,"It was a nice minimalistic UI, while it lasted... 😢
Game too obnoxious for me now, but worth a try."
14610,cool causal game
14611,Yeah
14612,"So far so good, just about to try out the big update."
14613,"This game is a lot of fun. I really enjoy the new UX upgrade in the ""Big Update"" as well."
14614,"I'm really liking the direction the game is going in, it's definitely a beta, though it's updating constantly, the gameplay is getting better, good design, [UI could use some work]. 

"
14615,"Very nice addictive game, the update is amazing even though it takes a while to adapt to the new UI"
14616,"Very fun, very addictive, literally free in every way. You don't have to spend a cent on this, and it's fantastic."
14617,"New UI and animation sucks. Old one is much better. The new animation seems ""cartoonish"" compared to the old one."
14618,"While there is a lot of RNG still in the game, it's a decent enough time killer.  

The Jail mechanic makes it unlikely a true meta can exist for more than a day although it's still possible that strong builds with easy substitutions will become a thing.  The Underlords have also added quite a bit of variety and flexibility in the builds, and as more get added, the game should continue to improve."
14619,"Genre of the year 2019, weekly updates with excellent community communication, mobile first. Love it!"
14620,"Update for underlords is the worst.
The beta promised simple mechanics with good creativity. 
Both underlords have too much skills and life, leaving very little to strategy.

The game was fast paced and fun in the beta, now it is slower than actual dota.
Game is now broken with too many powerups and OPed main characters. Not fun anymore. Leaving this comitee"
14621,"ded free game, no bitchin

EDIT: Yup, dead and getting crashes. WP Volvo"
14622,Developers are trying their best
14623,"With the new update this game that was already really good has been magnified and it's free so just get on board, it's not very difficult to understand either!"
14624,"The Big Update is adds so much complexity, fun and visual interest to the game.  I didn’t have any expectations for duos, but it’s actually hilarious and awesome.  Get this game!"
14625,The Big Update made the game borderline unplayable on mobile for me. I cannot see the units beneath enormous health bars. How am I to learn the new units/alliances/underlords if I cannot see what's going on?! The most important value (my gold) is so tiny its hard to read. The majority of icons require too much precision to press.
14626,Great game to play with friends or solo.  Chill when paused and intense when not!
14627,This game has been ruined.
14628,"How do you fck up whole game in 1 update? Takes real talent... 

Underlords addition feels forced and unnecessary, and slows the game pace down. 

Dont even make me start on UI and graphics update..."
14629,"Unlike Artifact, this game actually has devs that care about it and they're posting updates regularly. This game has a future. Quite fun."
14630,"This game has been a huge amount of fun for me.  The type of game may not be for everyone but it deserves better than a Mixed review score.  What it does, it does well.  

With the recent update we are seeing more and more what this game will be like at it's full release and I'm really excited!"
14631,8.5/10. It's ok. Need a story mode to be a 9/10.
14632,BEST CHESS GAME EVER
14633,"Big Update:

Pros:
- more variety
- the concept behind the jail system is neat
- Underlords (yes, I like them - apart from that talent unlocking)

Cons:
- UI: I know it is subjective, but man... it went from not great to horrendous
- Visual Effects: should help players to intuitively understand what is going on, currently does the complete opposite. I mean, i suppose you could get somewhat used to it by learing what to ignore from that clutter, but I doubt new players would want to do that
- Underlord talent unlocking: this is my biggest problem with the update and the reason I won't recommend it: What I liked about the game was that you were able to play 1-2 games after work with a level playing field. Everyone had the same chance to win. This ""feature"" basically takes a huge dump on that premise."
14634,"dont fight the RNG, be one with it and you'll succeed."
14635,"Played them all, still my number one auto battler"
14636,"Good game. A recent update came out that made the UI messy, but steps to take to fix it: 

-Turn off High Quality Dashboard 
-Lower your settings.

Great game overall. The negative reviews are just feedback that ended up in the review section."
14637,Fuuuuuuuuuun
14638,gud
14639,Best Auto Battler
14640,Absolutely one my favorite games in the library can easily can  spend several hours playing this game
14641,A fun little game.
14642,"The big patch just dropped and I think it's great. A lot of people are (massively) overreacting to the new UI. Personally I prefer being able to see the damage chart, alliances, and items all at the same time. Even if you don't like it though, I'm not convinced a bad review is warranted. 

Other than that though, love the new jail system that provides a regular rotation and should help prevent the meta from getting stale, love the new underlords, and am very excited about the opportunity to play duos with my brother. Overall the game is a fun and chill; I'm a big fan."
14643,YO!
14644,This game is great
14645,Suck for few people cant accept some changes for the new UI.
14646,Freaking hate the UI after the patch they should have just retained the old UI and added all the new heroes and all.
14647,dota 2 is going down because of roles get it back old one solo mmr and party mmr no one care's about roles and que 10min+ fix that shit
14648,"Best auto chess game there is. Dont even bother with the rest, I've tried them and always come back to Underlords. Now with the new update, the best auto chess game just got even better. Screw the haters."
14649,"Its free and Tusk does PUNCH!!! 

"
14650,"Very good auto battler. There are many hero combinations and alliances which enable various strategies. The Jail mechanic (~10 daily banned heroes) makes the experience fresh every day so there is no ""The Meta"". Underlords - the leaders of your army are a nice build around mechanic and add more decision making to the standard auto battler game. They could use a bit of balance changes and more variety (for now there are only 2 to choose from) but it's a good start. UI is mostly functional, there is a lot of information presented in a good way but some places need to be improved in terms of clarity like hero skills and hero statistics. It also could be made to better fit the style of rest of the game. Better in-game and post-game statistics window would be nice. Besides solo/party unranked/ranked PvE and PvP modes there is a Duo mode where you share health total and can send gold and heroes to your partner. It is really fun to play with a friend."
14651,"The ""Big Update"" has brought a  much needed refresh to Dota Underlords.

The new UI, Jail System, and Underlords added much needed variety outside of updates. It feels like a totally different game, and I'm excited to see where they take it in the future."
14652,"Don't take the negative reviews seriously. The game received a major update which drastically changed a lot of stuff for the better. Those bad reviews are mainly a bunch of faggots complaining that the ui changed, it literally takes one or two games to get used to the new ui, but people like to complain for the sake of complaining.

Other updates the game received: 
-Jail system that takes some random heroes from the pool each day: Not only this solves the issue of adding new heroes, but also creates a lot more variance in the game, meaning you have to be more versatile with your builds and not just copy paste the same builds and repeat them every game.

-Underlords: New special units that also add more variety to to the game, currently you can choose only two, but I'm sure more will be added in the future. Even if two players pick the same underlord, there is still variety as you can build yours completely different via talents (every 5 levels you pick one out of four talents for your underlords).

-More alliances and heroes: More combos, synergies etc. Self explanatory.

Give this game a try and don't be fooled by the bad reviews, enjoy!"
14653,gud
14654,Fantastic game that is surprisingly deep in strategy.
14655,"Fun to play solo against challenging bots. Plus useful ""pause"" function when stuck on a particularly difficult decision or called away to wipe a child's nose."
14656,Best auto chess ATM
14657,"Game's definitely improving almost on a weekly basis thanks to the community feedback and open minded devs, the latest update made the game feel more up to par with what the player base needed but didn't know they did.

A lot changed since i've written what's above but the game's still the best one in the auto-chess category, due to its unique improvements and smooth gameplay."
14658,pretty decent auto chess game. Plus points for a mobile port that syncs to same account!
14659,I highly recommend. 10/10 for creativity and something new to play.
14660,truly captures the dota experience of enjoying 10% of the games enough to make up for hating every decision in my life that led me to this game the other 90%
14661,"Dota Auto Chess was never a mod that I cared about much, far too much uncontrollable RNG for my liking. When underlords came out I gave it a try, it seemed like it could be fun but was sadly just reskinned auto chess. The latest update was an abomination though. Where are the dota devs to tell these people not to do the terrible things they have done to the game? 1st, lore is completely a mess in underlords, it doesn't work with dota and artifact lore at all. 2nd, the new UI is kinda garbage (although I trust they will fix that). 3rd and most importantly, there are now GAME CHANGING talents that are unlocked outside gameplay. I tried to play a couple of matches on the new patch and every time it just felt like my opponents underlord was just stronger, making my entire team comp completely useless. Not only does this need balance, the talent unlock needs to be removed entirely. Sorry valve, you produced a shit mobile game."
14662,very cool
14663,Play dota? Play underlord!
14664,"It is strategic and has a solid premise that it builds its design on. The updates are frequent and the developers are really communicating. I generally like more mechanically intense games(like timing, aiming and what not) but this game is fun regardless"
14665,Is nice.
14666,"A good start to what will soon be an epic game. The recent patches are really leading the game in the right direction. It started from mostly an idea or thought but it wasn't rounded out before. They were smart to take their time though and improve at a good speed. I do hope that they add more Underlords quickly though since there are only two at the moment but it's kind of smart to start here, as long as they do not take DotA's approach of one hero/underlord a year on average... time will tell. The ball's in your court Gaben.  - side note: Make DotA Tactics!!! Just like the game Magic the Gathering: Tactics - A DotA version mixed with Artifact and a truly competitive ranked system with card trading would be the best thing I ever played and will play for a long time."
14667,worst game in steam ever
14668,it gets better
14669,epik stupid copy paste from imbeciles who dont know how to fix his own stuff :-D háháháháháháháhá imbeciles from valve
14670,"this is an amazing valve game the gameplay is very unique too! especially after the new underlord update.
the game has nice graphics too"
14671,Great game with a mixture of hearthstone and chess
14672,"Great UI redesign in new patch. 
Low FPS on MacBookPro and iPhone after ""bigger update"".
Super useful(no) LORDS - they looks like anime characters for 10years kids.


"
14673,Get fun and free. What more do you want.
14674,"Great game despite still being in early access. Can feel a bit RNG-heavy at times, but adapting to RNG and other players' choices is part of the game. Active developers that listens to community feedback, keeps the game fresh, and aren't afraid to try new things."
14675,Free game gg
14676,"New update is great, Underlords are finally underway and although UI leves a bit to be desired, devs are very responsive and quick and have provided frequent updates on a weekly basis, thus I know that UI will get optimised. Try Underlords as it is by far the best autochess game."
14677,Lets not rush negative opinions about the game's UI and mechanics after 1 day since big update. The Game is more versatile now and I'm sure they'll fix current problems and make Ui more readable.
14678,"I was in love with the game and it's mechanics so far until the latest update. With the brand new Underlord update they have ruined the UI. Literally ruined. Half of my screen is the face of Underlord. Like why?! 

Such important informations like my gold, tour info and other players' HP/Gold data are minimized and they are not very visible. Which I believe they were more important than seeing Underlord's face.

I hope they will be able to fix their broken UI and we will keep enjoying their game.

I recommend the game but not the update so till they fix their broken UI I will not be recommending the game."
14679,"no, not anymore"
14680,"It's a cool game, that can be played on mobile and has a lot you can learn to improve."
14681,"Very addictive and fun to play, love the Big update!!!"
14682,Recent updates arnt as bad as the negative review burst makes out. Good autochesser
14683,It's very nice
14684,"Best take on auto chess games!

Recent UI change took some time to getting use to, but overall I like it. During round, new UI is better but then the menus themselves I think went sideways. So my opinion regarding that is mixed. But change was needed, one before current one was way worse, so don't know why people speak against this overhaul!

I haven't tried the duo mode yet, but it sounds fun and worth trying.

Overall Dota Underlords is
... relaxing game to play
... fun to combine alliances and find new things
... pleasing to watch, graphics are nice
... somewhat slim with the number of heroes
... struggling to balance, certain heroes seem to be auto-include"
14685,Great game
14686,"Sure, the UI could receive a few tweaks but that's why this is beta and EARLY ACCESS: to figure these things out.

The Big Update is quite good and it will take a few days for people to get used to everything (new). 


To be completely honest, this feels like a different game from before. This is neither good or bad, it just is. Personally, I like it. More diversity, more strategies and most importantly, as far as we can tell so far: no stale meta."
14687,"Great game. Valve should make more platform games!
"
14688,A Good Game to Pass Time. Played the Mobile version which was cool. The game is good enough for me to play it on my daily basis. Loved it! Good Job
14689,"nice game, very funny even if you don't know DOTA 2 is fine, just play a couple games with bots and you are good to go"
14690,Very fun
14691,Great Game TFT bad Underlords gud
14692,"Actually good game now that ""The Big Update"" came out. Feels like a complete game."
14693,"after the update the game got way better would highly recommend it now
"
14694,Just writing a review because I feel all the negative reviews are way too much. Let's appreciate this great game more.
14695,Great game. Meta continually changing to keep it fresh.
14696,Game is going in the right direction
14697,The UI updates needs a lot of work but overall brought a lot of great things!
14698,Pretty good Gaben
14699,It's RNG chess
14700,Awsome!!!!
14701,artifact failed so this game could succeed
14702,"This big update is really BIG, especially when compared to Dota"
14703,I still don't know what I'm doing but I'm winning anyways.
14704,"Best auto chess out there, don't mind the haters."
14705,"The update shows us that the developers are trying to fit cosmetics and RPG style progression system into a relaxing and fun game concept. The games UI has been shrunk to fit in Underloard avatars on the sides which annoyingly animate and glow making it hard to focus on the gameplay. 

Imagine playing an FPS game and seeing your characters model taking up a 3rd of the screen at all times for no reason, that is what they did in this update.

Played this game for a day before the update, I kinda liked it, now the game is hard to look at, maybe you will enjoy it"
14706,"good game !!!
"
14707,"Well, now the early access is over and guess what? The balancing is still shit. Had a little fun with the city crawl, but forget ranked play either in standard or in knockout, there is exactly one unit everyone is playing, there is exactly one counter comp and that's it. Great concept for a game, to design it in a way that winning makes you feel like a pice of s*it

________________________________________________________
with over 400 hours playyed you coud say I liked the game... but this chnged massively with the ""Big Update"". Th e game had problems, especially in the progession of the match as well as item balance and UI but it was still fun and you got used to a lot. And still big thumbs up to the Devs, there was always a clear direction that they were working towards.

But now to the patch.... wtf?
The UI is such a downgrade from a already problematic state. It feels cluttered, missing features and is obviously once again more tailored towards mobil gamers.

They introduced a jail that reglarly benches random units. On paper this is an awesome idea to prevent ""meta combs"" but they cycle so fast through the jail-time, that people with just time for a game or two an evening can forget to play ranked at all. At the moment I hae tos 2 hours time a day for gaming, that means at the most 4 matches. two of them I need to get a feel for the get of the day, two I can maybe try ranked... if I'm lucky I get both rounds against people that haven't playing all day and already a great feeling for the locked units...

They doubled all hp to let the rounds last long enough for the underlords to have an effect.... makes sense on paper... in reality the matches take even longer and the game feels slow and slugish.

The changes towards the races and allies... that is something to get used to... but wild feels so forking weak, hunter racial still one of the worst, many counter strategies are bound to specific units that now can be nenched any day...  

Underlords are a fun addition but balancing between the lords is questionable, it limits the combs you can go for even more since there are only 2 availalble and each has clear pros for single comps everyone is trying to go for these comps... we just shifted the limited meta from one trigger to another... will give the contenders now much more playtime. New approach from tft looks promissing, the original dota autochess still has a lot going on and on the mobile market tencens products have some success."
14708,Fun game.
14709,Good game for chilling.
14710,"Proper auto-battler. Game, at this point, is still work-in-progress"
14711,"Underlords has grown so much on me, seriously. I was never into the genre but now I'm addicted. I can always shoot a quick bot game while commuting, or I can go ranked on my desktop while munching down a burger. The meta is kept fresh by the devs constantly updating and shifting things around. Looking forward to see what's to come, loving it so far!"
14712,"Bloodseeker sucks the fun out of this game right now, so for now its thumbs down."
14713,GOOOODDDD
14714,Really enjoyed the game and like the devs responding and working to make the game better!
14715,"A patch that will be seen as a stain in the DotAverse equivilent to Zelda CD-i

Thank you for wiping my mmr and replacing a good game with this crud. Now I don't have to think about this game anymore because I wont be playing it."
14716,Great new update that adds more variety and polish to the game.
14717,Game sucks devs suck
14718,"Even though it has a few details to iron out with the UI, the update itself is amazing and I am beyond impressed with the developers."
14719,dobre szacher macher
14720,"this game has gotten worse since release.  the alliances are completely unbalanced, and the meta is instantly stale.  RNG is absolutely absurd... this game is boarderline trash.  it is free though so enjoy if you want."
14721,"fuck the haters great patch

pls fix UI soon tho there's a lot that can be improved on."
14722,"Was a Lord of White Spire (LoWS) before the big update wich was basically the highest tier you can get in ranked matches. You'd go further as a LoWS by going head-to-head with one another to become the Rank 1 Champion. I can tell ya'll that it's a pretty fun game with not much of a learning curve but has a high strategy ceiling; kinda like chess (go figure) and a little RNG if your build is contested. If you're a new player, don't bother reading the negative comments as most of it is petty dislike. Give the game a try."
14723,Really fun game! Switch from playing on your phone right to your PC and back! REgular updates and new balance!
14724,good game
14725,Very fun and interactive.
14726,"An improvement to the auto-chess genre, also creating a lot of new playstyles and as Anessix said ""This should be interesting."""
14727,"As of Oct 24, a lot of people are brigading the reviews about the UI.  I prefer the new UI and think the game is fun as hell."
14728,"great game, i would love to play this game whenever i have spare time. 
"
14729,yes
14730,"Loved the game before ""The Big Update"". Now it is absolutely terrible. Never going to play again."
14731,"Pretty much the best autobattler around.

Pros: 
+Awesome Devs, communicating with fans in Reddit all the time.
+Mobile version has an awesome battery saving function.
+Offline mode, perfect for flights.
+Great decision making opportunities, which is satisfying and feels rewarding when done right.
+Developer mode where you can test things out easily 
+More being added, need more of it.
+Supports cross platform, you can start a game on mobile, kill it and log on from pc and continue within seconds.
+New features, balances, but fixes done really quickly.

Cons 
- the new UI is not the best, being fixed within first 24 hours of launch tho'
- games last 40+ mins on average.
- not a spectacle for new people, not very viewer-friendly especially for people who wants to learn the game 


"
14732,'The Big Update' is the most bug ridden thing in gaming history
14733,"I am a big fan of limited formats in card games like draft in MTG or arena in Hearthstone. Autochess genre gives new take on such formats. The best thing that whole game is build around drafting. 

So far, for me, Dota Underlords is the best game is this genre, so definitely recommend to try it to anyone."
14734,Very nice. Love the constant updates.
14735,"Best autochess, great game, devs always listening"
14736,"Go play, it's free. And that's a great price!"
14737,"The small rank compression in underlords made me drop from smuggler 3 to enforcer 1, thats 9 ranks. Thanks."
14738,Big fan of big update.
14739,"Love the new Underlords, the jail system, and the new units. Feels fresh and fun, and reminds me why I loved playing it in the first place."
14740,pog
14741,Best autochess game out there.
14742,"Underlords is a decent alternative to the Auto-Chess genre.

It has gone through so many changes since Early Access, that it'd be nearly unrecognizable, but in its current state, the game is fun, more or less balanced, and offers a decent single-player campaign.

When it comes to performance, it can be ran on most setups, but running on a potato is probably not advised."
14743,Fun and easy!
14744,Best auto chess version
14745,...
14746,"Just because you're used to the old UI, doesn't mean you should give it a negative review. It's still a great game, it'll just take some getting used to with these major changes."
14747,Who thought the new UI is a good idea? Looks like chinese web games.
14748,"Love to Big Update, on PC. No idea what is with all those complains on new UI. I thought it is amazing =X"
14749,"Great game with a great dev team, constantly churning out solid updates"
14750,Great card game ! Pretty addictive.
14751,bad
14752,buueuebueuebuebuebububeubuebubeububeubeubeubeubeubeubeubeubuebuebubeue
14753,yes
14754,Lots of fun for free!
14755,The new update has brought a lot of content for free and the game mechanics have changed quite a bit to stop the game from becoming stale. I like it.
14756,yaaaaaaa
14757,"dota auto chess > underlords

not only does auto chess update to add new dota heroes and new items into their pool, they balance competitive metas and also bug fix! Feel bad for anyone who spent money on this game"
14758,very nice game
14759,Has a good bit of Random draw. Enjoyable if you like Auto chess games including Dota items and a few new spins.
14760,yikes for new update...
14761,Good good
14762,great game with hard working devs
14763,"It's a good game. I love that Valve has been communicating about it's updates, and updating it regularly.  Also love that they have been responding to feedback recently.  Ignore the haters, the game is worth trying out at the least."
14764,awesome game
14765,NICE COMPETITOR AFTER AUTOCHESS DRAGONEST XD
14766,\
14767,"veryyy good, i enjoy"
14768,Was one of my favorite games. Loved the randomness of my own and my opponents teams. Now there is an annoying boss character (one of TWO ffs) in EVERY single fight that repeats three voice lines and the UI is.. horrible.. just.. what?! Not digging this change at all.
14769,Developments are good. Community feedback is taken seriously.
14770,10/10
14771,"Great game I've sunk a bunch of hours into. Love how much work the devs have been putting in to keep updating it. Things are rarely perfect on their first attempt, but I'd much rather them use this style of development where they iterate quickly on new things and listen to community feedback instead of be overly cautious."
14772,"Good game, well played."
14773,"Wrote a negative review yesterday, within 24 hours the developers have fixed the vast majority of the issues with the big update in FOUR patches/hotfixes.  Just please for the ever loving god get rid of the underlord characters in each corner that take up 20% of the screen while giving me an aneurysm and serving no gameplay purpose (the necro underlord's giant ass arm actually blocks a spot on my bench).  Otherwise game is damn near perfect and fun for this stage of its development."
14774,Good Game
14775,"Great game to be honest. While i wouldn't say im head over heels for it, i jump right back into it every few updates. This new one is especially great, adding a lot of charm to the game"
14776,Great game completely ruined by the worst UI update I have ever seen. The eye strain of the new UI and ridiculously annoying added voice lines has turned a fun and relaxing game into a massive annoyance.
14777,Great patch!
14778,"200 hours - it's a great game, love that I can play at my own pace too."
14779,Fun game that scratches my itch for a competitive experience without relying on a team or opening card packs.  It's just you and every game is a fresh slate.  Weekly updates stop the meta from getting stale.  In the running for my favorite game to come out in 2019
14780,bring back old UI!
14781,"I love the auto-chess genre and I like that this is a standalone game compared to the others that I know of. 

I really appreciate the dev team, they work very hard to put out consistent updates and listen to their community.

As a game, I think it's really fun and its free to play so you might as well try it!"
14782,Really cool game to play with your friends
14783,"It's good. Going to get even better.

Update: It's okay. It's probably not going to get too much better."
14784,The big update change the game in a good way.
14785,"Dota Underlords is a good autobattler. Taking the base aspects of the genre then added a major 'underlord' that acts as a key unit for your strategy. It's got heaps of depth, the available units change each day, and is just generally a great game.

If you're seriously considering it, you can ignore most of the recent negative reviews since they're just UI complaints (The UI has gotten a significant downgrade, but I expect that to be fixed). Give it a try, see if you like it. It's free after all."
14786,Best autobattler out there!

14791,"The game itself is good however it is constantly changing and the most recent UI changes are undoubtedly an issue, many things are too small to see and or too large. There is more skill than RNG regardless of what the scrubs here say."
14792,とても面白いだね。
14793,dope dope
14794,"Used to be addicted to this game but the new update carries it so far away from what made the original dota chess great. The first game i played pre-patch i was hooked, played one game today and i was so bored and tired after i think i might just uninstall."
14795,"Fun take on the autochess genre. I've enjoyed this game far more than both Dota Autochess and Drodo Autochess. 

Currently being review bombed due to a significant overhaul of the UI that people are not yet used to (it's a few hours old.)"
14796,Volvo > Drodo
14797,good good
14798,"With the big update they destroyed the good interface it had. There is too much information on the screen, now you have to open the store to see how much experience is missing to level up. Descriptions that are a bit long have extremely small lyrics. You can no longer distinguish the number of stars of the heroes on the board. It is difficult to distinguish which number represents what, whether it is life, gold, level, or I don't know what other matter of the underlord, as I said, too much information on the screen."
14799,"UI is atrocious with the ""Big Update"". Im fine with the new heros and alliances, but my goodness does the game look awful now. The addition of the underlords seems to undermine the whole idea of recruting heros in the first place. Pre-update, it was exciting to try to play more games and collect XP in order to get neat expressions and effects (Thats HOT)....There is now a system where you need to win/play multiple games in order to unlock the better Underlord abilities. New players will be at a disadvantage, and have less choice in how to shape their underlord. Absurd. Now I have to sit through multiple crappy games in order to get the full effects of my units. Will not be playing anymore barring a UI update and/or an overhaul of how the game is played."
14800,Big update is absolute trash. played mostly auto chess but value decided to yeet this game in a whole new direction. 10/10 visual cancer
14801,"Fun game, updated often. Would recommend!"
14802,"A great auto chess, probably the best for me. Graphics are good and devs are listening to feedback. The new patch feels great, excited to see what they will do in the future."
14803,The best Autochess on the market!
14804,No stress strategy game
14805,"Before, this was the best auto chess game with good updates and responsive fast balanced team

now it is a joke.

Game is unplayable and highly unrecommend after the latest update.

The latest update was a game trying way too hard to add too much new stuff at the same time

while also not having fixed any of its previous problems

Target Buddy is still the most broken item in any auto chess game and dictates whoever wins rounds 1-20.

Also, they added a lot of new heroes which makes the game even more impossible to balance

and they added Underlord into the game which makes battles last longer and does some more bs

Overall, this game is an example of how to make a good product into something that no one should ever play. Games will no doubt last longer due to the extra unit you have to kill and battles are now extremely unfun and impossible to plan against due to the new underlord addition

With Teamfight Tactics coming soon to mobility, there is no way this game can survive in its current state."
14806,"You had a perfect game in all aspects. Once after Half-Life, Valve, you had something. But now, thank you for killing this game. Its unplayable, interface for kids from kindergarten, not even school. New functions implemented to maximally to distract from the game (by size and place on screen). Some buttons are TOO big and some TOO small. Before update it was super.
Want to teleport game designer in my room and break his face!

*played 0 seconds ever since"
14807,"Roll back the old update 
this is super boring !! i just started playing 2 days ago , then the update hits ... super lame . 
"
14808,"Very good Game, you should try it."
14809,The Dark Souls of autobattlers.
14810,horrible and brilliant at the same time. fun and rage. good updates. i love it. so everybody calm down this is gonna be the best auto chess game at the moment its just a beta.
14811,BIG UPDATE
14812,yrd
14813,Don't like this new update :/
14814,Great game!
14815,"This review (or for a better word, critique) is not about the game as a whole but about the 'Big Update'
I've played a few games since the update came out. Three thing kinda ruined it for me:
1. The game has become a visual mess. A screen filled with particles and with that losing the impact of individual heroes.
2. The interface is terrible, it looks nice and pretty but doesn't supply you with the information you want while playing. I also don't need a quarter of the screen filled with the face of my underlord. 
3. The underlords feel stupid. They take the spotlight and take away from you other hero choices. Their presence on the board also feels useless for as far I've played they only die last. I also dislike having to unlock abilities for them, removing the even playing field. Would like to have maybe a mode without them.
I really hope Valve will adress the issues in some way and don't try push the game away from its original simplicity."
14816,"Unfortunately, should agree with many users who said that the latest (24.10.2019 BIG UPDATE) sucks: UI became terrible (IMHO), previously it was pretty clear what happens, now information is kind of covered under FXs and/or colorful bars and/or very-very tiny UI elements (when it's hard to see them properly).

Because of that I was tired of playing after the 1st game (with prev UI I could play 10+ games in a row).

Please, do smth with UI as the current version frustrates a lot and doesn't give a good/normal gameplay experience.

The game and its mechanics should be at the first place (as the game is majorly based on chances / pools / synergies / heroes, etc.) the information is the king. Please, make it easy to read / understand what happens, and later add additional FXs to it."
14817,"In true Valve fashion, they have taken a good game and turned it to trash with their latest update.  The UI is an unreadable mess.  I'm not playing this again until this patch is reverted."
14818,No
14819,"You will play it for a few hours, and it will be fun (in a mindless way, but fun none the less)

After you win your first game, you will experience everything the game has to offer, and you can uninstall. I'd say since its free, it is okay, but the second the begin trying to make money off of this game, don't get it. It is very apparent that anyone at valve who actually had some kind of soul was either fired or left a long time ago. 

Dota Underlords is just barely skirting copy right infringement laws, as the original developers were smart enough not to work with Valve. This is the best valve can do now, copy pasting the ideas of others. All of the fun parts of this game weren't made by Valve, just copy pasted. If Artifact wasn't enough of an endictment of the times, then I don't know what this shit is supposed to be."
14820,"The new big update is out! And it killed the game for me, honestly didn't think that adding more would take so much away."
14821,Pro tip: Play on mobile; not worth playing on PC but time-killer on mobile...
14822,"Хуйня обнова, верните как было!!!"
14823,Good Game
14824,"The ""Big Update"" it's just a shite. Lords are ruined the all sense of the game."
14825,"Best autochess genre game on the market right now.
Cross-play means it never took more than 15 seconds to find a game.
The game is very optimized on my mobile and run smoothly in medium setting.
On my PC the game looks beautiful and run smoothly as well.
The gameplay is fun but sometimes RNGesus will just screw you over.
Valve game quality is assured :)"
14826,A really fun game. I suppose it will become even better after the beta ends.
14827,game to pass the time.
14828,"bugs

sometimes heroes doesnt attack
some times games seems to be running while closed, imposible to open it
"
14829,"Amazing gameplay, constant support and balancing and full of brilliant ideas"
14830,Glitchy piece of garbage. Deletes units off the field randomly and makes me loss buffs and 3 star units. Fix your glitchy pos game
14831,"if you play for fun , you'll have fun"
14832,"light version for dota 2 players, easy and fun"
14833,"The game was very good. The smaller changes after each season made the game play out a little different which was also fine.

Then suddenly it started to be laggy and buggy, followed by a ""big update"" that:
-changed the visuals to not allow tracking what is happening
-added a ""hero"" that ruins the actual alliance bonuses
-changed every unit in the game
-destroyed any balance

No idea why someone would change a game that much with a single update..."
14834,Come on everyone let's get DU's up to overwhelmingly positive to get the developers back!!!
14835,"A nice game that goes with your coffee in the morning. Part of my routine. I hope they continue with the development of the game and sometimes, maybe later to implement more complex mechanics in the game."
14836,Hell yeah heaps of fun........
14837,Reduce the RNG elements please
14838,"Great game, super fun and challenging. Like RPG Chess! Every tournament is a clean slate. Plan to spend almost an hour on a tournament, however. Great graphics."
14839,Pure RNG... Players withought economy just 3star ur ass all night... See ya there is better Auto chess games out there.
14840,sooooo addictive!!!
14841,Anjay
14842,Garbage
14843,"It's great game, but still learn more. it's wasn't bad."
14844,"nice game
you can play it where you noob to play dota
easy to learn, hard to master"
14845,Stupidest game Ive ever played. RNG to the core!
14846,"I'm not a Dota Player. I'm a TFT player that got curious about the game that inspired TFT. And i will compare them, since they are very similar games. 
______________________________________________________________________
First things first, the good points:
 
1 - RNG and Balance: I've seen people complaining about RNG, something I don't agree at all. Even though items and pieces are random, they are equally likely/unlikely to everyone (unlike tft and its stupid carousel). For a luck game, it's decently fair. Apart from the (very weak primordials), alliances seems pretty balanced too. 

2 - Heroes and alliance Diversity: I played the game for about 15 hours and i still didn't manage to test every high tier Hero, same for a lot of alliance combinations. There's a lot to explore. Also, diversified teams work pretty well, it's pretty nice to be able to win a game with 5~6 different synergies. 
_________________________________________________________________________

Bad points: 

1 - (Lack of) good Item System: 
For me, the real issue is the boringness of item system.  I didn't play the game when alliance items still existed, but they seem way more entertaining than the nowadays ones. The thing is, TFT's item-combining system is WAY more inspiring and fun to play with, making items feel like a primordial,  almost as important as chess pieces choice. Besides 4s immortal bloodseekers, Underlords's items seems like a secondary, not versatile thing, that fit well to only a few Heroes. 

In TFT, i can make any of my favourite champions powerful by giving them a powerful combination of items. It's not simply about a better item system, it's about the replay factor, the diversity, the innovations and strategies that a better item system brings. In Dota Underlords, all I can is to make an already OP Hero more OP by giving him an item that suits perfectly (but only) to him.

2 - Poor UX experience: I wish SO MUCH that heroes's information were easier to see before buying them. A simple on:hover auxiliary  side-box would be enough. I absolutely hate the fact that I need to click on a ""?"" question mark that opens a INGAME FULLSCREEN POP-UP to know what a hero does. Hiding your uncompleted alliances synergies during battles is also very annoying. The ""shop-mode"" itself is a pretty painful unnecessary thing, honestly, TFT made it way more easier, cleaner and user-friendly.
__________________________________________________________________

As a game that is NOT DOTA, but an independent autochess one, i wouldn't recommend it since TFT, it's direct concurrent, has way better UX, replay factor and diverse gameplay. As a 'same universe from DOTA  game', it works well."
14847,.
14848,A retarded reap-off.
14849,"Horrible UX. Started auto chess on League of Legends TFT, and then tried to play DOTA Underlords. I have no preference for who makes the autochess, as I don't play MOBAs -- but underlords felt horrible to play comparatively. Maybe I just got used to TFT. I wouldnt recommend underlords, or at least I WOULD recommend TFT for anyone interested in an autochess."
14850,"Wont even play without freezing up. Are there some kinks I dont know about?
"
14851,"90% Luck Base game
5% skill
5% big brain time"
14852,noice
14853,"It is good.
After you play any round of TFT
You would cosider this game
AWESOME."
14854,"This is probably one of the more polish auto chess games. This is at the VERY least a must try if you have or like other auto chess games. You even have the option to play AI until you understand the game, unlike many other auto chess games it doesn't even try & teach you how to play it just throws you into PVP."
14855,"This game is fun simple as that. RNG is a benefit to you but the law of averages plays a larger part to the strategy and your success of this game. I read a few reviews that say its all luck to win this game but truthfully these comments are coming from people who probably don't understand the strategy and that's probably fine too. The same rush gamblers get can come from this game and the same excitement one might get from playing a good game of MTG is also present here. Its an iron tight game and I haven't noticed to many bugs. The updates come frequent and the contents is plentiful. For a game in beta, its 4/5 starts for me."
14856,A fun game of strategy and risk management set in the Dota Universe
14857,I really enjoy this game! I like chilling to it on both PC and Mobile. 10/10
14858,Great spending of time!!.
14859,"this game suck
it is like a luck to win game
"
14860,gud
14861,"TBH this is fun game and very enjoyeable to play with since it's still have the same concept and strategy genre like original dota 2 but i don't like this rng system when you have to choose card from large heroes pool and need 9 same cards to upgrade it to 3 star
valve need to either nerf requirement to gain 3 star heroes from 9 same cards to 7 same cards or change gold requirement to change card from 2 gold to 1 gold

for now i'll not recommend it since it's still 50/50 rng luck base game"
14862,gud game
14863,Fantastic!
14864,not attracting and fun compare to same type of games
14865,"Great game, people leaving bad reviews fail to realise that it's still in BETA and they are preparing for a big update that will shake a lot of things. While that the game has obviously got a bit stale, but it usually had patches nearly every week before they started really focusing on launching it.

If anything, the game is free and it isn't big. Try for yourself. I already had a lof of fun playing it and intend to keep doing so."
14866,"Really dull game. Played about an hour, that's it.  No control over combat, it's a mobile game for PC.

Who fucking gives a shit."
14867,Fun game and lots more to come when it's out of Beta
14868,This game is worse than the mod the menus look bad and the game feels slow i was playing a mobile version of auto chess and it felt faster and overall better than a game made by valve
14869,OMG! This Game IS SICK(:
14870,"SLARK ,remove him."
14871,Yes
14872,"eeh...
The updates were delayed for far too long. Felt like the game got abandoned after a while.
Bit better now with new update; still bit bored tho.. No events/skins or anything to work for really than useless ranks."
14873,It's not a Dota card game
14874,Garbage game. Questionable mechanics. Deplorable AI. Seemingly exists only to exploit existing IP. Stay away.
14875,"Hi welcome to my review, it comes with great sadness that playing such a RNG game that I have come to the conclusion of uninstalling and deleting this game.

When you come across the likes of players such as ""Aryan, Agger or Eoin"" then it's just not fun to even put up 1 unit and still win the round, if you end up on a team with these guys then you misewell not waste your 30 minutes and go and masturbate. 

After saying that, if you come across any other player without them names then it's unfun vs 3 stars that pull out there genitals and insert them inside your anus for no reason at all, even if you're bisexual they ask no questions and insert it anyway.

Thanks for taking your time to review such a great review by myself (not big headed) and hopefully you all follow the Sheltonator ways and uninstall, bye"
14876,"Once good, the new update brought a new system of ""No matter what your combinations and combo skills are, only the one with the most broken champ team win. Valve proved to us one mroe time they were unable to look at their games before to make updates which ruin everything once fun..."
14877,stuck on loading screen. GG my friend!!!
14878,"It's the only game I play these days. I love it! 
Don't listen to people saying it's all about RNG, they're wrong. There's so much you can do to beat your opponents, and luck only plays a little role in it ;) (In the long run at least)

Also: I hated the Big Update at first, but I got used to it. They can still make a few improvements to the UI, like the Damage/DPS window being too small, but generally it seems fine to me! There's also still a few bugs that really need to be fixed, but as it's still in beta it's all forgivable!"
14879,The most aesthetically pleasing and understandable auto-battler out right now but could do with more depth and complexity of choice during a battle. This will prevent the meta from getting stale so quick.
14880,"-----------------------
❖ My Score 50/100 ❖
-----------------------
valve legally ""stole""another game&added to their company collection. Game itself is more polished/balanced than the autochess in dota 2 client but still game is basically a lottery you need 30% knowledge 70% dice roll first people who succeeds making a strong combo with 3star heroes gets top 3 rest die like flies"
14881,"This game tries hard to be like the 3D chess game that Lieutenant Commander Data plays in Star Trek TNG: S5E14, but it comes off being much more like the virtual reality disc-and-tube game that Commander William Riker got addicted to in S5E6."
14882,"atleast we cannot swear to other players, no toxic gaming ~"
14883,"good game
"
14884,"meh i say is a 9/10 game

14885,"veeeeeerrrrryyyy goood game

14886,"Crashes alot .. takes forever to load .. buggy game

I have a pc that can run ark the most leaky buggy game known perfectly, yet this game crashes around 20 times per game .. doesnt run ""smooth"" as other people claim at all ..

Nice idea run by a idiot monkey"
14887,abcde
14888,"Nice game,needs some work and updates to reduce the rng aspect a little bit in my oppinion but as a whole just a nice game. The ones that complain that the whole game is based on rng are just sore losers that dont know how to play the game."
14889,"A great auto-chess game. It's free, try it."
14890,"Love the game.

addicted now"
14891,Hot pile of RNG garbabge
14892,aaaahhhh okay
14893,"The intriguing thing about this game format is that it is a mirror of the future of warfare. A day will soon come when battles will be decided by autonomous robots operating on largely deterministic instructions. The only thing generals will be able to do is arrange them in formations and hope for the best. Git gud at autobattlers to prepare yourself psychologically to participate in the RoHoWa: ROBOT HOLY WAR. 

This is also unironically. without reservation, the best multiplayer game I have ever played. It is a patrician's game of deep thought, tactical positioning, and the absolute total destruction of half-wits. Negative reviews here say it is a game of pure luck. Check my screenshots. I win a *lot*, and I play over Tor where my ping is usually around a thousand milliseconds. That means I have a considerable disadvantage to other players because I have lag after clicking when trying to draft units from the shop, reposition, or assign items. I virtually always place top 3, and usually win. Today I still had 75hp in the final round after I utterly crushed continually all game long with a scrappy/assassins/deadeye build. The entire game was just vicious and unrelenting humiliation inflicted on all the poor misfortunate cretins that had the ill luck of landing in a match with me. I felt like I had 7 new psychic phalluses, all of them ruinously violating the quivering orifices of my opponents. As the match was brought to a close as my gyrocopter rained down a pillar of destruction I knew that this is what it feels like to be alive.

The barrage of updates which have come recently, The Big Update and the Outlanders have made this game even better. I really enjoy the knockout mode, which lets me fit in a game when I don't have a lot of time. Even more, I enjoy the duos mode because now with two people searching for units it accentuates skill even more -- there is less entropy in rolling and you are more likely to get stuff you need. 

Death to the undermen, life to the Underlords. See you in the White Spire."
14894,"Dota 2 custom autochess - Piece purchasing decision and placement matters

Dota Underlord - a race to the best pieces and dealing immense amount of  TeamFight Tactics style damage as early and quickly as possible."
14895,"I really tried to enjoy it.
I hardly reach 5th place in every game I play. Because the shop only gives me the most useless heroes. No alliance bonuses, no enough copies of the same hero to upgrade, nothing.
by round 20, if I actually reach round 20, I usually have 2 level 2 heroes and maybe level 1 alliance bonus. while one of my enemies get a 1 level 3 and 2 level 2 with multiple stacks of alliance bonuses by round 7. The randomness of this game is unbearable because the game itself determines who wins and who loses with its RNG system. I don't even know why there is ranked mode at all! this game doesn't require any skill, only luck.
I hope valve pays attention to this issue, just stop this ""5 random heroes in shop"" thing and make all of the heroes available to purchase from level 1, or maybe divide them into different tiers with every tier unlocking when you reach a certain level, let us ACTUALLY use our skills to play this thing."

Not recommended, not fun you will only get massive stress from playing unless you like stress games that much other than that its waste of your time."
14911,Just another attempt by Valve cashing in on whatever is popular at the moment. Also the concept of having the game play by itself for you really doesn't work for me.
14912,"with the ""We're Lycan This Update"" update valve has once again shown a complete lack of basal understanding of their own game. the game has went from a semi-rng based but really enjoyable strategy game where alliances and compositions matter to just spamming the few champions that are downright broken without any care for their alliance bonuses, since they matter so little these days. all of this in just a matter of weeks. it's looking more and more like the case of artifact, just wait until they implement a cash shop and then completely give up any updates on the core gameplay in favor of more cash grabs."
14913,"do not download this game until the november(?) update comes, lack of hotfixes ( why are savage still garbage after this """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""update"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and why did bloodbound get nerfed )

assassins still exist and is a complete rng fest in an already rng fest game

yeah bro somehow defend this:
lost one round against assassins, then won against the same assassin comp ( with the same exact positioning  and units )

void also existing (its like a pre nerf tidehunter with a built in blink dagger, wow why would this ever be added) and the fact is also makes assassins durable

and then sandking (dislocating your backline dps haha) and its filthy insects adding more to assassins

very amazing development team cant wait for the next savage nerf 
atleast theyre updating it weekly now

14914,get good

14925,Great interpretation of Dota Autochess. So fun and addictive. Keep the good work.  I am thrilled to see the tournaments.
14926,GOOD but this cant be installed on new window 10
14927,""" I don't like the new updates i guessed i like the older one ""

- Bad interface texts so small and mess up with many tabs
- Underlords ruined the game because there's so much going on in the board just go Dps and CC then you win
- Sometimes depend on RNG
- Broken ranking

so ill quit this game"
14928,Nice game Enjoyed
14929,Garbage.
14930,"At first it was fun. It's highly polished, much moreso than any other auto-chess. The interface is so damned easy to use. All of it just lets you get to the fun of the game quickly.

And then lets you use up all the fun the game has quickly as well. Got to near the highest rank within just a few weeks of play, saw the end game with the majority of the players all max ranked, and then got bored. By all appearances they Valve have no interest in changing just how simple the game is either. The promised large update, soon as of writing this, just adds more alliances. Instead of, I don't know, making unit placement on the board require more thought and be more important? Or unit composition be more important than ""damn I hope the few good available alliances I'm going for aren't being used by too many others so I can win!""

I just don't see this as a viable longterm game. Valve might do well to stop updates by the end of the year and just leave it an eternally free game."
14931,Really confusing.
14932,"good game, balance and fun."
14933,"If you like getting molested by RNG like a small boy in a catholic church, this is the game for you."
14934,"very fun but bugs not worked out yet. simply evil, like dungeon master...just wrong in addiction! But stop changing things!. We are you lab rats....think about that......

Ah someone else who's life was ruined by Dungeon Master... Those were the days....of evil birth"
14935,10/10
14936,"A better implementation of autochess. Valve might take this newly birthed genre to the right direction, art quality , lore and gameplay wise."
14937,Fun game to play and never be afraid to be last anything can change into your favour.
14938,garbo rng
14939,"super game, nice job !!!"
14940,"Before i start this review it is worth pointing out that i have played this game before the big update launched with the Underlords bosses and gameplay revamp and was able to climb to lord of white spire before the big update hit.

Now, with that being said, i personally dislike the direction the game is headed towards where Underlords keep drastically changing the core aspect of the auto chess gameplay to the point where it is not even recognizable for old timers like myself who would prefer such gimmicks out of the game simply because they feel awkward to play with and build around in terms of team compositions and such. 

Additionally, the hp and damage values were reworked which causes games to last way longer than it should, what kind of auto chess games last up to an hour per session? That is ridiculous. Granted, the devs have tried to remedy this by introducing modes such as knockout but again these feel more like gimmicks and custom game modes that are not meant to be taken seriously considering how heavily reliant on RNG that mode revolves around and such. 

Finally, The UI and display especially on mobile is horrendous compared to what it looked like in the past. Overall i have to admit, the big update has left a bitter taste in my mouth and i wish we could play the game as it originally was before the big update because it was better in my opinion.

Now to move on to the underlords subreddit and discord fanbase. My god i have never seen a community more sensitive and more aggressive towards people who don't share the same circlejerk opinion as they do. The moment you bring up any problems with the game, be prepared to fight off the fans who come up with all kinds of reasons and excuses to justify it and report you hoping you get banned from the community. An example of this would be if you complained about issues such as gameplay length or UI display, they will talk about how the game is still in beta and that means these issues are allowed to stick around, which honestly defeats the purpose of a beta but i digress.

Additionally, being negative about the game is viewed as being a toxic menace to these people, say one too many bad things about the game in the game discord and you will probably be banned by the oversensitive moderators who get mad as soon as you critique them and tell em that they are incapable at their jobs. These are the same type of people who believe that there is a limit to negativity. Never in my entire life have i ever heard of something more ridiculous besides listening to Donald Trump's Speeches.

Lastly, even though i personally dislike the game and it's community now especially in it's current state, i am not going to tell you to not play this game, instead, i am going to let you decide if its worth it to invest time and effort into a game that is constantly in a state of flux with a community that will defend all it's problems to the death, with that being said, i wish the game and it's community all the best.

14942,Best auto battler in the market!!
14943,No
14944,Good idea to remaster autochess from mod and skin UI with original dota 2 but the development is pretty slow. Game balance is terrible. Nothing new or special from mod version. Felt really boring after a few days playing. Not recommended.
14945,Random Patch changes. Stupid additions of mechanical crap. Imbalanced combinations which have been imbalanced since launch and never changed. Devs dont listen to the feedback AT ALL. Honestly this game sucks.
14946,This game is fun.
14947,"No startegy, only luck, tossing coins is more fun"
14948,strategizing is the root of the game. enjoy
14949,Amazing game with great potential! Hard to play on phone tho.
14950,Good game!
14951,semi-rng based game. but i still played it cause this game is official from valve. not f****n tencent <3
14952,"wicked game - if you want to climb ladder i'd wait for early access to end though, meta shifts very heavily at the moment between patches.

also quite buggy, but you'll barely notice until you're climbing the ladder."
14953,i love this fvcking game lol
14954,Headass
14955,This game so nice.
14956,"Updated Review:
Underlords has come into it's own and I'm pleased to say I can recommend it. While balance is different than it was before, it is sufficiently interesting and fun that it keeps you engaged. Knockout and Duo's game modes are some of the strong points of Underlords to the point that I don't even play the regular mode anymore. 

Knockout is a much faster pace game mode where instead of 100HP you can only lose four rounds before being ""Knockout Out"". To speed things up you roll for a starting army comp and you need less duplicates to level up your guys.

Duo's is more like the regular game mode except you're playing with a partner. Both units and gold can be shared. The best way I can describe it is that instead of believing in the heart of the card, Grandpa slams the last piece of Exodia into your hand and you guys high five as you destroy your competition thanks to team work.

Overall Underlords is an enjoyable Auto Chess game and I look forward to it's future.

Initial Review:
With every single update the game grows more different than the original Auto Chess mod from which the game borrowed heavily. Unfortunately it does not appear that the developers understand the reasons for the design and balance decisions which those mod devs had made. And thus with every single update the game becomes less interesting to play. With the latest update it has reach the point which I can no longer recommend to others."
14957,0/10
14958,"Really nice and captivating game. The matches are quite short, so you'll end up saying ""Just one more"" and suddenly evening has turned to night that has turned to early morning. :) Nice background music and cute graphics. The only downsides I see are that the time between rounds are often too short, especially in late game; and that the randomization in the unit shop sometimes can make it hard to form a great strategy, but often that is not a big problem at all."
14959,"I did not plan to like this, but I do"
14960,The first few games were fun then I just started to hate it. Haven't had a single win. I try to do all the things right yet somehow always get wrecked near the end of the game. Maybe you'd like it if you don't really care about winning or trying very hard and just want to kill some time.
14961,It is sad that the game highly depends on RNG and not much on strategy.
14962,dedas sheveci
14963,Nice rework!
14964,"The current state of this game is not well balanced in terms of the meta, only few alliances are good to use in ranked match."
14965,;l
14966,I can't play this game
14967,One of the most unbalanced game i have ever met. Shame on you. How dare you are :(
14968,"Requires no strategy or skill, simply RNG game"
14969,This game totally awesome for ex dota player. Since dota need more time to play. This game clearly easier and shorter to play. Gameplay are nice. Hoping for more update to make it more interesting
14970,"Great game, but need fix for mobile version because its so laggy"

Slot Machine The Game

The skill being how to manage your money and when to increase the bet

(If you like real life games like dice, you will like this: 75% RNG - 25% Skill)

(If you like games that are more skill based then that, you will not like this)"
14972,"Welcome to the Casino! No depth in game, not much skill required, just random and knowledge of several best setups. A lot of dead sinergies and figures."
14973,"Fun game in small doses. It's not really a kind of game I would recommend playing multiple hours every day, and if you take it too seriously the RNG will make you rage. Probably best auto chess game at the moment."
14974,"Currently the 'meta' is simple: get knights. If you don't, chances are fat you'll loose. As long as other alliances don't stand an equal chance of winning this game sucks."
14975,Almost completely luck based and very repetitive.
14976,Beta game by a small indie company.

you pick characters which all just do random stuff.

the tutorial sucks.

the animations suck.

no fun, boring as hell, and confusing as hell"
14985,Best Autochesslike game
14986,"first off this game has been extremely fun. love all the play modes and to this last update , devs seem to have a plan. Then here come the nerfs to cater to the kids that cant grasp strategy and any adversity is considered bad game.   all games start off good on steam until they disgustingly become overly greedy and succumb to the money at the expense of a really good game. Here is a more healthy  solution to the characters that have pets, nerf the fricking pets dont take the dynamic away from the game.  i hope somebody that had a hand in making this game has some cahones to say no quit changing this great game because of weak players."

14990,"Great game, great graphics, great way to pass the time, much less lag than the dota autochess gamemode in dota, I recommend this to anybody who wants to play a chess like strat game!"
14991,"with the ""We're Lycan This Update"" update valve has once again shown a complete lack of basal understanding of their own game. the game has went from a semi-rng based but really enjoyable strategy game where alliances and compositions matter to just spamming the few champions that are downright broken without any care for their alliance bonuses, since they matter so little these days. all of this in just a matter of weeks. it's looking more and more like the case of artifact, just wait until they implement a cash shop and then completely give up any updates on the core gameplay in favor of more cash grabs."
14992,"This game is highly addictive (for me anyways) in short bursts but it can get repetitive if played back to back for long hours in the same day. It's very fair as you can't pay to win and no matter what level you are at, everyone is on an even playing field. Have to be quick with decision making and highly adaptable if you really wanna win your matches.
However, RNG can be a killer, as the re-rolls can be really unfair but that really depends on your luck and tactics; if you curse and get triggered too much due to bad luck I don't know if this is the game for you. The RNG is what can really turn the tide of the match.
Those who have been losing in a match can catch up. This is a great game for casual gamers and of course those who wish to play competitive and rank up for bragging rights. Lots of improvements still to be made to make it more fun to play with friends and perhaps more characters would make it more interesting as well.

Highly recommend this game if you like quick strategy on an even playing field. Good job Valve. Hope this game is even better in the full release."
14993,"You put your 'updated Tier2 crews' in formation and you think you could win easily, but the other team has more hero combinations... You die in few seconds and see the enemy cheering with heart balloons.

Its a Good game, but its not for everyone. Its a good 'time killer' to play when you are listening to podcast, music, etc. or just to spend time/enjoy playing... but its not a quick game. sometimes you need more than 15/20min to play (if you are going well...)"
14994,🤙🤙🤙
14995,"Very nice game. 
Relaxing and lots of fun...

I like the YO!"
14996,"Game seems like a lot of fun at first. Then you quickly realize that because its all A.I controlled (poorly)  you will lose most fights. The troops are not even kinda  balanced (in my opinion)  (had a two star blood guy one hit a tank for 800+ damage with no equipment) whomever lucks into the target buddy at turn 3 will likely win the next several fights.. the game will pretty much see that you are building a certain set of char's and never give you enough to make more than one 3 star.. but dont worry your opposition will have at least 3-4 by turn 9.  Phone players dc like its fashionable and you will have to face a harder smarter A.I. 
Phone players also spam emotes... so thats pure cancer (see rocket league) 

Also i don't know how but some players will have 50-60 gold by turn 10 just saved up with full armies..(would love to know how they do that if its a bug or cheat or legit.. seems useful.

Fun for a few days and i did not see any microtransactions."

14998,"Imagine a game where your skill and game knowledge mean less than in Hearthstone - that's Underlords.
If you haven't played Hearthstone, here's a summary of Underlords:
* everything is random
* you can only hedge your odds for units, and even then it's minimal
* it's full of bugs, either visual or literal (units healing/taking damage without reason)
* if you don't get the items/heroes you need, you lost
* there's one OP strategy per patch, and if you don't get it, you lost
And none of it has changed across many patches.
The only good thing about this is game: it's running stable."
14999,"If gaming is where the developer moves the meta, and the players chase it, then i guess this is a game"

15004,"It's just not compelling. Interface and tutorial are clunky. Even by Early Access standards, this feels pretty meh."
15005,"""Investment Brawl""

There are a lot of features in the game that allow for different styles of play. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys DOTA in general, or any games with different competitive aspects."
15006,"Having played this for a ton of hours, more then enough to fairly critique it i've learned this.

The game is not good.  That won't stop you from wanting to play it.  You see, it's more addictive then good.  It's like playing a slot machine that kicks you in the crotch every time you pull the lever.   It's only after putting enough coins in that the illusion is broken and you see it for what it is, a mobile game on the pc.   You can't take the ""addictive"" out of mobile games.  

Beyond that, it's ""balance"" is who get's most lucky with items or pairing up units.  Some may argue that is not true, and in one aspect that is correct.  People who correctly identify the most broken builds and FORCE them will win more then others who try to play the game for what it sells itself as.   

It appears to be a ""draft"" game where keeping open and flowing strategies will lead you to win, instead due to piss poor balancing,  whoever gets multiple contracts, summoning stones, broken units, will win.   

I wanted to like this game, and i was sucked into it's addictive nature with the promise of a draft experience, but due to extremely poor management i cannot recommend you waste your time."
15007,Very stupid game. Pay to win. boring as hell
15008,I would be glad if we would get a new Artifact still... but it is almost the same experience so i guess it helps forget about the impossible.

15026,rng bullshit
15027,"To all the people that rag on the 'RNG' aspect of this game, if you believe it's that big of a factor then you probably don't understand this game properly.

The 'RNG' aspect makes this game dynamic and engaging rather than static and predictable. 

You can have a really good strategy that you know how to use, but if you're not good at thinking on the fly and adapting to the situation in front of you then it will only take you so far.

I'm pretty sure I've never reviewed a game on steam, maybe 1 or 2 but many years ago. This game prompted me to give a review because I think it's bloody outstanding. It's seriously fun, engages your mind, prompts you to research strategies and techniques. 

And once you start refining your gameplay you see a dramatic increase in wins.
 
I highly highly recommend this game to people looking for a rewarding challenge!"
15028,very fun to play

15048,I really enjoyed playing this game
15049,"I don't understand this game. I don't like this game. I usually get in sixth place and I have no clue how to play, really. And what sucks even more is it isn't casual at all. I already read online that you save your money and I'm usually first to 50g. They don't even tell you about interest in the tutorial. They really don't tell you much of anything in the tutorial... 

I've only played it for a day, but I really have no desire to play it again. It might be someone's cup of tea but it doesn't seem very balanced or fun for the average gamer. If you are competitive and like figuring out the best team to go for... yeah... I'd probably play it if I were you.

It was, however, fun in bot mode, and at the start before I read you should save your money. I actually won several of the matches... wondering why people weren't using their gold. Then I found out."

15052,Neat idea but rng plays way too much of a factor in how the game ends and who ends up coming out on top. Also not really enough meat on the bones of this game to sink in the time it takes to understand which hero does what and who is the best counter to who. The contraptions update just adds needless complexity that you cant really account for due to the RNG of how you get these items. The better of the auto chess like games but still not really fun enough to learn how to master it.
15053,"This is a very competitively but relaxed game. Easy to learn hard to master, RNG plays a role but a 'win' is when you finish the top 4 which makes it feel casual."
15054,No.
15055,Gud <3
15056,its an Autochess game may require better marketing and systematic way to attract the audience who are not familiar with this kind of game.
15057,говно мамонта для отсталых хуесосов
15058,get out of the fckin beta
15059,Simple game and enjoyable
15060,"Even though it's in beta, it's a well paced strategy game that doesn't require you to focus the same way a MOBA or FPS does. Calling it ""Auto-Chess"" is a disservice to chess, but it does share the same size board, so there's that.

It reminds me a lot of old Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2 customs, where you build your units up over time, manage your economy, and try to outdo the other players all at the same time. There's just enough to juggle that it's engaging, enjoyable, and fun.  Combining units feels good, winning battles feels good, and stacking up alliances feels good - all things games in this genre are measured by. Units feel like their DOTA counterparts and (for someone like me who hasn't really played DOTA since WC3 mod days) provides the suitable element of nostalgia and familiarity.

I'm excited to see what future updates and eventually 1.0 bring to the game. It's worth playing even now, though."

15072,I don't see the point. It is like a MOBA only you don't get to play... The characters fight automatically and all you can do is a bit of management of them. In a MOBA you get to do both.
15073,RNG HATES ME!
15074,"It's bogus to write a negative review for a FREE game, so consider my thumbs down on this saying: it's a good game play for a few 10's of hours until you know the ropes basically, that part is fun......the rest of this is a warning, and hence it's thumbs down.

Ok, I've played this for a week and quite understand it. I got to outlaw rank which is third from the bottom and when I watch someone on Big Boss play, I don't notice anything different in their choices. One thing that is indeed a big difference, is their luck with the shop and item drops compared to mine. Like with all the digital CCG/TCG games I've played, RNG is the real winner/loser......although I made progress to the outlaw rank.....I am playing against people who constantly and consistently have 3-5 three-star hero's....and quite often also two-star Aces, which I have achieved only once in close to 100 games, but to no avail because I had no three-stars, had lvl 10, and lost to my opponent who was still on lvl 8 but with 5 three-star extremely tanky hero's. Only once have I had the luck to have 3 three star hero's ""online"", but then didnt have the cash to seal a win with them.

I don't get angry like I do getting totally fucked over by RNG in a CCG with this game......because I am not investing and am not taking it seriously.......but if I had to pay for this.......I would hands down refuse because it really comes down to RNG if you get first or not. Someone will now say, you had choices to make along the way......sure, I did.....but when I spend 70 cash on 2 cost re-rolls that never give me that fucking Ace, let alone 3 of them.........or never gave me the right items for my present build composition.......I don't call any of that skill. I can get to 10 in nearly every game, but i never have more than 1 three star on average while doing so...that means I mostly dont get them....they just simply don't appear.....I see plenty of others doing this with tier 3 hero's and sometimes even tier 4's.....but I'll be damned if I ever get that lucky to have a loving shop keeper give me what I need like that without going completely broke at the moment i need the cash the most.

Then there's this thing in the first pvp round some dude with 2 two-stars already online while you were never shown anything that matched at all.....ensuring your losing streak for the comong 5 to 8 match-ups. Catching up and beating such a guy 'I have achieved only once and it was quite epic because we had 3 battles before I actually won that final matcxh only due to me moving my guys around to ensure me killing his badly? placed totem pole first.

Maybe you like this and can stay calm and just be all ""this is fun"" even if you always end in 5th to 8th place.....who cares, play it. It's actually fun trying to ""make do with what you get""......I just find it frustrating.

On the rank below outlaw I was coming in first to third on one single day and ranked up, but the few days before i wasnt coming close. so why Is that when I dont feel like I ""learned"" from any failures I may have made. four leaf clover programming. good luck and ignore the fact that it's not actually you who is at fault for losing. If it isn't there for you in the store....you can't buy it even if you perfectly managed your interest all the way to your final match up.

It's just like your choice right now after reading this. Will you take the red pill or the blue pill?"
15075,It Ain't Over Yet!
15076,"this game is literally garbage, whoever made this game, don't ever make a game again"
15077,best autochess game idk
15078,zaibal sukas blje
15079,"This game started strong - really strong. It had unique ideas to modify the already known ""Auto-Chess""-Genre. It used the already known units to make it easier to get into it. It had a great UI.

Ideas it had: Global-Items and Tribe-Items that force players to modify their game style depending on the items they get in the early game (with the problem that you of course had a huge problem as soon as you do not get the item for the tribe you are locking yourself into - balancing was needed).

One Item per Hero: Contrary to TFT and the original Auto-Chess, every hero can only hold one item. This game with pros and cons, but finally, it made hypercarries much less of a problem and made team-compositions much more the focus of the game.


Sounds good, right? A very basic, true-to-form Autochess-battler with the units that started it all and many possible improvements! Well, yes, but then the team, patch by patch, dismantled their own game. First, they took away the tribe items - most likely because they did not find a way to balance them. Either you had them and were stronger - or not. A problem.
BUT: They left some in. Summoning Stone, for example, makes all summoned units much stronger - an item and is useful for some tribes only, but is absolutely necessary if you want to build savages and druids. It is therefore an unofficial tribe item. They also left in the Human-option to make all humans undead.

Then, they implemented ACE-Units. Those are the new tier-5-units, and they come with huge, if not game-breaking effects. Wanna build a tribe that has no ACE-Unit? Well, tough luck, since in the lategame, you will just run against a brick-wall. You go for a tribe and need that ACE-unit, but get it later then the other players? Well, you can at least spactate after you ran against the same brick wall again!

Then, there are knights. Knights don't have an ace-unit, and they are easily assembled, but... somehow, they just counter nearly everything else. Since many patches now, I heard from all my playing friends that knights just win the majority of the games - at least as long as not 3 or 4 players try to go knights and steal each other the units. Which happens quiet often, but is that a way to balance the game?

And now for the new unique addition to the game: Units that are not units! Instead of items, you can get contructs now - target dummies that taunt everyone, healing wards that heal the area around them... and of course th tombstone, which reads: ""If you see a tombstone, pick the tombstone, because in the end, everyone has a tombstone!"" - he revives all dying units and makes them to ghouls. Elementals weep in the corner since their tribe-ability is a joke now compared to this.

The game gets less balanced with each patch. While TFT improves, Underlords seems to try its hardest to somehow differenciate itself from TFT - which is understandable, since TFT has much more success, as it seems. I always liked Underlords better, but... they are ruining what they had. And they make it worse step by step, just to be different, just to have stuff that TFT doesn't. A shame, really, since they had a solid game on their hands before they decided to just change nearly everything and make it a pure RNG-game.

Because that's what it is now: I pretty much start a game, knowing that it is 95% RNG. I play one game. When I win, I do not feel proud because I just anihilated the opponents thanks to luck. If I lose, I feel angry because I feel like I never had a chance against the luck of other players. Tribes are very much unbalanced right now, and that seems to stay this way. If you are searching for an Autochess-Experience, search somewhere else, this game goes in the entirely wrong direction."
15080,"Fun concept. Look up the best synergies and hope you get the RNG. 

The first time you spend an hour getting RNG-shafted, you're gonna close this."
15081,nice
15082,"Only giving this a thumbs up because of the fact it was promising in the beginning. Lately all of the fun mechanics have been removed, albeit they have done some good with balancing issues. The mobile version still sucks somewhat due to performance issues and there are a few mobile versions out there that are quite nice who basically copy this game.  Fun game all things considered but hopefully there are better things to come."
15083,"this game is so boring and simple !..if you want more fun.. just go and play dota2  ,go Arcade..choose Dawn Of War ! and thats x10 better then this thing..dont know how to call it ! you have there all dota2 heroes..and make a team ,buy items etc..and also heroes cast all spells..not like here..one hero with one spell..even a pasive one..lol.."
15084,"Nice game, but still in Early Access with motivated developers."
15085,this is game is so awesome
15086,Vey well balanced and overall great! Hard to win ranked though!
15087,way better than autochess
15088,Very nice
15089,For an early access game it's really fun to play. looking forward.

can't comeback to match after connection return
fix it"

15102,RNG HATES ME !!1!1!!!1111!!!
15103,"[MY ORIGINAL REVIEW - 2018]
The entire game is about rolling the same hero nine times so you can combine them into a three-star version of that hero.  If you do the math, once every six games one guy will get super beefed and destroy everyone.  The rest of the time, you're just hoping for a payout like a fancy slot machine.  Too little strategy for me.  Pass.

[MY NEW REVIEW, FEB 2020]
Having seen advertisements for ""Season One"", I redownloaded and tried again.  Still a giant RNG stressball.  They have added personal heroes which you choose at Round 10 of each match.  These offer little customization and you'll soon learn that there is one personal hero who is the best regardless of the random outcome of your army.  There's also a map that you can travel down.  Even here, the systemic randomness of the game means you can alt-tab out of it and read the newspaper and then come back for the results.  Still pass."
15104,wow they ported a mobile game to pc.
15105,"The game feels too random. One time you are close to first, the next game you are close to last and it feels like it is because of luck or lack of it."
15106,"First of all, this is probably the crappiest and most unbalanced trash game I've ever played. Secondly I play assassins in my last two matches, with a full synergy of 6 assassins, if I managed to crit more than twice it was luck, but with 25% crit chance on 6 fucking assassins it seems merely impossible. This game in it's current state is so fucking unbalanced it's unplayable. I've played more than 100 matches by now and every fucking single time I end up 8th or 7th. Good job Valve, for the probably the crappiest auto chess game I've ever seen. In other auto chess games I manage to win matches on Rook or Bishop ranks, but on this fucking game I can't win a god damn single match nevermind getting top fucking 4!!! 

Uninstalled this piece of crap!!!"
15107,game is fine for now.
15108,"Too addictive. Original auto chess  was good becouse it give you a lot of choices, here choises are limited but everything is super simple. This create very addictive and stupid game with very small creativity needed - just check what you opponenets doing."
15109,nice game
15110,fun
15111,Great game!!
15112,"fun and engaging even though luck is a big part of this game. Still, the mechanics are innovative"
15113,godd
15114,Nice game
15115,"Stop ruining games, you fat fucks."
15116,"RNG is very fishy in this game. Every round i played somebody got a 3 star unit very early, when i just had one or two 2 star units. Reeks of very favorable RNG. Was there some option to pay money in order to get that ""RNG"" ? No fun at all like that.
But seriously, everything is about RNG: what units you get, how each single battle is going down is also pure RNG since you cannot control your fighters. And you have to sit idly around watching either winning or more often loosing a battle due to RNG. Quite boring. Rather play something where you alone control the outcome."
15117,"Nice game, gotta think good tho"
15118,I don't like battle chess but this one caught my eye.
15119,"All I know is I was just meandering down the lane and all of a sudden this game hooked and dragged me into its fountain and I'm not complaining one bit.

15123,i try this game :v
15124,good game
15125,ui IS DUSGUTING if you want autochess dont play this and go play tft
15126,Almost The Same with Chess Rush ;)
15127,Worth. Love the new patch! More challenging to play. Epic!
15128,"I only started playing this game today, so I can say with confidence that the tutorial is a little... lacking. But once you pick up what a few of the symbols and such mean and figure out where you can get information from, this is a very simple to play fun game. I really enjoy it!"
15129,"this game has no tutorial. If you're not already a huge DOTA fan, you will have almost no basis for learning this game and getting better at it. There's no tutorial, no method of figuring out how to play. It's just a mess. What is charming and cute as a mod is unpolished and lazy as a professional release"
15130,"boring game, i cant believe you hold artifact update for this shitty mini-game"
15131,The UI is really bad and unintuitive. I wasn't able to complete the tutorial.
15132,Nice
15133,"[h1]Dota Underlords is the best auto chess game right now and i will tell you why![/h1]

- The game gets patched regularly because the devs are listening to their player base and take feedback seriously

- it has way less RNG than the DAC mod because creep waves will always reward you with 
   items. In DAC lucky item drops can decide the outcome of a game too much

- the matchmaking is balanced and takes no time at all

- you always have feel of progress because of unlockable skins and emotes

- more room for strategies through static defenses and global passives

Try it out for yourself its free!"
15134,8/10
15135,"Game is fun, but can't recommend for PC in its current state.  The client is very unstable and crashes repeatedly throughout the game.  The reconnect function works well, but it is still frustrating and results in a bad experience.  The mobile client is a lot better."
15136,"Well lets talk about random, but take that random in a range of maximum and minimum values. Yes, it is math it can be hard for some players, but it shouldn't be a struggle for game devoloping companies! Here I'm gonna explain.
What's the difference between this game and the Dota? No difference, it's the same Dota with its broken random. Could seem that Underlords is a solo game, you won't struggle, cuz you have no team and everything depends on you. No fuсkin shit!

Here you will take your 5000 points (MMR) during one month, because you will play against the game. From 5k to 6k I couldn't get during one f*ckin month.

That helm will save your opponent's life and turn the match. 

***Also, if there will be only one all-ined player with over-buffed desk, you will play against him every second game in a row. 6 of 20 rounds and be kicked out  from 8th place. 

* I'm sure Valve found out that no need to try hard and make a normal game. They develop a buged 3/10 game, but add mechanics of making gamers addicted throw their emotions after losing. A banal scheme which used to execute with animals and F2P gamers.

15139,"An interesting game which is much deeper and more complex than it first seems. The balance is still in a flux and constantly changing, but this is normal for a competitive game in early access. The only wish is that the combat was a bit faster, and there were more viable class combinations in high rank play. Surprisingly addictive."

15151,"The odd is very low. Not featuring many heroes as well. Getting MMR is very hard because only the top 4 gets it. +15 for top 4 and -15 for losing (whatever the position). It's fun, but it has a lot of buts."
15152,It's a fun game but needs less RNG and better AI.
15153,Game is ok but needs improvements
15154,"fake probability!!!
I hate this game!
"
15155,Great Game
15156,No balance. The new items like totem are complete junk. The game got from promising slowly to complete garbage.
15157,It`s a good game but it have a lot of bugs. I can`t solve problem because of the absence of hero cards visulisation. I try many ways recomended by community but the problem still exists. Help!

15159,"best auto-battler out there, developers are in touch with the community and push for frequent updates"
15160,always crash when i play on laptop
15161,"The game input is almost entirely based on random.
Heroes, items and even opponents are randomly generated.
You basically play a glorified slot machine. It even makes the same sound when you reroll.
The games are long and mostly uneventful. You have no control over anything apart from clicking reroll or upgrade.
And because of all of that, there is no satisfaction from playing. You won? Well, you rolled some cool heroes and managed to make alliances that were good. You lost? Well, your opponent was luckier. Even if there is skill involved, you would never know it since you have no control over any of the inputs.
Some may find this type of game fun, but I feel like I play in a casino rather than an actual game.
I can't understand why Valve after creating skill-based games like tf2, csgo, dota 2 started to make random driven games.
Maybe it's a shift in the market, maybe a new generation likes slot machines more than actual games, but hell I just can't enjoy that.
And the fact that at the time of writing this game has twice fewer players than a 12 yo game with no updates in 2 years speaks a lot about the quality of the core gameplay."
15162,"Not balanced and RNG plays too much of a role in gameplay.
The new items really broke the causal gameplay."
15163,"I'm not sure if the game has enough tactical depth to be a game that you can engage in long-term.  It's fun, well-balanced, and worth a bit of time.

If this game is going to be relevant in the long-haul they will need a way to add some depth to the game, or to speed it up enough that it can succeed in the casual/mobile format
"
15164,I suck at it but it's fun. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
15165,"Good and well designed casual game. Not for competitive play, nothing is balanced and rng plays way too big role. Enjoyable for dozens of hours, but falls off very quickly, although it's free. Still NO for me."
15166,"I currently have 255 hours and I honestly have hit a point where the game is no longer enjoyable. I'm at Big Boss rank and I'm just finding the RNG too unbearable. Heavy loss streaks have also been kicking in so that has also played a factor in my lack of future interest. I did enjoy my prior time during the previous patches, but the new changes are just garbage (alliance shifts, items, aces, blacklisting) and I wont be sticking around to see what becomes of the game outside of Beta."
15167,very good game.  the thing i dont like but what make this game fun is the rng thing. the challenging is you have to adapt the rng thing that deck provide you. but sometime it piss me off to
15168,Fun enough but FAR to many cheaters after Grifter.....FAR too many. One person per game who goes 100 health to the end.....EVERY game.
15169,Game for noob play
15170,One of the reason I play this game because it's the only game that can handle my shitty internet connection .
15171,"Final review edit: unfortunately this game has been COMPLETELY abandoned by Valve. Not worth putting time in to unless you just want to waste time messing around casually.

Almost every patch since the early beta this game has gotten worse and worse. Every patch makes the game either simpler or easier. The use of the Underlords on the board is a good idea but completely breaks the game in terms of strategy.

Go back to the beta or this game is gonna be another Artifact.


Previous review from during BETA:

By far the best implementation of the Auto Chess style game.
People leaving negative reviews because they don't like getting updates... Go fuck yourselves. This is an Early Access game, and it's being made by VALVE! Fucking valve! They are on the subreddit and forums listening to what we are saying and making changes we request! They're also experimenting with new ideas which is HEALTHY!
Way better than TFT, devs actually listen and care."
15172,Another pile of trash forced 50% win rate game crated by valve to encourage gambling.
15173,best AUTO-BATTLER game out there and its constantly getting better. play this and uninstall TFT for god sake
15174,"Artifact died for this pepeHands. I tried to give this game a chance but its not even much of a game this is basically reskinned go fish 15% skill 85% rng, noobs will love this game tho."
15175,很棒的游戏；希望可以尽快更新。
15176,RNG at its finest.
15177,"Very good game! Ignore negative reviews and try it yourself. (It's free anyways...)

Edit: With the new Big Update, I'm definitely addicted."
15178,"Howzit, would say the game is addicted, only really miss the random item drop from auto chess.
Like one item per hero not bad and even better to change items between heroes even greater just wish i could take the basic items and create something beter as game progress

15202,"this game feels like every round is a gameplay altering lootbox, i really wanted to like it, and i actually had fun in the tutorial (which i think might be a first), but then i got into the actual game and realised that strategy either plays much less of a role than i thought it did, or that its extremely unintuitive and complex.

also for the love of christ valve, if you want people to make timed decisions, at least let them see the heroes abilities on mousover during the purchase period."
15203,"Honestly have never played any auto chess games before, and thought they were pretty stupid but this game has changed my view on them quite abit. Mind you I have only played Dota underlords and probably will only play this one..... I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves strategic games I LOVE THIS GAME!"
15204,"Disconnect me every fucking game! Valve, do smth with it"
15205,"game doesnt feel balanced well at this point. the 'career mode' is boring. heck even the skins/ profile pictures you can unlock are boring (you pay for battle pass). its nowhere near as good as hearthstone battlegrounds. the heroes suck. during the early beta stage the game was a lot more enjoyable.

there is also no long-time goal. you just level up the battle pass (omg!!! just add cash-cow in the game description, at least people know what they are in for then). there is no ranking system or smth like that."

15212,one thing Valve and Riot have in common that they really know how to fuck their own product up
15213,Nice
15214,ну вот мне не понравилось:\
15215,"Solid strategy game, with plenty of depth & RNG to keep things interesting. This is a good example of an early access model - free to play, with frequent balance & content updates."
15216,"Great game, for the price (which is free). I think the best description would be a time waster, matches last about 40 rounds (one hour) and it can get tedious in the end. But this game is fun for those who like strategy. this is a good game for those who have a day off, not really something after getting home from work."
15217,After the new patch(2019-08-31) it suddenly started crashing randomly.
15218,"Contraptions? You mean free units with no unit cap that taunt my heroes and absorb damage? In a RNG based game? Hahahaha. Fucking bullshit.

I'm switchting to TeamFight Tactics. Stick this crap game up your arse."
15219,"20gb of Dota 2 is too big for my turtle internet and ant size storage, tried this game to satisfy my dota craving."

15222,;0
15223,"Last update with walls sucks, game lose simplicity and fun and fights become messy and non predictable =("
15224,"It's an auto-battler. You basically gamble, choosing attack or defense patterns. Something you have to understand about this game is that it can be unwinnable. Some games you can't win even if you magically picked the best hand possible with the deck you were given. Some people get 3 stars as early as round 4. Sometimes you can roll 100 times and not get a single unit of what you're looking for.

This game is RNG with logic/tactics placement. 

Good luck, I hate each game I lose because it feels unjustified, but on the flip side winning feels like a long time coming... In the end it's win or lose at the flip of a coin."
15225,GOOD GAME
15226,hhh
15227,Imagine a game that can make you love it and hate it at the same time. That's Dota 2!

15235,"a fun and addictive game. i've lost count how many times i start playing around 12am then quit around 6am without realizing. you don't need skills to be good at this game. just need to plan ahead, learn how to adjust base on heroes you get and last but not least, PRAY THE RNGESUS for he will decide whether you get high tier heroes that might match with your existed ones or not."
15236,Good updates.
15237,_______________________________________________________
15238,"This is a decent game, however what is holding this game back is the graphics. Valve should keep mobile graphics on mobile and allow PC users the option of better more realistic graphics. I mean atleast at the level Dota 2."
15239,shit game
15240,There is nothing better than coming back from work and playing a game of Underlords. Has a lot of depth but doesn't require the dexterity and twitch reflexes of most games.
15241,"Great game, layers upon layers of strategy. A lot of reviewers will say the game has a lot of RNG, however it's about adapting to what you're dealt."
15242,Save yourself some nerves and rather hit the casino if you want rng..

15245,"Great job, they are working on a very good line."
15246,"Worst game ever because valve is shit company, that can't create (even clone) a game"
15247,"As a fan of Dota since its inception as a WCIII custom map, I am filled with nostalgia whenever I play Dota Underlords. And as a now older gamer who currently prefers games that are more laidback, I find Dota Underlords to be just perfect for my cravings. 

Art Direction:
I really appreciate the small details, both in visuals and sound. The butterflies fluttering about and the leaves rustling against the wind add a welcome richness to the environment. And Queen of Pain's sinister laugh whenever she levels up is simply amusing. Please keep adding touches like these to keep the unexpected delight coming.

RNG:
If you are the type of player who can appreciate and cheer for your opponents' ability to use RNG to their benefit (in an equal manner when RNG works in your favor), this game is for you. I feel nothing but respect for my opponent whenever I get outsmarted during the late game phase. And this only became more enjoyable with the new contraptions and Aces mechanic, as they add another layer of clever depth.

Keep up the good work. You have a great product that has amazing potential."
15248,better if you make it simple as autochess

Auto Chess is better in case of balancing :D"
15265,"Fun, but without balancing and new characters/equipment etc... will run out of content fast, becomes chores (repetitive); good for some 15-30 hrs. 

Training against AI is nice - especially the non-timer match, good for studying the game. :-)

Beware of unfairness of the cods of the RNG; especially when looting equipment (sucks bad)."
15266,"[h1]This is going to be a direct comparison to TFT[/h1]

+ is for Underlords, the rest deductible

[code]
+ Easy to see who will synergize with whom
- harder to see whom you might need considering what you have
  which makes me say that
--- tft has better store, easier to react
     closing and opening the store menu is extremely annoying
- in tft you can pick a champion which has an item in the beginning
  and the later stages of the game from the ""carrousel"" which 
  gives more variety to the game.
+ You can choose which items you get from neutral waves, makes it more strategical
+ It's less limiting to manage items (can be seen as a minus)
- You can't see how much gold you will get before the round end
++ You can play against AI

15270,"Addicted af and I like it more than TFT since you can try out new builds against advanced bots

Update in Oct 2019: After playing for nearly 150 hours, I'm done with the game. At the time of the original review, I have only roughly 20 hours. The recent updates have made the game more RNG-based than ever. Or maybe it's just because I climbed up, but I no longer know why I win or why I lose a certain game. It feels like pure luck that depends on whether you can get the units to complete your build or upgrade them as early as possible without messing up econ. Every meta is contested by at least one other person, so don't tell me going for uncontested builds is the key.

As they said, after a certain point, the game feels like 70% RNG again because everyone uses the same strategy.

I still recommend the game because I have 150 hours of playtime. But it needs to be way less RNG-based to be sustainable enough. One way that can fix this is to not punish players with bad luck for losing early rounds so they have significant econ disadvantage than those who are lucky early on and can reroll as many times as they want to complete their build/upgrade their heroes."

15276,"A curious study into how to provide the least amount of player agency while giving players the false sensation that they believe that they're actually being ""strategic"" and making ""smart plays""."
15277,"School has barely started and I'm already hailed as a god.

A little context. I'm not too popular. I'm always that one nerd kid, and the only time people would hear about me is if I won a math competition.

Well this year I changed that.

My school has posters up saying ""We encourage you to use your phones, tablets, and laptops."" The last one is what caught my eye. Because my school allows us to use our devices during lunch.

So I brought my laptop to school. For my first couple classes I would jokingly ask if I could use my laptop. But when lunch came around. Then things got good. I sat down at my normal lunch table and pulled out my laptop. Immediately people started eyeing me. Next I booted up my laptop. Now people were watching. Finally I got onto Dota Underlords and played some ranked matches. I slowly gathered a crowd, and eventually people started chearing when I was winning.

When I won everyone went ballistic.

And that's how I became a god."

15279,"Before I begin, I want to say you should try this game out because I like the premise of it. I will fist talk about what makes it not so good then what I liked about it in the second paragraph. I want to recommend this game, but it is difficult to. The tutorial doesn't teach you how to play the game. It tells you how to buy units, choosing items are a looting round and how to place units on the board, but that is it. It doesn't teach you how to make two- or three-star units or that similar units have bonuses, like warriors or mages. Now, assuming you think the solution to this is to simply research online how to play, that is okay. The lack or explanations aren’t the real problem. More importantly, the multiplayer is the real problem. When you play a match against someone who has won multiple rounds in a row, like 3 or 5, it is because they are extremely lucky and the guy losing is unlucky. While the guy who is on a winning streak has multiple two-star units that cost 3 or more gold, it the loser has multiple copies of 1 gold cost units. So, if you get nothing but bad units 1 gold units, you will lose every time and if you get lucky and get multiple 3 or higher gold units, you will win. I like the premise behind this game, but the “winners” who just were able to create a better board than others early will probably win. 

Now about what I like about this game. I like the premise behind it because it makes the player start from nothing to get ting more and more powerful units to defeat other players through multiple rounds. The idea behind choosing between random units at the end of each round seems like a good idea and I can understand why Valve chose to use it. It creates an atmosphere of mystery because you never know what units the other player you are going to face has which is what I like as well. Dota Underlords also has a lot of potential and I would like to see where Valve takes this game when it releases. I know this is just a beta and they may change the above during the release, which is what I want because I want to recommend this game. I wish this game had more strategy verses luck in the multiplayer, but I would still say you should try it out at least before you make decision because it is worth it, even if you don’t like it.

15280,"I like to imagine a mad scientist's DotA-addled mind created this hellspawn of a game in an underground laboratory. It's some kind of too-weird-to-live Chimera of chess and poker and it will get you addicted faster than opioids and destroy your free time just the same.

Right now, the patches keep coming fast, experimenting feels good and I'm looking to clock in close to 50 hours in my first 5 days."
15281,AMAZING
15282,good game
15283,"Great game, much better then TFT for example. Devs are responsive and do great job in patching. Its also interesting new genra"
15284,That UI needs hella more work. It's like typical Valve maze :D Hot damn!
15285,Pretty gud for free.
15286,"Overall, I give the game a 8/10 in its current state, but this game SERIOUSLY has the potential to be a 10/10.

What the game is missing:
It's missing 1v1. I'm not talking about within the ""mini-tournaments"" themselves, that was already patched in with an August update. I'm talking about TRUE 1V1, where you play this game against just one friend (and 1v1 with one random as well). I don't know how this would be implemented, perhaps one player can run/manage 2-3 sets and whoever crushes all 3 sets first is the winner. However they decide to do it, IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. PERIOD. This game would be a game-changer if you could battle privately with your friends.

Also, in my own honest and personal opinion, 25 seconds for the preparation phase is way too short. I'm not just speaking for myself either, I have seen other players struggle to devise a solid plan with the phase being this short and I feel bad for them too. There should be an option (within Casual Multiplayer) to vote on the preparation time - 25 seconds (Traditional), 45 seconds, and 60 seconds. This gives you a few more seconds to review your roll, spread your buffs out on the right units, level up, re-roll, manage units on the board, sell off units, manage gold, etc. There is A LOT going on, so having a few extra seconds before executing a plan would be EXTREMELY useful and effective for players.

There should also be an option for players to vote on ending the phase, so that way, if all of the players are prepared and there is still time running on the clock, they can all vote to move to the next phase already. This can improve the efficiency of each game's run-time, But ALL the players have to vote to agree on it. We should respect if other players need a little extra time.

This last piece is just me nit-picking, but the little icons for the buffs that go on top of the little icons for the characters over on the right-hand side of the screen are super tiny. It's hard for me to see who has what sometimes. If there was a way to make that look a little better, then that would also be greatly appreciated."

15290,"Incredible fun, lots of depth, very active community, great game :)"
15291,Decent game
15292,game is aids
15293,"Sure, this game has an element of luck, but it's hardly the sole indicator of success. Much like a lot of other games, you will need to put in the hours to figure out how things work, and there can be a bit of a learning curve. I'd say the proof that this isn't ""too RNG dependent"" as some people claim is that you can actually climb the ranks if you put in the time and learn how to make things work for you. All those Big Bosses and Lords didn't get there just because ""they got lucky."" They learned how to read their opponents' boards and adjusted accordingly as the rounds progressed, etc. That to me seems to be a more reliable determinant of success than RNGesus. 

Even though it's still in beta, and even though some patches have been more miss than hit on certain aspects (looking at you, Arc-Maiden Apocalypse -_-), the game has been very enjoyable so far, and even losing just makes me want to play better next time. The Proto-Pass achievements also add to the experience--it's satisfying to finally get certain visual and sound effects. The devs, too, have implemented a lot of suggestions players have given (that I've seen from Reddit), and it's a testament that balance is a continuous process and not necessarily a static end goal, and it makes the game feel fresh when you see those small tweaks. 

Can't wait for Season 1! Looking forward to hero pool rotations!"
15294,very good

15296,"This is a shitty cell phone game

Adding ""Underlords"" was a bad move. I just play this game because its mindless. Adding that much shit to the game ""progress"" just makes me not open it."
15297,"I used to really enjoy this game some patches ago, put quite some time into it. Figuring out cool synergies between units, alliances and items that were really satisfying to pull off and watch. And thus – you were actually able to win games with some skill involved. [i]“Just one more round!”[/i] as you could just relax and watch a video on the side or something.

But now it has become a total crap-shoot. A lot of interesting perks or items have been removed or reworked so that they're only [i]meh[/i]. Same go's for the alliances, which all have been nerfed, to not be more than nice side effects instead of game changers. The rng feels way heavier than in the beginning, so that even when you play the same exact powerful build you figured out for yourself, you can still be knocked out almost last. Because not only the items and units are randomized, the fights feel rng as well. Your most powerful unit [i]could[/i] attack an important target to win the round... Or they simply won't.

Since that one reworking patch some time ago I've been dropping from Lieutenant lvl4 to Lieutenant lvl1 and been stuck there ever since, simply because I keep on getting knocked out almost last for a lot of bullshit reasons. It's simply really unfun when you have a complete team of quite competent units with a 'good' set of alliances and still get steam-rolled for seemingly random reasons."
15298,pretty good i played a bit
15299,Abuse the meta and pray to the RNG gods
15300,hard game.

Actually i'm not doto player, so i dont know anything about this game.

I dont know about the characters, their skills, and their gameplay.

So I just random play and still lose aylmao.

They didnt detailing the tutorials on mobile version, so this game for doto's bigot only.

Actually its a good game..
But not for my taste and its not my genre

And for casual game i just only play it on my phone..
So uum, i will going back to chess rush and play it in my room xD"

15304,fast pase quite good
15305,"Generally liking the game and the ideas but GOD it needs so much less RNG,  had several games where it is impossible to even get decent 2 stared units together because nothing shows up in the shop. Had dozens of games where the loot from randoms is entirely counter productive to the build I am running. 

I get all of this is RNG and there will be times where you feel unlucky but the sheer number of variables that are out of your control makes it luck if you get a good composition going instead of skill. 

I recommend the game because I like the idea but it really needs the RNG trimmed 4/10."
15306,35+ minutes to lose a match.
15307,"game is in its best state right now. any build path  is viable now and in long term skill is higher priority than randomness. there is subtle concepts like blacklisting which lessens RNG aspect . 
this is my 1st auto chess and got me hooked into this genre and made me forget dota 2. the ranked climb is super fun and addictive if u are into these ladder climb. started from smuggler .. now at bb 5 and looking forward to cross the lord barrier. 
devs are always listening and interactive on reddit and discord.
also for people interested there are tons of weekly tourneys for steam wallet prize pool going on to test your skill. 

i suggest give this game a try and give it  a week or so to sink in the mechanics and it will get super addictive and fun. there is lot of learning curve in the start but its all worth it. 

cheers."
15308,"I love it. I am not very good. Floating at the bottom of Smuggler 1. But I still enjoy it. I enjoy watching the YouTube/Streamers for different ways to play.
I highly recommend for those who know how to play auto-chess."

15310,My favorite auto chess so far
15311,"I'm still very annoyed that proto pass rewards were almost entirely removed, but my brother can spectate me and spam ""THAT'S HOT"" via my golden bird statue. That is even better than the that's hot reward. Knockout is wildly unbalanced but duos is a blast to play and plan with someone specially if you have a brother. It's a great coop game, they should be worried if TFT adds a coop mode tho."
15312,"Edit: I like the new underlords system quite a bit, it changes the game up, and the Jail system adds variety in what builds you play daily. It seems like they are working hard to change the RNG system quite a bit... I think my review still stands pretty well. 


It kind of bothers me when people automatically assume a game is a slot machine or casino game because of RNG
But RNG is the cornerstone to most games

Is D&D a slot machine? (Lots of RNG there)
How about Pokemon? (tons of RNG)
And Monopoly? (RNG city)

Good RNG is where decisions matter. Your choices have no bearing over a slot machines odds.
If you think choices dont matter in DU than make random character choices and see where that gets you.....
The game is about good decisions, counter-play, resource management, and learning to roll with the punches.

Yes. Sometimes you will get three Venomancers in the same pull. Yes, you will have 10 re-rolls that dont have anything you need.
And how you work with it separates you from Sub-Par to Lord of White Spire.

RNG does have a skinner box reaction that rewards the pleasure centers in your brain when you hit low/unlikley chances. which is why games like XCOM, MTG, Backgammon, and Yatzee so popular. Its essence is in deck building games and is the main reason why there are several types of pokers and games of chance.

RNG is only harmful when there is a slanted fiscal advantage or predatory monetization practices.

As for the meta. It is hard to get away on a highly competitive metagame. MTG, Most MOBA's, competitive RPGS, and especially chess has a heavy meta. Balancing, champion variation, and creativity will move it around enough to keep interesting. Even reading the guides for the most meta builds I have still seen creative builds beat out everyone else because no-one built to counter something they didnt expect.

Those who learn to pivot hard can beat even the most meta primortal mage build. and even minion spam.

[strike] That being said I am curious to see how underlords system adds to the game.[/strike]"
15313,"Fun, and more strategic than it first appears. Also, it's free to play. What's not to like?"
15314,omg
15315,This game is a delight and everyone should play it always
15316,"The amount of RNG in this game is infuriating at times. 
Want to get a mage lineup? here's everything BUT mages. 
Want to upgrade that one unit you got to 8/9 of the way to tier 3 at round 10? It's round 49 and you're not getting that one last piece. 

I do not recommend this game because of the RNG and by round 20 you can already 99% of the time see who's going to win the game.

They've added some changes, but the same underlying RNG problems exist. 
If you like gambling, you'll like this, but again, I still won't recommend this game because it's addictive for the wrong reasons.
If they somehow fix the ""if you're losing, you'll lose more"" maybe it'll curb the rng factor enough."
15317,"I never got into dota but tried this game out, its sweet and not pay to win. definitely recommend if your looking for something new !
"
15318,"So, i put some hours in the game. The game was exciting af in the beggining and you could see changes and improvements per week. However, these changes not only made the game far worse than it originally was, but also illustrated the incompetance of the developers to adress major issues. Example: u can get 6 knights easily through the game which are the most overpowered units both defensively and aggro. There is no way to counter that without losing. Even if u attempt to counter the knight users, the rest of the players will farm u easily while still losing to knights. Another example, in order to get the assasin buff u ahve to get 9 assasins out of the 10 unites u may have in total. There is no way of reachin 10 units while using assasins as you will lose in the progress by the knight users or other setups far superior than 9 assasins. Who the fuck plays 9 assasins and wins a game? 

The game is faaaaaar from balanced and optimized. Will be uninstalling until these issues are fixed and I will still think about it as even if you play your best, the rng factor is far from fun. The aspect of luck is highlighted not only on the heroe selection and their positioning but the units themselves are so dumb that a level 3 unit may polymorph and auto attack (0 damage done whatsoever with auto attacks by casters) until the get hit from a high level assasin and die like a piece of shit. 

Highly NOT RECOMMENDED. Give it a couple of years and try again. So many good games being launched and remastered so don't waste a minute in this.


Update.

Some issues addressed, some still persist. Its nice to see however when you come back and revisit a game to see changes towards a better experience."
15319,"Us gamers have become lazy. We don't even want to play the game, but just watch as it plays by itself. Casual but strategic. Addictive and fun. Sometimes really frustrating, but you just keep coming back. One more game, one more roll, one more upgrade... Still in early access, but it feels very good already. Really looking forward to the actual release."
15320,GG
15321,Never played its auto-chess earlier version. Tried out this and tried out Team Fight Tactics; felt this game offered more in-depth strategy and was a better designed game. Took me about 200 hours to get to Lord of Whitespire. Yes there is some RNG involved which many people complain about; the fun is discovering and implementing strategies that help increase your odds of winning. Disclaimer: This game takes some time to learn and fully appreciate.
15322,"Layer upon layers of RNG. No matter how you optimize your build base on what you are given, RNG will still be a major factor who will be the winner. When you win, there is almost no sense of achievement because it felt like good luck. When you lose, there is only frustration especially when you had to spend tens of golds to increase your odds even there is no competing alliance in game only to be kicked in the face by RNG while other players causally roll 3 stars heros without trying.

It was made worst when valve introduced round damage but scaled back. I think it should be completely remove.

The game itself is definitely well made. Very good casual game. What made this game addictive is the gambling aspect of RNG."
15323,Decently good game.
15324,"Underlords is an enjoyable distraction for a while, but the game is so crucially hinged on RNG that it eventually becomes tiresome. Winning multiple games straight is less enjoyable than it should be because you know it largely came down to luck, not skill, and losing multiple games straight is frustrating because there's literally nothing you can do to compensate for bad RNG. Game sense and strategy play a part, but all too often luck feels like the ultimate deciding factor of most matches. Read up on strategy all you want, it won't help you when you're dealt no matching heroes for ten straight turns late-game."
15325,The game has big issues that the devs are just ignoring.
15326,100% RNG
15327,Good Enough
15328,The perfect game when you want to take a solid 45 min dump at work
15329,fuck this trash game . still trash after 500hr play time . fucking broken rng .
15330,dis sum rng shit
15331,"Just go troll knights and u will win 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time you will have 3 1-stars units because rng doesnt let u find what u need and u will be against sombody that has like 4 3-stars and u get stomped while ur 1-star unit die by aoe. Pure rng game, no skill involved, no fun since they removed the aliance items, useless item still in-game like forcestaff, just wait till they will charge u money for the proto pass. I spit on this game, as always, Valve manages to destroy a beautiful game like autochess. Nice one."
15332,Artifact was better
15333,I don't understand it but I think its a good game if you can understand its mechanics.
15334,Fun chill game
15335,"want to play to dota but bit relax, this game is so good make me ""play dota again"" :("
15336,This is better than the real Dota
15337,"The AI in this game needs to be improved and not by a small margin. Another suggestion I have is to move the global/class buffs to a certain round(s) instead of random neutral rounds. I mean, IMO, this game would be much better if anything else in this game was as certain as slark + mask. You can always count on that. I get it, it's an rng game but cmon this is a little much."
15338,Fun Game! Lots of tactics
15339,"I don't know if I should review this game as a recommended or no, but having so many trouble with it. And I'm playing using the mobile ver.
I'm never tried DotA2, actually I do but only several hours and I'm not that much enjoy the game. I'm more enjoyable with LoL than DotA2, sorry. And this game seems refers to someone who already understands DotA2 itself, even this game has different mode.
The tutorial is not completely tell HOW to play the game MORE understand.
Play with bots or A.I is hard as hell when it reach high level (or I don't know how to call it), even the difficulty is Beginner or something. 
So I don't know how to review this game, but maybe if something changes in the future and make me or people have same opinion like me understandable the game, I might to change my review."
15340,"I've got alot of hours into this game and i gotta say this game can be so stupid, i had 7 units of the highest tier vs one of his but somehow he manages to win against me anyways because his lvl 3 (slark) is one of the best......."
15341,"I'm not even sure if you can beat the hardest; protopass bot, been at second place for good 7 times.
It doesn't matter how you play, even if you plan it accordingly, you get butt blasted very easily,
some items seem to appear more commonly than others. 
Losing first half doesn't matter, if you can spend the rest of time updating 
your troops or their alliances to the max. It's alright with minor polish, but playing for exp, totally nope."
15342,"I'm new to this genre, but consider me addicted. I've never played DOTA, so it's odd that I chose this one to try first, but I'm glad I did. Yes, the game is basically RNG Simulator, but there are a number of interesting decisions you make throughout a match that allow you to manipulate that RNG. I always feel like the player with the best strategy wins, not the luckiest player. If you're a fan of deckbuilding games, you'll love this, as it's a similar concept. I feel like it's a bit too easy to push for specific ""meta"" builds, rather than being creative with what you're offered, but this may change if the hero pool grows larger.

The tutorial could use some improvements-- for instance, it doesn't even tell you how to upgrade a unit unless you happen to do so. Since the game is deceptively complex, perhaps providing more tools, information, and feedback to the player would help shed the perception that the game relies too much on luck. For example, in bot matches where you play at your own pace, there should be an option to slow down and replay the combat. Maybe there could also be special tutorials or challenges for concepts like positioning and economy.

Overall, Underlords is very polished for an Early Access game. I encountered very few bugs (most of which have been patched during the two weeks I've been playing) and no crashes. The game's relatively balanced, with players going for a variety of builds each match. I've come in first place with many different kinds of builds. Updates come at a rapid-fire pace, and I like that it's 100% free-- rare for an Early Access game. If you're even a little bit curious about this game, I'd say give it a shot. But if you don't check out some outside resources before jumping into a ranked match, you might be in a little over your head."
15343,"Unbalanced, full of unfair mechanics that stop you from winning, full of cheating players that have 9 heroes while you get 5. RNG based upgrade system means you lose simply by a stroke of bad luck."
15344,Pretty easy to get into considering that I have never played Dota. Pretty simple at first look it has multiple layers within it. Very easy to lose a couple of hours and not even realise it. 9/10 after playing for one day.
15345,Reminds me of the Starcraft II map settings game Squadron TD.. addicting.  ME LIKEY

15381,Its a pretty solid game. A lot of people complain about the RNG element saying that its too hard to build or be strategic. From my own experience its not that bad. In general you can build anything you want. The real challenge is getting a few 3 star heroes that matter in your line up. That is where the RNG can be a real pain in the.... Having said that controlling your economy and long term planning can improve your odds of getting what you need drastically.
15382,"Don't waste your time, animations are horrible, the UI is incredibly ugly and it looks like a mobile game.

Go play Teamfight Tactics instead, it's a far superior game and a much better overall experience."
15383,"You will never get what you want when you just need one more hero to make the alliance. Thanks for the algorithm. This game requires more luck than management sometimes. Feel free to reroll anyway, you will not get the hero you want but your opponent whose team is just like you can get everything."
15384,nice
15385,"There's a lot of strategy to be had in this game, but the effort to educate the player really sucks. It can take a long time for a beginner to player to understand ways they can alter their strategy to succeed, which is ultimately very frustrating. A lot of people gripe about RNG being the whole game, and while I don't agree, I can see exactly why they'd be annoyed enough to think they have so little control or thought to put in. Everything this game should be telling you can only be found on google and youtube.

What you DO get, however, is what leads to so many people review bombing this game, and that's the incredibly irritating myriad of factors in the game beyond your control. I can understand stuff like unit drafting, because the randomness there and reading the pool of available units is a core part of the game (in fact, that basically is the entire game). But I still can't understand why some mechanics from DAC survived into this game and in some cases were worsened.

The most egregious offender is the pairing for who you fight each round. This is not a round robin and the only hard rule is that you can't fight the same player twice in a row. It's incredibly annoying to get paired against the same 3 people repeatedly and finally just build a lineup to counter them only to not fight them for the next 5-10 rounds. Or to bounce back and forth between the player in first and the player in last multiple times in a row, so you can't rack up the gold for either a win or a loss streak. 

Worse yet is that sometimes when the player count gets uneven, you fight a ""ghost"" of a player, wherein they attack with their units but if you win, they take no damage,  which is because the fight they're actually invested in is with another player. It's a particular kind of frustrating when you could have secured yourself a place in the top 3 by knocking a player out, but you were randomly selected to fight the ghost this time around, so you do no damage, then die next round without making top 3.

Finally, the controls and UI need some love, at least on PC. This is supposed to be mobile friendly, I guess, but some things just aren't going good with a keyboard and mouse. If you wanna do something basic like look at a unit's stats in the store, you're just screwed."
15386,"nice game
valve please advertise it more so there's a bigger playerbase"
15387,"Really great game. Fun, free and easily accessible. Weekly updates and committed devs.

Current game modes:
STANDARD - your regular game of underlords, 8 players, you slowly build your team and win. 
DUOS - like standard, but with a partner. 
KNOCKOUT - fast mode (5 to 10 minute games). This is more whacky, for fun mode. 

10/10 strongly recommend"

15393,Better than TFT
15394,"Sadly, but there is little strategy in this game... It's like 90% RNG and luck.

You can have best team or build, but without luck you are done.

Or you can have dumb team with 3 star characters and win.

It's like poker"

15399,"This game is way better than dota lmao 
Also I'm big noob!"
15400,awesome game
15401,"extream rng that lessens your chances the more you have of one unit, giving you an abundance of ones you dont want and making it impossible to get the one you want, then they weight 3 star units to heavy, its almost like getting an additional unit on the field, meaning the ones that is lucky enough to get 3 star units and multiple on top of that always wins. i usually get 1-2 3 star units and the winner seam to always be the one that gets 3-4 of them. ""your just a scrub"" yea because resetting 20 times in a row without getting the last unit i need must mean im just bad."
15402,"People downvoting this game just because it's heavily RNG based are just nuts.... what do you expect from a game where you draw cards and put them on a board??? This game is not dota if you are expecting that. This is completely different genre, and most card based games have RNG as their core . If you find that aspect frustrating then dont play the game..Plain and simple"
15403,"Yes Casino, but Casino is fun."
15404,"The game is so balanced at this point, we can literally win with any build. Devs are listening to all the suggestion made by the community and hope they continue to do so. Really fun atm."
15405,"The game sucks now period!!! the game was amazing a good casual exp but this new update is so bad. 


Change it back ASAP this new hero system is garbage"
15406,"Absolutely amazing. It's super fun, well made and pretty balanced. Hands down the best autochess game."
15407,"Love the game, a rng risk management strategy game. It's relaxing at first and than to the end very adrenaline rush. Also love how they have been updating the game to keep it fresh and working. And even a new game mode now. Great Jobs guys."
15408,"Dota [strike]Auto-Chess[/strike] Underlords has its own uniqueness apart from its kind that can keep the player retention rate.

ok Valve. time to make something else besides Dota related."
15418,fun la
15419,Came back a little over a month ago. Game crashes more often now. Also rng seems to be worse now as the majority of matches are determined by who can get the most 3* units. At the end of the day the game feels more like something that valve thought would be cool but gave up on.
15420,"This game is boring. After 6h of play I have enough. I understand that the game is in beta, but any future updated will not change the game play dramatically. The mechanics will not change, so you will be looking for the same heroes and alliances, trying to save some gold.

But after entering the mouth, the bulb clamps to the mouth due to The Shape of the bulb and the arrangement of the teeth. and it causes the jaw muscles to rivet, which makes it impossible to remove the bulb.

15451,Is good but needs better UI u should play tft instead! Noob game
15452,"This game picks 2 players at the start of every game and gives them the ""luck"" leaving the other 6 to fight for 3rd place. And guess what? Thats not even the worst part about this game. The worst part is the perks given to the different classes. I've played every build i can, one of my favorites is the Assassins build, one round you will see the screen light up with critical hits(The assassins perk), and the following round. 9 atleast 2 star assassins will get beat by five 2 star knights and three 1 star warlocks. Why? How? Because the game decides that round you dont have any luck, so no critical hits and no chance of winning. The next round you can beat the same guy and do 15 points of damage. With absolutely no difference to the builds. And for that reason. I wont recommend this game and infact i have uninstalled this game."
15453,"A fun diversion, sometimes you can spend hours on it unintentionally.

It's not as RNG based as people would have you believe, everything is minute to minute decision making, and strong awareness. Learning counters, learning to be flexible, and utilizing tactics will carry you far. I enjoy Underlords quite a bit, but if you're the type to get upset at games, you may find it too frustrating for it to be truly enjoyable.

Definitely less RNG than Hearthstone. 

Have a good one."

15461,...
15462,I wish the game explained the ins and outs a bit more. You get screwed as a new player pretty quickly. Addictive but not rewarding.
15463,"I personally really enjoy Dota 2 Underlords more than I did Auto Chess. There’s a lot more that Valve has done with the game than simply taking the original concept and streamlining it. They’ve made the U/I more accessible (thank goodness they removed that blasted courier!). The game itself isn’t too different and the meta is relatively the same, but what remains is a chess-like game that reflects the MOBA we’ve all come to enjoy. After all – enjoying a good mod is what the Dota 2 community was built on."
15464,"Excellent game. It takes at least 20 hours to properly understand the mechanics, alliances, and hero abilities, so don't judge the game too quickly. I enjoy the game a lot more now.

+Dota universe
+Polished UI
+High skill ceiling
+Huge community (50-60k peak players)
+Battlepass/cosmetics
+Replayability is high 

-Frustrating initially b/c it's complex 
-Tutorial is too short
-Cosmetics limited in beta
-Having to wait for Season 1!"
15465,its all about knowing how to use your ressources smartly i love this game
15466,nice

If you're into Auto-Chess this game is top tier in terms of quality.

15479,Make Valve Great Again.
15480,"The game has some good strategy. But the key part is it takes too long.
And when you are losing you know you are losing.
The RNG is a big killer.
Its becomes boring quickly due to the fact that you know you are playing a losing game and there is no fed baunty hunter that can oneshot them all and carry you to victory.
The game to be fun and emotional you need to learn from league of legends. Skill vs skill outplays etc.
Show me that the 8th can kill the 1st and you will get me on your side till then.
PEACE SUCKERZZZZZZZZzzzz."
15481,Put a random heroes and winning. 11/10 would recommend
15482,"A lackluster tutorial doesn't really help you learn any of the supposed combination of pieces you're supposed to use, nor does anything really feel balanced when you use it. You either curb stomp someone throughout the game, or you're the one getting curb stomped yourself once they're eliminated. In the event you do lose a round (which there's usually 40 of that feel like they take forever), it unexpectedly starts an avalanche where you continue to lose, since you not only lack the gold to upgrade the pieces you do have, but you also don't get enough experience within the match to level up and use more of them. You can have all sorts of fully leveled pieces, but if you're short on numbers, you're done for. The actual experience you get to level your profile is also greedily kept away from you, so have fun slogging through your first five or so matches before getting anything to customize yourself with."
15483,"Yes, RNG can be a factor in deciding games, but when you get to the point of understanding how to play the game, you dont need to rely on RNG that much because you learn to adapt in many situations and make more decisive decisions in terms of what units to buy for you composition and when to ALL IN.

As of right now I can say that this is a great game which rewards good decision making, although I do feel this game needs constant patches/ unit changes every 2 weeks or so because once the meta gets found, it does occassionaly get tilting playing vs somebody brainlessly forcing a broken comp, *cough* brawny *cough* knights *cough* mages."
15484,"Matches take way, way, way too long. They need to be 1/3 the length."
15485,"Supposed to be a strategy game, But is 100% based on RNG. 

One game you get lucky and can have a 3 star Tiny and a 2 star Bloodseeker 7 rounds in, the next you have no synergies, no doubles you need, and the worst items for your team, Not to mention there is always one player who pubstomps with a 0 synergy team just because they got the lucky enough to draw several duplicates and have 3-4 three star units very early on."
15486,Good game to spend some time.

15489,"This is a great game,better then artifact for sure,but can you make the hero more visable when they are upgraded like put some shining stuff such like immortal item or something,not just putting some bigger sword or some stars on it,so we can see it clearly if our hero get upgraded and it can be our pleasure to see our hero get more shining like on Auto Chess"
15490,"UI is a huge mess, matches take forever to finish, really boring game"
15491,"Fun for awhile until you realize that every patch drastically changes the game to the point where it is so unbalanced that everyone spams the same hero and builds because that is the only way to win. Also, why does Razor use his ability when no one is around him? I think the heros need better coding."
15492,Great game it requires almost 0 skill when you get to know the builds. Its like playing the lottery with a little bit higher chances of wining. Pure waste of time.
15493,"Good Game, but very complex and needs a lot of practice time to get good. So, if you don't mind a couple of teammates getting mad at you for the first few games then you are good. I would also advise that you go vs bot to start. Good game though. I like that all the heroes are free to play, it makes the game balanced. All in all, it is a good free to play the game, but it can be a very competitive community, so watch out!!!"
15494,in beta
15495,"DOG GAME IF RNG

BEST GAME IF CHICKEN DINNER"
15496,It's my first autochess. At first I thought I will play this for the few days and then forget about it's existence but devs keep adding so much and so often that I enjoy it to this moment. I like that meta is constantly adjusted.
15497,"This game overall is good, easy to play, good!"
15498,what a steaming pile of RNG junk
15499,shit
15500,no
15501,"Terrible game that's fairly hard to recommend. At best you should maybe try it and come to your own conclusion but after playing a few dozen hours I can definitively say that you'd be better served playing anything else. There's no substance to be found here.

They've added some content as of the time of when this review was written. They added the proto pass which is a progression based reward system where you unlock cosmetics to equip that affect the board. They give you various methods to gain xp towards the proto pass via the dailies, the limited achievement system, and through playing games in general. Casual multiplayer was also added recently if you want to play vs players but don't want to play ranked. It is also a requirement now for ranked that you play 5 casual before you can play it (unless you've played ranked before this patch).

To talk about how the game functions, you get a set of heroes in your shop (each player gets their own pool of heroes to pick from from a larger pool that everyone shares) and you purchase heroes to add them to your bench which then you can add them to the board. You can pay gold to reroll the heroes in the shop, which then gives you a new lineup of heroes to purchase. When you buy 3 of the same hero, it creates a 2 star hero. When you buy 9 of the same hero, it creates a 3 star hero. Each hero has a tier which represents their cost and their availability/frequency that they'll be in the shop and 2-3 attributes called alliances where when you have a number of heroes with matching attributes you can get bonuses affiliated with that alliance. During the purchasing round, if you have any items, you can equip them during this period and it will be used in the next battle. If you equip it after this period, it will not influence the board until the next battle. After the purchasing round ends, your lineup of heroes fights (picked at random) an opponent's lineup of heroes on the opposite board. The loser takes damage per level (star) of each hero plus an additional amount depending on the round. Each player starts with 100 health and last one to survive is the winner.

After explaining the general idea, what makes this game aggrivating is how it's built around a high amount of variance that at the end of the day is essentially a huge lottery mostly out of your control. A lot of these elements come together to give you the illusion there is skillful play but it mostly comes down to what you roll and what appears available to you and mostly your purchasing decisions based on what you see. Generally speaking, ideally you should be looking at what other people are building and then build something that no one else is building since the availabilty for an individual hero is limited. Say there are 25 Juggernauts within the overall hero pool, if 2-3 people are trying to build him, then the likelihood you will see enough copies to make a 2 star or 3 star Juggernaut will be diminished since the supply will be strained by the other players who want to build him. With that in mind, you should not build him. The problem is depending on when this occurs in the game, it may be hard or impossible to change your purchase strategy depending on whether you need juggernaut or not, thus losing you the game potentially. It would be easier to mitigate if the alliances and heroes were closer in balance, but as is there's a general issue of balance that destroys the viability of certain strategies which limits the pool of viability.

One of the worst aspects is the combat in general. Combat is completely ai controlled and the ai is really poor in terms of decision making, for which there is none (at least sometimes, most notably when the ai spazzes out and can't figure out who to fight and does nothing). So victory can sometimes be completely dependent on how your ai happens to play out vs their ai. Placement can mitigate to some degree some of the ai's mediocrity but you'll still lose some battles due to how inept the ai functions. There's not a lot of depth to combat, heroes generally only have 1 active skill each and may have a passive skill so they work fairly linearly for the most part. On top of that, with the recent change where you take additional round damage based on the round, you take too much damage if you lose. It was done (I think) in part to speed up the game for the mobile market since games can take upwards of 30 mins plus. This is completely the wrong approach if you wanted to make the game faster and tells me that they're unaware of what people enjoy about the game.  

As a package, it's what makes it fairly hard to get 1st consistently in the auto-chess genre of game. It's generally considered a ""win"" if you fall in the top 3 places in the game, which I think is ridiculous. It's hard to get 1st in a game with a lack of agency on the player's part. The experience is like gambling without the reward and satisfaction from winning. They've been slowly improving the game with each patch. With that said, I'm afraid because of the inherent design of the game, this game can't be good due to design around mobile and you'll always be susceptible to various elements out of your control, just like dota. Unlike dota though, there's no mechanical skill to differentiate player ability, so the game is really made for people who like the aesthetic and ideas of dota but aren't interested in actually playing and learning dota (or maybe people who are taking a break and want something simple to play).

Realistically it's about as fun as playing with a slot machine. At least with a slot machine though, it doesn't take a couple hours to know you're being rused. You pull the lever, here some noises, see you don't win and walk away. Read this to save yourself from wasting your own time."
15502,"It wasn't worth my time. If you decide to try it, consider if it's worth yours. It just wasn't fun."
15503,good
15504,Worse than auto chess in everyway
15505,"this like a chess , but dota heroes!"
15506,"NIce game
"
15507,"Updated to recommended for now because it's free so if you want to waste your time there are much worse games to play. Notes:
- addictive, time consuming
- winning, in my slim experience of it, equals 'I made some good choices and I also got lucky'. It does not feel like there is enough room for creative strategy
- Sure my heroes all have really cool powers but the fast automatic play-out of matches is hard to properly consume with the eyes and brain
- It might be more fun if I could play fewer battles with more control over the moves of the heroes. If they added a different paced manual mode, or a feature where you could choose the path of each hero before the fight, anything like that, I might recommend this game
- the luck / skill trade off reminds me of Rummy 500. You choose which paths you are not going to follow as far as which cards you are going to try to match up, and you suffer the consequences as later cards are revealed.
- I do still think that team building / hero combining element is fun, satisfying even
- There is a lot of room to make the game more interesting strategy-wise but don't listen to the  100% RNG reviews, there is strategy involved in money management and being dynamic with who you choose on your team, positioning, etc"
15508,"if i wanted to watch a game play itself, i would go watch literally any lets-play on youtube. pass on this game entirely."

15516,RNG is so bad it's easier to find a girlfriend in real life than the last missing unit for finishing three stars.
15517,dota underlords is missing from my library
15518,"Geez...i thought i thumb down this, forgot to change that, oh well..might as well change my review.

...RNG

the game will let you have win streak for 25-30 rounds and after that the system decide to fvck up your deck with useless list, and the enemies get a comeback win.

but,
10/10 will play again because its free"

15520,So far so good this game we can play this game isnt only on pc
15521,"I. Love. This. Game.

It scratches an itch that I used to deal with by playing Magic the Gathering sealed deck. 

You get dealt random components and have to make the best of them. You can't plan on what you are going to get. You have some influence and some resources at your disposal, but you have to make tough decisions while playing this game, and the wrong decision will make all the difference between finishing in the top three and finishing in the bottom three.

It's also friendly to an old gamer like me. I can't play these shooter games online because I have just never had the hand eye co-ordination. This game is entirely tactical and decision based. Choose your units, put them on the board. Sell off excess units. Do you take life damage and try to hoard gold or do you spend early and pray it pays off. Do you go for knights or warlocks or trolls? 

On top of everything else, the interface is amazing! The units are highly detailed and evolve as you power them up. Everything looks great and is easy to work with. It's fantastic.

Also, it's FREE. As in no money. Completely 100% free to play.

How can you go wrong? Download it and play already!"
15522,The first time I loaded up this game it crashed instantly. Thanks Valve.
15523,UNDERSHIT DOTA BATTLE PASS CONTENT WAS DELAYED FOR THIS SHIT HIRE MORE JANITORS VOLVO
15524,Turd.
15525,not bad
15526,I think there should be more areas to be strategic. Some games i've played if you need to force the meta it won't work out the best.
15527,Very Fun Auto chess game. The game is incredibly balanced right now due to a very active and responsive development team. I have never seen a game push out tweaks and updates like this before.
15528,Learning curve is a little steep at first but quickly becomes manageable.
15529,"Well designed, balance patches making it more fun. I think it's gonna be a great game when all is said and done."
15530,"DONT PLAY THIS STUPID GAME, SCRIPTED AS FUCK WHEN YOU WIN LAST GAME 100% YOU WILL LOSE ON THE NEXT ONE BECAUSE THE RNG WILL BE FAVORED TO THE ENEMIES.. BETTER PLAY DOTA AUTO CHESS I AM NOT ALREADY PLAYING THIS GAME AND I WENT BACK TO AUTO CHESS BECAUSE THAT ONE IS A PURE FAIR RNG GAME... TOTAL RIP OFF OF THE DOTA AUTO CHESS,,, FUCK U VALVE AND YOU SHITTY RIP OFF GAMES!!!"
15531,"Although some say it's impossible i managed to drop rank from lords. I am guessing there is no support available to fix it, right?"
15532,"Could use better graphics but otherwise pretty awesome game.

Edit: Game has been abandoned. Devs are incompetent."
15533,Dogsh$it RNG game
15534,"You are 0 in this game, game decides you win or lose.... 

Round 6: enemy has 4x - two star units
                me - 1

Round 14: enemy has - 2x - three star units
                  me - 0

Plus match duration is too long for such game... it should be from 5 to 10 min max"
15535,"I can't recommend this game. I've been playing a couple weeks on and off and the balance issues keep getting worse. Games last too long, somehow people with really weak teams stay in the game until round 30, despite the fact that people should be eliminated much sooner. Even the rounds themselves last too long. I get it, it's early access, but there are bugs everywhere now where there used to be none. I think there was a good concept here somewhere, but it's almost completely gone. 3/10."
15536,OSOM GAME.
15537,"New patch seems more balanced. A lot of added extras, achievements, daily quests, rank/unranked multiplayer."
15538,"good
make it easy cause android can playing this game"
15539,"Mobile game. If it was like battle arena in Heroes 3 it would work. Like this, its not fun at all."
15540,"Not worth getting into the game at the moment. It might get better when they release it, but after almost half of an year in beta UL just got worse."
15541,"Nice game of making most out of randomness thrown at you. Hire guys, build up synergies between them and counter opponent's lineups.
Often updated and responsive devs. Game is improving in very good direction."
15542,"I can only describe this game as incredibly boring. The tutorial took me well over 40 minutes and even though I think I came close to finishing it, I can only imagine how drawn out on-line games will be.

I'd compare this game to Minion Masters except that this game requires even less interaction from the player. You can't do anything once battle commences which means you're even more at the mercy of the AI and random rolls. One thing it does do right is allowing you to see what you're going to be up against, allowing for a little more strategy in that department. 

It does solve a problem that Minion Masters has: it doesn't have any pay-to-win heroes and cards so everyone can at any time (assuming the RNG will let them) apply any strategy they wish making it truly not pay-to-win. They also have no vested interest in making newly introduced heroes over-powered in order to boost sales. That's a good thing.

By now I have tried the game several more times and even tried one game against real people but I found myself not knowing how to play the game because the tutorial doesn't actually teach you how to play the game! I had no idea you were supposed to buy units several times in order to upgrade them. Would have been nice if it was mentioned at the start or something seeing as how it is the ONLY way to win the game.

The overall feeling I get from the game is that it just drags on and on and that winning doesn't give me any satisfaction (nor does losing make me feel bad) because you simply have no real control over what happens. The key to winning is knowing exactly what each and every unit does, rolling the right units so you can upgrade them (which is almost completely random, only influenced by whether or not your opponents have already taken a unit out of the shared pool and whether or not Gaben has passed gas that morning yet).

I suppose it's a lot like chess in that you have to learn each and every strategy known to man and hope your opponent doesn't know a particular strategy or mistakes one strategy for another and makes the wrong move as a result while hoping the AI and RNG is on your side.\

It's got potential but it's just incredibly boring to me right now. There is barely any communication with other players and no way to play in a team. Is that the future of gaming? Being stuck in your own little echo-chamber? Might as well play Solitaire."
15543,"it's like a slot machine

you mostly get crap, but you keep playing."
15544,i love rng
15545,"Quite boring.

You put some bots on a bored and watch them fight.

Also 20 mins into my first game and it was still going. Maybe I should give it another go but not it wasnt a great first impression"
15546,"Fresh and smart game. Did not think I would get hooked, but here I am 100 hours in :D"
15547,"The new UI is questionable (and the Underlords need to get gagged), but the expanded, post-Big-Patch game is suddenly very interesting and involved. Great for passing the time and tweaking. The Underlord brings a nice twist to the autobattler scheme."
15548,"Lots of fun, addicting."

15559,"No, thanks..."
15560,[h1]this is a good game yes[/h1]
15561,this game is pretty good man
15562,"wow, really?"
15563,"It's free.  Worth a try.  One of the biggest complaints in the negative reviews is rng and this game is rng heavy but in some ways that is what is fun.  When you get bad rolls try to finish in 4th place instead of first.  

Outside of that I like that we have a new genre of gaming in autochess.  It seems rare these days to find something original.  I'm not sure when autochess style games started, but it has a nice concept.  It's a nice tactical but stress free game."
15564,Waste of time
15565,RNG BLESS ME PLEASE
15566,"This game is fantastic - if you like card games or strategy games this would be up your alley. I have played quite a lot of Teamfight Tactics and Underlords and after the latest updates, I have to say Underlords is the better game. More complete, polished, balanced and feels like there is less RNG.

Looking forward to seeing what they add to this in future!"

15568,bruh moment

15574,"The WORST GAME EVER !
only LUCKY GAME !

A well-furnished slot machine.

With strategy and thinking, you can get into the top half of the players each match. But in the end, it mostly boils down to that 5-hero slot machine luck. If a side gets their 3-stars fast, they get a massive advantage.

It takes too long to finish a match. They need to pace up the game, as it gets more and more frustrating with each passing round as you are not able to get that needed 3rd hero to upgrade"
15575,very esketit
15576,"Pure RNG at every point in the game.  If you like playing rock paper scissors without being able to choose, this game is for you.   You  trying to draw 3 cards of rock/paper/scissors, and you will be unable to adjust your strategy in any meaningful way past the first 3 rounds.  my recommendation is go play something else.  I really did give it a shot btw :)

Happy Gaming"
15577,Game's fun
15578,Addictive... stay away... or don't.
15579,"Pros:
-Theory-crafting!
-gold management
-item and build synergy
-finding an underdrafted archetype and smashing face.

Cons:

-sometimes feels like monopoly, your opponent got Mayfair and Parklane (*** star heroes and ultimate alliance combos) , while you didn't even complete any of your hotels, plus...
-still some major issues with balance, so it is massively RNG heavy at times. e.g.,
your opponent get ** /*** terrorblade and build around  :((, you literally can't do anything but watch your entire team get wiped, or, he get *** star Shadow Fiend with blink dagger plus warlock, blink into your entire team, tank damage, then cast enormous AoE to heal back to full health, so all your units are still focussed on him, while the rest of his team wails on you, very imba combo.  Also imba: *** Tiny with bloodlust/ upgraded bloodseeker with Helm of the Undying, or facing a focussed mages full alliance team with minimal magic resistance (watch your entire team get shredded to their spells in seconds!)
 
-still not enough variety in units  and alliance combinations. if you are drafting the same build as two or even one other player, prepare to miss out on fully upgraded units. For this reason, it can also feel samey some games.  (""oh great, i'm going scrappy again, yay I look for same exact units).

-also, I find it a bit frantic late game to roll fast, readjust items, prepare build, get new units into team, decide who to take out of your roster,etc..all within about 30seconds.  I have lost so manhy rounds just to not having enough time to prepare based on above changes.  A little more time in maybe one round in 5, say, after you fight the creeps, to give a full minute to readjust build and new item, would be appreciated.

I understand this game in development still, but since the Cons outweigh the Pros for me at the moment, I cannot at this time recommend it, even though i love the principle.

EDit: since playing the game awhile (half of those hours are just afk fyi), its nice to some some new units, some new alliances.  Game feels like it can have some nice balance with choosing undrafted archetypes and builds, even creating new builds.  And the jail idea feels unique.

However, the biggest thing that the major update seemed to not address, and if anythning, make worse, was the frantic pace of the game at times.  There is simply not enough time to reroll, reposition your army, choose, and add new item after creep round.  It feels sometimes like I am holding my breath to do all these things, and personally, I do not want that from a strategy game.   Especilaly in the rounds at 25+, when a single wrong decision or unit placement can mean the difference between winning or getting crushed by 10. 

\The game is also more intense now.  If you do not keep updating your army / level, you just get left behind, and eliminated by round 20-25.  There used to be a strategy with losing streak, and even that does not viable now.

Finally, the synergy between your underlord, and the alliance you pick, seems random, and if many others have the same idea, you are all going to be fighting for the same units.  Similarly, if I pick knights for example, but have Hogben, I will wish I had Annie instead, especially if I go healers / warlocks.  Even Hogben with focussed Super-charge and damage reduction does not wreck house as well as Annie with her healing and insane regen for high-level knights.

I wish I could explain it better, I want to give this game a recommended for its nice updates and theory-crafting and so many things, but the above flaws still prevent me from doing that."
15580,"The most enjoyable and balanced of the new auto chess variants. My only complaint is the tutorial - it doesn't adequately explain what or how interest, win/loss streaks, and shared hero pools work."
15581,interesting concept had more than i expected

15587,"I dropped a Hero,
that dropped a player,
while dropping a deuce,
then dropped my phone.

Learned that an IP68 rating allows for protection against a mixture of solids and liquids.

Gameplay is pretty good.
"
15588,"This game is actually better than what I expected. It's not a pay to win and the things you earn in the game are strictly cosmetic. Yes there's a little RNG in there, but you can make use of it when planning out more strategically. I especially enjoy that you can personalize your board, banner and game effects as well as view the ones others have earned. So far a step in the right direction."
15589,Epic !
15590,"Great game. Don't let babies who hate RNG of any aspect, or people with poor management of economy, tell you that its just an ""RNG gambling simulator"". Its not, there is a lot to learn, and realistically each section of the game is predictable."
15591,good game
15592,"It is really random, you cant do anything if you cant manage to put at least 2* units. I had like 8 matches when i cant do anything and it is all about luck, especially when all your units picks different targets. I had several time first round with 3 same cards and couldnt do anything"
15593,RNG
15594,"Very nice
"
15595,"interesting premise, DOTA Underlords runs quite well with only minor bugs found during the Beta..
but interesting as it was, it's all based around DEVELOPER METAS and not PLAYER CHOICES.
so if you want to play an actual game, i'd skip this.

IF you like copy-pasta-cookie-cutter-STRATEGY, and NO REAL VARIETY or impactful decision making, then you should give this game a shot.

(I had fun for about 16hrs, before learning for sure this is a META-woaring game)

Translation: you'll only win if you copy-cat a developers current guide.

0 chance of winning with your own strats. RNG and Skill BOTH mean nothing in UNDERLOAD"
15596,Not bad
15597,"This game has completely taken over my life. I literally cannot wait to get home to play it every day.  I've stopped answering the phone and given up all semblance of a social life.  But hey, I hit Boss tonight, and now Big Boss awaits.  10/10, would choose over friends."
15598,"An RNG time sink. 

And that's all, folks !"
15599,"Yep. 

Get it."
15600,"Would love to recommend but it constantly crashes around round 20. It used to be around 50/50 if I could complete a game or not but now it crashes about 100% of the time.

We have had multiple patches since this review, for a while there I stopped crashing and it was great, but either the Juggernaut patch or the patch before the crashing came back.

EDIT: The crashing has now been fixed for some time and I think the game is in a good place."
15601,"I like this game better than teamfight tactics from leauge. I think the negative reviews dont understand the strategy involved in this game. You have to balance economy and unit upgrades and item management. I seriously love it! More updates please, just needs more content."
15602,"Do you want to play a game where your decisions matter?
Where you can learn, train the fundamentals and grow stronger?
Where you feel like the best player in the server will win 9/10 times?

Then play literally anything else. This game picks the worst of RNG games, but without any of the fun. 

In card games, despite all the obnoxious meta and stupid draws, you still can build your deck, and read your opponents deck, there is a degree of control in there, a degree of personality customizing your own deck and tech cards.

Here, you have all the RNG in the world, but your degree of control is almost non-existent. 

The units are the same for everyone and just randonly distributed, you need to built your build the way the game is ""[i]selling[/i]"" to you at that moment, or try to make a build you enjoy and get rekt by not having the right pieces.

[spoiler]  And also like in card games, some compositions just dominate the game to a point you NEED them to achieve some win, while others are harmless even if you max them out. [/spoiler] 

On top of that, [b] the game doesn't even bother to teach you anything. [/b]

It doesn't teach anywhere that some classes are bulkier and should be the frontline, where others are pure support, it literally doesn't even imply anywhere that.

So it just takes a lot of unecessary painful trial-and-error to figure out which classes are for what purposes unless you read a guide online, something it should be already taught in-game, since if you don't follow the Frontline x Backline composition you pretty much already lost.

Same thing with placements, gold management, synergy between classes, win streaks and lose streaks.

The absolute worst that made me sure to unnistall was:

[i][b] Even if you care to learn and master those things, you will still lose. [/b] [/i]

Thats it.

Someone with a nutty hand or your bad hand, will be the final deciding factor for who wins

And when you say this to some Dota UL fanboy they just say ""[i] well you gotta play for the fourth-second place [/i]"" 

When my friends who tried out before me, all said that: ""[i] the game plays itself [/i]"" ""[i] its a lootbox simulator [/i]"" ""[i] its a mobile game filler [/i]"" I thought they were just salty or didn't get the game, because I couldn't understand how this auto chess format that is so popular suddenly, could be so braindead.

But it actually is.

So, if you just want to burn time by clicking pretty icons for a hour or so, and get that dopamine fix from getting a stupid good hand that gives you undeserved free wins, this game is great for you. 

However, if you want competition, control and skill, don't waste your time."
15603,Actually good and very addictive
15604,Randomly freezes/crashes like how the game is based on RNG. STUPID GAME END
15605,"This game was fucking ruined by the big update, went from a 9/10 game to a 1/10 game. 

Garbage UI, an underlords system that makes no sense in an autobattler game, removal of flavor and unique systems (like replacing the old UI with generic mobile garbage or the race/class system being changed to alliances) and balance, rather than being improved, has continued to languish in the same state for months. Remember in the early days when we laughed at knights for being the same cookiecutter build every single game? Guess what, now every single build is like that, there's no diversity, flex pieces, or anything of actual strategic value outside of picking one of three meta builds and forcing it.

Not to mention, the devs have stopped listening to any comments or suggestions by ""top"" players, and if you try and make a statement about how the game has gone downhill the redditeurs stop drooling to say either ""b-b-b-b-b-b-ut the game is still in beta!"" or ""if you want the game to return to auto chess go play the epic games one, valve is simply putting their own spin on it!"" like they lack the mental capacity to actually come up with a response to any criticism. 

I was top 500 lord before the big update and played 3+ hours every single day after work, nowadays this game lies untouched because the devs have managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in one of the most stunning displays of incompetence I've ever seen.

At this point, I'm honestly surprised that Valve hasn't taken this game out back behind the shed like they did with artifact. At the rate it's going, we should expect this sometime soon."
15606,"The game has gotten a lot better since the original early access release. Removing Alliance items made matches less dependent on single big RNG swings, and balance has been steadily improving. It definitely feels like they're getting closer to finding a good balance between randomness and strategy.

It's a good time!"
15607,"Best of the auto chess variants out so far!  Constant updates with clear feedback from the devs, and the game's in a great place even if it's still a beta."
15608,"Just play drodo's auto chess, its more balanced and requires more skill than underlords pure rng."
15609,"People say this game is about RNG, tbh I do not agree. 

If this is RNG then it's (almost) impossible for you to have extremely bad luck. 

For example, for some games, I've never picked up a tinker while only another player picked two of them. 

So where the fuck are all the other tinkers?

This same thing happened so many times since late July/early August. 

People say, hey you need to figure out a strat in this situation. 

No man, I mean, if your game experience is designed to ruin you, that strat are you supposed to use? You need a tinker and there are only 2 tinkers in the first 20 rounds - this is not RNG at all. If this is not RNG, what strat are you using? You win because you are chosen, and you lose not because you are dumb - but you are just being picked up by the stupid randomness mechanism. 

This is not RNG. This is bullying players randomly. 

I don't take any bullying like this. Fuck you too."
15610,"Engineered for addiction.  
Not engineered for human satisfaction, accomplishment,  camaraderie.
It looks like, plays like, and sounds like every game I see when I go to a casino.

"
15611,Solely relies on RNG
15612,"RE-REVIEW
I played this game when it first came out and the core of the game is the same. I've popped back in multiple times when I get bored of other autochess games. They've added the mechanic of the mob boss characters and refined it to make it more accessible. They've worked on item drops to make them less rng/game-winning. The biggest QoL addition to me is the mission map which gives more incentive to play and experiment with different compositions. It makes missions/passes more fun and interactive rather than pure grind. They also added a faster game mode for people who don't want a long match, and I do find it pretty fun as a side-game mode. The one thing that I think that this game lacks compared to TFT (the league autochess game) is that TFT has huge gameplay and pool changes that basically revamp the entire game to prevent it from getting stale, while Underlords has largely stuck with the same pool and just made minor adjustments, additions and removals over time. Still a solid overall package and probably most complete auto-chess game out there. Its not a must-play, but if you enjoy or want to get into the genre its a solid and fun pick.

Rating: 8.5/10

ORIGINAL REVIEW
It's an autochess game. It's pretty fun and also available on mobile so you can play on multiple devices. I couldn't get into it because I played a lot of the original mod and found things to similiar and different at the same time and i just ended up enjoying other autochess games more. Still a fun game though, definitely recommend if you are looking to get into an autochess game for the first time. Definite room to grow but still a fun product.

Rating: 8/10"

15620,"The game functions are pretty easy to get onto to, but the strategy is what makes it engaging and fun. I also like playing with friends in groups."
15621,"This game is a really fun strategy game that can also be played on mobile which is amazing.

I see alot of negative reviews saying this game is ""all RNG"". There is some small elements of RNG (mainly on what items you get and getting tier 5 units) but outside of that alot of RNG is under your control. 

The hero pool is shared so if you are going for a unit and so is someone else then you will see less of that unit as the pool is shared. This means you need to be viewing what everyone is going for and adapt accordingly. 

Overall, this games offers alot of depth and I look forward to new heroes and balance changes that keep the game fresh."
15622,"Dota Underlords is a auto chess game based on Dota 2, this game i'm liked it and i can enjoyed this game with some happiness than other auto chess game. Dota Underlords still the best game i ever played."
15623,"This game is like poker... no you can't control the cards you are dealt, but if you use all the information available to you, you can place bets with the maximum chance of paying off. Unlike poker, counting cards is absolutely allowed, and actually encouraged, as you can look at other peoples board at any time. So in spite of what what others have said, it's possible and downright common to have a major comeback. This game is about resource and risk management. There's more strategy to it than RNG, just maybe not the type of strategy you're used to. 

I don't know if it will keep my interest long term; as of this writing I played 63 hours, mostly on mobile and I feel like I'm done with it. I enjoyed the time I spent with it, it was free, and I'll come back to it to check out updates as they come, so I can easily recommend."

15628,"Cannot stop player. Great game. Regular updates and quick fixers for bugs. 

The recent balance patches have been great, really opened the game up so many builds are viable and adapting to each game is more important than forcing builds."

15631,give back artifact instead of this shit
15632,"Great game, best auto chess"
15633,"At first I wasn't really convinced about the game and it sounds really boring on paper.
But after playing several games I got hooked and it's actually a lot of fun.
Despite the RNG elements you still feel in control most of the time and the recent tournament showed that skilled people can win consistently as well.
Valve is also actively listening to the community and implementing good changes that make the game even better."
15634,Trash.
15635,"MORE LUCK THAN SKILL
recent update made the game faster; (on average 5-10 rounds faster) and hence it's more about luck than skill because there's almost no time to reroll for units that can counter ur opponents."
15636,"Great game, highly recommend. Good mix of fun and strategy, good for casuals and more serious types as well.

There is a lot of RNG in this game and that can make it feel like you have no control and you don't know how to get better, but the skill ceiling is very high and the better players usually win. I recommend looking up a community guide or watching some streamers on Twitch like Gaara, Swim or Savjz (he also has gameplay videos on YouTube) to help you get the hang of some of the basics like economy management. But it's also great fun to step in and learn as you go."
15637,Good game. Watching AI fight each other is basically the next step in human evolution
15638,"I think this is a really good game within the Auto-Battler genre.

I had initially called this out for having too harsh RNG - basically being a terrible game about rolling dice. 40 minute yahtzee, but without the friendship and fun times, you know?

But with the free re-roll on loss... suddenly you have much better odds at getting what you want. And that makes ALL the difference.

That items have taken a bit of a hit and no longer determine your win/loss chance so majorly is also a huge balance change that is for the better - no longer do you get one good alliance item and just go hard into it because the item is so good.

Simply put, this feels better than Riot or Drodo's offerings. Best in its class IMO."
15639,Game is great. Devs listen to community feedback and are consistently improving the game.
15640,best game in africa
15641,Highly recommended.
15642,no longer worth playing as valve is already abandoned/putting very low priority on developing the game.
15643,"As expected. a very polished game from Valve, balanced often, and only gonna get better from here."
15644,"Heads-up to the Devs, really great work and always listening to the players!"
15645,Needs more heroes but they are making positive changes to the game constantly.
15646,"Excellent game with a hardworking, communicative dev team behind it. A little tough to learn how to min/max at first, but once you get the hang of it, you can get really creative with builds and positioning."
15647,Trash.  You sit there needing one more character for a triple star and it NEVER comes yet almost everyone else has 2 or 3 Triple stars.  There are builds out there but good luck getting more than 3 characters you need for it.
15648,"I am a massive fan of auto chess, and dota underlords has made some amazing tweaks to the genre and the game has never been more fun.  RNG is inherent in the game, but they have solved this in a brilliant manner and the game has amazing flow and games feel tight and fun."
15649,9/10
15650,The game is very fun and since the last patch the meta is really engaging.
15651,"Free, fun, and being updated faster then any game i've ever played. The meta is changing constantly which is fun and refreshing. The makers of the game seem to have their fingers on the pulse of what the players want."
15652,"great game, sorta disappointed with last patch removing a lot of the globals and switching the alliance bonuses around. doesnt feel good anymore. but i guess they needed to switch up the meta away from most 5 costs win."
15653,game enak untuk di main-kan sambil coly
15654,asdsadda
15655,"My first experience with a game of this genre and it's been really great and extremely fun! Very easy to get into it from being a fan of DotA, but also accessible enough to get my friends into it too that knew nothing about DotA."
15656,Wasted 145 hours on this shit. Don't Bother.
15657,nice
15658,Game is a great auto-battler. Frequent updates is a nice feature
15659,"The game which plays itself from start to finish. 
DLC 'Infernal RNG' included.
An awful time-killer.
Bought for $1,5.
Deleted."
15660,"Had always heard about Dota Auto Chess, but never really got into it. When Underlords came out I decided to try it out. I had lots of fun with it then it hit mobile and that is where it has shined for me. For the first time I have a game I can play on the go that is connected to my steam account. I love that I can be sitting on the couch and pull my iPad out and start a game. I'm not the greatest at the game, but it keeps pulling me back in and I'm loving it."
15661,"Way better than other autochess games. Recent patch fixed the annoying RNG alliance items by removing them and reworking them into the alliance buffs, so that complaint is dead. 

Reading the negative reviews on here, the vast majority of other complaints seem to be people complaining about things that are signs they're just bad at the game. 

One reviewer, who disabled comments on his review sates ""there is no getting good at this game"". LOL Maybe not for him.

This game is way less random than any card game I've played, magic, yugioh, whatever. With this game you can make whatever you get work if  you're flexible and able to adapt to the units it gives you to chose from. Even with my unluckiest RNG games I can still usually squeak out a top 4 and gain a little rank cause I don't cry when the RNG tells me I'm not doing the build I hoped for, I adapt and make the best of what it does give me. 

I think if I could make one change I might consider having 2 more slots on the bench. Or making that a perk you can unlock with certain underlord skill trees once those are implemented. 

Most enjoyable game I've played in years."
15662,"i cannot recommend this game, the rng is absolutely brutal and it's giving you either the worst or the mediocre option, you have to constantly reroll every round for units you mostly do not want/need and thus you end up in a losing battle, the xp you get from winning is laughable to say the least, the unit layout is very dodgy, some units are downright OP.
Do not play this game."
15663,Slap that Anti-mage on the board. Good game.
15664,Really good game will definitely be playing it alot would suggest others to play it aswell.
15665,"Best game I have ever played. Mix of RNG, strategy, and epic battles. Dont listen to bad reviews, its all idiots that don't understand how to play the game by ecoing, knowing when to roll, etc."
15666,"While this game might not be for everyone, I'm certainly hooked to it. 
It's so addicting. 
"
15667,Awesome game! You do not even need a computer to play it. It's quite addictive when you understand the mechanics of the game and most important: No toxic players!. 10/10
15668,Fun even if u dislike dota 2
15669,"The game has great potential, at the present time, in popular gaming genre known as ""auto-battle""."
15670,"Really great take on the auto battler genre. It deviated far enough from DAC to stand as it's own game, which I appreciate.  The latest patch was a huge leap in the right direction, removing the race global items that led to just too much stackable power and the bad kind of RNG.  Very fun right now with many competitive builds."
15671,"frequent updates, fun game, feels fresh with everypatch"
15672,I'm new to autobattlers and really enjoy Underlords.  Weekly updates and communications by the dev team are helping it move through its beta phase quite well.
15673,They updated this game hundred times and they ruined it so badly. Play autochess not this trash.
15674,"When I'm too lazy to play dota, I let the heroes play by themselves"
15675,i love this game its super fun and addicting but the one problem i have with it is with every update it uninstalls itself from my library and crashes every now and then but overall a great game
15676,Yo! Ow!
15677,"UPDATE:

They made the game even better, really.  New modes and exciting new features keep this fresh."
15678,Just as much RNG as games such as hearthstone with twice the amount of fun and actual winable meme builds.
15679,"So, back in the day we had Blizzard's Warcraft 3 with custom maps.

There was a custom map called DOTA that started a whole genre of games.

Then Valve made a standalone game DOTA 2, (and had a ton of lawsuits lol) which eventually got custom maps.

There was a custom map called Dota Autochess which started a whole genre of games.

Then Velve made a standalone Dota Underlords.

WE NEED TO GO DEEPER!

That said the game is as fun as a good Warcraft 3 custom map can be. I know it sounds weird, but if you, like me, enjoy playing Warcraft 3 custom maps, even after all these years, you would see the parallel. For now it's hard to call this game a full fledged experience because it needs a bit more content, but after playing it for 20 hours I feel like I can play it for another 80.

UPD: I updated this review to get a badge from autumn sale. :D"
15680,It's fun at first but then you realize you lack control over winning and it basically comes down to luck and whats meta. There is no skill involved and nothing to really help improve your chances of winning. It's just RNG as most have said. It feels like it's missing sumthin all the time but I cant place my finger on it.. I gave it shot though and it's just not for me.
15681,"There is no loot boxes, only surprise mechanics, and it's quite addicting for a mobile game."
15682,Gaming is devolving
15683,Time killer game
15684,"RNG based.  So basically ZERO control of your game, just like in the actual Dota game with coinflip, win-tradin' a$$ teammates.  Every win or loss is forced.

Someone got your core hero(s) before you?  May as well leave, you just auto-lost.  No point in playing this game if I have no control when I play.  May as well be playing the actual MOBA or just playing a card game at that point.

DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, LET IT DIE JUST LIKE SHARTIFACT SO VALVE HAS TO ACTUALLY PUT EFFORT INTO AN ACTUALLY NEW, CREATIVE AND ACTUALLY FUN TO PLAY GAME."
15685,It started as maybe the best auto battler. It is now defenitely the best auto battler. The last patch was amazing and the meta has never been so diverse/balanced. Props to the devs!
15686,"I've enjoyed what I've played originally, but as they keep changing and balancing the game it's like re-learning how to play every other week.  Because of that I just can't continue to play or recommend others play.  Maybe I'll come back in a year and try the game again once it's out of beta."
15687,This game does have some luck in it but it is mostly an skill based game. One of the most fun things about this game is exploring all of the different playstyles and team comps. I really recomend this game :)
15688,This game is very nice. God tier game.

"
15693,"A game genre that’s based on buying units and watching them fight. On paper that sounds boring to play, but somehow it’s insanely compelling. I find that it fills the same void that a card game does, without being a card game. What I mean by that: you are offered things at random and you try to make the most of the options. You also buy from a shared list of units, so it’s a bit reminiscent of Dominion.

Unlike a card game, it has more complexity. Whereas cards might have small numbers for health, attack, keywords, overall easy to grasp an individual cards, Underlords has a full on character with harder stats to parse at first. This makes the learning curve steeper, but I was compelled within the first few games even though I didn’t entirely understand what was going on.

The UI is not brilliant. It’s obvious it was meant for mobile as well, but even then some things are not the most intuitive. The party system for one, is terrible to navigate. It’s happened that I buy an item because the screen pops in front, even though I was trying to move units about. It does do some nice things as well though, like highlighting units you already have alliances or duplicates of, or the in-game list of units you can filter by cost/alliance (features completely absent in TFT).

A note on the beta: many patches and balance tweaks keep happening. I’d honestly disregard any negative complaints on balance, as devs do seem receptive to change and actively trying out new things. To me, that’s a huge plus.

All in all I've enjoyed my time with Dota Underlords."
15694,much better than tft imao
15695,"its about luck,no skill at all"
15696,Doing it for the badge progress... :P
15697,your update make your game worse
15698,"Amazing game, the UI is so good!!!"
15699,"There is no skill to this game, once you figure out the meta it just becomes a game of luck."
15700,"Enjoy the game everyone? I don't know how I reviewing this underlords. Game itself is fun. But I doubt this already have lots of cheaters. I never get that luck 3 of 2 stars heroes at 4th round that is first round against users while I spent more than 100 matches of underlords. But recently, I faced all the time 3 or 4 of 2 stars heroes have kind of that users at 4th and 5th round. Haven't happened to me ever. I am not sure but I strongly doubt it and that's why I stop playing at the moment."
15701,"Blah blah blah, this is a great game, especially for an Early Access game."
15702,"Good.
Will be even better when they allow for more items on one hero."
15703,"Dear Valve,
This game still had a potential to overtake LoL TFT, however it requires a big update, just get inspired by whatever you see in LoL TFT and alter a little adding your ideas with updates and revive this epic game. Underlords is the first auto-chess game I have ever met and it was the best when I first saw LoL TFT, but now LoL TFT has been so much improved that Underlords looks like a garbage. Come on, do not stop until you make this game perfect. As I said, the potential is huge if you do something."
15704,"I've spent about 40 hours on this over 2 weeks.

Great game. I would at least give it a try. Learn the basics in strategy for this game and you'll come to realize it's not entirely RNG. There are ways to mitigate said RNG with rerolls and proper gold management. That's the strategy aspect of it. ""What's the best army I can build with the gold and rolls I have?"" Top tier army compositions mean everyone will try to get the units they need for those comps. You can take advantage of that as the units for the lesser tier comps will be more common for you, so you get better upgrades."
15705,"TL;DR version: Board placement, alliance configuration and synergy, item builds, reforming your team mid-game, skill compositions, and money management techniques, and flexibility are all strategies that you must figure out to be successful in each game. It's based on RNG, but it is so much more. If you are looking for a strategy game with an absolute array of beautifully crafted strategies, look no further. Get away from those incredibly boring 100v100 simpleton games and get your brain juice flowing. You will need it. 

Now this is a strategy game. All these kiddos crying about RNG this and RNG that... bullshit. Yes, it is based on RNG, but it requires an incredible amount of strategy and constant manipulation of your team. It's not just about getting everyone to three stars, it's about synergizing your team, while countering others. This requires you to actually use your brain, which can be difficult for all those Fortnite and LoL players that aren't good enough at clicking and pointing a mouse. Let me explain:


Strategies that matter: 
Board placement. This can make or break your team. Do you have a heavy front-line, but a back line that is constantly getting nuked into nothingness? Rearrange your units per opponent placement. Put your squishy back-line off to the side, so that when everyone gets nuked, they are out of range. Are assassins taking out your DPS? Slide all your DPS to one side, then move your front-line to the inside of them. This causes assassins to jump into your tanks, allowing the DPS to do work.

Mid-game reformation. Sometimes, you just can't get those units. This requires you to rebuild mid-game. Keep a pool of heroes that work with many teams. As you level them, start swapping out. Have an opponent heavy in Demons? Get a Terrorblade to negate them. Maybe there's a team of Knights that seems impossible to get through, grab items and heroes that move them around the map, rendering their buff useless. Those mages nuking you? Find a good AOE stunner.

Team builds. The most obvious tactic, but still not used by many to the full advantage. There are very few teams of which you need the ENTIRE team from one alliance. Elusive is the exception. The rest, not so. If you are going physical DPS, pick up some Heartless alliance members or the item that changes Humans to Heartless. Mixing and matching is where this game shines. Don't think you can win with stacking one alliance. The game requires more thought than that.

Item builds. Jesus... the items alone can make or break a game. You have Venomancer? Getting the 50% CDR item will make him an absolute monster at two stars. Brutalizer on Dragon Knight is an absolute game changer if you can get him to two stars. Even the item that moves heroes around the map can be key in taking out a Knight alliance team. Use the items as a central part of your strategy.

Skill compositions. Alliances aren't the only objective when building teams. Certain teams MUST have certain heroes for them to fall into place. For example, stuns. There are so many players that build teams without a single stunner. There are also many players that build entire teams out of stunners, but neglect other forms of CC, such as silencing or sheep/chickening. CC is not mandatory, but a well-built team will likely require at least one hero that has an effective stun. Knowing when to pick one up and where to place it on the map will make-or-break your team.

Leveling, rerolling, and interest. In this game, you can accrue interest by holding an increment of gold based on tens (10g = +1, 20g = +2, 30g = +3, etc.). Many players will stack gold until they get 50g, which is where interest is capped. This isn't always a good play. While you are saving gold, someone is buying heroes you need. Also, you can level your team by buying xp (5g = 4xp).  There is also a bonus for winning streaks, which maxes out at +4g per turn and then resets, while lose streaks max at +3g per turn. Sometimes, it's more important to get that 7th level, than it is to have an interest rate of 5. Sometimes it's more important to reroll (2g) to find that third hero for a two star than it is to get that level. Sometimes you're better off going for a win-streak than you are saving and sometimes saving is more important than winning. These decisions require lots of thought, thought that I feel most don't give it. They save to 50g and call it good. This leads me to my last point.

Lastly, Flexibility. While this kind of falls into mid-game reformation, it also does not. You have to be flexible throughout the game, not just with heroes, but with your gold management, your item placement (sometimes you will want to move items around to see which hero benefits the most), your hero placement, your reroll sprees, win-streaks - it all culminates to a beautifully made strategy game that, while based on RNG, has incredibly delicious depth, depth that I have been dying to have. So look no further if strategy games are your jam."
15706,"Anyone with a negative review that says this game ""is just like slot machines"", or ""is pure luck"" obviously does not understand basic strategy in the game. There is a core of luck based drafting on the surface pulling out of a shared pool of characters, but your chances at winning are far more dependent on how you pick and combo based on what you are given, how you evolve your board over time, how you position your unit (far more important than people realize), and how you monitor and react to other player's strategies. It's no grand strategy so don't expect it to go deep, but there is more than appears on the surface, you just have to understand it. 8/10 for being entertaining, though it is easy to walk away from after a short amount of time due to lack of variance."
15707,"I really wish I could recommend this game, I really do. From an artistic and polish stand point, this game is great, however the RNG that occurs in this game can be so bad, you can go from winning a round against an opponent to losing almost a fifth of your life the next round against the same guy. There is many times where you left frustrated because you felt as if had you had control of each unit, you would have flawlessly executed the round, and that really is what makes me not want to play this game anymore. Buyer beware (luckily it's a free to play game) - If you do not handle RNG swing losses, this might not be the game/genre for you.

[UPDATE 03/09/2019]

So, I want to say that this game is much like a onion; it has layers. Coming into this game now with about a day's worth in play time I can definitely say that the more experience you have with this game, the easier it will be. The start can be very daunting for new players who are new to the game/genre, but I will say. If you're willing to take some immediate L's or spend time watching streams/tutorial videos you'll eventually understand what's going on and the game's overall mechanics will make much more sense. You do have some control of how the rounds play out through the heroes/alliances you pick, and the items you acquire.

Overall, I can say, it indeed does have a bit of a higher learning curve, but once you get the general idea, you can really start to micro down on a lot of mechanics to get you consistently towards more placements/wins."
15708,"You'll see many people say how addictive this game is.
That's because gambling is addictive and this is a slot machine."
15709,This game is awesome! Half Life 3 can wait.
15710,This game is soooo good . I love it !
15711,"I never ""played"" something as boring as this. I expected Chess with Dota characters, instead i got the most boring round of ""random units hit each other in the face"".

The presentation is so incredible boring, i dont have any motivation to learn the strategy, the tutorial is just a bot round, and everything takes for ever. Its just a lot of random effects, but seeing how much valve loves their loot boxes its no wonder they made a game based around the entire concept of lots of colorful effects and rng.

This game is not free, it costs your time and knows how to waste it in the most meaningless way possible"
15712,"Pretty decent. Still needs some balance ofc but no one thing is OP. Played with mouse ONLY and it's great. UI needs a PC version.

I give it chek out of m8"
15713,If jimmy neutron had main role in the new James Bond moviem I would rate this game little higher. 9/10 made me addicted.
15714,this game is so broken
15715,Crashes constantly
15716,ok
15717,"Plain old boring imo. If you want an RPG inspired strategy game, go for something with proper turn based strategy like Blood Bowl.

The tutorial is one of the  weakest I've seen and I never found much fun after the first few rounds. The only reason I can see this genre growing is because it adapts well to mobile?"
15718,"that was good promising game at first, but then it sucked because they updated ui and made it look like obnoxious teamfitght tactics rip off"
15719,this is gud
15720,It took more than 3 min to find a game on grifter 3  . Bruh the game's already dead.
15721,AOE HELL
15722,I don't like the game at all.
15723,"It's really flat in terms of actual gameplay, kinda boring ngl."
15724,"Rank system is a joke, the randomness of units and OP higher-starred units make it very luck-based as individual strong units far outpower good alliance builds"
15725,cool game
15726,"if you don't know what is autochess, its worth to try it as its free , but already it's a good auto chess game ,each game takes around 15 minutes , and its easy to play and learn , and you don't have to take it serious just play and enjoy , so i recommend this game for mobile not mobile because its not worth to turn on the pc on start playin this kind of games"
15727,"good fun, easy to learn and some fun looking characters"
15728,"I really enjoy this game, so many strategies to explore. The last patch fixed a lot of inconsistencies and I finally start to feel like every alliances is worth playing.

I play on both PC and iPad. Never had an issue on PC, had some crashes on iPad, but you can reconnect to the game really quickly without losing anything."
15729,good simple yet very challenging.
15730,I have no idea what I just played.
15731,Dota Auto Chess is better
15732,"- Strategy genre reached it's bottom with MOBA introduction... Oh wait, here's Underlords...

"
15733,"Fun little game with a bit of a learning curve. Just imagine chess where your pieces(dota heroes in this case) have abilities and other factors such as perks shared between the same type of units exists. You pick from a rotation of heroes using currency and build a composition that you think will get you the win. Then you enjoy the show as the pieces/heroes play automatically. 

Flaws? It's addictive. The game revolves around theory crafting your build, watching pretty lights and visuals as you watch your build in action, and of course RNG. All the elements of an addictive experience. So play in moderation :P 

8/10"
15734,"You win -> feel great about your strategic choices.
You lose -> it's clearly all just RNG."
15735,The idea of the game is good but the game itself isn't.
15736,"WOW love this game easy to play and lots of fun, nice be part of the start of it.  new updates will be great!"
15737,Excellent game. The new patch made it even better.
15738,I've been playing this game since the very first day. It was great... until the dev team rolled out an unstable update. The game is crashing every 30 seconds. Totally unplayable.
15739,"""Strategy""
"
15740,RNG heavy but fun
15741,"Pretty much pure rng, barely any strategie involved (yeah there is some but most of the time doesnt matter).
Bad game design and pretty much abandoned project anyway."
15742,"Feels rewarding when u win, unfair when u lose :)"
15743,Good for wasting time!! Rect it!!
15744,"very good game, i play it on androied and really like it, but  need some tools i think, like ranking, win rate, 1st place, top 3 place and somethinkg like this."
15745,"Very fun game, but I think the real obstacle that faces Underlords is the fact that dota auto chess is still playable in the arcade in the dota client."
15746,You shouldn't allow people to have two aegises because that would ruin the balance of the game.
15747,"Please add an in-game clock, i can't stop playing this game :lol:"
15748,"Fun initially but as many have said, it is heavily RNG based and you have minimal ways to influence your chances. Additionally, there is no meta gameplay customization and a relatively limited pool of mobs to choose from, so the game quickly started becoming bland to play.

Obviously still early days but were the game to start charging, I would not be able to recommend it in it's current state (04/08/2019)."
15749,Ever since the latest patch where you get rewarded for losing i have had about enough of the game. please get rid of the free reroll for losing. it completely screwed the game up and is not fun right now. DO NOT play this bad game in this state.
15750,after updates the odds getting awful
15751,"Too much RNG to determine teams. Luck can decide OP teams and items. I like some of the ideas, but it's not feasible to change strategies and builds in time."
15752,better than other autochess games
15753,So many russians
15754,"Since the last patch, this game, made by Valve, the owners of Steam, refuses to believe I am logged in to Steam and therefore won't let me play the game. This is entirely preventable and a foolish mistake, and I am letting Valve know my displeasure with this review.

The game itself has been enjoyable however."
15755,YO!
15756,You can go from 2nd to dead last because of pure RNG.
15757,Very very nice game really exciting and fun. Can wait for the updates that evolves it to be better than before
15758,Very good chess game
15759,Everything Looks & Sounds Awesome SO-FAR...
15760,better than tft
15761,"I play on phone and I like the ui more than autochess. Mostly because it doesn't feel cheap. Game is addictive, simple to learn and leaves place for mastering. I'd add mechanism for adding heroes on board directly from shop. Check current meta, save up gold for interest and you'll be good :)."
15762,Game is great love it
15763,"....
"
15764,"For people who are unable to play the original game, however want to feel a bit more included than watching Twitch streams."
15765,I didn't like it....
15766,Yes..
15767,"Great time waster. Personally, I'd prefer somewhat shorter matches and a little less randomness but already in a really fantastic shape!

Also great that it works perfectly on Linux and Android. Great showcase how a game can run pretty much every OS and hardware."
15768,"Game is pretty good as it can be played on mobile devices, it is something new. A small step for Valve, but a huge leap for community.
Game is still in BETA and it shows great progress so far. Game mechanics can be changed in the future and I know that balances are coming as well.
Pros:
-It is addictive and fun to play
-Supports cross-platform gaming, mobile devices can play with/against PCs
-Cross-platform is balanced neither platforms have advantages
-Easily accessable Steam friend list + progress track via Steam
-Good graphics even on mobile devices
-Free to play rewards
-Yet no pay to win feature
-Able to play offline and online
-Very good servers, can be played with poor connectivity
Cons:
-Game is still in BETA so it doesn't have even half heroes yet
-Game is a real table turn, you can have 20 rounds win streak, but start losing every round after that
-Game is way too RNG at the moment, you can plan strategies, but it doesn't mean you will be able to impliment them
-As the game is way too RNG the bot difficulty you are playing against won't matter, you can easily lose to medium bots and also easily win against Hard bots.

What could be changed/added ?
-Longer sessions with more players, game usually ends before 40 and we all want MORE LOOT to get before we finish. Like for real you will MAYBE get 1 tier 5 item before finishing as a 1st place.
-Balance, balance and more balance. Some heroes feel way too off and other's are way too strong. I think Arc Warden is broken, because he keeps spawning his Tempest double until you kill him, which may be an issue because he block the path with it and so he becomes unkillable.
-Waiting for more heroes :)
-More items :)




"
15769,"this game ruined my mind, hard to think about other stuff after playing it. 10/10"
15770,"After many balance changes, adding too many perks, ""super"" gitfs ugly skins and big changes this game becomes boring.

Game was before playable and similar to dota2 balance - now it is something strange - typical phone game where is thousand gitfs or micropayments.

Even skins looks strange  for dota2 players - Abandon skin (elf like hat looks like taken from other game)."
15771,"The game was great in beta, now it is weird and not fun at all, and I am not talking about taht bs city map and battle pass"
15772,Dota is not for me. I find dota matches way too long for no reason. This is better than dota 2 but still boring.
15773,Y E S
15774,"I really wanted to like it after the most recent patch. Unfortunately the game is still unbalanced, completely stale, and some races still just remain irrelevant. It is sad to see but this game should fade out relatively soon with the current dev team."
15775,"Honestly a lot of fun, nice learning curve"
15776,awesome gameplay but needs mo balance in update

15779,"I'm not even into dota 2 and i fucking love this game would give it a rating of 8/10 because its still in early access
fun addictive game i find myself craving to play everyday or 2
and man the developers are working their ass off cant believe it"
15780,"It's a fun game but allowing preformed groups of friends to enter the solo queue killed it for me.  If you don't mind that aspect, you will probably enjoy the game."
15781,"From the surface appears as a simple game, but the mechanics are deep. Requires strategic planning while knowing that luck plays a major part both for you and against you. In my opinion, requires the same balance of Skill/Luck as poker."
15782,tft is much better
15783,Best doto boardgame doto
15784,"I don't understand shit and the tutorial is a bit whacky, but it's fun"
15785,Horrible balance to the bots.  This isn't ready for prime time.  NOT FUN.
15786,"Ok, so I've played this game quite a bit between PC and Mobile and have played since launch. The game is free, which is great but the changes they make are CONSTANTLY focused on the wrong things and game-changing every week.

Example: Knights have been way too overpowered only requiring 6 units for the full T3 bonus alliance bonus which guarantees 50% physical and magical damage reduction for ALL knights, meanwhile Warriors need 9 to get 35% physical damage reduction (not even counting magical.) What do the devs do? Nothing. Instead they remove items that affect all alliance units and create new items to do the same effect on a single unit.

The devs took the game from someone that had a good idea and have begun drastically reducing the quality of the game. Every week the updates seem to be going in the wrong direction making the game worse than it was the week before. Balance issues aren't even a thought, they would rather add cosmetic changes than make the game playable on a competitive level. At the moment the game is reliant so much on luck (inherently with the game genre of autochess/autobattlers but amplified with the necessity to get lucky with the OP units.)

At this point, I cannot recommend this game, 2-3 weeks ago I would have had glowing reviews, but now? No. I'm uninstalling and will never touch this game again, there are better versions of the same game out there that focus on gameplay/balance instead of cosmetic bullshit."
15787,even if its not the best game right now the devs are trying and making it better with each patch
15788,I never win but FUCK ME IN THE ASS SIDEWAYS  THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE
15789,Shit game. like artifuck. die soon. foolish  in bussinees. Stop doing shit and back to dota2
15790,"Click and pray style of game-play. Serious disconnect from AI to real player.
I am disappointed that anyone would attempt to relate this to Chess in any manner.
This is a finely polished WC3 Mod, if you want to waste your time with it, it is a perfectly okay obsession based time killer.
I really wanted this game to be something I wanted to play."
15791,I really like it and Enjoy it while i playing it but to be honest its not my type of game . Still you make a great game !
15792,Good shit while im bored af in my phone. Well its good to see the staff updating this always
15793,nice
15794,Ow!
15795,better than dota artifact :D
15796,"this stupid game just want to make sure you are lucky enough or not
reroll every fucking single round just looking for 1 hero unit to reach 3 star hero
and that stupid damn unit still doesn't exist even the others units doesn't have that fucking damn unit
this game not to fucking damn recommended!!! just uninstall right fucking now!!!
3000 tumbs down!!!!!!"
15797,"There were a lot of updates that I didn't really like. I made it to big boss during the beta and used to really like the way it played, but TFT just feels better to me now."

15799,"Early Beta Player, Updated review at 475~ hours - 


This is the best the game has ever been. It is at a full release state, with online/offline-for-credit-hardmodes and the hands down the best/most balanced meta we have had thus far. 

Some stuff is strong, but nothing is 'I win the game and theres nothing you can do'. If you see an opponent starting this gameplan; you can adapt or always grab items that will help you defend against such tactics. And build something else that your opponents arent and win because your uncontested units are bigger.

A lot of things changed during the course of the Beta, and the Devs have listened every step of the way.

This is a AAA Quality Puzzle game and its crazy to see no one else on my friends list trying it"
15800,"Pretty enjoyble game. hope they update this alot, if not: it's going get broing really fest."
15801,I am addicted to this game. Purely F2P. Awesome gameplay. The dev team always listen to community feedback. 9.5/10
15802,"bad

edit: I am decent at the game now so it's good"
15803,Very relaxing game. Wish there was a VR/AR support. I want AI to fight in my living room.
15804,Best Gaem
15805,"Pay to win !!! ahh sorry Pray to win !!!!, but seriously after playing this game you will love it"
15806,"Think it needs some more work on the matchmaking. I played 1 round where the top 2 people with zero losses, kept battling those of us with losses, and they didn't have to battle each other until well into the match. Also, it is kind of pointless to sit through matches just to watch battles you cannot control, just to buy an upgrade at the end of the round, to sit through another round you cannot control, rinse and repeat 30 times and then you have finally finished a round. A lot of game time for very little actual game play. This is a spin off of the multiple mobile games where you do very similar things, only you don't have to watch the battles. Not a bad game though, just not my style, If you are a hands on gamer, this might not be for you, but hey, its free, and worth a shot. I recommend it for at least the tutorial and a match or two to see if it fits you."

15811,"Game has grown on me, I don't know if its due to the new patch or what, but its pretty damn fun!"
15812,I guess this is for people who want Dota to play itself while they watch? I don't know. Doesn't feel very involving.

15825,"Using familiar DOTA 2 characters and items, this game is loads of fun to play. Lots of bugs with the score adjudication and scoreboard postings, as slower games are ranked higher at the end, but a solid game that won't give you carpel-tunnel."
15826,"Most boring game i have played. Only play it because its a distraction to other activities on secondary monitor. You click couple of times every 3 mins and then just do nothing. rounds take ages to end and then there is same amount of time to wait to roll and another wait where the actual fight happens which again is so stupid with its totally buggy and shitty disjointable projectle for spells. That lina who is supposed to be your ace ? just wasted her nuke on some on who was moving from one tile to another . Shit like this is so infuriating you wonder why anyone plays this shit and then you realize hardly anyone does. You are better of playing playing other titles. This is ofc the alpha review and they recently copied tft's 1 battle field only gameplay which just feels lazy work. Maybe if they had a rapid fire game mode where you dont have to sleep every round it would be a little more engaging.
They cant even make good use of a gold mine idea developed in their own client , what we have is some shitty client made for mobile gaming forced on pc users. Valve should stop making games .

Overall poop play something else ."

15828,"Dota2 combined with PlantsVsZombies, Valve's take on autochess really works although it'll take time to grasp for those new to Dota. Worth your while though, and I prefer to play on mobile so give that a try."
15829,"Ignore the whining 'game is pure rng' reviews, those are simply bad players who do not understand that games of this nature are about rng mitigation. 

Yes there is rng involved as there is in games dating back as far as history allows us to look, any game with dice or a random card draw (so most card games known to man) have a random element. The skill is learning how to mitigate that random element and play around it. For example here in auto chess games the heros are all drawn from a shared pool. So early on do you go full meta and try to nab all the units everyone wants, this is high risk high reward, if it works great if it doesn't your done. Where as smarter players will go slightly off meta or splash something else in their comp that nobody is building and get them to 3 star (the units are all upgradable) 

Now with that out of the way is DU good?

Well its OK if I could give it a 'Meh' I would, I mean its free so you don't lose anything trying it out but honestly as of now its the worst of the 3 main contenders. The others being the original DAC which is still superior to this despite its rough edges, it has much more depth. And Teamfight tactics from Riot which is simply more appealing visually and much deeper. DU also suffers from the fact its basically a reskinned DAC with some of the item depth removed so it feels like you've seen and done it all before but better. There is a reason TFT is hitting 75k viewers on twitch and this barely hits 10k, cause its just a better game. And that considering Dota2 is actually more popular than LOL is quite an achievement. 

That said it is free so if you like auto chess games give it a go its fun enough but ill stick with thumbs down purely cause its contenders are better games."
15830,"its a great and all but what if we can connected to dota and we can apply the skin we have in this game it will be fucking cool

15833,"hmmmm i don't really know, seems interesting but it's a bit confusing at start. bad tutorial. Give it a shot it's free!"
15834,"This one is easily the superior form of the nascent auto-battler genre, and it's still in its larval Early Access stage! Every update so far has made improvements to make the game cleaner, easier to understand, and more exciting to follow. Even better, the UI gives you all the needed information in-game, so you don't have to keep a separate window open or have an encyclopedic memory to deploy your strategies. I'll be playing this one for as long as Valve supports it!"
15835,"At it's current state, I don't recommend the game. It's still boring compared to the other auto chess rip-off that I have tried in mobile. 

Might edit it after a few hours due to new update."
15836,My childhood heroes turned into chess pieces?
15837,Very fun free game in the auto-chess genre! Regular updates keeps this game fresh!
15838,A really fun game with only a small learning curve. Much cleaner interface than dota autochess and less buggy. Way more fun to play.
15839,TRASH.
15840,Pretty Neat Game
15841,so good
15842,Warning game can be addicting....
15843,"Excellent take on the popular Auto-Chess genre. There's so much to learn with all the different layers of strategy such as unit synergies, items, placing, countering enemy team composition, whether to use money on level updates or rerolling or saving for interest. 

The game is still in Beta and it shows in minor flaws in user experience. However the frequent updates show that Valve takes Underlords very seriously and the game has a real chance to become the king of Auto-Chess. It's free, so there's really no reason not to try it."
15844,THIS GAME MADE ME WANNA EAT BIG MACC VERY GUT
15845,"The best autochess game out there, the latest (2 aug) update provide alot of new gameplay and strategy, free rerolls for losers and lots more."

15848,i love this game
15849,gay and bad
15850,as this game is fucking fecal garbage puked by some chink because valve has no creative ability. RIP VALVE.
15851,Yo
15852,make half life 3
15853,I've never experienced so many graphical bugs in any other game. Literally unplayable.
15854,I love this game and the constant updates it gets. May not be for everyone. But for people that like strategy and rpg elements. You will love this.

15860,"Outstanding quality of a game. 
Very entertaining and very addictive! 
But in the end of the day it just brings you bad health because if I felt good playing an RNG game i'd stick to some piece of shit like Hearthstone. 

Honestly, you can learn all the 2 to 5 strategies in the current meta and just hope minimizing RNG with adequate and fast reaction. But the randomness is a bigger factor that your strategies, intelligence and planning will ever be. You pick from the same pool of heroes and still you can be having a single Beastmaster 23rd round in the game while nobody's picking him because you're trying to desperately make that warrior-brawny strat you just read on the internet cuz it turned out despite how much you're experimenting that's the only viable option - knowing the working ones. 

Edit (September): Several months in, the game is still based on current metas. Wanna be creative. Well fuck you, read a guide.

Edit (November): God damn it, they absolutely changed everything and are I guess kind of listening to their base so there's no way I don't change the review to positive. 

Edit (Outlander's patch): Yupp, it's getting weirder.

This s not a fun game. It's Frankenstein between the Casual and non-Casual. 

Fuck you, Slark"
15861,"Free game no bitchin...but please make proper game again...no card game...no mobile game for robots...just HL3
TY"
15862,This game is herpes without the fun.

15864,Beautiful game I soon injoy
15865,RNG fiesta
15866,I'll recommend this game for someone who have a free time or while waiting for someone else
15867,"It is nice game OK,but not strategy you need a lot of luck,is like casino machine you know this machine with fruits 777."
15868,Seems like nobody cares how many cheaters in this game right now.
15869,"It is ridiculous, a company behind the masterpieces like Half-Life, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike, is now releasing card games and mobile graphic chess simulators. What is the next plan? A farming simulator in 2D design? Please, go back and start making real games..."
15870,Sranje GOLEMO
15871,"The strategy level of this game is the same as a slot machine, with the only difference that you can save some coins in this crap."
15872,"Works like the cats meow on Linux, Perfffffffffffffffect. Though doesn't matter what OS you play on the dam RNG is going to smack you in the face with crap rolls tell you learn you are nothing, Nothing before its might. Maybe if I pray to the God Gabe, it won't hurt me so often."
15873,"Well this game is interesting based on dota 2 characterand abilities, but much different from the base game dota 2. If you are familiar with dota 2 Charecters and ability the it will take just few moments to master this game. But for new comers it will need lot of time to get the game basics. I will say a good designed game even you can play in mobile it is cross platform."
15874,nice game but feels so boring if u play too much in a day but chess always gonna be a chess
15875,They've just destroyed the game after the huge update. Everything is now way more complicating for new players
15876,"I actually loved the game to start. They are slowly making it bad.
There is no real balance.
Many games I had where I was doing fairly decent, build was going good. Then someone in last place tosses their build and somehow manages to take over my build and win it with the same heroes. Just upgraded cause they spent all their gold for it. Meanwhile Im sitting at 50 getting nothing after 10 re rolls. 
Every game is the same. People fight for this Druid/Savage build or Heartless/Hunters. Unless you get lucky with globals and can build something different. Which is a whole other thing. The item RNG is even worse than before too. You finally win a round vs these neutrals that got a un needed buff and than you sit there going? I am not running Warlocks and its round 25... or inventors...or mages. 3 globals you dont need after a round 25 win. Its just silly. Meanwhile other players are getting everything they need. This game was good and now its trash. I got to Boss1 ina week. Havnt moved since. The game is super easy and fun but there is 0 balance and the RNG is just horrible. I actually think it works a lot like facebook poker back in the day.
If you spend a few days off the game. The rng increases, as well as after a few loses it also increase rng. The more I test this. The more I feel right. It is about 4-5 games of shit and then 1-2 of good. Keeps you in right? dont fall for it. the game sucks now."
15877,good game for wasting time
15878,"I can say great game and funny with alot way to win and good game to spend alot time on!
"
15879,"There is no getting good at this game, it's 90%+ RNG and completely out of your hands. I don't mind the RNG, if everyone is equal and dealing with the same thing and we are all just working around with what we are given... But no, that's not the case, the game has extremely unbalanced ""I WIN"" builds, where if someone gets that build, there is nothing and I mean NOTHING you can do about it! 

I don't even want to get into the unbalanced meta builds in this game. All I see is everyone using the same meta builds and if you deviate from this, you bet you're gonna get stomped!

------------------------------------------------
I've said it a million times before, but this time I actually am serious, I'm done with this game. I have even uninstalled it already. The only reason I played this game was because of the addiction from the gambling, I honestly think that's why a lot of others play this game as well, so I suggest others to uninstall as well. I mean seriously, ask yourself, why are you playing this mess of a game, beyond the addiction that gambling brings. I ask again, SERIOUSLY, ask yourself, why are you playing this game?

Believe me or not, I actually am done with this toxic gambling game that only has addiction going for it. There is no progress in this game, it is just gaining points and then losing them just as fast and staying in an endless loop and never progressing, much like a slot machine or any other type of gambling that hooks you in.

------------------------------------------------
I've put 164 hours into this game and I see no light at the end of the tunnel for this game beyond gambling addiction. There is no ""git gud"", you are at the will of the slot machine."
15880,"No big update for months, only small useless nerf/buff.. Dead game for sure"
15881,Even more exciting than Hearthstone 5/7!

15883,"meeeeh better than auto chess ye, but TFT is more fun"
15884,"I play dota underlord in android then i steam link in so when i want to play in my pc i cant downloaded it and it say on your library
"
15885,"I hope all the effects and sounds in dota2 are here, especially the sound of FIRST BLOOD to RAMPAGE. That is the words and sounds of the legend."
15886,"The game is really OK
	
it can be fun for a time
it has some promise
BUT
The reason I cannot recommend this game now is because the balance is just broken. 90 percent of games will see other players following the META. which leads it to being a casino style race to complete the core meta heros first.

too much stake is in the early game and if you dont get something good in the first 10 turns you might as well quit and queue up again

The requirement of APM in placing heroes temporarily on the board and then microing out some rerolls into a combination is surprisingly essential and can often end in you just losing as you ddint make it in time and ja lot of your hard work is forcibly sold. Having high APM isnt really the demographic of this game and it seems to determine a lot of games.

	 I feel Valve rushed this out and it feels more like an alpha than a beta
"
15887,"Want to have fun in an auto chess game? Want to actually get the units you want to at least have a fair advantage against other players? Want to have fun in a game? Well then don't get this screwed up negative RNG game. The RNG is so bad it literally makes you lose 80% of the time. You'll get 20% of moments where you did awesome and got what you needed. The other 80% is questioning the games logic as to why they're giving you alliances that are not even close to your build over, and over, and over. Until you're taken out by someone who got their perfect build. You'll win, but most of the time you'll win like a homeless person on a date. Out of pity that you got shafted 50 times in a row by a big cock so she let you bang her this one time for your sake."
15888,"Eh, how to say it.. RNG Simulator? Yeah, something like that. Personally the game plays like those trading card games, except that the game has 8 players and every card is available for everyone. Fun for a while and with friends, can get frustating sometimes, yeah, you can go and blame the RNG God. Micromanagement is there.. but seriously tho, you need bigger luck.

Another issues is you can peek at your enemies build, this should be really an issue but eh, it doesn't give any impact on your RNG anyway.
If only I can give this a neutral instead of positive or negative. Just play this game if you think your luck is high enough.

PS: Optimization sucks on mobile version."
15889,"finally won one game after way too many games played.

solely relies on rng and being able to get warlock maxed out with scrappy/inventor tanks. the regen is too strong compared to the other alliances and its the only way to win. if you dont have a full 2 star squad by mid/late game you cant win"
15890,"The devs have proven they are unable of balancing the game correctly so far. The game is almost unplayable after the last two ""updates"". Wait for Auto Chess to come to PC or if you can stomach it play TFT."
15891,"Its just RNG bad luck, theres really no strategy, just luck."
15892,"Really addictive gameplay that keeps you on your toes no matter what. Lots of variation for what builds you could go for, a lot of which won't go the way you plan the first couple times, but after a couple of games thing begin to click. Its hard not to just queue up again after losing what you thought was the best demon build you've ever made due to not being able to get that last unit to make it a 3 star. Overall fun game that kills time with ease."
15893,entertaining.
15894,"Less is more, especially in RNG based game. Unfortunately game got ruined after the major update that introduced overlords to the game. Such a shame, I enjoyed the game a lot before that update."
15895,"Much better than Artifact, and I really enjoyed Artifact.

Cross-play with iOS/Android and being able to swap from one device to another is AWESOME.

Games are running long now with the Underlords but hopefully Valve keeps tweaking the formula"
15896,"Dota Underlords doesn't have Underlord in it. 0/10
"
15897,The game mechanics are so unbelievably boring. The game takes too long and your are not able to switch tactics because coincidence decides if you win or you don't depending on what allies you roll. you should go to a casino for a more exciting gameplay...
15898,nice
15899,"Weird, I can't see the game in my library"
15900,A very good game with impressive strategy mechanics.
15901,Nice gamessssss
15902,Holy Hell all I wanted was something fun while I took a shit. Clearly I was misinformed with this rng mess. Big ol oof.
15903,This is the real Artifact
15904,"Good game, I'd like to see a few things implemented. More characters and items, and then champion customization. Like implement the different skin parts from original Dota 2 and allow the player to choose how our heroes look on the board. That would give the game a unique touch compared to the other auto battlers. Otherwise very enjoyable"
15905,bad Random
15906,love this
15907,"Great for Beta, looking further to the development of new characters

Would be great if recipe items were included in the future as with Dota 2"
15908,"A great game with many players. For a game which has still not been fully released, even now there are currently very few things that could be improved. A great game."
15909,"Loooooool no. Listen alright its trying to be this strategy fun game, but there is way too many RNG elements like the shop for you to really use your brain. You could get really lucky and get 2 star heros by round 4 or get super unlucky and get stuck with level 1's.  Basically no chance if you're stuck with level 1's. 
The concept is great but the mechanics and RNG is complete rubbish and does not make a fair skill based environment."
15910,Luck based RNG garbage. Not much room for any strategy. Graphics and animations are addicting...as usual.
15911,"Pretty addicting, the biggest + for me is the crossplay option. 
I like that after you link your steam account it also counts towards your played hours stats even if your playing on mobile!

The game is mostly the same as Team Tactics from LoL, i play it both but the fact that i like to have most of my games on 1 platform i prefer this one, even though it's still in beta.

Just try it...it's free!"
15912,no mames cabecita esta con boletos este juegazo maestro ajuaaaaaa velga!
15913,"I like this game

but the mobile port ruined it for me 

for that i prefer TFT ."
15914,"Feels a little bit laggy on mobile but so far, its been running smoothly. Just hate the fact that there is no comeback mechanic when you're behind you most likely lose to the ones winning the game early."
15915,"I have no clue what Valve was thinking here... They had an amazing game that was blowing up.... Then they literally patch out everything anyone ever had fun with and turn it into a RNG fiesta....

What a joke game will be dead in 2 weeks which is sad bc it was all there and they just went the wrong direction.

Play this game if you like playing slot machines at the casino."
15916,This is honestly one of the few games that balances RNG and Strategy. Very good.
15917,Addictive game! I totally recommend for who like table games.
15918,"epic
"
15919,"This game feels a lot like the actual Dota. Your team has the worst possible focus order, uses spells at highly inappropriate times and occasionally saves an enemy by doing so, like to stay as close as possible to each other when the enemy have 8 AOE spells, don't communicate, and the support never buys wards. When there is a support.
You can try your hardest to get your team to actually play the game the way Icefrog intended, but ultimately you can bet the tank will decide that the carry's life just isn't worth it that much.

Truth be told I'm not even sure why I play this game. On paper, it's everything I hate, but somehow it's actually pretty fun. Maybe it's just the idea of playing a Dota themed game where I don't have to pick Crystal Maiden every game because nobody else wants to support."
15920,"First 15 hours, game felt like 100% rng 0% skill
15-40 hours, game felt like 30% rng 70% skill 
40+ hours, game feels 85% rng 15% skill"
15921,This Dota map is much better (yo)
15922,"Good game , but it needs to be refined. Can't wait to see how it's like when it's going to get out of the beta"
15923,Nusta jugad..
15924,Excellent game..better then all other Auto Battler variants so far..The best part is that its cross platform. Hats of to Valve on making this such a success. I was skeptical after Artifact but this game is on a different league all together.
15925,I never really liked Dota so i thought it was going to be like the other ones so i never tried it until i saw a video on it and immediately fell in love with the aspect and board game type play
15926,"This is a new type of game where you prepare the combination of classes before matches to make alliances that make your team unstoppable.  You dont do any combat on itself, just manage your team of fighters.

The most difficult part is understanding how alliances work and how to get those combinations that give you the winning edge.

Its a huge plus you can play it on iOS or Android (It works great in iOS 13 Beta and iPad OS Beta), and its also huge you can start on PC and finish on the tablet for those moments you need to go to the can and not miss a match.

I sat down last night for one last game before going to bed, it was 10pm, when I got up to go to bed it was 2am... huge time sink."
15927,"This game is nice and challenging, they try to correct the patch mistakes to units/alliances being overpowered but at the moment it is invaded by hackers and it's become unplayable. Some people have lvl 2 only so early on that regardless of alliances or bonuses. Now some people also hack the creep rounds to have more items.

I know that it's just in beta, but at least having a reporting option might help."
15928,"Valve can't make good games anymore. 

Boring mobile game that wants you to read all kinds of wiki's before you understand wtf is going on. You can't do anything, you're not  playing you're watching ai play like a mobile game."

15931,"Fun Game, play with Friends, practice and get to know the game.

Which Kombo is the best? You have to find out. 

In my opinion there is a lot of luck included but that is what it makes so interesting.

You can be last place with one health and win the game, ofc. reverse vice as well.

Have fun with the game, just play it to calm down and when you have to wait for a queue in another game for instance. 

Peace!"

15935,"Compulsive, polished looking auto battler using DOTA lore. Still in development and therefore balancing is in progress. One to watch I think."
15936,"Auto-chess is a board game thats built around drafting up the perfect team to win round after round of battle. Win and gain power to spend on that roster as you build them up or trade them of. Underlords is built on the roster and items from Dota2 (as well as the long match times 20-40 mins). Under-lords is Valves well polished but still very early version of that popular community created dota2 custom game mode. Surely if you like strategy gameplay and/or like the DOTA IP, then youll at least find some interest in trying it out. Or keep reading for my impressions as a semi casual Dota2 player and sometimes armchair general.

    As with dota2, knowledge is king and it all starts with drafting.
It is the main mechanic to this game. This really is a deck builder in a way... But its also MOBA-like with its deep roster, the alliance trait pairings , each units unique abilities, and various ranges of stats that are also different per unit. The roster has also been tiered, placing some heroes out of the pool early game, but drafting them once they do show up is commitment as they will cost more than the lower tiers and have less chances of showing up again. Also, with 3 of the same unit, they upgrade to a""higher"" star, giving them ""level ups"" to abilities and stats. Beware, again reminder that the draft pool of heroes is limited and each player is drawing from it. Pay attention to the other players lineup so youre not wasting money on a hero you'll never get upgraded.
    Whats interesting is ""Team-fight"" knowledge will actually translate to some degree from dota2if you're a veteran of mobas, you'll know right off whats going on when youre squad starts getting wrecked as the abilities and animations are matching the units in dota2...to a degree. Their much more limited simple versions but by the time you have 10 heroes on the baord, its all gonna be a mess. Reduced heroes complexity is gonna work in your favor should you try to figure out whats going wrong or right post round. 
Knowing the games finer details will greatly increase your chances of enjoying the matches; instead of wondering why you're just dying no matter what you put out there. 

This game is very much based on the deeper learning curves of Dota 2 style of games. Deep rosters, buff system, and random items to loot means that threre's a lot to study if you want. Each round you can choose to buy a hero drawn out a shared pool with the 8 other players who are also presented 5 per round. That means ""card"" counting is possible and allows a skill ceiling for high level play. You can also peak at individuals opponents units and items. The game escalates in tiers, eventually having much higher tier heroes and items entering the pool as the rounds go on. Each unit you place unit on the ""chessboard"" (thus the auto-chess nomenclature) has its own actions and advantages.  This means placement determines a lot but alliances are the key to hold the taking over the board and staying out ahead of the rest of the players in match. To do this, you spend gold earn each round to purchase more heroes, each having two unique traits that when pair with similarly trait-ed heroes, fielding enough units for the prerequisite amount of a trait and you'll gain that traits buff. Each buff is very interesting and layers the strategy game even deeper on top of an already deep unit roster.  as the two opposing rosters fight to the death, watch your detailed stats as the fighting is going on. who is getting killing blows, who is dealing most dmg, who is getting the most dmg done to them? all of that can inform your changes to the line up as the round continue to advance.. Sure you don't control the unit directly and the ""AI"" isnt spelled out for each hero so its gonna take trial and error at this point. Tutorials are also kinda light and generally not gonna do much to help you get into it. Go watch a video before jumping on. Long matches are the norm in dota2, and its not any different here. set aside an hr if you want to play anymore than one game. also"
15937,"there's no strategy on this game, the RNG its too afwul and u have absoluty no control over the luck. totaly unfunny to play after a few hours or days."
15938,"I first saw auto chess when some streamers started playing it months ago. I couldn't wait to play something like this on my mobile device. Now that I've been playing it on a mobile phone, I would like the option to play on PC, but says not available on this platform. too bad. At least I can play on my android phone..."
15939,"An appetizer game. Luckily it has solo vs bots matches. Little usage of disk space, perfect to play if you are bored and want something else, but not get too invested in."
15940,So fun
15941,They should have a moba version of this game. Also 10/10.
15942,Its a fun game but the lack of progression makes it get old quick. The reliance on RNG rather than building up makes it really annoying. You don't build up or accumulate anything. You just play a match and maybe get the lame prestige from it. It feels like they are copying overwatch in a strategy game.
15943,"My combo: Anti Mage, Enchantress, Slark, Phantom Assassin (x2), Axe, Tusk, Tidebreaker

First ""perk"" is +1 item selection!

Another useful perk is +1 gold for every kill :)

PA must have Mask of Madness!

Battle Fury for the 2nd PA!

Maelstrom for AM!

Not a whole lot in terms of synergizing, unfortunately (minor or negligible)

Lil bit buggy atm (1fps sometimes)

Easy on the battery (tips fedora)

Trash RNG (hard to get heroes you want)"
15944,"boring. 0/10. would pick something less than no, but that's not an option."
15945,"The game used to be fun, now it's too frustrating to give it a thumbs up. 
The biggest issue is the extreme reliance on RNG and as Valve has updated it, its gotten worse. Typically, by round 10, you'll have a good idea who is going to win the game, either by items, or by sheer luck with units, the person in first will have a massive income/net worth lead over everyone else. If you're in the bottom, you're pretty much 'looking forward' to playing a 20-40 minute game trying to place in the middle so you won't lose a rank. Alliances are always broken, and there is always 1-2 obvious metas. The other issues with alliances is that a few are dependant on items/alliance items to even be worth it. The gamble never seems to be worth it as its either you will get the item you need and do average or well, or you screwed yourself as transitioning is impossible with the shared/limited unit pool and the fact everyone is fighting over the meta picks. 

If you check the review rating graph, you'll notice that with each passing day, the proportion of negative reviews increases. it's almost 50/50 now; a pretty good indication that a lot of us players who enjoyed Underlords are getting sick of it. If they manage to fix the horrible imbalance and allow lots of different builds to be viable, I'll change my rating."
15946,Better get good RNG or your gonna have a bad time.
15947,"It's not for me. This game seems simple, but it has an extremely high learning curve much like Dota 2. I'm sure the pro players have strategies that let them consistently win, but for a casual like me it just feels like whether you win or lose is 100% dependent on the RNG. I don't find that fun."
15948,"I'm really close to giving this a thumbs up. Just too much RNG. I understand that better players will maximize their chances more often than worse players. But there is a TON of RNG. One game I had 3 2star units by round 6, the next game I didn't have a single 2 star unit until round 15. Both basically take the win/lose out of ur hands/

Fantastic game easy to learn highly recomend"
15958,"Until major patches change the direction of the game, RNG will be out of control."
15959,Great f'n game.
15960,"If you enjoy buggy games with half-baked concepts, this is the game for you.

Balance is atrocious, there are at most 2-3 builds in any meta so far that completely and utterly dominate. You don't play them, you don't win. Bugs and crashes galore. If Dota 2 was any indication, Valve will continue claiming that it's beta for 5 years or so, cash in and move on."
15961,"Fun game, best game."
15962,"I'm impressed how Valve keeps managing to consistently make this game worse with every single patch.        
Balance and polish? Nope, the priority seems to be pushing a garbage battle pass. 
"
15963,Good game
15964,"PSST!










YO!"
15965,"Unfortunately this isn't like autochess. Balancing might be an issue because there's too much RNG you have no control over and the shared pool of heroes and global items make the game kinda snowball if you know what you are doing. Once you have a team assembled you just spend your extra gold to prevent the second in place from getting a good piece they need.

It was fun to stomp a few matches but the shared pool means you can't really play around with synergy strats like the original autochess."
15966,I love it. Helps kill time.
15967,veri god game i like it
15968,"This game sucks. I'm boss level 1 and at this moment and at this level it's a boring RNG fest. You get a good global item - you win. You don't - nope. You get good re-rolls - you win. You don't - nope. You get 2 stars units early - you win. You don't - nope.

Same builds every game (3 or 4 of them, and that's it). Same units every game. Same positioning every game. It's very addictive though. But I do not think it's a good thing.

Also, the idea of a common pool of units  is a bull shit. Or I do not understand how it works. I go assassins, no one else goes assassins. Should be plenty of them in the pool for me, am I right? Nope. No assassins. And try to get Sand King - nope, nope, nope. Never.

230 hours of playing this crap on record. Got Sand King 3 or 4 times. What a joke.

And this one: if you get a good global item early, a first or a second pick, let's say, a bonus for hunters, you'll never get any unit that good for this bonus. Never. You'll be re-rolling early for hunters but there will be no hunters, even though no one has them on the field or on the benches. Just no hunters. No one has them, they should be in the pool, you should see them but nope. No hunters.

First creeps on level 10 you kill without any hunters. 10 levels and all your gold is lost to re-rolling - no hunters. Bull shit."
15969,"This is the dumbest concept for a video game I've ever seen. Use RNG to build a team you have no control over. Watch the computer play against itself. Choose new team members. Watch the computer. 

The people comparing this to chess have obviously never played chess. In chess, you get to choose which pieces move to which squares (which determines who you attack). You choose *NOTHING* in this game except which pieces you have on the board. This is not a game you play, it's a game that plays you. Quite literally.

 I think Valve has just given up at this point."
15970,"The game is... OK. There's very little strategy to play with despite how it may look at first. You are a slave to the RNG, there is no masterful play to be made that wins the day. 

Artifact is by far the better game if you just compare the actual game play. This game is a time sink, it's a candy coated nothing. Perfect for the masses..."
15971,"me, playing for the first time: what the hell is this trash, why is auto-chess even a genre

me, a week later: this is my favorite game"
15972,"Shit.e very often u place a unit and it don`t work so you lose  at which point you realise its no longer worth playing and quit. Ive never completed a game where less than 4 people leave.

basiclly Dota Chess with RNG = Shit  learn the game be lucky and win or don`t be lucky and leave yer not fun not good long winded.

0/10  just stupid a good idea but RNG instead of skill it like playing a fruit machine you have little effect on the outcome its luck.

Really digging this, I can easily see it taking a big segment of mobile competitive gaming. Can’t wait for the season to start!"
15983,too much RNG even though it's fun and Valve is doing good job in presentation and all. Not for me though.
15984,"Amazing game, no major bugs at all. You draft and build a team in an 8 man tournament. Each round you add to your team and you can level up each creature and gain more power. You start with 100 life, knocked out at 0. Some great fun and its free :)"
15985,i hate this game
15986,Nice game
15987,"100% RNG based.
 Got to Lieutenant 3 pretty quickly, using different strategies.
 Next 20 games for e.g 2 Luna's, 2 CK's by lvl 8.
 No one else is using either unit. By lvl 22 I still have no ranked them up I have two lvl 1 two stars, and a bunch of crap.
 If I stick to what I want, I don't get it. If I change strategy I'm still screwed. 
 Basically if you don't roll well in game you can't, not matter how well you play.

 Yes I made some comebacks, but it's still way WAY too RNG based might as well play headsortails.com and save yourself 30 mins."
15988,BEST GAME EVER
15989,"I saw autochess while in the exam session, but never tried it. Saw some videos, I thought why not, I'll try the mod. Then I saw Dota Underlords...it's pure fun! It's a sit-back, relaxing game with a bit of RNG and excitement on the end phase of the game. First seems boring, but it's actually fun when you start to get the idea of the game. I put in a few hours already, hope to put in more! Try it, give it a shot. I think looks best out of the AutoChess copies!"
15990,ok
15991,"I am not a big fan of this game because I feel there is more luck involved then skill.
I don't like to just watch the fight, I prefer to be in the fight so I can have a purpose while playing.
Maybe for other people it could be lovely, thats possible but not my type of game!"
15992,"the game is easy and relaxing, but it is too heavy for mobile phone, it can make your phone freeze, restart, blank or create dead pixels.. but it's a good game after all.."
15993,"Valve, please stop"
15994,This game doesn't even have a fucking functioning tutorial. They don't even teach new players how to play the game.

Even with 1HP you can come back the game as long you decide the great tactic againts your opponents (Well I just did that today). There is always high posibility of winning in this game. Even lose streak is helping for your win. Trust me this game is good to enhance your brain :)"

This is true to a certain extent but no more than a generic TCG. 
There is still an element of skills involved, it's fun and enjoyable and since I've picked this game up, I've been unable to put it down."
16019,"While it's very fun at the beginning you will soon realise that there is  a lot of luck involved.
The shop gives random heroes and you can go the whole game without getting a hero you want to level 2 while the enemy has their combo and level 3 on several heores.
I played till the boss league level so i'm not quite a beginner.
If you want luck involved it's a great if you'd rather rely on planning and strategy you will get dissapointed soon.

I won't say its not fun, because it is...to a point. Then you learn the meta pretty quickly, and learn that your true enemy is NOT the other players and their skill, but moreso the RNG of the game. If RNjesus smiles on you, you'll probably cakewalk most fights until end game. Don't get a couple teir 2 units before round 5? Then you'll be playing catch-up the rest of the game and be lucky to place better than bottom 3.

Kinda fun. Too grindy. No real skill involved. Too random.

16050,"Absolute garbage. Nobody ever plays it, and for a reason.

When playing against computer players, it uses rubber-banding to give them an advantage when they are falling behind, meaning that every game you ever play will at least be an hour long.

You can have a maximum of 10 pieces on the board in a game, but they only give you 8 slots in your reserve pool, so upgrading any character to three stars is next to impossible because you are trying to pick up all the characters you need.

The character pool is so large that trying to collect all the duplicate players you need to get a 3 star champ on the board is nearly impossible because you will never see 9 of them in one game.

Don't waste your time, because it will take a lot of your time to even realize how unbalanced rubbish this game is."

16055,"Dota Underlords hits a sweet spot for me. It is a drafting ""card"" game that throws you in a mini-tournament ( aka lobby ) Until there is one player standing. Strategies vary and there is always a different way to approach the game. Full games last 20+ minutes which may be a turn off for some but this is not a problem for me. I am extremely excited about more drafting format games that level the playing field and offer some fairness that just does not exist for other games. 

If you would like an idea of how addicting this game is > shows my playtime at 92 hours in the last two weeks. I have lost some sleep to this game for sure! I've almost hit 200 hours in this game and I can honestly say its one of the best-developed games I have played in years.

The play style was counter-intuitive to me at first but after a heaty amount of research and testing, I am consistently doing well. 

This game is still in its infancy and I am very excited how Steam handles seasons and updates in the future. The only concern that I have is how they plan on monetizing Inderlords. Currently, it is free for my computer and phone.

I highly recommend!
 
• Draft format = fairness
• Constant updates from developer = keeping the meta fresh 
• Game format = clean simple no frills. 
• Addictive = 9/10
• Mobile PC Support = Battery Dies on Phone - switch to PC midgame!"

16057,"Some people have been saying you can only enjoy this game if you're into Dota, and I want to chime in and say I've never been able to get into Dota, but am obsessed with this game.

You can learn the characters from this game independently no context from Dota 2 needed, in my opinion. 

So if you're hesitating because you don't know Dota give it a shot anyway especially with the bot matches that allow you to freeze the timers it's fun to learn about the characters, what they do, and how they interact with each other."

There you've got a gameplan that you prebuild the deck around, or in drafts find strong synergies from the options. Then you go and execute the plan with varying success. But you always know what vaguely to expect from your next draw. It makes you feel smarter that you anticipated that next card. In Underlords the only type of fun there is, is from popping up those boosters. I feel dumb when I don't get that one unit I need for 10 rerolls. No, I don't enjoy 'smashing no0bz'. You can't even compare them to deckbuilding games - last time I checked, they didn't scramble your buying options when your turn started in Dominion or Ascension. Just the simulator of opening packs, which you can do elsewhere online without wasting 40 minutes of watching units do their dance.

Then the gameplay:

First round: you can instantly loose health because you're not given any 2gold units, that you kind of need to spend the full gold. Then when you lock the shop, the bought-out spaces don't refill. Why won't you make them refill at the start of round? At least HS battlegrounds got that right. Ranked system let's you only go up, not down - it means you (or rather, I) will be facing normal guys no matter how atrocious you are at the game. What, you thought you'd be finding that ""fair"" match in ranked? 

I don't know, maybe the game should give you directions in the first couple of singleplayer missions? Like, ""You'd probably want to open shop and buy a couple units there"" Or ""Pudge has a hook that brings his opponents to him, just mentioning"". Obviously the first ones are easy as hell, it's the confusion you getting thrown right in there without any instructions...

The shop rng will screw you, then the little space on the bench will screw you from playing more than 3 units to 2-3 stars, then the in-battle rng will screw you. I don't know if the 2 people in the same battle actually see the same events.
Then what if I want to 3star that white unit - I need to get xp, but the higher level, the less chance there is to get white units! Also I have trouble with the items from creep encounters giving the tribe specific enhancements in the first 3 rounds when you don't know what you're going to build towards, and what the opponents will."
16060,"Game hard to win. No way!
Need improvement perfomance"
16061,"i like game
"
16062,The last patch brought the best balance I've seen(ofc not).
16063,"I have played Dota for almost 10 years (from Dota1). For each new patch, Valve always tries to balance heroes, buffs some heroes, nefts some others. Players never get bored whenever the new patch is released.

However, Dota Underlords CANNOT work in that way. At first it was fun, compared to Auto Chess. But please, Underlords is not Dota2. You cannot just buff this hero, neft others.

The latest patch (17th July 2019) made a huge mess. There are 8 players on board, 6 out 8 playing Primordial Alliance, Beast and some heroes who can summon units. Troll is a sign of winning. Who has the Troll (even 1 star) can secure their 1st or 2nd.
I can't even see the Knight, Assassin is totally disappeared, Mage is far long gone, Hunter is too weak comparing to other Alliances. If you wanna win, just need to Primordial Alliance and summoner (like Lycan, NP and Venomancer). Every single round, I have to fight  Arc Warden (so overpower).

I played Underlords for fun, keeping myself chill and relax. But because of fun, I have to uninstall the game.

Dota2, Valve got Icefrog. But Underlords, is Drodo there with you?
"
16064,"cant balance for shit, every game is either fallen win. piece off shit"
16065,"Valve's take on the Auto Chess genre. I have played multiple versions and I can say this one is my favorite. It still has a lot of things to improve on, esp on unit models. Unique mechanics like Alliance buffs add another depth to the game + QoL features (unit attack range info, alliance buff highlights, etc.) are a nice touch. It's not Half-Life 3 but it's not Artifact :D Overall gj volvo 8/10"
16066,FUN GAME!
16067,"Please less RNG, more strategy, keep the game length, don't try to compete with Riots game for ADHD kids with the attention span of a fly, thanks!"
16068,"This kind of game is a waste of time. It's gamble in disguise which is why people get hooked. RNG plays you, not vice versa. 
And balance is a major problem.. I uninstalled this game when it's Primodial meta. At least with MOBA, you don't enjoy meta you can play off meta and still win. This game is not that generous. You either go meta or get stomped.

EDIT: Well, i added more of my thought about this type of game (Auto-Battler). WARNING: wall of text

- People will abuse meta to the bone. Back in early days, open fort (don't spend money at all or spend very little) was mainstream because the more money you save in early rounds, the faster you become rich (interest system). Punishment of early rounds were not strong enough to discourage them. Early rounds are meaningless. People complained about open-forters. Then some updates came (which is the moment i edit this review), early rounds became harsher (which mean more important), game tended to end around turn 30 instead of turn 40, the game became more RNG than ever. You have to have good luck to roll 2 star units and good alliance so that you don't lose HP and don't need to spent money to reroll to prevent loss, so you will be richer while other unlucky players keep being poor. People complained again, what will Valve do? Whatever they do, it will become a snoozefest (money-saving meta, aka the slow-pace meta) or full RNG meta (early game meta, aka the fast pace meta).

- So half the time, you will be in the bottom half of the leaderboard. You look at the top 2, they have good comp and a lot of money. You can't beat that with skills. But also, half the time, you will be in the top, people in bottom look at you enviously. This also has nothing to do with skills. And this is the hook. People have some chance of winning, so they will keep playing the game. Would you still play the game if you keep losing? That's the case of Battle Royale game. Those games have bunch of players in 1 game (100 players), but it's skill based, so good players can consistently stay at top, while bad players will consistently stay at bottom. When bad players quit, good players will play with each other and we will have another batch of good players and bad players. It keeps grinding until not much players left to play the game, the game is dead.

- Auto-Battlers will live longer than Battle Royale i think, but you will feel bored beyond imagination at that time. The game has no skills. What top rank players call skills are just text book knowledge, which is very easy to remember. And that's why it's easy to write a good bot for the game. A lot of people say you can cruise to Boss rank, but it will become a lot harder to get Big Boss, let alone Lords. Of course it's harder when you group all players who know the same, act kinda the same, it will be RNG that decide everything. The players at top of the world in Auto-Battlers is the luckiest, not the best. Go ahead, use statistic in the future, i guarantee you none of them will stay in 1 place for too long, the ranking will keep shuffling in wide range. And i repeat, this is the hook of this kind of game: people play because they think they have a  shot, and indeed, they do have a shot.
So you want to know if God loves you, play this game. If not, play other games."
16069,DOTA Underlords has gone through some huge changes and the game has definitely improved. It's so easy to get lost in the game I lose track of time when I play. I would recommend this game as it's a unique genre that is done right.
16070,:(
16071,"The server is the worst server!! the game appears frequently is unable to connect the server and infinite falls the line the situation.
最差的服务器，最差的游戏体验！游戏经常出现无法连接服务器和无限掉线的情况。"
16072,"Early game: Pick Tiny, Razor, and Font of Creation.
Midgame: Pick Morphling, Arc Warden, and Crystal Maiden.

16074,dota undertrash >.<
16075,"Worst crap ever, it's buged as fuck and so unbalanaced 2 games in and i felt outraged...... never install"
16076,Very interisting!!!
16077,Loving It!!!
16078,Good game
16079,"I don't usually write reviews for games , but this game is way too fun . I recommend it highly if you are the type of gamer that likes to win using strategy , wits and intelligence"
16080,Needs more work but looks promising. ( If they do balance like Dota2 got it will rull all )
16081,"i'm just play a few hours 👊😎

-
9/10 👌"
16082,"I know this is early access but if the current balancing is a sign of anything to come, don't waste your time playing this game unless you want to learn how to build your team all over every new patch."
16083,"Fun game. I enjoy the amount of communication seen fron the underlords team. The game makes you think and change your startegy in a blink of an eye. I think it feels a little to fast, but you get use to the speed of the game."
16084,"Can't stop playing this... It must be coke or something!!

So, shut up and take my money already!"
16085,"Good dota chess game, like it +"
16086,game gets worse and worse
16087,"One session takes longer than 15 minutes on a toilet, so I cannot recommend it."
16088,"typical rng bullshittery. you will never win ever. when on turn 5 everyone has 3 three stars and you have none, its infuriating. most likely full of cheaters like hearthstone. zero enjoyment, zero tactics, skills involved. just pure luck. do not try if you are not the lucky asshole all the time."
16089,Addictive and fun game! The devs are excellent at communicating and are improving the games based on community feedback. It's got a promising future
16090,First steam game that i played with my smartphone! Awesome!
16091,yes!
16092,Dice game
16093,pretty good job so far!
16094,With every new update the game becomes less and less balanced. I also don't like the fact that a huge part of the game is just pure luck... I have to fight sometimes with lvl 1 units and a few lvl 2 against full lvl 2  units and lvl 3 ones....
16095,"Download, Play, lose your friends"
16096,not bad
16097,nice game
16098,"Really love this game, but i think it's not easy to get a 3 stars hero"
16099,"This is peak pc gaming.
Literally doing fuck all but rolling a dice and watching the npcs fight each other."
16100,Fun auto chess game that is getting updated frequently.
16101,"Fun game to play. Very exciting and Tricky with every match. Makes your brain work hard with those combinations of heroes, alliances, items, positioning etc. Great game for those strategists out there."
16102,"Slot machine simulator.

10/10 would pray to the gods of RNG again."
16103,ABSOLUTE BEAUTY
16104,"It has some fun mechanics and you have to try and plan for the whole game but in the end frustrating is the best way to describe this game. While you can plan everything and try adapt to what you get, in the end you get screwed over by the randomness of items and heroes every turn. Either that or you walk through the game easy, usually you know by round 10 and need to play all the way to round 30ish still.

In short, winning and losing is about 40% luck, which makes it so annoying at times."
16105,"+ Overall the best graphic out of any auto battler in mobile.
+ Cross play support between PC and mobile.
+ Less RNG than auto chess, with superior item's system.
+ Decent balance, fast bugs fix, constant update and balance patch.
- It's still an auto battler so there are still a lot RNG In this game.
- Performance still not optimized for mobile.
For me this is the best auto battler out there.
"
16106,Loving the current way the game is playing at the moment.
16107,It is a fantastic game. Really nice for a switch of pace after a couple of intense dota 2 games.
16108,"The last Patch killed a Game that was actually very much fun to play. Not only did they introduce Alliance Boni tiers (1 to 3) they even can now spawn in the first Creep round (ALL of them). They messed up the Hero Tiers (Trolls now have 1/1/2/5 good luck goin for Tier 2 Troll Bonus) Primordals are a near must have (Tier 2 Bonus is way to Strong). They changed a lot of Tiers completly unnessecary (like Goblins) and made common Stratagies just useless. All in all it is just a matter of pure luck if you even have a Chance of winning. The Randomness of hitting something usefull for your intended build, even if you keep it flexibel, is PURE Luck.
BTW was Boss 3 when Patch hit...

I will either go back to Dota Auto Chess or give TFT a Shot.. Maybe Valve did the same thing to their Auto Chess, that they did to their Card Game... Copy a good System (Dota Auto Chess) update/fix it. Release the first big Patch and mess up everything!"
16109,"This game is as balanced as the main Dota game but instead of actually playing it, you pray to RNGesus to get good items and units.

Very nice game indeed, 2/10.

"
16110,"pls fix about rank system. at lieautenant 1, im playing about 40 games and still not get promoted or demoted.  pls help me"
16111,iyot
16112,"After playing 2 hours of this game, the appeal to me was barely there. I was thinking, ""How boring can this be? I mean, I just sit here doing nothing but the game gives be these heroes who lose constantly"" and then asked myself why I didn't want to learn how the game worked. So I came back just in time for the Proto pass and I'm addicted like crack cocaine and I've played 50 hours in the last 2 weeks. The only issue I have so far, is the updating. Valve is great at communication and spreading their ideas and intentions, but when an update like the latest patch on July 18th, Ooh Wee does that just demotivate you like hell.

(The update believe it or not, broke the game in some places and made it ridiculously easier to lose now.)

I still love it because it is a strategy game like no other. Team fight tactics is awful and I'm not playing on Epic Games Launcher so Underlords must do for the rest of my life."
16113,yes
16114,what a fcuken RNG geym .
16115,Is this the breaking new genre? Automated Strategy Clicker...? Dissapointing
16116,"the best words to explain this game is it is COMPLETE NONSENSE.....

I really have no idea what works and what does't and i can not form any kind of strategy, because the minions do not fight with consistency.   Its the most frustrating game i have ever played..  

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS. Trust me, it will cause you so much frustration. THIS GAME IS JUST GARBAGE"
16117,Good Game cross platform balance!
16118,Nice
16119,"morphling+tiny, these t1+t2 combo is much much stronger than most 2 t4 units. 
This game is full of it! Too OP!
While t5 medusa and enigma are too weak.

And hope this game can change pace to slower to let players see any t4+ unit grow to 3 stars."
16120,Still inferior to Auto Chess. Small indy company.
16121,how can you possibly copy a game made by some random chinese people and make it worse? only valve
16122,"normally frequent updates would be a good thing, but then they break things while fixing others which then fucks you in the matchmaking. you read the patch notes and turns out alliances where not working correctly.  so many god damn changes so often really messes the game up for me. by the time you figure out the alliances and units, they change them again. i think ill wait for the dust to settle and for them to make up their damn minds as far as what they want alliances to do. latest patch specifically completely flips the game on its head."
16123,After no llifeing this game for 3 days I can definitely say I achieved a new level of virginity
16124,like
16125,Lots of RNG
16126,"Probably the best AutoChess game out there... now that doesn't say much as AutoChess in general is pretty unfun by default.
No real gameplay, no real strategy, just RNG and wasting an entire hour each ""match"".
Just a fad that will die off soon enough."
16127,Very relax
16128,"This game has a lot of great things going for it.  If you love combining strategy with adaptability this game is for you!  It quickly became my new obsession.

Since this game is still in beta I would like to offer some constructive criticism for Valve.  Please consider these two items to improve the player experience:

1. Cheating Bots
While playing against  more difficult bots I have noticed near impossible advancements on their team.  One specific example was in the final two rounds between me and the last bot he had 3, 3 star units.  Then on the very next round he had magically attained *5* 3 star units!  Unless he was benching 2, 2 stars, had 2 extra units for each of those, and then attained 1 pf each set, it really isn't feasible.  So my loss to that boss did not feel fair.

2. Game times
The rounds take an extensive amount of time to complete from start to finish.  I would prefer less rounds and a total playtime of a half hour.

Excellent game so far, I've really enjoyed it!"
16129,Just awesome. Need some good damn strategy to surpass. Well developed game. Getting awesome day by day.
16130,"leaderbord for what for a game lucky or not, noting pro there just luky"
16131,"A surprisingly engaging, approachable new game. 

Granted I have around 5k hours in Dota 2, so I was already plenty familiar with all of the characters involved; but there were still many new mechanics to get into and understand! Thankfully, the tutorial is fairly helpful to get you up and started, and there is plenty of opportunity for experimentation.

My only caveat is that each match can be a bit long. Other than that, it is a wholly positive experience."
16132,i wouldn't play this game as a main Auto Chess but it teaches you the basics of Auto Chess really well and has a clean overlay that enables quick learning and getting used to
16133,Good game
16134,"If you fancy sitting there doing almost nothing for an hour, with the exception of some unexciting RNG shopping, this is the game for you."
16135,Very cool game you can play it for hours and you are not going to be bored
16136,"As long as there are unviable units and unviable items, there will always be strong metas and the game is an RNG simulator towards these metas or away from shadow shamans and claymore"
16137,FUN & INTERACTIVE
16138,Unbalanced game since the recent update. Gg volvo. Rip.
16139,gooooooooooooood
16140,Cool to play just like Dota 2 Auto Chess <3
16141,"Dota Underlords aka ""DOTA RNGlords"" is an auto-chess game made by Valve and proof that Valve can still make decent games despite the very mobile level of quality of said game (its even crossplatform). Game essentially is turn based multi player battle royal auto chess where you place heroes and they fight on each turn and you draw new heroes as each turn passes. 

The game does have some skill and is not purely RNG as you advance through the ranks you will note this as you start to climb the tiers and play with more skilled players. Game is mostly around adapting to the RNG and trying to time your buy/upgrades in conjunction with your opponents thus balancing your gold hoarding, upgrades and life preservation. Ultimately though the game does often come down to some RNG....but all the same I place consistently in the top half by utilizing tactics although placement between individual players is often RNG-ish.....so I am pretty good and know what I'm talking about.....

...that being said though......

I BELIEVE IN THE HEART OF THE CARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
16142,its suck now
16143,Always want to play one more  game more :) I'm not dota 2 player but im very like that game. Only one minus - for one game you need at least 30 minutes.
16144,"This game is like trying to win the lottery. More luck than skill which is not my cup of tea. Not worth wasting your time and getting tilted over not getting what you wanted. Go enjoy your life, there are plenty more nice things to do!"
16145,So whats the deal with the money hack that ive been seeing about? Round 2 70 gold like are you serious? please fix this
16146,I wipe away my salty tears and head back in. I'm in a emtion filled headspace right now and I love it. 10/10 would angry cry for this game again!
16147,Great game untill the latest patch.. Alliances doesent matter anymore all you have to do is spam high level units and get lucky to get a level 3 hero.
16148,"5 seconds of decision followed by minutes of waiting, repeated ad nauseum."
16149,Valve may be on to something...
16150,Berry Nice
16151,"Very repetitive and kind of unbalanced atm, but still a lot of fun."
16152,crap
16153,pure shit
16154,"Extremely fun and easy to get into strategy title. Having knowledge of Dota isn't required, although enjoying its flavor definitely helps aesthetically. The gameplay is reminiscent of a card drafting game, for those familiar with tabletop gaming. It's free to play and doesn't even ask for a nickel in early access, so there's no reason not to give it a try!"
16155,"For now, this game leaves no room for creativity and is just about getting to 2 copypaste builds.
It's the same every time."
16156,"Very match RNG generator, yes you knowledge and skills matter but they can't beat RNG."
16157,"Can't recommend this game after the last patch. Devs clearly don't know what they are doing. The game started as an basic copy of Dota Auto Chess with some very needed improvements such as itens, bug fixes, etc; But the core elements were still there.

Now is the first true patch where devs decided to really try out what they think would be good for the game, and boy oh boy, it's pretty shitty IMO. Seriously thinking on migrating to TFT after this..."
16158,fun gaem
16159,Awesome game with a lot of patches it's awesome to have some fresh updates every week
16160,0/11
16161,Fun autochess game. Try it.
16162,Nc game but android and pc pleasse same update don't pc first
16163,"win=pure skill game
lose=pure luck game"
16164,"full of bugs, besides the RNG, sometime the minions just EROR 404 don't atack like for 2-3 secs GG"
16165,"Wow, I am am addicted to this game and I am generally not a strategy game player. A lot of fun.  Easy to get started and incredibly deep and difficult to master. There are so many different approaches to take with the alliances you choose. There is a lot of RNG to it, which can be frustrating at times, but that is also what can make things interesting. as it can prevent players from just taking one good strategy and just using it every time they play.  The RNG forces you to explore all the alliances and playstyles.  Definitely a game I'll be playing long into the future."
16166,Goof game
16167,"While I do not think the game is bad, I still do not recommend it and that is simply because it relies on RNG layers.
Will I get the right heros?
Will I get the right items?
Will my heros attack the right targets?
Will they use their skills?
Will they use their skill on the right target/in the right direction?
WIll my enemy shortly change their positioning?
Will I face this guy or maybe one of the other 8 people?
It is a casual experience that has a certain depth of mechanics/tactics with positioning, lineup etc but at the end of the day, RNG is what makes you win.

I do understand that some people say you have some sort of control over things by positioning and equipping the items to the right heroes. While that is not wrong, it is also not entirely true. 
Some heroes have skills that rely on RNG. For example Phantom Assasin that crits with a certain percentage. That means she can jump across the board and oneshot a hero in your backline. Or maybe she will jump in the back, do ~5 hits without a crit and get wiped without ever being a real threat. 
You can also have a relatively good line up depending on what you were able to buy. But you can also do the absolut best and always make the right decisions but somebody was lucky and upgraded a hero to level 3 in round 15 mopping the floor with your line up. 
Losing isn't fun but neither is winning because your enemy never stood a chance only because they had bad luck.

edit1: It is worth mentioning that the game still is in beta. That being said since the latest update it keeps on crashing randomly. date: 25.07.19
edit2: 30.07.19 it seems like the crashing has been resolved and balance is on it's way. Still, the layers of RNG are a problem and what came to my mind is the following addition: the game is based on Dota2. Dota2 is a game where a comeback is possible if you play your chances right. In this game this is just not the case which honestly is a shame since the game for itself isn't bad at all.
edit3: now since it is released I can add the following things: the battlepass for 4,40€ is worth if you like Underlords. The layers of RNG are just as bad as they used to be since there still is only one pool of units. Therefore as soon as smb uses the same alliances as you, you will not get these units. It is just a complete unneeded design choice since it makes it possible for one player to ruin the game for another player. Can't win but don't want smb else to win either? Just pick their units. It'll ruin their early/mid game and will render the game unrecoverable. Grrrreat. Also Valve please stop using this interface code base, it is just so incredibly bad on all levels. It is buggy and NOT viable, it is on par with flash based dropdown menus on webpages. Nightmare material. Also fix brawny units in knockout, absolutely broken"
16168,good
16169,Great game. Great devs. Yo.
16170,relax papega
16171,"What an update....
since last update game become much more unbalanced with OP pair between Mage and primordials and ofc warlock.
every player who got mage and primordials first guarantee win the game.
Good job valve..."
16172,Pretty decent game to play when you're bored.
16173,"the new mid-season update is not how you balance the game, you make it worst... good job valve. you can't even ""remake"" games, like you see how fast artifact dies out, please stop pretending to rival other games and focus on 1 goddamn thing at a time."
16174,"Underlords is so good, it's JUST like the mod for Dota 2, except for the fact you:

>can win without even using synergies
>fuck it just put multiple anti-mages and bloodseekers out there
>oh you have a full 9 stack of warriors?
>too bad because nothing will die anymore if you have a single omniknight

Other than that it's great, at least I don't have to go 37 rounds on a streak before losing to horseshit anymore."
16175,nice game
16176,free & great game when poop
16177,"if noone vote a positive review,is better do a negative review,yep."
16178,"Never play Dota2, but this game hooked me right away.
It's addicting, trust me"
16179,"Used to love this game!  Was totally addicted.  Each patch is making the game less and less fun with ZERO fucking consistency.  There is no point in learning anything because they change the game so drastically.  Combos that win one week will lose you the next.  Far too rng focussed, and just really boring.  Declining player numbers are a great indicator that the devs are clueless."
16180,yes
16181,Complete garbage. Incompetent developer who´s making the game worse with every patch.
16182,"one of the best, if not the best auto chess game out there
the graphics are good and the game play is amazing 
i love the style and the features it has to offer

i would highly recommend this game to anyone that loves auto chess
10/10

XD I love this"
16183,Strats and eco!
16184,FUN GAME
16185,Interesting game
16186,"Well done game, quite fun to play.
Somehow the heropool and drafting process needs attention as RNG can make your session very frustrating.
Items are even more  influental and even more RNG.
To often I end up with a build enforced on me because others were luckier early on and items that dont match.
THumbs up anyway...."
16187,"Que pedo con este juego? llegue a jugar contra un jugador, osea solo quedabamos 1vs1, le gane 4 veces seguidas, y no podia sacarle los 5 puntos de vida que le quedaban, pero el man me ganaba una y me bajaba todo, que asquerosidad."
16188,I no life this game 24/7 now. It's a perfect auto chess game with consistently changing meta and updates. Literally 0 microtransactions as far as I have seen.
16189,"Thank you Valve, very cool!"
16190,"Utterly hating the game. Tried it when i first saw it in steam, figured 'sure, why not? I haven't played autochess before.' Holy f** is this game luck based. After numerous games, including a couple at first where i didn't realize how getting multiple of the same units increased their power because of the lack of instruction, I'm at a 50% win chance vs easy bots and have yet to have won a medium bot difficulty game.  Didn't matter how adaptive I tried to be, position reworks, or anything else. I was always f** from the outset. Steer clear and wide of this unless you can just embrace the sacrifices to rnjesus and don't get too invested."
16191,"good game, very addict!"
16192,Is good
16193,"Played it allot. Had some wins, had some losses. Was 1st out of 8 player a few times. Was never last or 8th. Yet there are some strategies and skills involved. LUCK and RANDOMNESS plays a much higher role than skill. You can be the most skillful player with the best strategies, or even the best at being flexible and changing as much possible. If you get dealt a bad hand few times, the person winning will win the game due to interest and a winning streak. Skill cannot beat luck and randomness in this game."
16194,This game taught me not to gamble with 50 coins.
16195,is this auto teamfight chess tactics?
16196,ggwp
16197,Fun AF.
16198,"Game wasn't half bad before update. They want to ruin it, I understand. Lets take an OK game and make it worse!
Game can be fun but..... its trash"
16199,"As a non-gamer and casual person, I love the dynamics of this genre, it is fluid and smooth on iPad (2017/5th gen). Great touchscreen experince!"
16200,"Just downloaded on my iphone 6s, was able to connect to multiplayer through wifi, won the game.

I'm beyond frustrated at this point. There is utter silence on this connectivity issue. Using a Windows laptop and wifi not working properly. If my phone connects through the same wifi and is successful, why can't my laptop?

Then to only top it all off, since the update before last the game doesn't even start. Black screen and crash. Latest update AT LEAST said their was a problem and also stated they changed the code to where the crashing would end but NOPE.

Since the day before Open Beta my Underlords experience has been disappointing. The game itself was fun to me. Lack on communication, acknowledgement, or any transparency has been quite distasteful. I've been gaming for 20+ years and I've never felt so distant from Developers as I have felt with this game."
16201,This game is beautiful for people without love..
16202,Card games actually feel less RNG-based now after playing this. Thanks Valve!
16203,constantly disconnects. Literally was about to get my first win and game disconnects and wont let me reconnect even after restart. Sick Servers Gaben
16204,Terrible Balance
16205,"each update creates more dependence on luck, making a game a waste of time unless by luck you get lucky. because you either ride the momentum to victory or lose. there is very little chance of recovering from a losing momentum... unless you get lucky. made me realize why people get addicted to slot machines. it was sweet that once i got a beastmaster with 11000 hp and the odd op combo, but like slot machines some you win, often you lose. overall time consuming, and the fun is decided by a coin toss."
16206,"Just like rigged slot machines.
And now you also have to grind underlords levels. Absolutely trash"
16207,yes
16208,I don't like it.
16209,City crawl is bugged but decent time waster
16210,-
16211,"You know it when you play this game, slowly but sure, gaben is taking your soul, you play you lose"
16212,"Very fun game, Worth a try!"
16213,"Gambling slot, the game."
16214,I LIKE IT A LOT!
16215,Best autochess on the market even if it`s still work in progress. Big surprise from Valve after Artifact fiasco.
16216,"Artifact without cards and with more RNG

stoopid :D"
16217,gud
16218,too much RNG
16219,awesome
16220,I approve.
16221,"It's a Dota-themed skin for roulette, but it's fun w/ friends!"
16222,Neat
16223,"Depends on luck? 50% true. But this also need strategy to win, and it's addicting!. Good job for this mod, Valve!"
16224,"My phone ran out of battery so I decided to download it on my pc to play, I believe this to be a sign of a good game."
16225,Un joc frumos cu un potential si mai frumos!
16226,Time killer game..worth it to play. Hope many features and rewards will come. Good job!! Keep improve!!
16227,"0 skill involved , purely luck  based game  which only makes you so frustrating ."
16228,"This is not a serious competitive game but is fun if you can deal with random luck aspect. I found that I get must fun out of this game if I just do random unit experiments and don't care how much I get wiped trough floor. Sometimes I win sometimes I get my ass handed to me. Sure you can try to get to the top but even your master plans can fail due to the random unit and item selection and this is when this game shows it weak points. You can't do everything with skill and talent. 
It's a fun game if you don't take it too seriously."
16229,"Great little game that could almost qualify as an idle game crossed with a team management sim.

Battles play themselves but you have to actively manage your team. 
RNG does play a role in item and troop selection, so be warned :)

Lots of options for solo and multiplayer.

Recommended for play with headaches as you can set up a bot battle and have turns only advance when you want them too.

(Also reviewed by me via the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HeadachesandMigraines]Headache & Migraine Gaming Group[/url])"
16230,You can play this game one-handed which allows for some multi-tasking with your other hand. Huge win in my book.
16231,actually really good holy shit
16232,Yo
16233,Better interface and more accessible than TeamfightTactics
16234,penile excrement
16235,addictive
16236,Good shit.
16237,This game is way to RNG
16238,"I started a game, but 5 rounds in I had to step away from the PC

I came back at round 15 and was in 4th place

I then realized this is not a well designed game."
16239,"So damn good, hopefully it keeps up through the test of time!"
16240,"Awesome, much better than TFT."
16241,"play it or dont i couldnt give a whopping shitfuck less what you do, but please, for the love of gaben, just stop putting pineapple on pizza."
16242,ASDFDS
16243,"Just a shit-ass boring free game for phones

Update- Game is still a piece of shit."
16244,"When the devs actually put some effort into balancing, rather than listening to any random with a reddit account, ill try it again. 
Definitely worth checking out if youve never done auto chess, but ive come to believe there are better ones out there (like the original dota auto chess and the league one). 
Still, worth trying.... just dont expect a GOOD game that is up to par with most competitive games."
16245,Best free game I've played.  Can't wait to see more from it in further updates.
16246,Insanely addictive
16247,FUN
16248,Its fine I suppose but for Valve standards its VERY lackluster.
16249,good game
16250,Crashing on startup making this game unplayable.
16251,Fun way to kill some time at work!
16252,"I've been playing this game and I thoroughly enjoy it. Good for passing the time, easy to pick up and play. Alliances work great, Items could use a bit of work though. A few different alliances can use a bit of a nerf.

RNG is a killer though. You'll build a great Alliance, need one specific unit and then spend all your re-roll gold just to miss out.

Enjoyable"
16253,hopefully future patches will resolve balancing issue. nevertheless enjoyable game. recommended.
16254,it's an RNG game like 50/50
16255,Very nice game.
16256,well well well. nice
16257,game cukup lumayan oke nihh
16258,非常好玩，吹爆
16259,"Not great, very confusing and poorly made tutorial for beginners. Small file size and quick download is a plus though

"
16260,Boring.. but fun
16261,gg
16262,"Ridiculous battle and unit drop RNG make this game more frustrating than getting 4 random Russians in your Dota team... 

Most of the alliances are garbage and the meta revolves around building 3 out of 5 different overpowered units in any of the three viable combos that actually do something.

+ the amount of waiting around doing nothing amounts to passing Total Warhammer turns.




But it's fun when you are winning, innit bruv?"
16263,"why plague ward is didnt have 100% magic resist, thats confusing meh Gabennnnnnnnnn. but i love this game euehhehehehe"
16264,ds
16265,"aaaaaaaaaa, gw gk tau cara ripiw, tpi mantep lah xD xD"
16266,топчинская игра сооветую
16267,"VALVE is trying to improve the Autochess in their own way to make it better. Unfortunately, underlord is not as fun as autochess, losing a lot of fun factors... boring and dull.."
16268,f c k this game
16269,0/10 NEEDS BATTLE ROYALE MODE
16270,"Well this game is good. It is indeed a strategy game. We choose which class and combo is the best for the situation. But it's depend more on your luck. The hero you can buy is very random. Sometimes you get the hero you want and able to upgrade them, and sometimes you never found the hero you looking for. Because of that you need to change the formation and combos, that cause a lot of problem. That make you lose to the guy that already have many high level heroes and combo. I hope someone fix or change how the hero shop work. Like first slot is for savage or other slot, so it's not very randomized. Thank You."
16271,great game
16272,"Well after 100 hours I guess I'll comment.
Fun easy auto chess game totally based on RNG
There is absolutely 0 skill in this game after the first 50 hours playing. 
You've learned the combos of teams and realized it means shit cause all that matters is RNG. 

Ranking is total garbage, You could win 7 games in a row and not go up a rank because of one loss to RNG in the middle. The game heavily favors demoting even at low ranks. It's a huge turn off and even if you're in the top 4 99% of the time. You will still be deranking. So the end game is shit to me because of this. Otherwise a great game and looking forward to the patch tomorrow that changes up AI and balancing issues. Hopefully they fix the ranking otherwise it's about time to go dive further into TFT.
Edit: Patch was garbage. Company literally owns steam and cant even bother to add content. No wonder this shits dead already."
16273,"Literally just luck. There is no strategy involved, the game plays itself, and all you need to do is be lucky enough to get upgrades for those few units that are worth playing and you win. If you don't get lucky enough to get upgrades for those units, you lose.

To put it even shorter: Mobile shit on PC once again. I'd rather play Dota."
16274,Pretty sick game. Friggen give’r a rip.
16275,Game plays by itself and makes me question my existence.
16276,to say i'm not a big dota fan but i played one game of this and it was really fun i may not be good at it but that is fine i will say is new game is great
16277,"The game is awesome in it's own right. Addictive and tactical. Yes tactical. I have had several occasions where the computer wiped the floor with me, only to loose after I change the disposition of my units. Recommended, but watch your time."
16278,"After wasting thousands of hours in dota and finally quiting it, Gaben came back after me with this game..
back to being addicted"
16279,Haven't played much but its ok.
16280,"Get ur shot of digital Blow, NOW!"
16281,RNG stupid
16282,"Tell me pls, why 1 man have 2 refreshers orb but i 
in the same time have 3 items absolutely unnecessary?! FIX items, pls. Fix balance, pls. 
Or write in big letters ""The game is absolutely RANDOM"".

UPDATE:
Stalo huze chem bulo"
16283,cool game
16284,"I can't understand all positive reviews. It's not a game, it's rather one arm bandit where all you can choose is another icon. Brainless AF, product aimed at zombies sitting all day and watching their screens without understanding. Complete waste of time!"
16285,good game
16286,"Turn back now, while there's still time."
16287,ass
16288,fun game! :)
16289,"Try as I might, I'm unable to squeeze any fun out of this game. It is simply too reliant on the luck of what you are offered to be enjoyable.

With other strategy games, one at least feels like they could have done something to play better. With Underlords, you will often know what you need to counter the opponents that can beat you, but the game will simply not offer you any of the pieces necessary to act on this idea. For example, your opponent may have been given a bounty of Knights which gain percentage damage resist. To counter this, you need to break their formation with Tiny's toss or a Force Staff. However, the game probably will just not offer you these options.

This, coupled with the way the gold system works means that the lucky player who gets offered enough units to combine by the second round can coast on that without spending additional gold, allowing them to level up faster and snowball even harder."
16290,[b](Y)[/b]
16291,"not enough gold i need gold so im not a welfare bum, and lycan is too hard to find 3.3/10"
16292,"NICE GAME BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY :((
"
16293,Nice game but how rank works? I always on place 2 or 3 but still stuck at Smuggler 1 -_-
16294,"Game of 80% luck and 20% skill, frustrating when people get multiples every time and you get nothing.

Very boring very fast, generally another game for those that rely mainly on luck over skill, of course there is a little bit of skill, about the same as winning at a casino"
16295,has nothing to do with dota besides the hero figures.
16296,"Meta destroy's any fun the game has. Too much RNG, which also takes the fun away.
So, no thanks."
16297,This game suffers from the same problems as dota and league. For instance there is already an established meta and playing anything else will only net you losses. These game devs are asleep at the wheel.
16298,"its nice. probably most polished auto chess game right now.

if you like the genre try it. 

me personally finding it kinda okay. not bad not good"
16299,Mmm C H E S S but Dota
16300,"Cracking offshoot game from Dota2. Its beautifully presented, plays well and is always challenging to play against your fellow humans. There's plenty of depth in the character and alliance combos, lots of items and buffs you can get for your characters and the challenge of levelling your rank to the Lord of the White Spire is quite addictive.

Downside for some will be the learning curve if your not familiar with the Dota 2 characters and lore (although you'll pick it up pretty quickly I'd imagine) and the fact the game itself is pretty repetitive - in fact most games are to be honest!

Still plenty of enjoyment to be had, lots of development going on with a battle pass adding cosmetics for completing games and challenges. With more on the horizon there's a lot going for DOTA UNDERLORDS.

Check it out, its free to play too. I recommend it!"
16301,"They fucked the RNG, the ranksystem i shit and they dont know how to make a ranksystem!
Otherwise great game!"
16302,GG
16303,"I'm recommending only because the price is right.

The core mechanisms work fine, though it's pretty underhanded to rip off someone else's game design.

The heroes and factions aren't balanced, nor should they be, because if everything was balanced you could draft whatever you wanted and do just fine.

However, some of the factions are just downright bad, and that's an issue.  Magic the Gathering has some weak cards, but there are thousands of cards, so it doesn't much matter.  In a game with so few characters, having some terrible ones is a real problem.

In other words, you should be able to win with any hero on your roster as long as you build the roster right, and that's really not possible currently.

It's in early access, it will change, but this is how I see it right now."
16304,"As a game that encourages battle passes and 'ranks', its simply ridiculous that it relies on RNG mechanics.  Game can be an extremely casual play at best, little room for improvement down the line.  No matter how well you play, somebody who gets better luck than you in a match will most likely out-synergize you at the end of a game, which after spending 20 minutes reaching, is a huge waste of time IMO.  Many games have achieved success with such luck-based elements, but most of them are akin to mobile based games that cant have a game last more than 3 minutes.  I expect this to flop if it ever charges money down the line."
16305,"[b]Perfect Games[b]
i like how valve develop and make underlords better, such battlepass adding map and make gameplay competitive"
16306,The fight is automatic. I got bored in the tutorial.
16307,aa
16308,dope game
16309,Love love love this game! No toxic chat arguments and noobs can't ride on other people's backs! 15/10 would play again.
16310,Better than Artifacts for sure.
16311,nice game
16312,this is nice game
16313,troll knight is gay
16314,The sad mans autochess. Go play Teamfight Tactics its quite a bit better with 3 items per character and upgradeable items.
16315,still many bug
16316,not bad
16317,So gud
16318,Enigmatically good.
16319,"Waiting Simulator.
80% of the game is watching your dudes fight.
Add RNG fiesta on top of that."
16320,Simply the best autobattler. Do not listen to those who cry on rng. They are simply too stupid to learn how to play.
16321,May need rehab.
16322,I can't stop playing!!!
16323,mantap mamang
16324,"I played  DOTA back in SC days, not a huge fan now of DOTA but you got yourself a decent little game here.  No two matches are the same, decent amount of items and lots options for builds. Skill and thought is required while being a laid back all at the same time. It's Free.."
16325,Me like it
16326,"Valve only good when ""remaking"" some mod on their games"
16327,"Yeah this game was dead on arrival, which is a shame because I think it'd be a good fit for the Deck.
Still recommend it if you wanna play with friends."
16328,"It's a great game as it is, and I can't wait for this game to continue to expand!"
16329,"As of me writing this review, the game is free with no monetization. It's definitely still a beta, but polished enough to feel finished in most respects. There's honestly no reason not to at least try it."
16330,It is good game
16331,"Really fun relaxing type game.
Has a small learning curve but looking into the stuff its gets pretty easy.
Valve does a great job putting a lot of the info into the game for you so you don't have to look far.
I've enjoyed my time with it and would recommend anyone to play it if they like these kind of games. 
"
16332,"this title fulfils the primal essence of a GAME, it's easy to play and relaxing. :)"
16333,a little daunting compared to a couple of other auto chess. However it is very fun and the pprto pass you get for free already has some good things you can get. i would recommend trying it out at least during this beta period to see if this is for you. Underlords also gets bonus points for being able to play on your pc or on your mobile if you want.
16334,"Fun and addictive. Need to be improved, but it's in a really good way!"
16335,не затянуло((
16336,it is a good game.
16337,If u want play this just click and play
16338,"Season 1 changed the game alot, extremely fun. Might get frustated sometimes from the RNG but thats part of the experience.

9/10 Battle Pass is also great, reasonable price."
16339,"Good

16343,DROOLIES R COOL
16344,"Brilliant idea, but unfortunately is based purely on luck.. the worst players can get lucky with hero pools and stomp any plans you had.. with each lose it knocks you further behind.
Rng and luck based mechanics has no place in strategy games. period."
16345,I think this is better than any one out there. I enjoyed it a lot. Its would be great if Value make it more compact for the mobile.
16346,Pretty fun
16347,You can play it on your phone.
16348,"Tried it out on my phone after I saw it on the Play Store. Personally I haven't played Dota before because I don't like the playstyle of it but I'm a big fan of Auto Chess and I have to say this game on mobile and PC, with frequent changes and an active community? It's one of Valve's litte gems."
16349,"Polished and addictive, especially now that there are little cosmetic rewards for levelling up. Once you figure out winning synergies and unit placement, it becomes incredibly satisfying to do well every game. Looking forward to each new update!"
16350,macos version of this game drains battery like crazy even though I have charger plugged in. Lots of people I know also experience the same issue.
16351,"This doesnt look like a Valve game it looks like a garbage mobile game, as it turns out this game is now on mobile so cool. I couldnt even get through the tutorial I was so disappointed when I already knew what to expect like what even is this game valve. Only reason I played it is just in case valve gives something to beta players when the game is released."
16352,why do only the worst wc3 custom games get made into actual games? it feels like a mix of being a data input technician and clicking on a random number generator.
16353,if you have good luck and small brain play this game

dnt waste ur time on a random game all luck 0 skill

16365,"If you have RNG GOD on your side then go ahead and play. 
Otherwise, don't ever think about playing this stupidest game ever made =)"
16366,good game
16367,"Basically, Valve carried over the white noise problem, lack of visual feedback, snowballing mechanics and clusterfuck UI from Dota 2 and Artifact, but this time you don't even get to control a character.

This is now the third ""Dota title"", and the third game Valve has made in a row where vast potential for depth is deliberately thrown away in favor of tactically braindead ""synergies"" or ""talents"". If ex-Valve employees hadn't already confirmed multiple times by now that all Valve cares about is easy money, I would seriously question their ability to design."
16368,Beta but not bad
16369,Great game put lots of time into it the skill needed i feel has a decent ceiling. I would say that it at times can be a little too RNG heavy compared to other auto chess games. Still would reccomend as i feel the monster set is the best.
16370,"BE CAREFUL OF MISLEADING REVIEW IN THIS STORE PAGE. ALL DotA FAN BOY MIGHT GIVE THIS GAME POSITIVE REVIEW.

DOTA UNDERLORD ? MORE LIKE, DOTA UNDERKNIGHT.

[u]You may enjoy this game casually.[/u] But, if you try to really get good at this, you will disappoint.

Con :
- Lack of balance (knight build in every match, and cant counter in mid-late game if you are not flexible in strategy)
- Hard to coming back at late game
- RNG is too much (imagine you want build anti-knight build but the shop is always giving you trash)
- Knight is very overpowered s . h . i . t
- Shop is rigged (maybe because the hero is too much / not balance between tier grading)


I will edit this if there is improvement upgrade in further patch. But for now, just play Chess Rush from Tencent. It's more enjoyable. (its not an advertisement)"
16371,Its a fine game. It is pretty random and you dont have much impact if you win or lose. Also 3 Star common units are to stong so just leep stacking. The game has many flaws but its still a pretty nice time killer.
16372,"Makes original game (artifact) - fails
makes there own version of existing popular game (counterstrike,Autochess) - succeeds

16380,Pretty bad and boring.
16381,"It's a fun game, but you cant take it yet seriously, the RNG is a huge deal atleast 60% of your games are decided by it. But still as i said, its a fun game, still in development and they work hard on it. Sooner or later they will improve RNG issues, and then it will be a true strategic card game."
16382,Has the version of Dota Auto Chess that came out in the beginning and is very enjoyable. The alliances feel balanced somewhat except knights.
16383,"Edit: Dagon says ""random"" but it's unreliable to get multiple. So don't.

it's just Autochess but under Valve's name entirely now. Same old boring RNG fest. nothing interesting happens. it's hardly even fun to watch, let alone take up system resources"
16384,noice
16385,"really fun but as of right now RNG for pieces and global items determines whether you win or lose. piece frequency and global item frequency for certain synergies/heroes should increase if you buy those certain pieces. plus, this is horribly optimized on mobile. Auto Chess feels more balanced and less RNG than Underlords. I wanna give this a positive review but right now it has a lot of gameplay issues."
16386,"awesome
"
16387,This game is really good and enjoyable and still has so much potential. The dev team on this game is extremely on point. The improvements made during the first month of this game being available is amazing. And the dev communicates with the community so effectively that it feels refreshing from valve.

16398,"Well after playing like all of the three big Auto Battlers (DAC, TFT and Underlords) I can clearly say although I like the heroes, alliances and the look of DAC more Dota Unerlords is the best as a game of all three. It has a tutorial which helps new players to get into the game, it has bot games which is also nice to practice and it already has a ranked mode (looking at you TFT). It has the best item system as you get always one in a creep round, it reminds you to put another piece on your board if you can, it marks pieces in the shop, if they share an alliance with another piece or give you an upgrade for a piece, it has something new with additional buffs for alliances and you can easily overlook what the other players try to build. Overall a pretty good game with many QoL functions I like, but I will be watching the development of the other Auto Battlers."
16399,10/10

16409,(y)
16410,I just got into the autochess genre with the LoL version but then I found this.  Works on my phone and on my pc.  It is a blast to play.  I think I prefer this to the LoL version.
16411,"I stop playing dota for this shit
"
16412,"The good:
- RNG is bit unforgiving (compare to the mod)
- If your potato PC can run DOTA 2 then this one works too 
- Global Item (which is unique feature on this game)
- Items can reuse to other heroes 
- Cross-play with your mobile devices

The bad:
- If RNG hates you (ended up bottom 4)
- If RNG still hates you (because you can't get items needed for your heroes)
- Bugs (what do we expect it's Beta)"
16413,improved game of autochess from dota2 but still need improvement
16414,"Wow cool game, thank you for creating 😊"
16415,"This game is ruled by the RNG, which sucks, but the thing that I hate the most is that the more heroes are bought, the less they spawn (for this reason, there's people that buys and sells them to make others lose the possibility to evolve their heroes), hence making it impossible most of the times to have a decent squand and thus losing literally 90% of the games, which is as stupid as it could be. The only ones who like this game are DotA players, and this fact alone speaks for itself. Autochess are nice, but this one totally sucks."

16417,ADD WE DID IT LITTLE ROC PLEAAAAASE!
16418,"Too few choices to start with and then you get pigeoned-holed by RNG.  Seems like very little actual options.  Sometimes you get really lucky and are able to combine fast.   Othertimes you get screwed and keep re-rolling and never get anything you want.

This game needs more options that allow the player to feel like they get more choices."
16419,ok
16420,"Epic! 9/10

Nice"
16421,"While I would say that I'm mostly neutral about this game, at this point in time - the beta left more of a negative impression than positive. I hope that it changes, and if it does - I'll reflect it.

First of all, I'd to say that I'm unbiased here. I care not for this whole ""Auto Chess"" superiority. Look, guys, there was Aeon on Strife. And it was more or less successfully implemented into DotA. That is the original. Similarly - there were Hero Sieges\TDs\LineTowerWars and such back in Warcraft 3. That is also the original. I don't care which AutoChess is better or ""came out first"" - to me they are all pathetic ripoffs. The only reason I'm here is because this one is more or less familiar and maybe not as cringeworthy as LoL, which I was never particularly fond of.

Now that that's out of the way, I'd say that either this new AutoChess ripoff genre or at least Valve's take on it - reminds me of one of the worst mistakes of gaming history - Battle Royale. Back in the day there were deathmatches, FFAs and all that. Then came lootboxes, millenials, F2Ps, Dibloids and it all came down to one pile of garbage, called BR. A genre that took on well-known Deathmatch, added one life and a large map\playercount, added a wagonload of RNG and... plastered it into a quick-search NO MMR skirmished instant gratification. Basically if a kid wants to blow some steam, or an adult knows of nothing better - they just get into the match, try their lottery luck, maybe even get to ""pwn some nubz"" and... that's about it. Sure, dressing dolls in Warfarm or World of Cashcraft isn't exactly an Esport either, but... personally I always preferred cooperation and working towards something and not blatantly doing something for eff's sake.

Probably the only difference between traditional BR and Underlords - is the fact that Underlords don't have one life. So much that there is even an Aegis that does... nothing, because once there are like 2-3 people left, the outcome is PRECACLCULATED 100500% of time. No exceptions. So... it's just a waste of turn. Other than that - there is a large pool of players that are in basically a deathmatch, no teams, no cooperation. There is an egregious, downright offensive amount of RNG that dictates at LEAST 50% of the entire gameplay. Like any other BR - the goal here is not to win. You are not meant to win, this isn't some Overwatch where you can rage at your team or the cheating enemy team, it's not some other arena pvp. It's just a random lottery game that you play with other tryhards. Maybe you score. Maybe you don't. Nobody to blame and no gratification besides satisfying an addiction itch.

From the tactical standpoint, it all comes down to certain positioning on board, which seems to be very, very trivialized, so maybe you can learn some exploits from streamers and such, usually it's not rocket science. Assassins always teleport, tanks always go forward, you don't control anything whatsoever. It also comes down to some alliance bonuses, which are basically set bonuses for every unique unit of a given type. Should be quite predictable that at this point they are extremely broken. That Evasion set? Sure, invalidates all your %damage or %multistrike bonuses, because what's the point of doing more attacks or harder attacks, when enemy just doesn't get hit? Warlock mass healing is also hilarious if you can snowball it with some Mana Boots or Orb of Refresh and that Warlock passive item bonus(don't remember the name). Druid set bonus is absolutely broken, just downright borked ezgameezlife... early on. Then it's fairly meaningless, because there are only low-level druids that get outclassed after level 20 or so. Maybe that will get ironed out eventually.

Then, of course, there are broken units. Mask of Madness might seem like ruining your unit, but put it on a Phantom Assassin or at least Luna and... well, congratulations, you have won the game. That's your lucky ticket. Or a Nature's Profit, if you get him to be druid-set upgraded to 3star before level 10... That's also lucky ticket. He basically spawns hero-grade units every 5 seconds. And then, of course, there is the standard unit levels\stars. In my experience, getting a SINGLE unit to 3S over 40+ levels would take incredible amount of luck, effort and a potential loss of better units because of literally having to keep up to 3 bench slots occupied for a single unit. Like I said - if you get a 3S before level 10\20, you won. Congrats. Build your team around it, don't make stupid item decisions and do some basically logical unit placement and there is nothing that would beat it. Or... if someone manages to get a 2S T5 unit... jeez, noice. And things like that are ALL OVER the place.


There is one positive thing I can mention - crossplay and bots. That is relatively enjoyable, no pressure, you can read, you can think, it's actually more or less like chess. Problem is... like any PvP-obsessed game - that part of the game doesn't get anywhere. Tutorial bots are... tutotrial bots. Medium\Challenging... I didn't see any difference. If a bot gets on a winning streak, you can hopelessly lose or effortlessly win in either difficulty. And then there is Hardcore.... Which forces a live timer on you. Valve, Jesus Frederick Christ, WHAT'S THE POINT OF A BOT MATCH IF YOU DON'T PLAY IT LIKE A BOT MATCH?!
Okay, I assume that it's for those tryhards, who have gone so far up in MMR that playing with people is actually worse than playing with bots. And I can only assume Hardcore bots would cheat\get some bonuses to make it look ""realistic"". So... yeah, might want to lay that out better in the difficulty descriptions.

As far as PvP goes... it's quite decent. I suppose there are some kids who spam emotions and maybe there is a way to block them, but other than that - the human factor is reduced to a minimum, which is a very positive thing. The biggest downside of almost any PvP game - is that you are playing with\against humans and you know it. This game doesn't really bring the human out of human, and that makes it generally swallowable, if not for .... the live timer factor. Unless you want to lose before level 20 by just quick-picking and blindlindly selecting things, you should probably spend a week or two with bots. Otherwise there's just too much going on on a timer, it's not some bloody Gwent, you have to assess your unit position, gold balance, unit storage\mixing, item placements etc - all within like.... 25 seconds between waves.
And speaking of these delays - matches end up lasting +-1 hour. Which is perfectly fine for a PvE match that you can pause\resume at will, but not really great for live pvp. I mean, there is nonstop live PvP, I have spent the better time of my life playing various types of DotA, and then there is this... uh... ""Below Starcraft 2 Arcade"" level ""genre"". Actually wasting a full hour of your phone life's battery on a live match here is... well, your choice.
Meanwhile, PvE can either allow you to think when necessary, or to skip the timer when you can afford it. Live timer is... live.


So maybe if they can balance the unit set bonuses, the units themselves, the insane amount of RNG, maybe make 3S units cost TWO 2S units instead of 3( which would also reduce the RNG, because it may not be accessible to one lucky person, but to anyone who works for it), perhaps add some kind of team-based incentive, some beyond the Battle ""Pass, No thanks"" collectibles that would also work in PvE\bot matches\matches with no live timer...
Then the game could very well be promising. As in ""Better than a Starcraft 2 map made by 1 person"". At this point, however... it's more or less what one person, maybe an over-the-net cooperation of 3-5 - could do in a size of Starcraft 2 map. And that's not exactly suitable for BattleHardpass\livepvp\monetization."
16422,put the mob back in moba
16423,literally a slot machine that has decision making mechanics 10/10 would become addicted again
16424,"A fairly decent Teamfight Tactics™ clone, yes indeed clone, much like its forgettable predecessor was a clone of Riot's timeless and original masterpiece. Don't make me spell it out for you.

(In case Volvo screws up again, I highly recommend trying riichi mahjong. It's basically the exact same game, only older.)"
16425,"Strategy, Auto battle, team-building game. it's Valve's edition of Auto Chess and it's by far the best one out there!!"
16426,Only play this game if you are a lucky man.
16427,Go play Okey game instead of this.
16428,rng trash
16429,hello guys i am here to report cheating. it ruins the game. i also send a feedback to the game page. i have screenshots in case you need to see how some people have like 50 coins also to spent after having bought big characters and also evolved them.i hope you respond. thank you.
16430,At least it’s more successful than Artifact xdddd
16431,"To be honest, this game is really boring. It's mostly rng based, you have to plan ahead and at the end nothing big happens. I don't think this genre have a big future. I have nothing against this game, it's really well made but I feel like it goes more into dislike than like since it's just a mobile style game that will last 1 week until people switch to another.

Time will tell if this survives."
16432,this game so bad to play
16433,um..... why am I playing this game?
16434,"Dota underlords is a hollow shell of a DoTA 2 custom game where the best feature is being able to draw attention to an assortment of 10 pre-established text-based taunts by ""Yoing"" them."
16435,quite a good mobile strategy game.
16436,Has improved quite a bit since beta and is now actually quite fun and rewarding to play
16437,"Completely reliant on luck. No opportunity for real reactions when you start to get beat to a pulp, since it is never guaranteed you will get something to strengthen your composition. Trying to transition to another comp only tends to worsen the situation due to the aforementioned problems."
16438,"RNG simulator. The way you upgrade your units is bad game design, it's just luck.

It is also bad design, that you are basically stuck with item and hero strategy that you pick in first ~3-10 rounds, because you cannot level up enough many heroes same time and change heroes mid game and usually items are good only for spefic hero types or only boost certain type. 

If heroes would be upgradable with gold and not by combining same hero multiple times, it would be ok/good game. Also items should be repickable / rerollable, with minimum gold cost."
16439,Best game ever!
16440,"The game has gone from decent to worse. Now you have to start out the first round with no hero and now you don't have to skill them up.  The game is mostly luck in the beginning and luck later with a little skill with combinations. Thus the whole thing turns into a pointless grind.

The inability to choose your choice of starting character causes people to drop and just join another game.  I find myself stuck with characters I don't want to play and forced to develop strategies for random combinations that often don't work very well. If the characters you want don't appear either for leveling a character or providing you the character you want, you often end up wasting gold and crippling yourself. 

Matches have too many people and take too long. Would be nice if there were matches with 4 people.

Wish there was more diversity with neutrals and backgrounds."
16441,if you hate dota you will love it :)
16442,This was my first ever auto chess game and I had never played Dota so it was a steep learning curve. It was very fun though and kept me playing :)
16443,playful game. time killer.
16444,is  gooooooooood
16445,Dumb RNG game...
16446,"Pleasant, entertaining, absorbing. Perfect for every Dota 2 fan, and others might love it too. I hope future development will bring more balance between alliances, allow us to be more precise with our builds (as of now, there is too much RNG in play), and what is crucial - bring all other missing heroes such as Phantom Lancer, Ancient Apparition or Monkey King. Great potential, and thank Lord Gaben it's free to play - if Artifact were f2p too, it would have been much, much better received."
16447,good

Can not be more accurate than this. I will advise devs to once play Auto-Chess which is being developed. It is better in limiting content and has better to offer in gameplay than this garbage you have created. Rot in hell if one of you devs even think that THIS is good gameplay."
16466,Had an absoulute blast playing this while taking a big dump.
16467,"I've never in all my life of playing video games, ever, have had a game do so little to teach me what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing. And mind you this is in what's supposed to be the 'tutorial.'

Fuck this game. I just wanted to play some stupid piece of shit and it made me sit here for over an hour just to kill me and for the game to end. My friend told me to stop and I didn't listen. I was too busy being floored at how horrible a piece of software could be.

Negative a billion/10. Valve forgot how to make videogames. That was the WORST THING I've EVER played in my life. And I don't even think I was playing the fucking thing."
16468,"If you’re a fan of the mod – heck, even if you aren’t – you should definitely check this little gem out.  We’ve already lost a lot of hours playing this game. It’s a great procrastination tool and a really enjoyable little time-sink.
We’d love to see more progression-related gameplay mechanics added further down the line. Right now, the time investment offers very little payback. But assuming that’s on the horizon, we’re looking forward to losing countless more hours playing Dota Underlords.<3!!"
16469,Amen
16470,Nice!
16471,Everybody gangsta until RNG don't work
16472,"I love playing dota but I just don't have time anymore. Imagine me finding out that this game can be played on mobile, why would I even play dota on pc?"
16473,Haha
16474,Bitter sweet for me. I really liked this game before they added the manditory heros when it was like DOTA autochess. After that update i disliked playing and so I havent.  Still for a free game that insta queues i must recommend.
16475,"one item for one heroes really? lmao
better play auto chess the original one or TFT"
16476,"This is not a terrible game.  I'm excited to see how it evolves over time.  The inclusion of a functional bot mode that allows you to literally play at your own pace makes this better than any other auto-battler on the market.  But make no mistake - this game might as well be called ""RNG: The Video Game.""

Losses feel unfair, and victories feel unearned.  You are not at the mercy of the skill level of the other players - you are 100% at the mercy of RNG.  That is how the game is currently balanced, which is to say, it isn't balanced very well.

The foundation is here for a great game, and Valve appears to actually be supporting it.  I just hope that support goes beyond a mediocre season pass and extends into making the game a lot more fun to play.

Edit:

I was about to revise my review recommendation until the latest update.  This game is broken, directionless trash."
16477,"Pretty dope game!  Pretty much like Dota Autochess, except for being slightly different.  If you like that game, you'll also like this one.  

Pros:
* It is free.
* Standalone client, so you don't have to load up Dota 2 or download any Dota 2 updates.  For this reason, it is much faster.
* You can now click and drag units instead of hovering over a unit, pressing the key, and then clicking where you want it.  This is much more intuitive.
* It is easier to understand what units will sync with your current team when you buy them because the game shows you how purchasing each unit would affect your synergies.
* You can adjust the viewing angle.

Cons:
* Nothing significant.

Neutral Differences (depend on personal preferences):
* Items aren't dropped on the map; they are presented as an overlay screen with choices.  This screen appears after every neutral round that you win, so as long as you win, you are guaranteed an item, but never more than one.
* No couriers.
* The game goes a lot faster, meaning that you have less time to deliberate over stuff but also that you spend less time waiting for others to deliberate over stuff.
* Neutral rounds are easier.
* Items can be transferred between units."
16478,I'd put my dick in it.
16479,One of the most boring experiences i have ever had playing a video game. avoid this.
16480,Y
16481,"It's auto chess, but less fair and balanced. Wait for it to be balanced before playing it."
16482,Not really sure what I'm doing but I'm having fun. Also constant updates and communication with the community keep you interested and engaged.
16483,"Not even the tutorial was any fun. 

What is Valve thinking with such weird games where you do not even control the units yourself anymore?"
16484,kontol
16485,"As of 10.24 the game got the ""Big Update"" that brings Underlords into the game and many changes to both the UI and the roster.

Updates come regularly and with the new jail system we won't be stuck with a ""meta"" of sorts for weeks while waiting on changes. This is a good thing and I hope that the game keeps on livin'."
16486,"Don't waste your time on this like I did.

The current meta is to keep pressing the reroll button and hope that you get three star units before other people. There is no reason to save money and level up. Right now three star units are so much stronger than the alliance bonuses you just end up spending the surplus on rerolls.

I understand that this is supposed to be a casual game with RNG but in its current state it is kind of boring. It's like throwing dice at the wall and clapping when you get doubles.

The only good things about this game are the presentation and the game over music."
16487,its a good game just a bit broken right now.
16488,This game is fun and entertaining. A lot of choices and selections for different deck types. If Valve stays away from what betadwarf did with minion masters and their cheap tricks for a quick payday this game has potential to go far. When the community likes a game enough they will undoubtedly do what they can to keep it alive as long as the Devs stay honest and true to the game! Dont underestimate the value of a loyal fan base!

I had to open 4 sites to see what the fuck i need to do to play this game.  Too much relies on pure RNG, rather than some sort of strategy like the other similar games offer. 
There are certain units/heroes that are literally un-killable after round 2 (because they summon minions) till the end of the game in certain compositions. Items that cannot be used by certain units that which you can find out after you have spent money to purchase them, cluttered UI that makes really hard to see remaining time. Rounds last way too long, there are too many loading times and to finish just one game one must waste at least 50 minutes... 
Overall TFT is light years ahead."
16495,Good game + addictive
16496,it was good
16497,Best auto battler on the market
16498,NICE GAME
16499,"From all other auto-chess based games, Underlords is by far the best. Dedicated team improving this in past few weeks was unbelievable. Very nice interface, good content. Frequent fixes and balance changes. ( be reasonable, it took Dota ages to balance to some extent and the imbalance is the one feature Dota still has this much crowd. Time will fix balancing in Underlords as well. Hopefully. )

Now, don't be mega idiots and go ranting on how random and hard it is. Auto-chess had a high learning curve, so does Underlords. Going through patch notes and tutorial won't harm. Understanding mechanics will ease the learning curve. My personal opinion, it all depends on how fast you can go through opponent's collections and countering it with adjusting your own heroes. Risk management and fast decision making. 

If you can't get the handle of it after some rounds, probably you dumb."

16529,"Now that Game of Thrones is over you might be looking for an opportunity to see your favorite heroes murdered? Look no further, Underlords has you covered!
Click a button, your guys get stomped. Receive no explanation why, give someone a weapon (with some cool stats), click again... You guessed it, all murdered. Brutally. Add another victim to your army. Murdered. What are your options I hear you ask? Click. The. Button.
And this was only the tutorial. Wait, there are neutrals to loot! Not even the bots serial murdering me could defeat the neutral armies.

Great. Fun.
Uninstalled!

Update: I think the underlying problem was, that the tutorials were not clear/missing on some of the core concepts of the game. Like upgrading your heroes for example."
16530,"Never played DOTA but I like this. 
From the videos it appears the higher levels are a bit of the same, Hopefully Valve fixes that at least. 
Good thing I don't like going for the highest levels and can kind of just do what I want. 
Build different things and see how they work. 

Similar to how I played HearthStone. Get a good Idea on how to play then kind of just build what feels right. 

If you are one of those that needs to be the highest level. Good Luck. There are only a few viable builds it seems. 
If you are like me and could care less. Its fun to just try and get as many synergies going as possible or different combinations just for fun."
16531,"Edit: The game has already improved massively!

This game has recently received a game-changing update in the truest sense of the word. 
It is not longer a pure auto-battler but introduced boss-units known as ""Underlords"". Not only do they fight on the board, they support your units in various way and you get to decide how to progress their ability-set throughout the game.

Beyond that, so much has changed. UI improved, hero pieces changed, alliances changed and the Jail-feature mixes up the available pieces every day! 

We won't be able to recognize this game even half a year from now. 

Be part of this crazy time! It is entirely free and easy to learn, hard to master.

16535,Generally not interested in this type of games but i can see why a lot of people like it and i did for the little that i played. However me and probably everyone here is waiting for valve to release a non dota game...
16536,very good loved it very good
16537,i am entirely convinced that people who play druids are members of ISIS. change my fucking mind
16538,What a game! recommend
16539,"As someone that has played through the tutorial and has an entire hour in the game, I can assure you that this game is total trash and a huge waste of time. Worst game ever and trust me, I would know, I played the tutorial. Also, it should be important to note, I won the tutorial so this is not baby rage. I never played online though, but I'm still an expert with an hour in the game. Bad game. Booooooooooo."
16540,"stupid game
stupid developer 
need luck to win 
no luck u lose"
16541,"we need a god damn inventory and marketable items , pleaseeeee"
16542,"I was a complete noob, picking Riki and Slark every game.

And then, DOTA Plus came into my life! The computer told me to pick Juggernaut, and to go mid-lane against a Shadow Fiend. I was skeptical, certain that I couldn't possibly out-harass someone with three razes, but then DOTA plus suggested I use Blade Fury!

The three razes wiffed against my spin-to-win, and I was about to run back, but then DOTA Plus gently took control of my mouse, moving it unbidden of my will! He ran forward, not drawing creep aggro while laying down magic damage onto the SF.

Then DOTA Plus alerted me that the enemy Ogre Magi was missing, and got me to safety. After this, DOTA Plus opened all chat, and taunted the SF about having to share XP with the Ogre. They began fighting in a language I didn't understand, but thankfully DOTA Plus comes with machine language learning too, and began flaming them in their native tongue!

Not only that, but DOTA Plus suggested that I could have another cup of water, and informed me that it would handle the last-hits for the next minute and a half. On my time away from the computer, my eyes wandered out of my window, and locked onto a woman my age, with beautiful eyes. The connection was instant, but I had DOTA to play.

However, when I returned to my computer, DOTA Plus told me ""Go to her, go to her, tell her you love her, and NEVER let go! Life is too short!"" Then DOTA Plus got a rampage on my behalf under the enemy Tier 3. Clearly, I wasn't needed here.

I have been married for five years now, and now I am climbing to Divine 5 while brushing up on fulfilling hobbies, like learning the violin and writing my novel manuscript. Thank you DOTA Plus, you have saved my life, and made me a happy and fulfilled human being."
16543,"didnt really like dota myself so i tried this and got bored quick, other people will probably enjoy it though"
16544,"Its bad. I've played all of the ""autochess"" genre games and this is the worst one so far. Some abilities are literally copy/paste of autochess's heroes abilities. I had high hopes because a friend of mine told me it was really good, but i am disapointed"
16545,"good,buth dota auto chess was better."
16546,"Definitely the best of the 3 main Auto Chess's right now. I played Dota 2 exclusively for auto chess, and now I only play underlords. It is still in beta, but has weekly patches and COMMUNICATION FROM VALVE. This seems like a stepping stone for the company and is slowly becoming one of my favorite ""I am too lazy to play a real game so Ill play this while watching netflix""."
16547,nice game
16548,"its nice and a great time killer :P you can play it pretty much anywhere .. work / home/ toilet on a train .. you name it :D plus its free so i dont see a reason why you shouldnt try it! 
"
16549,FUCK GAME
16550,Great
16551,"It's fun, and it's addictive, but I still wouldn't call it good. Honestly it's ""Gambling Addiction: The Game.""

The basis of the game is you earn gold each round to buy units, each unit belongs to groups that gain bonuses from being on the same team, and collecting multiple of the same unit upgrades them.

You play against 7 other players, each building their own army, but honestly they're irrelevant. You're really playing against RNG. There is very little true 'strategy' you can play besides hoarding gold, and crossing your fingers and hoping.

If you don't get a 2 star unit earlier than other players, you start on the back foot. You may gain a synergy bonus from units early, then get completely screwed by not being able to upgrade them for another 20 rounds. You could sell them all and try a new strat, but you have no guarantee the same thing won't happen. Other players will often see your strategy beating them and start buying the same units you have, which limits your ability to upgrade by removing them from the pool. More often than not RNG will also decide to continue giving anything from your strategy to that other player. Then you get to watch as they win with 3 star versions of your 2 star team.

Items drop on the first 3 rounds and then every 5 rounds from 10 onwards. Many items can be equipped and buff a unit, but there are a substantial amount of global items that buff one specific synergy group, essentially adding a second synergy to them. Again, you fight RNG. A player who does not get the global item that corresponds to their team is significantly weakened compared to someone who does. A player who picks a global item early in preparation may then never see enough of the unit types required for it to pay off. They provide far too much benefit for already strong synergies in some cases and will often decide the outcome of the match.

It's a very win-more game. A player who gets a lucky start builds up gold faster with win streak gold, that snowballs into more gold from interest as well, providing them faster levels and more rerolls to get the units they need, while someone who starts poorly falls further behind each round. While there is ""lose streak"" gold, it in no way compensates enough to stay competitive in most cases.

So yes, it can be fun, and it sucks you in fast, but this is legitimately just an RNG simulator. While it's free it's decent, but if they try to monetise this it won't be worth it at all.



EDIT: A new ""balance"" patch has been released and it's laughable. Already strong synergies have received buffs, some of the weaker ones have been ignored altogether. Neutral rounds have now been buffed obscenely, eviscerating almost half of players each game.

The item drops have been changed, granting more synergy-based global items early with different or weaker effects. Losing to neutrals gives you 3 choices now, however the quality is lowered compared to if you win. Again this plays into the horrible win-more nature of the game. A player doing well now gets blatantly better items and scales far better as the game goes on, while someone struggling now gets offered items akin to the old wave 3 items at wave 15, because their mediocre team can't kill off a hellbear that now can one shot nearly anything besides a 3 star Pudge.

Before there at least felt like a chance at a comeback. Now you get to ALSO watch as you're given the option of a Mask of Madness, a Blink Dagger, or a Global item that's bad for a team you don't have any of, while the players who haven't taken 10 damage yet pick up daedelus' and skadis."
16552,"Fuckin sheet, no balanced, no more than 1 tacktiks, fuck this game and producers. Delete game, dont play"
16553,very good game
16554,pretty good game!
16555,"Simplistic gameplay, clear ui - this is what makes this game better than TFT."
16556,Please nerf PA and Slark hahaha. Great game for killing time 💯
16557,very good game
16558,"I've given this game a fair go. I've played a lot of round vs bots and a few with friends, but one issue keeps bothering me to no end: the excessive level of RNG that this game has. I'm not opposed to RNG, but there's no way to limit it in this game. Early game is always decided by who gets lucky and upgrades to 2 star, mid-game is controlled by who gets lucky can find stronger synergies with more 2 star heroes. And late game is, again, more luck."
16559,It's dead Jim.
16560,Nice ges
16561,"Updating review as updates roll in.

Lose because RNG
Win because RNG
Play well, still lose/win because RNG

Losing feels bad, winning feels bad because you got lucky. I know you can ""steer the odds"" with positioning and the like which adds strategy, but often I feel like I lost/won because the dice said so. Not very satisfying for me.

Pretty addicting, which is bad since I dislike playing it most of the time. 

Most fun is messing around with builds seeing what can come of it, for a short while at least.

I end up not enjoying it most of the time, but give it a bash, since free. I find some fun in it, but overall experience is negative, at the moment.

Hoping some patches address some balance issues and whatnot, since I feel like this has potential. 



Edit: After the update 18.7.2019 the game is even more luck-based and has even more strict limitations on what you can pick in order to win (primordials/savages). Comebacks are also gone, since games are over due to summon damage before lategame arrives for you to make a comeback. 

Can't recommend if you want to take it seriously, at the moment.

Edit 2: After fixing the Arc Warden nonsense the game felt better to play, but it still relies so heavily on RNG that there is not a lot you can do if the game decides you lose. Uninstalled it for now, it brings way more frustration than joy.

Edit 3: I do have to commend the devs for fast updates that seem to shape the game into a better direction. Removing the early round dmg makes the lategame a little more plausible again, getting a free reroll when you lose also should help. Interesting changes, need to see where it goes from here.

Edit 4: Got the time to actually test out the new update, seems like game is undergoing good changes and feels better to play each time, I will actually now proceed to change review to positive. 

Can't undermine hard work of developers with a negative review."
16562,this game is really shit :/ cant believe they made like this kind of games
16563,Realy good game
16564,Very good game
16565,NIce one....
16566,comeon out from beta
16567,next level gaming category.
16568,yes
16569,"nice game
"
16570,"At first, it's boring but then it has potential for some interesting strategy.
There is a luck element, the skill is working around the luck. You won't always get the heroes you want, you need to know when you have to redraft in order to survive.
Just watching the AI fight is a little frustrating, sometimes there are stupid moves that get made and you have to alter your formation to sort of alter how they deploy during the fight phase.

The problem with this game is the late late game. As the meta in Dota goes, everyone tries to play the same carries, the same rule applies in Underlords. If the game lasts past round 30, everyone is going to be spamming the same high ranking heroes because there is a point in the upgrade path where comp no longer matters and you can just steam roll. That sucks.
Most games I've played end before round 30, but it's something to consider about the balancing.

The games last as long as Dota. I probably shouldn't be playing it, it's a huge time sink, but I can't seem to stop."
16571,"10 percent skill
80 percent luck
5 percent dota
100 percent reason to uninstall this game"
16572,"Nothing has changed, still roll dupe global items that don't stack.  So while you roll humans count as undead every single item round be sure to know someone is getting a moonshard, hood of defiance, and battlefury.  Now understand I don't mean out of the 8 players, I mean ""1"" person will be rolling these and it will be up to you to hopefully strategize and get lucky on rolls to beat someone playing with bowling bumpers."
16573,This Game so  fucking trash i play 30 games and i lose all of it because game don't give me  right units it's balance broken in game they don't have it please don't play in this trash game wait updates or idk now it's not balanced game...
16574,"It's free.
It's fun.
It's addicting.

Pleh."
16575,"Woah, probably the most boring game without p2w elements ever created. I just played an 1h tutorial which:
- wasn't fun
- wasn't exciting
- explained too little (tho I figured most things out by the end of it)
- battles were hard to follow
- did not grant any kind of reward (which I expect at that length)

How people enjoy this is beyond me. I'd much rather take a nap than waste my time like this."
16576,"Very fun - until it's not. Gets repetitive and sometimes the AI does stupid things that annoy the F out of me.
For instance, they're like ""Hey, let's all take different targets instead of going after one together. That way, we will lose but all of them will survive at 2% HP.""

When I lose to stupid stuff like that, or because people are lucky for the same RNG shit, I don't wanna play anymore. It's a good game but only for a little while. Then it's the same shit time after time. I got to the second best tier level 3. Not gonna grind through for nothing."
16577,aku radong main e jancok

Besides that this is a good game."

16581,boiiiii
16582,better than dota
16583,simply the best
16584,"Early Access thoughts:

It is fun, it is quick, it is exciting. I can recommend this to anyone who wants to play short fulfilling sessions."
16585,я долбаеб
16586,i luv tis one :)
16587,"Review for this Beta build July 2019:

I think it's an ok game, but there is a big problem for me where everytime I play, I end up in last place no matter which combination of items I pick REGARDLESS of what team I play. Even if I choose the meta team or get lucky, its like every other player (yes all 7) every single game suddenly have perfect counters and I finish last.

Now I do play high rank and take breaks, but thats not entirely it because I noticed that this happens when I climb and actually the reason I take breaks, so many lose streaks to force your rank down artificially it feels like playing Hearthstone (game for bots, they do the same to force more playhours.) For this reason, I actually cant recommend this game right now. 

Also I think its at the same time too easy when you win you are unstoppable and bored, RNG just kind of all over the place. Another likely reason is racism. 

I was optimistic when I started and liked it a lot, when I started writing this REVIEW even I was going to give it positive but I played some time so here I explain where Im coming from:

What is Bad? 

-There are multiple versions of AutoChess/AutoBattler right now, this one is I would say the worst one by far. It's the most boring and they made changes to make it more boring, so its not even the ORIGINAL one. A competitor TFT(League/TeamFightTactics) are actually closer to the original Dota AutoChess mod than this version. I really think they changed the original formula too much and a lot of the magic and appeal of the original mod is lost.

-There is also a feature-rich mobile version out also called AutoChess (NOT beta) that is superior, from my understanding mostly preferred by fans, it IS the original. Also TenCent made their own copy game which I heard is good (but I dont believe this, Tencent only makes garbage. However, I do believe they probably made a better game than this one, without having played it, which is sad and shows the state this game is in.)

-There are many problems, every patch something breaks (seriously fucking annoying, I never get so pissed at a game the kind of shit they break key binding are you trolling me to make me leave??) Also, for how tame and boring it is, its still pretty fucking imbalanced so what is the point? It feels like the dev team gave up or lost all motivation, slapped it together, now some 3-4 intern is ""finishing it"" slowly. Who is this for? Who is playing it? Is it fun to watch? I dont know, Im not sure. Maybe Malaysia.

-Valve is involved and they dont know how to/forgot how to make games, it's not couple guys studio, its a huge corp that is full time ""The Dota2 Company/The $team $tore company.""

What is Good?

+The strength of this game is that Valve could put money in if they wanted to compete. This game is a mobile game (autoplay/bad gameplay) and not a PC game which is the point of autochess I believe to attract such audiences. However, it must be much flashier, I cant even p2w or buy any skins right now. I dont understand the logic behind a mobile game without such things, but I assure you its a mobile game and not a real quality game, its a minigame with one mode and minimal actual gameplay, only low brain required. I will give them a + for this, since that captures a goal for the mobile crowd, mobile user would find anything more than this overwhelming. 

-It is very RNG heavy so a lot of people that play mobile games for RNG and love to gamba will love this game. However, you cant even gamble that much, there is no currency or anything to gamble with. I can see a sick gambling addict not getting their thrill in this. A sick gambling addict will always choose casino over bubblegum machine at corner store if they have the option (and there is many even in this niche genre which will die much faster than people pretend.)  I will give it bonus points here for being perfect for very mobile player by making the game all RNG and no skill, but without a casino feel and nothing to buy or grind, it is only halfway there (not 80% like a beta, 50% like they need much more.)

-Besides being nice and giving an extra + for the same thing twice, I will say they are fast to update a lot so if you follow this game it makes you feel good like something is happening. 

What they need to do is add some store or some game modes and A LOT and FAST. Tomorrow not in 3 years, they need to have some way to stand out and compete with the other versions right now because they are not only non-competitive but they dont even have any strength and are not even anything like the original autochess. They can choose whatever, maybe make 500 items or add all Dota heros in to make it complete Chaos. But they must do something. 

If they just continue like this, I can see people dropping it before it leaves beta as well as support for it. Its just really dry and boring rank grind and the game offers very little in substance and longevity. Everytime I play this I feel like I am being trolled into abandoning it, everytime I try to do anything in the game like a new build or build some 3* for FUN, I am reminded that fun is not allowed and that I must play the same team over and over and grind rank and it will be harder and harder to RNG this way at a certain point. 

I wont give it a score yet and I will change this review after I try it in some months, hopefully they will have all the characters and items added to the game at that point, meanwhile I will recap why I have such a low playtime:

1. TFT,League version is exciting and fun, offering the old item system, its unbalanced but its not a mobile game and part of their client, offering at least fun which is what this game type should be, wacky ridiculous fun.

2. The Original became Auto Chess on mobile, its a mobile game but it looks much better and seems to have much more features already, offering an upgraded version of the original.

3. TenCent version (dont remember name) but Valve a non-game company competing with TenCent in the mobile space reads like a joke. 

4. You can always play the Dota mod too and its better or whatever.

So in conclusion: What does this game offer to the genre but a stripped down, boring version that is not even finished? I guess you can play on Steam because Valve has that monopoly, but is that really it? It's not as bad as I a making it sound, but realistically they must do much more. Valve forgot they dont have a monopoly on the world and cant force this to be the only version."
16588,maen ini terus sampe lupa kuliah
16589,hindi ako marunong magdota
16590,ok
16591,"Seems to be based on luck and knowledge. Other than the having to be lucky on what pops up for you to play it's a pretty decent game. The games are long and it's addicting, looking forward to see what the future updates bring. 7/10."
16592,"Free to play / related to dota / and its fun 
the only thing that is wrong with this game is that you need to be lucky to win it."
16593,rolling a handful of dice is faster and more efficient.
16594,"Too difficult.
Because my luck is awfull.
And this game's difficulty is 90% luck."
16595,amazing game and easy to play
16596,If you like RNG then this game is for you! you can go up 4 to 5 lvl and also go down 4 to 5 lvl in a short period of time. also you can easily spend 6hrs winning all games only to lose 2 to 3 games and drop down a couple of lvl. Not a fan of this.....
16597,"Out of all the auto-battlers out there, Underlords looks the most promising with its gameplay and visuals. I just wish Valve would optimize the game for mobile players."
16598,"It's been getting better.
Still dislike the static chessboard though."
16599,lmao
16600,"Chad 1: TF2 has not received a major update in over one thousand days, meanwhile Dota Underlords, an auto chess game, receives updates on a regular basis.
Chad 2: I know.

holy fuck, this aged poorly"
16601,"tl;dr graphics and animations suck, unbalanced, league tactics ripoff. take this review with a grain of salt
[b] oh god where do i even start... [/b]
 well let me point out the obvious this game is trying so hard to be like league tactics. if you like that game you're probably not going to like this game. the graphics are atrocious. I know graphics aren't everything but it doesn't help if it makes me not even want to look at my screen (yes, i was on the highest settings). this especially is prevalent when you have more than 10 champions on the field at once you have no idea what the hell is happening. the same goes for the animations. this game is also very unbalanced there's a champion where he summons 1 tree minion every 16 seconds or so. [i] so basically a free unit every 16 seconds. [/i] also there's no winning penalty. what i mean by this is if you have a massive lead and a good team you're not going to lose. unlike league if you have the least health they give you first pick on the carousel. i couldn't even play a second game that's how bad it is. the only good thing is this game would probably make you appreciate your other games. even if this game is free- 
PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
my final verdict will be a 4/10.
[strike] DOTA community please don't roast me [/strike]"
16602,its fun yo
16603,"Release Review Update:

R.I.P. the game.

Inbalanced
Worse MM and Pointsystem

Bugs, Glitches, Cheaters 
and Smartphone users have a bonus, if you recognized it; Mobile players are almost better without any visible reason.


There now some games to compare with:

Riot Games: LoL Teamfight Tactics
Valve DotA 2: Auto Chess
Ubisoft: Chess (not really good)
Epic Games: Auto Chess (buged and not fully translated and a lot other issues)
Blizzard: Hearthstone Battlegrounds (not really a Auto Chess)
Auto Chess for Android & iOS (full of advertising crahes, bugs etc.)


They are all not very fair or balanced, but Underlords & Teamfight Tactics are the best in handling, bugs etc. also both are avialable for Smartphones iOS & Android

Actually there less cheaters, some guys use assist tools that tell them what to buy and what a build they should use. But there no other hacks at the moment."
16604,"Still in beta, so there are some issues with the game. More so, with the mobile (android version)
Other than that, I highly recommend it. I AM HOOKED!
Waiting for the battlepass to be released :)

100/10"
16605,This is the MOBA for people who do not like MOBAs.
16606,This game Sucks!
16607,EMOSI ANJING
16608,I think its a good game with deep strategy including luck
16609,"all in all very nice game, best autochess game. just 2 things.

1. add coop-mode, like team line tower wars.

i think the high RNG is annoying if u play a very lot. 
2. would be nice to have something like: every round u have 2x 1Star Heroes the chances to get the third gets 1% better.. u kno?"
16610,"Full RNG, You have minimal impact on your game really. You get lucky You win, I've lost games having 50% more gold in the ending stages, just nothing to buy with it."
16611,"A good, well-balanced game. Not a single hint of the advantage of other table assemblies 10 gray hair out of 10"
16612,Super Addicting. 35 hours in 4 days addicting.
16613,Overall it's enjoyable. I feel like this is something you play in the back ground while doing something else as if you're solely playing this and you've put in the time and get to late game only to get mega d*** pumped from RNG it definitely doesn't feel worth the potential hour you spent playing. I still highly recommend giving it a go!
16614,Nice clean game
16615,"nice game is the auto chess,i like it"
16616,Addicting As f*ck. If u play dota 2 u must try this.
16617,EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16618,"trash,
Also a copycat of a game called Auto Chess."
16619,"Dota is Valve's least interesting IP, and this is the first valve title ive played that didnt wow me in any way. Im clearly not the target audience for this because it wasnt fun"
16620,TFT but it is better
16621,its fun xD
16622,Absolutely fantastic game!
16623,suprisingly addictive mini game fleshed out.. great with m8s.. has that old skool line tower wars feel..   there are a few negatives.. balancing needs work.. but all in all not a bad wee game
16624,"Love it so much
"
16625,fun game :D
16626,Its not the best game.
16627,PLEASE NERF TREANT PROTECTOR
16628,"Good game,a bit to much  rng depended tho."
16629,"go play LOL dota chess instead,comeback mechanic like a dumb wemen"
16630,"The UI is a lot better than DAC, and 1 item for 1 hero only is great concept."
16631,add more hero plis
16632,its fun
16633,This game is great
16634,"it's actually fun but this is not the best game of its genre, theres still a better game than this"
16635,gacha ampas + makin pusing semenjak update underlords
16636,"Very good, refreshing, 100% free to play, no shenanigans, queqe is fast, and the game is well thought in my opinion because even if players give up during matches it's fine,most of the time they are already behind, the fact you can come back from behind is also cool and well design,just a good game all around, if i was forced to point 1 negative thing, and i can't even come up with another one for now, is that a casual match takes some time and you really need to be in there and fast in your purchages. (well if you play stuff like LoL and DOTA, the match time is just fine,15-20m) maybe less"
16637,"Very fun, very addictive and the ability to play with the same account and even reconnect to the same game on multiple platforms is brilliant. The game is also far more polished than TFT but I guess it comes down to whether or nor you like League-of-legends or DoTA.

The game is in development and needs more balance and viable strategies that will no-doubt come with time. The one area I think needs some immediate work is on the pure RNG nature of items. Some are really powerful, others are situation and some are rubbish.....the problem is its 100% luck as to which ones you get offered and they have a significant impact on the outcome."
16638,It works 10/10
16639,Шедевр
16640,"Game is a bunch of RNG bullshit, strategy doesn't matter."
16641,"I'm honestly confused at people who say this game is less beginner friendly than TFT. I actually couldn't get into TFT even after getting decent at Underlords because it didn't come with any of the enormously helpful tools that Underlords provides - checking synergies in real time to determine which troops are expendable, easily swapping items, and being able to swap units and rearrange your team as soon as a fight ends make this game surprisingly accessible, even to someone like me who's generally not very good at any games, especially competitive strategy games. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, though eventually I'll have to try a strategy other than Druid/Savage/Warrior + Big Time Contracts -----> Victory."
16642,a legit good game nothing like that artifact garbage
16643,"For those who gave this game negative review and saying ""this game is unbalanced""
I think you need to step up your strategy and luck in order to achieve victory. (it's still on Open Beta btw lmao)

Very fun and recommended."
16644,"fun at first, WAY better then autochess because of the reworked item system but after a while you lose interest like any other chess game. valve should focus more on dota 2 rather then dota spin-offs. I really wish the developers for dota 2 were as responsive as the underlords team."
16645,cool
16646,I cant play it on my phone man wtf it keep telling me steam isnt running you need to be loging on the steam is that a bug or wtf man im loging in at every steam app wtf valve
16647,not very good
16648,"the balance is terrible, only valve could take a perfectly great game like dota autochess and ruin it. way to go, congrats on artifact by the way!"
16649,"Hi.

I am a junior developer and a gaming fanatic. I've played dota auto chess, dota underlords, and teamfight tactics. 
Dota underlords is in the lead when it comes to the direction of gameplay. However, there is a tiny detail that you might be missing the importance of. The curior that you could customize. I saw they put it in teamfight tactics and although it's a more smooth gameplay without it, players will want something to stand out from other players. 

tl;dr: bring back the customizable curiors"
16650,still have some bugs and still good to play ^_^
16651,The best autobattler!
16652,nice game
16653,"This strategy DOTA game is pretty nice
It's like a kind of auto chess
But with DOTA heroes, spells and items
For me this one is a good and catchy game
It's pretty complex, u need about ~5-8 hours to understand the hero alliances and to know by the 1st round which alliances u should combine, which heroes u need to choose to do a good combo 

I think on the future Valve should add steam achievements for this one
Because it would make it a bit more competitive and ...for example..i like to earn achievements by playing games..it's a good feeling when you ""achieve"" something when u play a game u like
I know the achievements don't help u to level up your account but some more achievements on your account would look good...but..that's just my opinion :)"
16654,"★☆☆☆☆ 
[b]DOTA Underlords[/b] is a pathetic excuse for a mobile game.  To call this auto chess is an insult to actual chess.  Lets more accurately rename this genre:  Battle Poker.  

After winning every round for 45 minutes, by rolling OP hero upgrades, I rolled an item that made my tank invisible, and lost the finals.  Don't waste your time on this glorified slot machine.  

[h1]Reasons to Buy:[/h1]
+ Gambling addiction!

[h1]Reasons to Bail:[/h1]
- Early Access
- Unintuitive UI
- Matches are decided by dice rolls
- Less balanced than a 1-legged dog on a tightrope
- Mobile version can't go a single session without crashing, and doesn't even save settings 

[h1][strike]Pro/[/strike]Con Feature Nags:[/h1]
- Mobile quality
- Heroes are crazy unbalanced
- No content or context, just eSports
- HUD never changes, causes screen burn
- No way to tell what a hero's basic attack is 
- AI lacks the I, in a game all about AI battles 
- Like half of the players disconnect every game
- Winning gives bonus gold, so you can win even harder!
- Spend 5 gold to buy 4 exp?  Why does that not match sense
- Games take 5x too long, whittling down 5 HP per round from 100
- Every phase change interrupts the menus you're trying to interact with
- AFK every round as other players finish invisible matches behind the scenes
- Progression, and therefor winning, is based on how much RNGesus hates you
- The only thing this game has in common with chess is that it has a tiled board
- Early Access Bugs.  From the biggest company in the gaming universe.  Ridiculous 
- Currently has no ranking system, so first time players are put up against pros at random
- Plays itself, so there's nothing to git gud at, aside from memorizing which heroes are OP
- Shared hero pool, and you can't even see what heroes are left without manually spectating everyone
- This game doesn't even have a chat system, and yet somehow the chat still manages to be toxic cancer
- Combat should either be turn based, so you can actually tell whats going on.  Or insta-sim'd, like it pretends to be
- Equipping a new item doesn't swap the old item between heroes.  Benching heroes doesn't swap their equipment
- The performance stats are basically worthless for measuring performance, its based on who lived the longest.  And it needs a totals stat.  
- Positioning, the only strategy/tactical/input relevant part of this game, means next to nothing.  Units instantly break formation as soon as combat starts.  
- Buying 3 copies of the same hero auto-upgrades them, instead of being a more intentional choice, and those upgrades are like 4x more OP per star
- The tutorial is worthless, it doesn't explain half the mechanics or features, doesn't even explain the goal, and it isn't reactive.  It basically just shows you how to use the shop.  
- Worst UI ever.  The title screen is just a static doodle, with a Play button on it.  Popups instantly/accidentally disappear when clicking other things.  The buy menu overlaps everything else, when it could fit on screen naturally.  The buy menu doesn't show abilities or stats.  The buy menu [i]does[/i] show stacking racial buffs, but no other menu does.  Opponent information is lacking, they should get a pendant opposite yours.  Level names make no sense.  Could do with a party list for each team.  Why are owned units not highlighted unless upgrade-ready?  Why is equipment a completely separate unattached menu?  It could just be under the bench.  Did they ever once playtest this mess?  Because it doesn't qualify as functional.

+ At least its singleplayer, so you don't have to worry about /carrying heavy trashbags"
16655,Very addictive and fun. Can't wait for the full release! I have not played Dota before but I quickly learned what works well between the alliances. I recommend you to try this out even if its your first auto chess game.
16656,"Great game, easy to learn but hard to master. There's a lot of strategic nuances that you will pickup over time, piece synergy and positioning is very important in high level play. A lot of depth in a fun looking game. 


If you like strategy games with fast paced action you will love this game.

Oh and crossplay with Android/iOS works flawlessly!"

16669,Best RNG system in the world spend 50 Gold to Never get a Hero you need and Neutral Round Gives 3 Globe that doesn't benefit My team. And player who use 2 Warlocks and 2 Witch Doctors destroy my 2 three star hero. Manage to drop from first place to the eighth place. It just Forces you to just bench all Your Hero to end the Game Faster. Might as well just Play Leagues Team Fight Tactic.
16670,A very well-designed game! 100!

16675,"good game, very colorblind friendly game"
16676,"I played i a bit because its a game you can play while watching tv or talking with friends in voice, it doesnt really matter if you win or loose. The problem with the game for me is the extreme RNG factor, you can save 2 of the same heros for 10 rounds and never get a third one, or you get an opponent that was lucky enough to get a lvl 2 hero within 3 rounds. Another big problem is the none existing influence you have in a fight, if there is 2 enemis left  one with 5 hp and one full life, your heros could attack the full life one instead of one hitting the low hp target, which can and will make you lose rounds, thats so frustrating to watch, if you know you lost a round bc your hero cant think for themselves."
16677,All the fun of Loot Bo..... Surprise mechanics without the strain on your bank account
16678,"I started playing the game again a bit since the lockdown. Quite enjoying myself, there's definitely good gameplay there and it's certainly my favourite autobattler. It's easy to access, with all the info you need and want clearly available, especially things like alliance stuff, where you can clearly see who belongs to what alliance and how many you have/need for the next tier. In other autobattlers this is either not well available or ""just"" plain text, which really doesn't help at distuingishing alliances at a glance and under time pressure.

The pace is now really nice too, allowing for multiple approaches in terms of strategy. Items are now given freely every 4 or 5 rounds (can't remember) instead of having those annoying battles vs mobs they used to have in beta and early 1.0.

So yeah, quite a fun game to play every now and then if you like autobattlers"

16683,"LUCK DEPENDANT, BUT HAVE A GOOD STORY BETTER THAN THE WITCHER 3"
16684,RNG hates me!
16685,"There is no skill at all in this game, its all luck. Just pray to the RNG gods that they will bless you with the good individual items or with the global alliance items. I tried building around my alliance only to get shafted every single time either with the items or the units itself. Playing this game you can clearly see why the top players in the game have 100 lives while everyone else has 80ish. It's because the have 3 lvl 2 units in the same alliance with 30 gold to spare while everyone else has maybe 1 lvl 2 unit. With a massive lead like that they are guaranteed a spot in the top 3 and everyone else struggles getting anything.

Only thing that will make this work is in the first 3 rounds you are at least guaranteed a global unit item and once you pick that item your chances of getting that alliance increases like 5% or 10%.

Overall its just a frustrating game. They even have a comment that RNG HATES ME...like really."
16686,"Literally just Auto Chess, very similar characters, classes, and races. The same in almost every regard except for the fact it has an even more horrible UI. Oh well"
16687,RNGesus is too strong in this one.
16688,"gameplaynya sudah bagus, namun untuk durasi 1 game terlalu lama, mungkin seharusnya disediakan untuk match 5 orang saja, agar permainan tidak terlalu lama.
so far iam enjoy play this game"
16689,Pls change strategy tag into gambling after Jull update
16690,it was really fun and addictive in the begining im new to this type of game since i have no exprience with dota chess but after a while it gets boring when u almost use every possible setup and strategy it needs alot more content and setups and decks
16691,i recommend
16692,this game is fuckin joke
16693,10/10 fun addicting not too hard and 200% better than tft

16698,"This game refines the already popular Dota Autochess mod for Dota 2. It add a great matchmaking system, with regular updates to the game. 
Even though the game can be played casually there is a lot of depth to each strategy used to win games, and if you aren't lucky with your rolls you have to adapt to the units that are given to you.
This game is great and would highly recommend to anyone."
16699,a fun game of autochess
16700,"Great game with a good amount of strategy.

My only complaint is that the rounds can be a little too long."
16701,Very good game! Cant wait for the full release
16702,"solid game

Edit: I take it back"
16703,"While I really enjoy the Autochess Dota 2 game this is a COPY CAT GAME. I don't see why I should play this game out of principle.
Someone took his time to develop Dota 2 Autochess and Valve just comes along and copies the entire game EXACTLY to cash out on SHEEPOLE.
Please do not support or play games with such a lack of creativity. Stealing someones ideas like this should be illegal."
16704,"Really good evolution of Dota Autochess. Underlords bring flavor to the game, and the new knockout mode is fast enough to play a match or two on your way somewhere."
16705,"This game is killing remains of Dota2 dev team. I understand that every work can go stale but bring new blood rather than pump it to a new body. Gameplay is fun though. Put your sh*t together, Valve"
16706,"Fun game! Combines Strategy, Position (chess) and RNG (cards). Stragegy comes from combining different compositions of heroes, 'Calculating' what you are likely to draw and positioning your units in a way that you are strong against the enemy. First you learn what units are strong. Then you start learning what units are strong together and finally one should learn what to play against the compositions that other play in that specific game."
16707,"""Just one more roll"""
16708,"Garbage. Still playing it tho. That's valve games for you.

EDIT: 1 MONTH AFTER THIS REVIEW I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS GAME HAS EVOLVED INTO UTTER GARBAGE AND I WON'T BE PLAYING IT ANYMORE (PERHAPS) *SEETHING WOJAK*

16720,Game is dead.
16721,146% random. casino - more fair. trash. delete from internet.
16722,"Dota Underlords is part of a new popular gaming genre known as ""auto battler"". You play on a 8x8 board, and you select your pieces from a randomly generated selection of 5 every round. Each of these ""pieces"", AKA heroes, have varying prices that you purchase with coins that are given to you at the end of every round. You then have to decide how to strategically place your heroes on the board, on top of learning how each hero is best utilized to synergize with one another. You will also need to take into account the heroes your opponent chooses, as well as the layout of their pieces, in order to counter them effectively. Other factors to consider would be itemization (a single item your heroes can carry), as well as which heroes to upgrade(if you even have the chance to do so).

Knowledge of DotA is not required to play Underlords, but a good amount of adaptive strategy is a must. Spending valuable coins on just any piece is the quickest way to lose the game. Of course, due to the randomness of the pieces that are offered to you, a certain degree of luck is required (about ~30%). Although unless you are extremely unlucky, you should be able to adjust your strategy according to the pieces that are offered to you, considering the fact that you can get a full refund for any pieces that you have yet to upgrade.

Dota Underlords runs pretty smooth for an early access game, and as of early August, there's none of that horrid microtransactional garbage.

This isn't the easiest game to get the hang of, but it's completely free and can be played on mobile. There's no reason in my opinion why you shouldn't at least try this game, unless you're prone to bouts of violence at the slightest hint of any bad luck."
16723,Nice game

16735,"Best Auto chest game, Nice graphic , easy to understand"
16736,Nice Game!
16737,"I'm giving this a 9/10. A friend of mine introduced me to this and I wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. A big group of us played a private match together and most of us didn't know how to play at the beginning. What makes this game so fun and great is that it's very easy to learn. You play a few sparring (prep) rounds before you duel your friends (or opponents, just depends which mode you play), then that's when the game gets very interesting. Once you're committed to a build, you're either gonna be unstoppable, or screwed if it doesn't work out. If you aren't a fan of RNG, then this isn't a game for you. There's so many builds to try out and experiment with, and you'll get addicted to this, easily.

Only reason I didn't give it 10/10 was because of a bug that crashes the game, but after you reopen the game, it takes you right where you left off, and not many games do that, which is a huge plus. Once this gets fixed, I'll definitely give it a 10/10 :) Can't wait to see how this develops over time!"

16744,"Holy troll game... it's a cute little tactics (or so you think game) but honestly, I think Valve knows this game is going nowhere, and they purposely developed it to troll the players into hating this type of game...

1. You try to play the synergy... after 5 games and a tutorial you have a clue what you are doing... 
But EVERY GAME, its the same bullshit..... whatever you play for, doesnt synergize....
You reroll for one lucky combbo, then your bank is dead.. or you play the economy, and you take 15 damage per round
so by the time you have 50+ gold... you are < 50 in points taking 10-19 per round.. 

soon you have to spend 50 gold in one round just cuz if you don't do something to stop the bleeding, game over..
but guess what, you are 3 levels higher than your opponents, (3 more pieces to play) and still can't win to someone who never played the economy since the beginning. kicking your ass even though you are making 3-5 times the gold per round
because the RNG trolls you, its not RNG< its controlled, and don't believe me? Go for anythingi of fthe bat.. trolls, tinnkerer... you'll get a tier 2 if you spend your gold, if you hold out, you never will.... nothing will synergize ever.... then you change tactics, and wap, what you played starts to drop like crazy... then its mid game... assassins are getting weaker.... but guess what
double assassins on the board of two types... nothing else... dont fall for the TRAP! reroll.. nothing
reroll nothing
reroll nothingn
reroll nothingn
reroll nothingn
reroll nothingn
reroll nothingnreroll nothingn
two tree's and an enchantress with a druid mage whatever the fuck and your out the game

fucking run far away annd fast, its so fixed, and just a bad game anyhow
eventually it will completely be played by bots, because its nothing to do with skill
just managemennt

16745,Super enjoyable take on the autochess genre. I personally have played both TFT and Underlords a fair amount and enjoy Underlords a lot more. I'm honestly excited for there to be cosmetics / stuff to buy just cause I enjoy the game so much.

16750,HOPE THIS SH1T GAME GONNA SH1T IF THEY HAVE BATTLE PASS HERE TOO
16751,"This game is a horrendous piece of shit.

- Steven Seagal"
16752,Valve can make games in 2019! Dota Underlords is sensation of this year!
16753,This game too random - Just a waste of time because you cannot be good at it - you need to be lucky
16754,"Good autochess game, looks like dev´s are trying to keep up with competition, it will be rough tho. So far I am excited to play and looking forward to other treats."
16755,"I love this game, I hate this game and I want to throw my notebook out of the window :)"
16756,gut
16757,shit tier
16758,It's a good game. Matches could be shorter but the game has a surprising amount of potential.
16759,You can play on the computer and if you have to go on the toilet you can just log into you phone and play there. 10/10
16760,"10/10, the devs are great and the game as well."
16761,"A game has never made me want to tear out my hair more. This game has a long way to go. Builds are boring, excluding the fact that you can get absolutely boinked from RNG. There is a certain level of skill involved in that you must be flexible when selecting what builds you can do on the fly. After that, it's seemingly pure RNG, whether or not you can get decent items, or heroes to ensure that you can get into the late game with some semblance of a build."
16762,I play this when I poop
16763,"Underlords is exactly what it needs to be, AutoChess that exists outside the DotA2 client with functional matchmaking and a cleaner UI."
16764,"1.It's a pretty cool game mod for Dota 2 because it feel somewhat refreshing despite being a totally different game and not a mod just so we're clear.
2.So far I encounter no bug and the game run pretty smoothly 
3.As a Dota player any knowledge that you learn from the actual game itself (Dota 2) does not apply here because it literally just went to the abyss.
4.I don't much about auto chess but it's a pretty fun game when you played it yourself 
5.You don't have to had any experience in the actual Dota 2 to play this game because it's a totally different game because it is like I said, this is entirely different.You will have an easier time remembering each units abilities as you play, which items is the best for your unit in your board and you can tell which set is the best for your team. for example: goblins gives you a healing status effect for 1 unit on your board

Overall I like this game and the concepts is easy to understand as you progress from being ""WHAT THE HECK IS ALL OF THIS"" to ""pfftt too easy"""
16765,RNG LOVES ME !
16766,"I guess you guys just made it. The next decade will be dedicated to this such of games, and im proud to be part of the most successful game! just GREAT."
16767,"This needs more time to be refined. Right now it's painfully RNG to my reckoning. There's some thoughtfulness and skill to the early part of the game but when it comes down to the end it's exceedingly luck based. It's extremely hard to reconfigure a comp nearing the late game. Especially when itemization and global choices impact the your team comp. You can scroll through and see what your opponents are building but it's hard to know what kind of team you'll need in the end. 

Alternatively you can get extremely lucky early and build a brutal wombo-combo and then just build a warchest. 

The alliances really don't gel very well. You can be mistaken into thinking you need to build your team around alliances but realistically you're building your team around individual abilities. If alliances have synergy then that's a bonus (and a powerful one).

Having played both this and the LoL auto-chess this strikes me as way less strategic. It seems to lean more heavily on the RNG of what heroes you get rather than thinking about how to build a team and then rebuild it to combat the remaining players late game. There's always going to be an element of luck and I think that might help this game's popularity overall but it's very frustrating to someone who likes strategy. 

I feel like this is a good mobile game for the very casual player. Anyone has a chance of winning if you happen into lucky rolls that give you the necessary heroes. That's fine I suppose, but it'd be nice if the overall winner of the game wasn't decided half way through. After a while of playing I could generally see who was going to win well before the end and knew that I would need a hell of a lot of luck to get the necessary heroes needed to overcome them.

But that brings me to the last problem. It's very slow. Each match takes a while to complete but I can generally tell who's going to end up 1,2,3 well before it's over.

Ultimately I think simplicity might be the key. There are a lot of possible combinations of heroes and the alliances do not actually do a good job of indicating what the pairings should be. I think a good fix will be to make fewer overall alliances and up the late game gold take, along with some other comeback mechanics to make the outcome less certain. 

To me it's more fun when you have to think about what your opponent is doing and then dump heroes and rebuild. Right now you kind have to hope your wombo-combo happens to beat the other top wombo-combos and you get the heroes to make it happen. 

But part of me realizes the genius of this is that literally anyone can win without having to think about it too much.

Edit #1: Yes, RNG plays a major role in this game, but the reason that I'm now not recommending the game in its current state is my disappointment in the latest patch that should have decreased the impact of RNG instead of increasing it!

16794,"The Mobile version was greatly improved
It was laggy at first and now its playable"
16795,"An autobattler game, where you continuously build up your squad, which battles in rounds against other players.

Underlords is loosely based on DOTA, but you don't need to know or have played DOTA. You will only have easier time remembering what each of the units does without reading it repeatedly. Each unit belongs in two or three alliances. If you control multiple units of the same alliance, you get a bonus which makes them or the whole squad stronger. 

Underlords is relatively fast-paced, with some short wait times between rounds. It offers a big variety of strategies, each of them being counterable by a different one. The only bigger downside is RNG, which usually makes the difference between similarly skilled players. More experienced players usually beat others, barring a very bad luck."
16796,"To be honest, this is the best auto chess game, kinda complicated at start, especially if you never played dota, but after I watched a few youtube videos and spent a week playing, I realized valve has finally done something right.

What surprised me the most, is that the mobile version works even better.

You can start on pc and continue on phone which is great.

16817,"Pretty good, and nice takeover on the Arcade Game."
16818,It's a interesting not bored game.... Well Done!!!
16819,"Great dynamic strategy game with lost of choices and lots of room for outwitting your opponents. At first it may seem quite random but switching strategies accordingly and even utilisation of losing spree are the way to go if things go south, Definitely worth a try for strategy fans"
16820,Excited every round :)
16821,nice game. just kidding lol.
16822,10/10
16823,so fun
16824,"Overall as a game it isn't half bad. The mechanics are good and the gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. However, there is no denying the fact that sometimes rng does play a role in some games. I would say that it is a decent that needs some polishing. Some strats and just broken while others are underpowered. Some balance issues here and there. I fit is fix it will be a great game"
16825,Good Game
16826,nice games
16827,Like auto chess but offical
16828,IMO the original Autochess on Dota 2 was better in terms of fun
16829,Nice
16830,Dota.
16831,nc game
16832,"Great way to kill some time! Experiment with new combos and setups. Huge RNG elements, so skill will only take you so far. Definitely a fun little game, well worth checking out! Easy to learn and have fun with.

Update 20191127: after having a break from it and coming back to it - the new elements of the game are engaging, albeit time consuming. Leveling your underlord does take some time and it gives an actual advantage in the game, so it needs to be done to be competitive. Still having a good time with it."
16833,Can't go wrong with Dota. Now with no team mates that trash talk you!
16834,"If you get 3 unstable reactors at the start of the game, go Scrappy Mechs
If you don't get 3 unstable reactors at the start of the game, go Troll Knights"
16835,"I wasn't able to enjoy autochess because of the UI in Drodo's mod.
Now I can at least figure out what I'm supposed to do.
I still don't see the appeal"
16836,Good if u played before dota 2
16837,Rng makes me want to kill myself
16838,better than others
16839,"Pretty good and deep game. At first it may look a bit chaotic and too based on chance, but keep playing and you will find that it handsomely rewards knowledge of the possibilities of the draft."
16840,Really liking the game-play as being a big fan of Dota 2 but I think it relies too much on luck and can get frustrating at times. A solid start and updates are coming constantly.
16841,ok
16842,"Automated chess, best part is you can play dota on phone now"
16843,"Easy to learn game but hard to master. It has a good amount of RNG, but controllable enough to be a fun game still(similar to hearthstone)"
16844,Pretty fun Auto Chess variant.
16845,its cool
16846,"Good

edit: Still kinda good, desperately needs a new update soon though."
16847,Good game for those who like strategy
16848,no
16849,Pray to RNGesus to get what you need
16850,Play Team Fight Tactics instead
16851,Very Interesting Game xD
16852,nice game
16853,really good game
16854,mehh
16855,"Praise be Lord Gaben!

Valve still got it."
16856,"9/10
best auto chess"
16857,Good
16858,"It's a polished version of Autochess, what more could you want?"
16859,It very good
16860,stupid rng makes the game from winning situation to lose very nice
16861,better than dota 3
16862,"Got into the game because of the mod Autochess in Dota 2. Climbed the highest rank in a few days. Due to frequent updates and changed to the game I would definitely recommend the game. First few games you are confused but when you get a hang of the controls, it is a really chill game."
16863,im addickted
16864,fun mobile game
16865,"Its auto chess. It does what it says on the tin. Very polished for early access, works well"
16866,Fuckin' masterpiece
16867,Is good.
16868,nice like a LoL
16869,jooooooon
16870,It's like gambling but losing is more fun than winning!
16871,better than I expected
16872,"Hi there

I'm loving the game and this is only a minor inconvenience that I'm pointing out with the aim to help improve the game. I also understand that the game is still in alpha.

I attempted to submit this via the in-game feedback link but it failed twice. In Chrome, the first time it stated there was an error in submitting my feedback and the second time it had a 502. 

Nevertheless, here is my feedback:

I'm new and I play against bots with click-to-start-turn on. If I've left the game idle for a long period it crashes out of the game completely. The save feature is fantastic and I can easily resume the game so this is a minor hassle that only takes restarting the game.

Maybe an inactivity kick warning could be added. Then an inactivity kick to the main menu? 

Thank you for an awesome game! Please continue letting us know how we can support you!

Regards
Rudolf

P.S. I would be happy to remove this and submit my feedback via another channel if such a channel was made available to me :)"
16873,i hate strategy games. but summersale need me to play new
16874,a copycat with dota world!
16875,Seems alright
16876,"The BEST AutoChess, all other copies of the original are, meh..."
16877,kinda okay
16878,Nice game
16879,Very interesting
16880,nice
16881,pepega games
16882,If u like auto chess game then u r going to love this but need better UI
16883,"Actually, to be honest I will not recommend it to you in the current state. Too many bugs and the game needs way too much balance.

But is free and if you like dota, maybe you will enjoy it."
16884,Божественно
16885,"Oddly fun. The ui is clean, simple and intuitive. The only downside is the fighting mechanism where you dont really face up your real enemy in the battlefield, only their clones, which is very disappointing the first time you realized it. Really wish they gonna change that in the near future, to make it more like teamfight tactics."
16886,"Polished AutoChess
same game playable on mobile and desktop"
16887,So much fun
16888,11/10 would play again
16889,Great new game! Also downloaded to my mobile for extra playz
16890,Better than AutoLULches
16891,good one volvo
16892,lots of potential but doesnt keep Me playing.
16893,meh
16894,good games
16895,Pretty slick version
16896,need to add more race and classes for more flexible strategy
16897,nice
16898,"Solid Implementation in the AutoBattler genre, however it does feel very isolated, like you're not playing against other people at all.
Not enough user interaction."
16899,GG

16901,"DOTA UNDERLORDS 8/10

16905,cool
16906,good
16907,Recommended
16908,not bad.
16909,:)
16910,dead game
16911,So far I'm really enjoying this.  It's a great game to play while listening to a stream or a video!
16912,"I suck at Dota, lucky for me this game has (except for the setting and some heroes) no similarities to Dota whatsoever. It's not that hard to get into but takes some time to get good at (I still dont consider myself good at all, tho)"
16913,Better than Dota 2 change my mind.
16914,"cross platform - Mobile to PC , for game like this. its is best thing steam did lately"
16915,this game is good
16916,Crashes too many times at the moment
16917,Gotta love easier version dotz chess
16918,Fun game
16919,game is good but we are looking for dota 2 on mobile asap
16920,no bad
16921,"No balance, RNG fest."
16922,YES
16923,Very noice game. no addiction possible Krappa
16924,"It's like Dota. You hate every second of it, but you can't stop playing."
16925,Sick tits
16926,Nice game
16927,"Very interesting much good, but not sure in long term interest in game"
16928,"If you like Dota heroes, then you will definitely have fun with this game."
16929,Imagine valve naming it Artifact.
16930,Never really been a Dota fan but this is really fun plus I can play it anywhere!
16931,Purty good. 8/10 will play again
16932,aksjd
16933,Good game but hope more heroes are added
16934,GG chess
16935,Very fun!
16936,ez game
16937,"Im so unlucky with the damn hero pools, but its cool."
16938,"fun game overall, recommended
"
16939,sad
16940,"Dota Underlords is addictive, fun and frustrating as well as the the best looking autochess game with the DotA 2 heroes you know and love. Personally my favourite Autochess game."

16942,good
16943,EGG
16944,Strat on a next level!
16945,"this is an amazing game that will suck you away for hours
"
16946,top
16947,"Nice mobile version - huge improvement to UI but still lacking a few features over TFT and DaC! Hopefully we'll get there, since this is the best looking of these games to date."
16948,its good
16949,It is a good game. Took me a while to understand it but it is a worth to play  game. Hope there is a multiple game speed setting for AI practice. For multiplayer mode round 1 to round 3 preparation time can be shorten a bit.
16950,addictive
16951,gud gem
16952,"
Nice GAme. Full of tactics"
16953,Not bad
16954,If they could only make the game a bit faster
16955,Godlike game. 10x better than Teamfight Tactics
16956,its okay
16957,What the hell is this
16958,nice gameplay
16959,if you play 1 game you feel like you wanna GO AGANE
16960,"Great inspiration from the Auto Chess custom game for Dota 2 to be part of their game

10/10 if you can learn the Auto Chess' Basics"
16961,It is funny and not a tiring game and alternative to Autochess map in Dota 2.
16962,"feels like playing with robots, no chat feature"
16963,AWESOME GAME
16964,The most UI friendly Battle Chess I've played so far.
16965,yes. yes.
16966,awful
16967,Great game with big improvements from the original Auto Chess. Waiting for the underlord-feature.
16968,Easy to get into the game and understand how to play it and feels like a well thought out game.
16969,I love gambling!
16970,"by far the best UI of the autochess genre so far

not that that means much"
16971,Very Nice.
16972,Finally a good Dota game
16973,Is a decent autochess game. Still needs update to be as good as the DAC version.
16974,Good game well played!
16975,"Mechanics are fun, except when you get screwed by rng and waste 20 minutes of your life... The game is not well balanced at all yet. Every patch just makes something different OP. Maybe they'll get it right eventually. I would give it a 'meh' rather than a thumbs up or thumbs down if I could."
16976,nice game
16977,NEat
16978,"Way too time-sinky
Upgrade mechanics are annoying. I get the design, but you end up negatively snowballing. If you don't get the upgrades you want/need, you end up losing, which means you have less chances to get the upgrades you need, which means you lose more.
Uninstalling. May revisit later, but in its current form, this game is just not worth my while."
16979,"Very funny, easy to begin but it has a very depth strategy system. I definitely recommend it."
16980,pretty darn good actualy
16981,Good Game.. But it needs more update...
16982,"I'm enjoying it alot! And it's free! 

^^"
16983,The fact that it's on mobile makes it better
16984,really stale balance right now. play meta or get blown out.
16985,Better than Team Fight Tactics by Riot Games.
16986,nice game
16987,good
16988,"Worth trying out once, Good for everyone who ever played Auto Chess once. Have Fun Playing Valve's own Auto chess :D"
16989,Fun
16990,"Got lucky. Won.

Got unlucky. Lost.

5/7"
16991,"It's not like i thought, gonna get back with DAC"
16992,well played. good game
16993,great game
16994,ez to get mad
16995,morokai died for this pepehands
16996,Came from Auto Chess to this version of the genre. Underlords runs more smoothly than the mod Auto chess and has less RNG with more interesting options for items. Overall a great iteration on the genre. I hope they continue to develop and add more units just as the Auto chess developers did to their mod. It will be really interesting when the Standalone Auto Chess version comes out and we get to see som true competition between these games.
16997,The Original is more fun to play than the stand alone.
16998,GOOD GAME
16999,"Amazing strategy game, would rate this 10/10. (Waaaaaaaaaaaay better than most auto-chess games out there)"
17000,gg
17001,"hey, thats pretty good"
17002,better than autochess
17003,bastante interesante

17007,"Fun, Strategic, and dynamic fun party or solo gameplay. must try!"
17008,Play jek
17009,Pretty good but League of Legend's TFT game mode is better.
17010,"we got underlord instead of ucking campaign fuck this shit
"
17011,need luck to win this game
17012,aye
17013,Pretty good but lacks a better reward system for winning or similar. As of now when you win it feels pretty dull.
17014,lit
17015,"Love it!
The mobile version is GOOD too."
17016,The overwhelming RNG aspect of it isn't really fun for me.
17017,assassin too weak
17018,Just really enjoyable game to play with friends and figuring out different builds. Can't wait to see future updates and adds.
17019,good fun especially on mobile
17020,Gim kntl hoki hokian
17021,yea
17022,"it was released pretty fast on iOS.
Has crashes"
17023,nice start. Keeep updating strats. Nice game.
17024,"Teamfight Tactics is better, what up haters"
17025,"Don't play Dota2 and know nothing about the units, this was a fun game on it's own, and its free. Hard to beat that."
17026,12
17027,yep you can play on your phone
17028,not bad but needs improvement.
17029,GOT SENT TO GAY BABY JAIL.

17039,"So much potential, but it is severely lacking. Dota Autochess is so much more balanced and intricate. This game is a little stupid."
17040,This game is good
17041,pretty fun! best for a time killer.
17042,It's k
17043,it is lit
17044,Ага...
17045,Having a ton of fun playing it. Could use a better tutorial.
17046,Fun game
17047,"Easily the most polished Auto Chess game on both mobile and PC. The quick developer handling of balance and bugs has been outstanding but being beta the faction balance sometimes swings a little too far when changes are made. If you plan on playing on a higher level I would definitely read every set of patch notes.

"
17048,"Needs some improvements but still a promising game :"")"
17049,g
17050,just review for event
17051,"Dota Underlords has the best RNG on all autochesses today, being an experience that surprises you after some games. Recommend."
17052,good!!
17053,still dead
17054,"10/10, would play for 6 hours straight again."
17055,Pretty good; comparable to TFT but Dota obviously.
17056,Pretty Fun and chill.
17057,Like the auto chess mod but better in every way
17058,Pretty good TBH.
17059,nice game
17060,Better than Artifact
17061,y
17062,"The game is fun to play, the games are a bit long sometimes but still fun!"
17063,nice gameplay
17064,i got boss.10/10 game
17065,great game but gets challenging the more you rank up. game mechanics needs to be better explained
17066,Autism mastery :333
17067,fun to play now and then
17068,I've been to Hell and back and back to Hell and back
17069,Melhor que o do lol.
17070,"Amazing.  Already better polished than regular auto-chess, lots of potential."
17071,low graphic but still fun to played this game
17072,"Good game, 9/10"
17073,"game for your free time, thanks for challenging AI, it was super fun, i can quit anytime and continue my game later"
17074,Good as f*ck
17075,better than tft
17076,Game crashes when looting Silver Lining
17077,its a pretty comfy game
17078,"u ever thought to urself hell yea chamber of secrets hermoine, ya thats what i thought u fkin white devil"
17079,"So Good,So Far"
17080,great
17081,One of the best game to waste your time when you are bored. Enjoy guys!
17082,Imagine Dota 2 but its actually Warcraft 3 Dota...Yaaaa
17083,Game is fun.
17084,"Whoever thought of this, kudos to you"
17085,great game
17086,Addict !
17087,Pretty sick
17088,The game had the possibility of being good. The monetization model was unclear and the development appears to have been abandoned though there has been no official commentary from Valve on this. I would not recommend the game in the current state as there is not long-term reason to play. I would think the dwindling player base would mean the matchmaking is not great.
17089,"Nice game. But graphic look kinna cartoon. Need to be more dark
"
17090,The game is addicting.  Can't wait for the battle pass and underlords to be added.
17091,I WILL BEAT ANY SMALL BRAINED DOGSHIT GAMER AT THIS GAME
17092,Okay
17093,this game is the best you can even play it on your phone if you are out haha
17094,fun semi idle game
17095,Not bad
17096,Good game
17097,Hmm
17098,"Competitive gambling and creativity. 10 Artifacts out of 10. Going to drop everything for its esport future, watch me now ma!"
17099,Love it
17100,Best game ever
17101,Fun game. Very interesting concept. Each match is usually takes around 30-45 minutes
17102,"Stupid rng game, only optimal setups and every good character is super contested, needs balancing tweaks."
17103,Good AC game
17104,Great game. Love the updates.
17105,lujcujb noni hi yk uhijol
17106,"A lot easier to get into than Dota Autochess and its Graphics and Interface are, at least for me, quite appealing."
17107,"Best auto chess style game out there. better than TFT, you are at least guaranteed items every neutral round + more viable option strategy."
17108,1
17109,Very fun game 10/10
17110,It's alright.
17111,a clone from the other game but still would give a thumbs up.
17112,"Better than other auto chess, probably the best one, with less RNG than the other."
17113,It's good! I'm excited to see how the game changes from Autochess and how Underlords changes its identity further in the future.
17114,Great game. Lots of fun.
17115,"Essentially a deck-building game, but with heroes and positioning.
Considering it's free, it's VERY dope."
17116,Very fun 10/10
17117,dog game
17118,"I liked Dota Autochess from Dota 2, now this? Damn loving it"
17119,Fun.
17120,"I love this game just because of how addictive and unpredictable it is.
You can have a plan from the start then have it get absolutely ruined by the RNG.
The uncertainty you have just playing this game is the main reason I recommend it."
17121,"I have mixed feelings, but my overall impression is positive. This game is infuriating as a competitive outlet due to the massive amount of RNG involved. There is room for skill, but ultimately if you get bad RNG, you're going to have a hard time winning. If you want a game to satisfy your competitive drive, I would look elsewhere. If you're just looking for a chill multiplayer game to play without trying to take it too seriously, this game will scratch that itch. The crossplay on mobile is a huge plus too; I mostly play this game on my phone with the occasional game on desktop."
17122,It was a great foundation to create Teamfight Tactics.
17123,This is a good game
17124,love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17125,"Fun game.
I have this fear that Valve will abandon the game after its released or stop updating the game often, as the weekly balance patches is what keept the original Autochess and Underlords interesting, but post 2013 Valve is known for letting their projects to rot.
 So far the people behind the game have been really active, and has been different to all other valve games where there is actual comunication between developers and the community, there are a lot of  balance, optimization and content patches, keeping the meta shifting weekly so the game doesn't get stale, just hope they keep this attitude, and don't do what Valve is know to do with their games last couple of years

the balance so far ( july 2019) is kinda wonky, but is understandable as the game is still in early beta.
wish there was a bit less of RNG on the item system, so far is way better than the one in the original autochess, but still is luck heavy, like having 2 passives and 2 items each neutral round to choose, and 3 and 3 if you get the item to have extra options, that way there is way less luck involved on a game that is already hard on the RNG"
17126,Good
17127,The nerfing of loss streaks essentially turned this game into a slot machine.
17128,"Out of the 3 Auto Chess games out right now (League's Teamfight Tactics, the original Auto Chess by Drodo, and this), I 100% prefer this one the most. It has a solid pacing (TFT is way too fast and more RNG heavy because of it, Auto Chess is too slow especially for being a mobile release, but Underlords hits a nice sweet spot because of the number values on every piece), a great and consistent item system, and the possibility of *deep* and *interesting* lore to introduce to the DotA universe that a certain *other* game didn't really help with. 



hopefully this game makes us all forget that artifact even existed"
17129,"Having played both Dota and Drodo's Auto Chess, I'd say that 'underworld' theme and lore takes a bit of getting used to. However, being able to practice with bots allowed me to familiarize with the mechanics. Speaking of mechanics, it's not as deep/complex (yet) compared to Auto Chess, but so far the simplicity works for me. : )"
17130,Its Okay.
17131,"Great game, I love playing this game because it makes me think of strategies to make me complete the rounds."
17132,I'm writing this review for the summer sale quest.
17133,I have no idea what I am doing.
17134,"Very cool, I like it"
17135,I mean the first match was fun.
17136,Great game
17137,"it is cleaner than the original but there are several bugs, and pretty unbalanced"
17138,Good but Mobile port better than PC
17139,RNG
17140,Nice chess
17141,"Really solid. Feels like a polished version of the dota mod with a few more balancing issues. Overall, I would suggest trying it out."
17142,Pretty good try on Auto Chess.
17143,Huge balance issues and awful ui. I'm playing on pc and i have to navigate like i'm on my smartphone? Can't event press ESC to exit settings menu have to click on the X. They don't even care for the pc version
17144,Solid game - can't wait for updates.
17145,"Neat autochess, but still needs some kind of account progression"
17146,pretty fun.
17147,"ok,"
17148,"Standalone game based on the DOTA 2 auto-chess mod.
Underlords has a much nicer UI and a loot-drop system that's less random. Frequent updates with balance-changes."
17149,"Rerole na esperança de vir o que você precisa, falhe miseravelmente. 10/10"
17150,its good
17151,nice
17152,very nce
17153,very good
17154,"Yeah, It's ok"
17155,Fun game
17156,Barely having a tutorial. No rewards for winning a match and only one stage.
17157,"Could be an interesting version of AutoChess. The visible lines of support between characters when placing on the board is a good effect, and useful.  While fun, the game is still very raw and needs some more time in the oven. The potential is definitely there."
17158,topp
17159,"A good game, but has a steeper learning curve than other autochess games"
17160,"The game is obfuscated behind enough layers hoping that the player will convince themselves they are actually responsible for the outcome in what is little more than a gambling game with large random elements.

It's not that bad, it's more that it isn't."
17161,you can play it on your phone

17171,"Lovely.!
Superbly Addictive..! I love this game and the amount of dedication from Dev Team.!"
17172,Fun and addicting. Has a good amount of depth and strategy mixed with rng.
17173,Fine game
17174,Funny game!
17175,"Great little game, very casual with just enough strategic control and depth to feel rewarding when you win. There is also a skill cap and over time your increased understanding can be used to win fairly consistently. Luck plays a part but I've only felt unlucky in a small number of games and I wouldn't say it was too devastating to my chances of winning.

Update: Game has progressed alot with massive additions to both gameplay and content, highly recommended!"
17176,"good game, great graphics"

17189,"If you like auto chess games, this is for sure a must try one. Currently there is only one real competition, yet this game has a unique style and is really fun to play!"
17190,"Easy enough to play, hard enough to rage over"
17191,Dota for Smartphone ?
17192,"Solid but a bit too time consuming to be an ""in between"" game."
17193,fun game
17194,"Every round you are presented with 5 random heroes. You can draft some of them into your ""hand"" using your gold. You place these heroes on a chessboard and then the battle phase starts. You are pitted against one of your opponents at random. The battlephase is fully automated, and the only influence you have on it is the starting positions of your lineup. If you have the better drafted heroes, you win that round and gain some extra gold for winning.If you lose, you lose some life point (and get some small amount of gold if you are on a losing streak). This goes on and on untill there is only 1 man standing.

There are other elements to it like upgrading heroes, upgrading your line up size, getting items to enhance your heroes, etc....

There are a lot of random elements to the game. But the challenge is really in trying to figure out what heroes to invest in, managing your economy, what will your end game look like, etc.... And all of this happens often in this small window of time you get to draft your next hero. It reminds me a lot of deck building card games. Yes there is luck involved, but I find that it has a nice balance of luck and strategy."
17195,"It's Valve own version of Dota 2 Auto Chess. It's awesome that you can play not only on your computer but in your phone as well. If you're a dota 2 lover and not a graphic artsy kind of person who loves new experience then this is the game for you. In order to survive the game and win the top, you need to be extremely lucky and strategic about your team composition! Team Buffs is the key. Dominating in the earlier round may still end up losing the game! 
8/10"
17196,very addicted - don't play
17197,pretty good time killer
17198,Much improved from the original. The current best auto chess.

17226,"I went in knowing extremely little, but it turns out the GAME IS REALLY FUN.
It definitely needs a better tutorial but after 2 games I figured it out.
I've only won once but playing it and losing isn't terribly heartbreaking. It was
fun the whole time."

17243,"It's an Autobattler, so you know what you're going to get.
Surprisingly competent execution, following Artifact's failure.
Meta could use some work, but we're still in the early days here, so it gets a pass."

17250,"Solid port of AutoChess mod from DotA2. Mobile version will eat your battery, but the desktop version is good."
17251,"[h2]Played on Linux and Android.[/h2]

Personally, the best game in the Multiplayer Auto Battle Arena(MABA) genre. There is a steep learning curve in this game, as there is for all other similar games, but it is not mandatory to know how to play Dota to play Underlords. Also, one of the benefits of the genre is that games are not as stressful because of the lack of need for cooperation with the rest of your team, unlike in Dota. The presence of RNG when drawing the heroes makes you think of a strategy on-the-fly during the game, which is both exciting and frustating, since you may find yourself redrawing the hero pool constantly to never get the one you wanted.

Another cool thing is that it works on both PC and mobile. This is rare, since most mobile games are either bad (too many ads and microtransactions) or are ported poorly to the platform.

8/10 I'm the greatest strategist of all time, but when I lose it's the RNGs fault."
17252,It's fine
17253,"a bit random, but still fun."
17254,"Great game, with some serious potential. The bugs present can be overlooked, given the rushed release.
But overall the game has a lot more room to improve !"
17255,no tx
17256,Good game
17257,"Better than TFT, but has little exposure."
17258,good
17259,"90% rng/luck, 10 skill, the one who gets the most units to upgrade wins.

17265,"It takes a while to know how to play the game, but reading online guides helped.

Simple to pick up but hard to master. Not a game you can play on toilet break however, the game runs slightly longer than that. 

Overall decent game, would play in my free time, super casual."
17266,garbage
17267,Great game seems like the most balanced version of auto chess for the time being.
17268,Woefully unbalanced due to the insane amount of RNG based mechanics. I'd suggest avoiding it.
17269,meh
17270,Loving this game.  So chill and fun to get into.
17271,Great game with lots of replay value. Would love to see more items and characters though.
17272,It's fine :)
17273,good game!
17274,"Takes a lot to figure out and get into, but i can see myself sinking in a lot more hours if I decide to commit to it.

17285,"I haven't really gotten into this genre but it seems nice, combo well and your team will dominate, atm it still feels like a beta but ok"
17286,"Great Game, congrats to the developers who started Dota 2 Chess. Looks like LOL has also followed suit!"

17294,nice game tho
17295,Good phone game. Good if you like only slightly boring games.

17309,pretty cool
17310,"It's a standalone of the dota 2 arcade format.

What can be said about it is that at least matchmaking is quick and it is optimised from the get go.

on the plus side additional items are added alongside garanteed drops during select round.

It depends what you're after, give both a try and choose to play whichever you think is best but for a standalone autochess this works well enough."
17311,"nice game 
"

17334,Easy to play and fun
17335,"Great game out of the gate, and pretty easy to pick up"
17336,a great take on the Auto chess Genre I love it! I recommend on other RTS style players Out there Try This one!

17344,berry good.
17345,just like hearthstone
17346,Nice game!
17347,its ok !
17348,"one items per piece is just weird. Also why don't we have any proper indication of the effect such as -armor, +armor, +dmg,.... In dota version they are very obvious but in this game I don't even see any different between 2 heartless (-10 armor) and 0 heartless."
17349,Хорошая игра

17353,"this is a nice cool game with a lot of heros and stuff .



NICE JOB GABE"
17354,"Nice but pretty repetitive. You quickly have seen everything.

The reason I cannot recommend the game at it's current state, is that what bothers me the most after having the feeling to have seen everything already: It takes way too long. If one match would take 15-30 minutes that would be awsome, but games often last 1 hour, in which time I could play a game of actual Dota and likely have more fun."
17355,"Pretty fun turn based game.

It was a pretty fun turn based game. But devs have abandoned it..."
17356,don't get it but 10/10
17357,A brilliant little time waster.
17358,bruh 2
17359,good
17360,Probably only popular because it is a valve game.
17361,shieet
17362,Valves auto chess spin-off. It has some nice quality of life improvments which makes it better than D2 autochess. The dev team is very active and listens to the community. 9/10
17363,This definitely has a lot of potential. Keep up Valve!
17364,Amazing game! very addictive!
17365,this game is great
17366,"Its good h3h3, gief me rewards"
17367,"Seems a bit rushed and i do miss the big costume changes of characters when upgrading them star wise.
But with that said, it is a fun casual game with lots of hours of entertainment"
17368,Pretty decent. Nice that you can play on mobile as well as PC!
17369,better than tft
17370,"Fun time, can recommend for fans of dota and Dota auto chess.

Loads of updates"

17387,Better than autochess
17388,"its fun, but could be improved"
17389,"Fun time-waster with strategy elements. Can't be too critical since its in beta but it will need some extras (in terms of more minions/game modes etc) to give it more longevity. Also things like unlockable skins, arenas, achievements and such would be cool. Still a solid game as is though."

17448,"I'm new to the whole Autochess genre. I've been playing DU for a few days along with TFT. From a casual player perspective, I like that you don't need to build towards an item. You can assign an item as well as transfer them between heroes.

Interface-wise, selecting heroes to buy in DU blocks the top portion of the screen, including parts of the chess board. You can minimize it and/or set your zoom to max distance, but the top portion is still blocked if you don't minimize the hero selection list.

Beyond those little annoyances, great game!"
17449,Here 2019
17450,why tho
17451,So good strat game!
17452,Best Game for Mobile :p

Yet to beat the bots above the easy difficulty. Playing against players feels easier so long everyone stays online otherwise with less players the game tends to snowball rather fast."
17487,nice
17488,Good game!
17489,"We're a couple years past the auto-battler boom, and no game has ever come close to being as incredible as Dota Underlords was. I've tried my fair share of them - Hearthstone Battlegrounds, Teamfight Tactics and Super Auto Pets, to name a few. This was my favourite game

Dota Underlords has a variety of game modes that check different boxes: duos for playing with a friend, knockout for quick games that allow for a little more mindlessness and of course the classic game mode that made it a great game to begin with. 

Not only that, the user interface is good. Everything is well explained and the game is relatively easy to follow. There are ample resources available to you within the game, to learn and understand the game, to be able and understand the combat phase, and also to experiment with compositions and their strengths and weaknesses.

The game was thriving. Regular updates that addressed balancing and meta changes, a healthy player base on top of a solid and well-running game were a recipe for success.

But then Valve stopped updating the game. The lack of updates meant that interest in the game decreased.  And slowly the game died. 

It's a dang shame, and I would not wish this fate on anyone else's favourite game. 
Please come back. :("
17490,While I am not a connoisseur of battle chess games I can say that this one is enjoyable enough to sink a few hours into while waiting around somewhere on your phone.
17491,good
17492,game butut
17493,Pretty good
17494,Very engaging as a PC game but not really suited for mobile gaming as a typical game session could be anywhere between 30mins to 1 hour.
17495,Played it for the 1st time a few minutes ago and I must say it looks addictive! :)
17496,"This game is kind of addictive. I had never even heard of Auto Chess before a week ago and a friend of mine got me on this. I haven't played the original Auto Chess or Team Fight Tactics by Riot but damn this game is fun. Think of it like poker, its 100% RNG so even if you're an amazing strategist and player the game will sometimes screw you and the best you can do is yell at your monitor. Lots of strategy and different comps you can make to get you to the top. I never really played Dota so I'm also having to learn the characters. As a Heroes of the Storm player, I bet its just a matter of time before Blizzard makes their own version. Get ready for this new genre to get saturated quick with other devs wanting a piece of the pie. Bottom line is this game is fun as hell to pass the time and its free and as of right now has zero micro transactions. Valve is back."
17497,"The best auto chess game atm, much better than its counterparts."
17498,It's a game.

17541,"Hey guys how to fix ""Error in creating a D3D device"". Help please"
17542,A good game to play when you're stuck in a bus with bad traffic jam.
17543,great fun!
17544,This is a good game
17545,Nice game
17546,Ggwp the best game
17547,Fun to play and I liked the flow of the game
17548,it ok
17549,Very attractive ggame
17550,Great evolution of the DAC mod
17551,Great time killer.
17552,"Game is extremely solid.

You can play free on PC or mobile device, and your account is linked. The game is quite simple to learn, but the heroes add much emergent complexity. While seemingly random, careful planning over the course of the entire game will allow a skilled player to win confidently by exercising a variety of interesting hero combinations.

The interface is very clean. While it is clearly designed for mobile, the simple design puts the focus on the core game mechanics. There are no unnecessary frills, which speaks to the quality of the base game. Some of the display components are a little buggy, but it seems apparent that these problems can be fixed easily after the beta test ends.

Due to the nature of the game, I look forward to new content and an enhanced competitive mode. Compared to other Autochess games, I feel that Underlords has the correct balance between skill-testing depth and ornate complexity. The item system is quite streamlined, so you don't have to worry about intricate upgrade trees. The focus stays on the heroes, which is the core game. The alliances system is also unique in that many bonuses apply only to heroes of the respective alliance. Only a few provide blanket buffs to your entire team. This adds more skill to the game because you actually have to think about which tanks will receive which bonuses. They don't just stack everything.

Thank you for reading!"
17553,"One of the newest time machines invented.
Start playing in the morning, then check outside, it will still be morning, but 2 days has already passed.
10/10 I would buy again for free."
17554,this game really enjoyable than playing dota 2.
17555,"This is a really fun game and great concept. I haven't played TFT but I don't think I want to, I am happy with this. Its a fantastic game for road trips on your phone. It is definitely worth the download!!"
17556,"EDIT: Warlocks no longer OP.

Warlocks OP"
17557,haha
17558,"not bad, combat seems more to favor status effect rather than damage output and coin generation leaves something to be desired unless youre on a streak. overall a decent time killer though"
17559,"Awesome when you get your setup just right, but RNG seems to be the biggest enemy you'll have."
17560,"Simplified version of Auto-Chess, basically the opposite of Team Fight Tactics (League of Legends : Auto-Chess).
Easy to pick up, tough to master."
17561,I think it captures well how big dota is. It's creating remarkable stand alone mods into games as valve have done it in past. I hope they see the benefits from old ways and that we are in for a wild ride. Thx Gabe
17562,"Chess, but dota, but definitely not chess, and not really dota. You know how you can level up in checkers? SO you can do that, but not the same way? It's confusing, but I won the tutorial so that's a start."
17563,"great game, a lot of potencial, but needs a new log of updates ingame"
17564,Absolutly love autochess!!! Can't belive they have something for strategy.
17565,NICE LA
17566,"Lazy mans doto, what more do you want, yo?!"
17567,"Great game to pass time with, its really challenging once you get down to learning the team compositions ."
17568,Autochess : tower defense on chess board
17569,gud game
17570,more heroes and buffs plz
17571,Underlords is fun and easy to learn. If you're new to the auto chess genre it is a great starting place (you can vs bots). You can also take your games to mobile seamlessly.
17572,Very addicting. What I love most about this game is the ability to switch from PC to Mobile seamlessly!
17573,12/10 would get addicted to.
17574,Very addicting
17575,"Valve should invest in making this game stand out even better in the competition. The mobile version looks sleek, and allows me to play this game anywhere I want. 😍"

17577,Is good
17578,"good game :)))

17579,"Totally love the game, the development, the only problem i have, is on the mobile app, they should improve the graphics with low end devices. BUT TOTALLY AWESOME!!"
17580,is g
17581,"awesome version of auto chess, hope to see how valve changes things up"
17582,RNG HATES ME!
17583,not a bad game but they could've added more stuff to it. also its hard for newcomers
17584,Fun

17586,10/10 Would Recommend
17587,"Feels like a card game.
Just a little too engaging to multitask.

+easy to play + interesting.  Many choices.
+Handles disconnects well

-no unlockables, collectibles, or inter-game progression besides player rank."
17588,very fun game
17589,Addicting
17590,"it addicting like a old custom game but for standalone game it need more feature, ill back reviewing after beta end"
17591,Its an alright game a bit different way of earning but I prefer the Original Auto Chess.
17592,amazinga
17593,Quite good if you going to play autochess games
17594,"Definitely loving this game! There's a lot going on and making an awesome team is all strategy, with some RNG. You gotta make the RNG play for you!"
17595,"Quite lag and hot on Mobile version, hope new heroes will be added in the future."
17596,Very enjoyable game!

17602,My just take over my life 11/10
17603,"yeah it's okay.

why read a review on a free game tho?"
17604,"too much rng, gets boring for me after some games coz there isnt much to do, not my type of game i guess, on technical side game looks very well."
17605,need luck to win even if u have good combination
17606,berry good add more people
17607,"Donate, disbalance, break matchmaking"
17608,Awesome strategy game. A little too much is left up to luck with the draw system; Nothing more frustrating putting together a perfect team and never receiving enough duplicates to upgrade them high enough to stay relevant round ~30+
17609,"Still in beta, but lots of depth and good turn around time on updates. Tutorialization is limited, but even as a player with no experience with either DotA2 or AutoChess, I still picked it up relatively quickly. The fact that it's also on mobile makes seals the deal when I compare it to other AutoChess options."
17610,nice
17611,It is best autochess
17612,it's ok
17613,"Fun mobile game, but the matches are a little long for casual play."
17614,Fun to play
17615,"Good game, addicted"
17616,fuck teamfight tactics.

17618,Awesome!

17632,"Kinda ""meh"" in the beginning but if you are into chess type strategy games, this ones actually good. Specially if you're familiar with DOTA 2, this game will grow into you...... or maybe if you're too lazy to play using both your hands and is tired of the toxic players but misses DOTA 2, this one's for you."
17633,good game for big gamers
17634,"been waiting for this!
Awesome!"
17635,I like this game also the new patch which benefits to new players
17636,This game is great

17640,"better than tft
"
17641,"A good take on autochess. Its easy to play, but fairly hard to master"
17642,Noice.
17643,"Nice game to kill some time. The games can get a little long, especially when you are on a losing streak. There is some unfair RNG element, where your run can go completely amiss because you can't get the right unites.

"
17644,Good for multi-tasking and having something fun to do
17645,"Man, this is one of those games that needs a ""Ehhhh...?????"" button, not a Yes or a No.

So, DotA Underlords. It's a game where you matchmake into a session with a few other players, it's free for all, and to win the game you need to be the last man standing.

The actual game is... you join a game, you get a bunch of, well, let's call them cards. Each time you get 3 of a kind, those 3 cards fusion into 1 card. Each card has a 'star' rating, each card starts at 1 star, and each time you shuffle 3 of a kind into your hand of the same star value, your card gains a star. So, three 1 star cards equals a single 2 star card, three 2 star cards equal a single 3 star card, etc, I have no idea if there's any higher than 3 since I never got that far.

Each 'turn' you and all other players get shuffled about maybe a dozen cards, and you get to purchase any of them with gold. You fight, you earn gold, you fight other players, then you basically just try to have the strongest team relative to your enemies.

I really feel like that sums up the game. I could go on, but basically you'll know if you want to play this game based on what I've already said, if you like card games and RNG then you'll probably have a good time with this one. Otherwise... stay away. I don't think there's anything for you here otherwise, I don't really think Underlords has mass appeal. It's an interesting game, but not really one I want to devote my life to."

17647,"Pretty good game,perfect when u're bored and don't know what to do."

17659,"Innovative new strategy game, great fun solo or with friends. Very competitive gameplay!"
17660,.
17661,"I like the easy to read UI-design but it is a tad uglier than Team Fight Tactics, still I like playing it because I like DOTA 2!"
17662,"Great game! Love the new patch, but shamans still need a huge buff. Also, would like to see new alliances and more interaction in order to promote more diversity"
17663,I actually really like this game I was sceptical about it at first but after playing it my mind has been changed the controls feel natural it runs on practically anything and most importantly its fun.
17664,10/10
17665,Good Game
17666,"Spent 50 gold to reroll for one unit.
Got nothing, lost. 10/10 Would recommend the disappointment to a friend."

17668,It's p good
17669,good game. I hope they make the items better.

17672,Artifact died for this...
17673,"Yeah it's pretty good, it's just a little too heavy on the RNG. Bad RNG can really screw you over."
17674,Seems like a good idea but it is too much luck based

17676,"Pretty lit ig, better than Auto Chess"
17677,"It is and upgrade of the first Auto Chess but it needs some tweaks. Still, pretty solid, good game."
17678,funny game recommend it
17679,Better than Hearthstone.
17680,Addicted game. I would love to play more like I played AutoChess. Definitely can bring more heroes on new patches.

17695,shit game no valve head guy :(((((
17696,"will be nice if the server can be more stable, anyway, it's a nice game, compare with the ori autochess, i be more prefer with this version."
17697,"Interesting Concept, enjoy the cross play with mobile. it allows me to play on my way to work"
17698,Dota Underlords is valves take on the auto chess genre. The graphics look very nice especially when you turn on the outlines for your pieces. There is some learning curves in the higher ranks but once you keep trying different things you'll learn and you will become the big boss we always wanted.
17699,zzZZzzZz....

17701,I can't believe they made Dota Underlords into a moba.

17720,kinda meh
17721,nice update
17722,"Dota Underlords is a game that is a great deal of fun all for the low low price of 0 dollars. For fans of complex strategy/rng games you'll definitely find something here to love, there's a myriad of team comps, item builds and buffs that make each game new and unique. For players who prefer games that they can casually play for a bit of fun, this game is great for you as well. You can easily focus on fun builds or characters you like over traditionally viable ones and it's always possible RNG could be on your side helping you get a win. 

"
17723,dkjhsadjkaskvdaskl;as;ldsa
17724,"This is a really fun game it plays really well it works really well only a couple things I would say could be fixed so it's slightly fairer like Dooms ability ""doom"" could be fixed to be a better targeting system so it targets someone who actually has a spell and things like that because I have seen him played quite a few times and he targets guys who don't have spells sometimes just stuff like that but other than that it is just a fantastic game and personally i really enjoy it"
17725,"Great little game that is challenging, yet also a joy to play with friends"
17726,super
17727,"Dota Underlords is a version of autochess. It's really fun nonetheless and the character designs from DoTa were good and in this game they are pretty good too. I find the ranking system weird and hard to understand since they really don't explain it. A major thing that bothers me is that the catchup mechanic is not as good as it should be. The loss streak bonus is only by one coin meaning it's absolutely nothing compared to the win streak bonus. If you are winning your going to keep winning, that is unless somebody else get's luckier than you. I like playing it because i feel like I have a good chance sometimes at winning if I pick the right guys, buy usually i seem to pick wrong. Don't get me wrong I do get far but after playing a few matches it's like a lot of the players just choose Axe and then luck is going to always be on their side. They'll get a tier 3 Axe by round 14 and i'm just left in the dust with maybe one Tier 2 or maybe two. If you feel lucky play this game if not then you probably won't like it, it's all luck based. I like it so no hate plz."
17728,Exact copy of Dota 2 Auto Chess. The GUI is nicer than the old one and the new items are cool.
17729,best autochess game out there
17730,thank you !!! wait for items in DU :)
17731,"Tons of fun, simple to learn, i recommend this greatly
"
17732,tis a damn fine game valve thx
17733,"GREAT GAME

it's really chill and fun but it is a little hard at first but once you learn the basics you can really get into it.
I normally play third person or first person games but i was willing to try something new and I'm glad I chose this game"
17734,zzz
17735,"I'll preface this by saying that Auto Chess is better overall, currently.

Underlords earns a recommendation solely due to the way it handles it's items. In that aspect alone, it surpasses Auto Chess. Otherwise, the flow of the game feels a bit clunkier than Auto Chess in it's current iteration. 

Observing another's board is a bit less intuitive, especially since about 33% of the time it icons denoting whom you are defending against and whom you are attacking disappear. Several small things are missing, like the big announcement when a piece goes on a rampage or easily implemented courier styles. Additionally, while they mention that you'll be able to pick your ""underlord"" in the future, you're currently given a random shadowy profile that you are unable to change. If you don't like it, deal. 

All that being said, it's a free to play game that sucks less resources than DotA's client, so you can run more stuff in the background if you so desire. It's based on a solid idea, so despite the above, it can still be an entertaining experience. Underlords is in Beta, so I'm hoping that they polish it up a bit and it will shine just as brightly."
17736,"Have same issues with characters random , but ok."
17737,"Just like the original Dota AutoChess, but it does not have any rewards to work for. Winning games gives only ranks, the game needs more cosmetics and skins"
17738,"Awesome, game is really cool, I hope valve will keep on updating and making new content for this game!"
17739,"It's an improvement on the old one, but rng still rules the game making it a bit less fun.
If you have bad rng you literally cannot do a thing to win and would just be wasting your time."
17740,good
17741,Rng heavy and time consuming. Good game to pass the time tho
17742,It's fun but lacking a lot of stuff on the UI like hero stats
17743,"Cool concept. Going to be another great game when finished.
To win requires planning and luck, but games don't last too long.

https://youtu.be/GGyJOtuOK78"
17744,love it
17745,Nice Game
17746,good
17747,"Absolutely amazing! Trying new comps each game is always an adventure, the meta feels like it's constantly changing and overall the game is decently balanced. Love it!"
17748,very similar to dota chess but with a different and in my opinion better itemsystem
17749,"Unbalanced mess right now. Mage comp wasn't addressed on the July 4th patch when nothing can compete with it, no counter play as scaled bonus doesn't help when they have 6 mages. Game rewards people who lose all the early rounds, why even have a losing streak in the game to begin with. Its supposed to be a competitive game!

Has potential but needs sorting out fast."
17750,"i cant even download it....
it says: an error occured while updating dota underlords (invalid platform) idk what to do if somebody can help me pls i want it so much and in phone i cant play with my friends because my version older than theirs...
"
17751,"fun game just like the autochess mod but unlike the mod items are easier swaped wich i like but sadly units don't change apearance when they rank (star) up.
"
17752,"you click a few times then watch pixels fighting each other than you noticed 8 hrs passed

17759,Best game for mobile i like it !
17760,GG
17761,RNG with strat
17762,its ok
17763,Great game with some needed balancing with some of the traits being near useless while others are a bit too strong. End game you tend to see a lot of the same team makeups with only minor variations due to the RNG of units you can select. Early game tends to be a bit slow due to the need for gold via interest after 50+. Anywhere between 30-45 min matches when playing online but if you're playing bots you can quit and pick up right where you left off which is nice. Integration with smartphones is good but the UI could use some work with the limited screen real estate.
17764,"fun and exciting, but RNG sometimes is frustrating. artifact v2"
17765,WAMBO JAMBO
17766,Good game bit of ui updating needed
17767,fun
17768,Nice.
17769,Nice.
17770,Actually a lot better than I thought it would be. I've never played a Dota game before and thought it would be hard to pick up but i got the game quickly. This game isn't for everyone but I can see it being a great game to pick up and play for a while.
17771,gg
17772,"+ Dota Underlords has potential.
- The main complaint is that the UI is abysmal for PC. There is plenty of space to display all the necessary information, but it is not utilized. UI is frustrating to use overall, everything is either too small or too large and sometimes there's something strange unresponsiveness moving the units. The game would also benefit from better positioned time indicator, and a clearer warning for the last seconds.
- While playing has been addictive so far, it can be seen how it may become too repetitive after a while.
- The latest patch causes random crashes almost every game now on my PC. Once you reconnect, you are greeted with how you have lost a level."
17773,"Made things way better, Duo is nice, even though not that balanced yet. Keep the good work up."
17774,pretty sick ay
17775,"Very fun game. My first Auto Chess experience and I love it :) Love the simplistic UI, the items, and has tons of competitive builds to play around with"

17779,"Excellent game, works well with mobile also."

17781,Best auto-chess out there which is getting better with every patch.
17782,"This game is the epitome of how detached Valve became with reality. Instead of making games on their own, they make money, and sometimes, a blunder a la Artifact. So why bother trying to think what today's players want when you can just copy someone else's successful idea??"

17795,Valve's greatest game in years and it wasn't even their idea
17796,Keren sih ini. Butuh pembaruan yang menarik aja.
17797,Pretty good
17798,Interesting game it s like chess
17799,"its free, its pretty good, give it a go or dont.
gets more interesting over time to start with and well its auto chess. maybe i should try druid, brawny and assasin .....*(starts mumbling about where to put units)*"
17800,"Fun and interesting. Learning curve may be a bit tough, but certainly approachable for those with no knowledge of Dota 2"
17801,"Дота шашки, класс играю всей семьей!"
17802,gooood :V
17803,"Very fun and engaging game. I will say that having previous knowledge of Dota and it's heroes gives you a slight edge in the learning curve of individual heroes, what they do, and synergies. Seems like there is still work to be done on balancing certain factions so that people have more options to have a winning team in the late game.
.

EDIT:

Ever since all the changes, I havent been able to keep up. Oh well, it was good while it lasted."
17804,"Dota Underlords is Valve letting what happened to warcraft happen to dota. Lovely to see mods making it to games again, support valve all the way in this. With regards to the game itself, its a kind of mixture of MOBA characters we know and love (hate. fuck you drow), where you manage an A.I team you slowly put together in competition with 8 other players through a series of rounds, managing gold, items, and character placement as well as RNG included with the 6 random character drops per turn to pick from, albiet with a mulligan option for gold. Very simple to learn, insanely hard to master as you have to pick on the fly and construct a team that will combat other teams, not just get the best team together. Well done to the modders for creating it and well don't to Valve for seeing the opportunity to capitalize on them."
17805,Such good many wow
17806,Fun
17807,Highly addictive
17808,Ayo why does my PC handle the witcher 3 but bluescreens from this....?
17809,"Game out a mini game, Just like the origins of dota."
17810,this is good
17811,I like it.
17812,Its gud.
17813,ZALUPAAAA
17814,"this is the best strategy game !!!
"
17815,I never knew you can have so much fun in such repetitive game.
17816,"pretty decent showing for a game that was rushed out to compete with the announcement of TFT, excited for the potential of this game. 
"
17817,"Smacc and attac ,this game looks legit,and takes up 99% time of your day"
17818,Perfect to pass time.
17819,muito bom
17820,"good strategy game, just a little bit of understanding of the game and voila. OWNING!!"
17821,"updated rewiev: 
>jumped on the autochess bandwagon
>no one cares
>mfw"
17822,not bad
17823,good game
17824,Laggy in mobile.
17825,Good game.
17826,Fun to play. I love the ability to play Mobile as well. Takes a few games to get into the groove but once you play its addicting.
17827,very nice
17828,"1. Game crashes 
2. Unbalanced af, if there is a guy at the first place, he might fight you several times in a row, each time hitting on around 15 hp.// FUCKING RANDOM IN CHOOSING ENEMIES MAY GIVE YOU THE SAME OPPONENT 5 TIMES IN A ROW
3. you will never get the pieces that you want throught your entire game because who knows how the rolling works. 
4. It takes entirety to rank up and one game to get demoted..."
17829,"Well it's so much better than the mod version, give it a try and you will love it, it's free anyway."
17830,Great game
17831,"Basically 2 strategies working, rest of them are trash 
You gotta get 100% luck on RNG or you'll just waste time"
17832,Good fun.
17833,Nice
17834,Underrated autochess
17835,Better than authochess

17837,"dota 2 ctrl c + ctrl v from warcraft
dota underlord  ctrl c + ctrl v from auto chess
RIP GABEN"
17838,"Really cool game, auto chess will be huge!"
17839,It's ok i guess. The playstyle is unique but a single round takes forever to finish. I thought it would be more fast
17840,Easy to learn and fun. The tutorial is not so great.
17841,Very cool game! Can't wait to waste my time here!
17842,Cool mindnumbing chess game
17843,pretty good

17850,Its quite good =)
17851,nice
17852,Amazing and addictive. Needs strategic mindset and skill to win
17853,"good game, but need some reward or custom model like dota 2"
17854,it gets stuck after some time
17855,"I like that we can choose which item we want from the creep round, and apparently there's a mobile version too"
17856,Best game ever seen
17857,sexy
17858,Enjoyable RNG.
17859,Got me into the Autobattler and must say that I am hooked. I like the item system more than the other games because hypercarries are less important and it is more about team composition. Constant updates and quality of life improvements coming from the team. Highly recommend
17860,autchess good fortnite bad
17861,Broken
17862,"If you are tired to wait ages for autochess in Dota 2 to load try this
Loads instantly and no lost turn from random load lags"

17879,Yo!
17880,OkaY
17881,better than tft
17882,It's a good game overall. The RNG sometimes just works against you.
17883,ree
17884,"A game where its development is really good i think so far and even if it have a quite lot of rng and luck required to play i think it still need a skill and thinking to win, like for the position of your chess and the buff talent you get, also with item it all need to be synchronized i guess and with the recent update its getting more fair with the win streak getting nerf.Game is good everyone need to try it even if u dont play dota and the future update would be making it even better from what i predict.

Ill give it a score of: 
Gameplay 8/10
Graphic 8/10
Menu style 6/10
UI 7/10

btw druid player are gey
"
17885,More Updates!
17886,can't wait for future features.
17887,best for time pass
17888,ok

17891,this is the best one
17892,.
17893,tangina bobo ampota
17894,The addition of the tutorial is a great tool to get new players into the game!
17895,nice game
17896,"Nah, a SIMPLE no no. play Dota 2 Auto chess, that's the original and is way better.
Thanks me later"
17897,"It ain't half-life 3, but it ain't artifact OMEGALUL"
17898,very good game
17899,I don't get it
17900,stupid rng based game that sucks bigtime. i dont know how people can like this genre.
17901,"Fun game to play. 

The bots are relatively good.
The only thing I dislike is that the game takes a long time to play.
I would like to see a turbo mode in the future."
17902,most addicting game on steam right now. This is so good
17903,Boring
17904,Penis balls
17905,A cleaned up interface from the Mod.  I enjoy it more than TFT
17906,really good game :)
17907,good
17908,It's the distilled cancer and autism of dota.
17909,Not bad good size
17910,Perfecto
17911,used to be a good game
17912,Great Game! Play it during Dota2 breaks..
17913,Autochess POGGIESS
17914,gei
17915,great gameplay
17916,"FYI remember this is early access.  The biggest issue I have with this game is the AI.  It does not seemed programmed to win a fight.  With the ideal of the game being so random.  I'm not sure if it ever will.  Deadeye passive does not work.  Knight's are still op per tier level of their passive.  Algorithm for randomness is way off.  You'll see players by round 4 to 6 have tier two champs, more than one, with extras on their passive bar.  While I'm glad Devs. have provided a means to give feedback.  I wish more that they actually played the game, regularly.  Seems players are playing the broken mechanics of the game more than the game.  In that regards it's not much of a game.  The whole gambling aspect does fill the addiction portion of playing...  There is some strategy in regards to who gets what gear and where you place your heroes on the board.  Always a WOW moment when you see someone use a new one.  But for the most part players just use the recommend builds and strats., that are online."
17917,Yo!
17918,Interesting game
17919,Nice!
17920,This kind of games is Refreshing yet Frustating!
17921,Great game if you are looking for something chill but with quite some depth.
17922,nice game
17923,very  cool
17924,10x valve
17925,great game!
17926,"What? You never played Dota 2 before? You know it's fun, right? Who am I kidding Dota 2 is toxic and cancer. If you want to bring cancer wherever you go, try the mobile version.

Edit: a word."
17927,"Better than autochess, frequent updates. Looks promising."
17928,Auto battlers are the new craze right now and Dota Underlords is Valve's take on the genre. There is a learning curve but it is very addicting because there are many different strategies and you have to adapt to your opponents' as well. Also I believe this is Steam's first game you can play on your phone and there is crossplay between PC and mobile.
17929,Very fun game addictive and much more to come.
17930,nice
17931,Great Game
17932,"It's pretty much a deck building card game without the cards and with on-the-fly deck building. The devs are working at an astounding pace right now and they actually listen to players which is very refreshing.

I am probably going to spend hundreds of hours in this game."
17933,just valve doing it right
17934,"Awesome game, wait until all fixed so i can play normaly
"
17935,"very good game
"
17936,I do like this game!
17937,Pretty Good!
17938,The most polished of all the auto battlers on the market right now and the most widely available. The Party Code system makes it supremely easy to join up with friends even those on mobile.
17939,Very fun balance of strategy and randomness.
17940,Mellow introduction to Auto Chess games
17941,The addition of the tutorial is a great tool to get new players into the game!
17942,gud
17943,Good Game! but still needs developing
17944,this game so cool...its make you fell like your playing chess on dota 2
17945,Autochess made more sleek.
17946,"It's very polished but lacks depth. Needs some sort of progression and ranked play. Other than that, it's a good autobattler."
17947,"this feels like DayZ all over again, mod did it better"
17948,fain
17949,good game with quality time using mobile phone :)
17950,Good game with great UI/UX
17951,"You can forget sorrows, pain and problems, let this game can make you forget about your depression."
17952,gg.
17953,DOG SHIT GAME
17954,Pretty guuud
17955,1
17956,good
17957,"nice game
"
17958,good game for killing time
17959,In my opinion Dota Underlords is just too much trying to bring a mobile UI to the PC which makes it hard to use and furthermore the UI is nowhere intuitive enough to get used to it.
17960,Interesting version of auto chess with smooth graphics and gameplay. I highly recommended! Yeah!
17961,good game
17962,"Very fun game, especially when you need a change of pace!"
17963,I lik
17964,Nice game!
17965,very fun overall but games take a large chunk of your day away since they can take upwards of 2 hours even
17966,Like the DotA AutoChess mod but better!
17967,sad
17968,Good Game but pls.. give more heroes to played
17969,Game from a mod from a game from a mod from a game.
17970,AND I OOP- PRETTY GOOD RECREATION OF AUTO CHESS
17971,nice game :)
17972,"Well designed, good ui. A great entry point if you want to try Auto-chess."
17973,Very-very interesting and funny game :))
17974,nice game to kill time
17975,Awesome =)
17976,Cool
17977,good
17978,A really fun game that allows some great time wasting tactics while browsing other things.
17979,"Friendship ended with Artifact 
Now Underlords is my best friends.
.
I enjoyed playing it through, buff dragon pls."
17980,:(
17981,This Game Is So FUN!

17994,good copy of teamfight tactics Kappa123
17995,"well played

17996,so funnn
17997,Yes
17998,da best game of the year
17999,way better than TFT
18000,alternative for dota auto chess but not more
18001,Best auto chess out here
18002,Ss pretty good
18003,Good game! :D / This is a good game! :D
18004,Good in dev game
18005,"Solid auto-chess game, very nice on mobile but not much depth for a PC game. Better than hearthstone at least, so it's now my new casual game"
18006,Good game just doing a review for grand prix
18007,kul
18008,Big brain game for big brain hearthstone players
18009,"If you played the mod you'll be comfortable with this, everything is similar enough to jump straight in, only some minor changes so far which i see as good changes to the mechanics. Controls are much much easier too.
If you've never played the mod then not to worry. There's a tutorial and bot games which you can increase in difficulty before you jump straight into the games against players.
It's RNG based so sometimes things just don't go your way and other times you should do the lotto with the luck you get."
18010,"I like it a lot more than Dota Auto Chess.
Underlords convinces with fast updates, smooth framerates, good networking, a ranking system and thoughtful innovations while staying true to the core gameplay that brought DAC success."
18011,Great game to untilt your self after bad CS GO or Dota match
18012,nice game
18013,rng
18014,need fix
18015,"This game is amazing, as long as you don't fight that fookin' 6's Knight strats.
Fuck that strats"
18016,the big nice
18017,Great Game! FUN FUN!
18018,Pretty good!
18019,"Just wow, auto chess is great, play original! 
Several nights spent there , recommend"
18020,"I can't believe i played this game for 100 hours. regardless, it was good, but the constant updates and revamps to gameplay makes for a confusing experience. also, while there is an element of strategy to it, a large part of what influences your win or loss lies in whether you are lucky, which more often than not makes for a frustrating experience."
18021,"Like Dota 2 auto-chess, but without 20 gbs of extra junk."
18022,Fun casual game.
18023,"hey that's pretty good
"
18024,Game is pretty fun
18025,cool
18026,At least not pay to play like Artifact :D
18027,TFT rip off smh
18028,"a lot of fun for free, y not?"
18029,"Great game, although the controls are kinda clunky. Its overwhelming for a new player and hard to learn."
18030,A better TfT
18031,Better than the League one
18032,123
18033,Decent game
18034,"I like the changes to the loot system, plus the mobile cross platform support is quite nice"
18035,A game that punishes people who are learning the game by giving the winners buffs. Mediocre graphics and boring characters. What did I expect from the creators of dota.
18036,<3
18037,"It's auto chess with OP mechanics, go try it out my dudes."
18038,"I never played an autochess game before this and I'm not a big fan of MOBAs, but this game is pretty fun and addictive"
18039,"Great game with decently complex mechanics. Little bit of RNG is involved but if you know the game well, you can play around it. Be prepared to sink hours into this game."
18040,WICKED SICK FAMM SKRRR
18041,"THIS GAME ACTUALLY BROKEN, NEVER GET A BETTER ODD"
18042,GG
18043,Nice
18044,"Solid Item system, The relatable heroes from Dota, still needs more tweaks towards making a better game balance."
18045,googd game
18046,some how its unclear to what are the objective to defeat your enemy. its a totally unpredictable game
18047,It's OK
18048,Nice game!
18049,I wanted to try out a game of this style while i was waiting for tft to be available in the live servers of League of legends.I had already tried out Tft and then I played this game which was pretty ok overall but it was kinda boring in front of other Autochess games and its graphics look worse than phone games. I would not recommend unless you enjoy the characters and the item system.
18050,Thumbs up.
18051,This game killed Artifact pepehands
18052,idk to play real chess so this is the only chess that i know how to play
18053,Decent Auto Chess replacement for the time being.
18054,Nice
18055,yes
18056,"Wasn't too sure on this whole autochess fad at first but finally gave it a shot and man is it addictive as all hell, pretty easy to understand and can get pretty complex as the match goes on. on the plus side it runs pretty well on my toaster so thats neat."
18057,very strategic lmao
18058,"Honestly, the production value is so much better than I was expecting. I was on the fence between playing this or the official AutoChess sequel, but after just one round, I'm convinced."
18059,"Nice game to play! I hope they'll add all the heroes of DOTA 2. 

PS: This game is so good!"
18060,"As much as people will tell you ""hurr durr git gud"" this game is actually just a slot machine simulator. If you don't get favourable rolls by mid game, you may as well just exit the game and start again which isn't fun for anyone. 

Spend your time elsewhere."
18061,Aliens!
18062,I like it?
18063,I dont really understand this game
18064,nice
18065,"Worth the grind, love playing this all night."
18066,Highly addictive if you are a Dota fan this is the game to jam when you are bored
18067,chill
18068,"goood
"
18069,I hate RNG
18070,better than autoChess
18071,v
18072,"Neat to play a valve game on a phone. its smooth. needs more tutorials. but i have fun getting wrecked xD

EDIT: IT'S LIT"
18073,Nice alternative to the original Dota Autochess
18074,good
18075,This game sucks
18076,games ok
18077,worse than tft lol
18078,It's actually fun even though I hate Dota 2 lol
18079,A great version of Auto Chess. They have changed some stuff but I like the constant updates and balancing.
18080,best autochess game ever!!!!!!!
18081,Nice attempt but no character skin
18082,Absolutely Perfect!
18083,RNG CHESS
18084,Not bad
18085,nice
18086,great game
18087,items selection are better than other auto chess
18088,it is not that toxic as dota and can be played in mobile too
18089,Love this game. Not as serious as some like it but it is fun.
18090,Solid game. Offers infinite gametime with many strategy options. Loyal to the Original game. Love it. Praise RNGesus
18091,nice game
18092,nais i loike
18093,"this game its more balance from all autoches i have tried , only a good rank missing from dota underlords !"
18094,"Fun but hard to master. Items, classes and so on. Love it on the phone!"
18095,you like a wast of time go for it
18096,"I played a lot of DOTA Auto Chess, so this is a pretty great way to play, especially with mobile support."
18097,Tons of fun
18098,Currently not recommended on some mobile phones due to low FPS but a fun game on PC.
18099,Nice
18100,great game. complicated diverse strategies. always interesting
18101,nice
18102,you would like it if you like dota.
18103,Love this game!
18104,"very adicting i love this game...
xD"
18105,*cough* Thank God Valve is creating games again
18106,simple light and fun
18107,"It's a good game,updating and improving,with a very good resemblance to autochess :)"
18108,Good game to pass time... specially while at work *wink* *wink*
18109,"Part chance and part strategy. 

Took me a few games to get a feel for it.

Love the whole strategy set up before each round then sit back and watch the pay off."
18110,what a game lololol
18111,Friendlier UI
18112,adddd
18113,yeah i can dig it
18114,"Great game, but hard to recommend at the moment. With updates trying to balance things out. It's free though so give it a shot."
18115,kinda fun and makes u think of strategy and combinations for effective output
18116,NICE GAME BUT YEAH
18117,Good game.
18118,hello gay
18119,like it this game in mobile
18120,It is very well made. It utilizes strategic thinking and combines with luck and adds some finance elements. WAlso I like the gameplay. Plus if you don't like collecting cards or pieces this is the game for you .
18121,"eh, its alright"
18122,Try #2
18123,It's alright if you have nothing else to play.
18124,SeemsGood
18125,nice
18126,I hate this game riot did better!
18127,not actual chess
18128,Budget Teamfight Tactics
18129,i only get trash items pepehands
18130,Fun concept but severly lacking in execution. Games take way too long and not balanced enough.
18131,Good game but not balanced at all.
18132,Way better than TFT in almost every way.
18133,"nice game. more improvment. but more different,,, more GGWP."
18134,Addictive than Dota .
18135,Very nice game :D
18136,uwu
18137,Fresh and creative way to play DOTA. Wonder if IceFrog came up  with this?
18138,"Pretty boring game that doesn't seem too have much strategy. The meta is instantly stale.

If you start losing you will keep losing.

Getting your heroes up to level 3 requires a fair amount of luck and if your opponents get it before you, you will probably lose because level 3 is a big deal. This is the worst part of the game design.

The interface gives you poor feedback with regards to what bonuses you are getting and which of those bonuses stack with what effects. When you win or get stomped you often have no idea why. Positioning of units seems to be pointless.

If this game didn't have doto characters no one would even download it."
18139,Absolutely amazing game. Definitely addicting and fun.
18140,is not as good as the mini game inside dota
18141,"My only critic is about round matching system. There is match which I have lowest hp, and I have to fight with those top 2 for 4 rounds, continuously (no one lost yet so there is 7 others, why did I have to fight the same guys? twice for each one). Well, and it's not rare so I assume it's not about bad luck."
18142,Currently best Autochess game out there. Love the mobile and PC cross play.
18143,Great graphics. The tutorial was very informative and easy to follow.
18144,"got artifacted, don't touch with a 10 foot pole

it sucks because underlords had legitimate potential. it was far more streamlined and intuitive than other autochess games, didn't need a wallpaper-sized chart to play like TFT, had decent innovations on the formula that served to shake up the game to make matches feel more fresh... then valve went ""oo shiny!"" and dropped the game on its head in the middle of the street and left it to die"
18145,Addiction is real with this game
18146,"still better than LoL

18147,"this is so good
but no sound in hero when we pick"

18151,mobile game and I lack content
18152,good game well played
18153,"Fun stuff, if a bit confusing."
18154,i am groot
18155,"For a Beta, Underlords plays and feels extremely well. Valve is actually communicating with the players and they're implementing player feedback at a fantastic rate.

Picked it up just to see what the autochess genre was like and ended up loving it. Would highly recommend. Great blend of strategy and randomness that lets every game feel different, yet never broken.
(Most of the time. But that's what a beta is for)

Valve let me buy hats please"
18156,is an ok game
18157,not a huge fan compared to other autobattlers but this would suffice if you like dota
18158,"everything in this game is janky

auto chess as a genre is a waste of time"
18159,very nice....

However, there's something lacking when it comes to satisfaction from winning."

18178,Loved it. Less RNG than TFT on League of Legends.

18185,"A very fun game, a little bit hard for the casuals because there's not much explanation going on in the tutorials, but when you get the grasp of it, it turns into the best experience that you can get with a free game. 

But still too reliant on RnG tho."

18198,lul
18199,"great fun, id like to see how far you will be able to take the characters. it would be handy if the characters could be labelled so its easier to compare what you have with what you need to collect."
18200,Pretty cool.
18201,Still not better than the DotA mod but it's getting there. Probably should wait for the proper release before trying this as it still has a mobile game sheen all over it.
18202,keren guys
18203,"Fantastic gameplay and a whole lot of fun. There is a lot of skill involved and managing your money is a crucial part to winning.
A very addictive experience and exciting to load up every time. 

I'd like to see more heroes added ASAP for some diversity."

18214,"I have played this enough to realize it is not a game I can get behind. 

I stayed away from autochess as long as I could because I like to control my units and too much chance plays a role in this game imo.

Therefore it's a no recommend from me."

18221,Fajen
18222,"liking the game but i feel as though maybe some balancing has to be done to fix the game also dont let the top player receive so much coins for being on a win streak. probably limit it.

also i like how league has this game on the same client with their other moba league of legends so i think it would be way better if they did that. 

i know the game is in its early stages but with time i think it can be a fun game and i hear its on mobile? so yea def gotta check that out ."
18223,"This game will be excellent once it's out of beta, but holy crap does it crash."
18224,"Part of the overwhelming current trend of ""games you don't really have to play"" - as far as they go, it's pretty good, but not as good as League of Legends.  Just like regular DOTA basically."
18225,good game play!
18226,10/10
18227,its fun
18228,Less of a life suck than DOTA. More accessible. Still feels like you'd have to fall through the rabbit hole for a long time to be good at it.
18229,"this is garbage, you will know if your going to win half way through the game, their are pools of units for some reason and only so many of one unit can be come purchased... its a very annoying and game breaking system..... and that's it games broken its just snowballing and leaving have way through the game because come backs are super rare."
18230,actual good game
18231,"good game but needs to be updated, units are stale, needs to be different from original somehow and unique."
18232,Probably the best in its genre at this stage.
18233,good
18234,This game is really enjoyable! Give it a try! Gets recent updates aswell!
18235,"Beta so we'll see how it goes, but so far it's got me hooked."
18236,recommended :D
18237,Great game!
18238,Another decent game from Valve :D
18239,"Started to play this game on holiday via mobile. Picked it up on desktop since then. It's a good wee game that keeps you thinking, but once you get a good lead, it's hard to be beat. So far my favourite game was a comeback from 5 points against the last player with 100."
18240,good much fun
18241,GOOOOD GAME
18242,"Dota auto chess ++, its decent if you like that type of game"
18243,Very good auto chess experience
18244,"Best game for phone.

Playing for 1 hour feels like 10 minutes.

Hope that Valve won't do the same mistake as Artifact and will make a great game. I think it needs more skill based gameplay than random.
Overall its a very good game for Alpha"
18245,"I honestly thought that no game could sink deeper than Dota 2, but oh my....

This is the definition of an abomination, truly shameful and utterly disgusting game.

"
18246,This game great
18247,Its verry good
18248,"As someone who never got into DOTA and mostly just plays shooters, this is a suprisingly fun game! Available on both PC and mobile devices, which is great for playing at work.

Its free so just give it a try and who knows, maybe you will end up liking it just like me!"
18249,Artifact died for this
18250,Very fun. Challenging but not difficult to learn. Bet Auto Chess out there. Just needs more content and a reward system like Drodo Autochess.
18251,The fact that this is mobile makes this game the best of the genera.
18252,This game is a lot of fun I'm excited to see where they take it
18253,monkas
18254,The best Auto Chess on the market.
18255,"The UI reeks of mobile game and feels cluttered to play. At this point in time there is little reason to play this over the Dota 2 mod and Teamfight Tactics. They have however, greatly improved upon the item RNG."
18256,"Fun game, constant updates."
18257,great game
18258,Veri veri good
18259,ok

18263,"It doesn't work and no solutions on the web. seems It's like that for mac users like ten days ago. Fix this.

update:
Never worked on my old mac, on a new one works just fine. BUT, It's shitty that no one from Valve tried to fix this, and is still a problem for old macs, don't even know why"

18271,good game
18272,"Easy to pickup, hard to master. Super addicting. Would recommend 10/10"
18273,"This game is deceptive. It has plenty of nuances that make it seem as though it has some skill involved and technically that is true. It is however without a doubt just a game of chance that really scratches your gambling itch. Very addicting, but don't be surprised when you don't get the heroes you need."
18274,gud game so good
18275,this hoe smacks
18276,end me
18277,Very fun game. Definitely difficult at the start but the more game knowledge you gain the better you are. In my opinion it is much more polished than the other auto chess games currently on the market.
18278,"As far as gameplay goes underlords is not making me want to play more. Maybe its just me but when i look at the board and how it plays im being reminded of old warcraft mods. The thing is i remember several that made me want to play more and this is just not doing it for me.

I myself cant recommend it but since this is a free game you should try it yourself and see if this kind of game is for you."
18279,like chess but faster rounds

18292,"A great game, with a bright future"
18293,"I'll change this when I can create custom game rules and mod it. Having a gold cap would make things interesting, for example. It would prevent me from scratching my nuts for 10-20 minutes and perving other boards to create my shopping list. That's just *one thing*. Imagine the possibilities. 

Lets mod the game that's like a mod for a game which is a game that's like a mod of a game that was a mod of a game.

Yeah. This could happen."
18294,UPD:Нормальная игра всем советую
18295,"With RNG reduced to resonable amounts and additional improvements like ability to change equipped items inbetween heroes, this seems to be thus far best version of dota autochess."

18297,yes
18298,Amazing !

Its not strategy - unless yours is to kill time with something stupid.

Calling it chess-something should be punished with beheading."
18305,10/10 great game
18306,Could be worse ;)
18307,"Great free strategy game, expands upon the AutoChess custom map within Dota2 and hopefully as a stand alone game will bring alot more features."
18308,a good take on the auto chess play this where you are
18309,"I think the thing that really got me into PC gaming was when I accidentally bought Warcraft III : Reign of Chaos when I meant to buy World of Warcraft. After a few normal matches on 2006 battle.net I decided to try out some custom rooms, and the stuff I found there changed my life. I don't think I have ever experienced the joy of gaming the same way I do when I play Warcraft custom maps. 

But anyway I only left this review to get the Grand Prix Summer badge.

For real though, play this game."

That last bit's a bit of a pain in multiplayer, as it's very hard to get everyone in a game to stay in a game for the whole thing. But it also doesn't affect your game quality all too much!

18359,"[h1][u]Summary:[/u][/h1] 
I like what I have seen so far, and I am looking forward to seeing where the developers take this game.  Lots of great potential for an already very addictive game.

[h1][u]Some General Thoughts:[/u][/h1]
This one is interesting, because the underlying strategy is largely embedded, and dependent upon, random unit selection options.  Almost like poker, but without the predefined number of cards in each suit.  So, if you love to rage at ""RNG,"" this is an excellent game for you.  If you enjoy losing 5-10 matches, and almost being knocked out, then coming back to take third place, this game is definitely for you

While this game is being beta tested at the time I write this, I have not encountered any game ""breaking"" bugs in my 39 hours of game play.  Minor bugs, some of them irritating in the moment, like, beating someone in a match and seeing that their ""winning streak"" is not broken by the loss, or units suddenly switching targets just as they were about to kill their prior target.

Overall the game is very cool, and steeped in existing Dota lore.

[h1][u]Suggestions To The Developers:[/u][/h1]
More ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" and less isolated decision making, by limiting the pool of purchasing options through a shared selection process each round.  Almost like a player ""draft"" after each match.  Units would still cost coins, order of draft would be established by your current Win/Loss ratio and your current available coins, and it is conceivable that players with a high number of coins could make 2 or more selections each round as their turn would potentially come around more than once, and if they have enough coins available for the purchase.

You could also add an algorithm to determine the ""commodity value"" of different units based on previous purchasing choices players made, and that ""value"" could either drive up the price on heavily purchased units, or reduce their chances of being randomly part of a draft, simulating a total pool of each unit type.  Something to influence the variability of unit options during each draft.

This might also work using a similar ""social"" bidding system, wherein players enter an amount of coins they are willing to spend on a unit, and they acquire the unit if they have the higher bid.  If there are two or more of the same units available to bid on, you have to guess which one is not going to be bid on, and then also gauge how many coins you're willing to risk on that bid.  1/4 of bid coins would be lost, as an ""auction fee,"" if you did not win the bid.  While this does force players to use something other than just the left mouse to play the game, I don't like this idea as much as the ""draft"" option, but maybe this idea will spawn some other ideas in one of the developer's imaginations.

""Boss"" matches could still be as they are, isolated options from randomly generated choices.

Right now the game has no ""social"" interaction, other than watching my units jump and run around trying to kill the enemy's units, without any targeting or tactical input from me.  Adding the ""drafting"" system would help the player's sense of global impact on the game's outcome, by creating ""social"" competition for desired units.  Sort of like bidding on an item at an auction.  I don't know the other bidders personally, but for those few minutes of rivalry we are connected in a love/hate dance while we compete for an item.  It makes the impersonal, personal."

18366,"This game is the way valve trying to counter Auto Chess (A Dota 2 Mod/Arcade Game) before it becomes too big.
The game itself is very similar to Auto Chess but there are some twists to it compared to Auto Chess.

It is not bad of a ripoff of Auto Chess."

Edit another month later: fuck this game still cant alt-f4"

18411,"This is what Dota Auto Chess should of been. Items are always guaranteed during minion rounds instead of having a chance of getting a lot of items to no items at all. Synergies are a lot easier to hit so you can have a variety of combinations. Only down side is balancing issues, some comps are too strong and can get you to top 4 without much effort while trying to be creative with other comps would just make you lose faster to those comps. Another downside to this game is a smaller bench space compared to the original DAC arcade game. Another downside to this game compared to the original is courier customization, I know this game is suppose to be cross platform with mobile devices but having a courier with various skins is what made me want to play more auto chess to farm out those candies. Other than those slight issues, this game is still fun to play and the game will get better in the future."

18414,Solid game to kill some time if you like DotA
18415,"Polished interface and seamless transition between desktop and mobile. Early patches have been good, game should only get better over time."
18416,good
18417,GREAT

18423,its auto chess
18424,Gitgut
18425,"Well, it's great to keep with the original characters of Dota. The game itself has some changes. I think everyone should adapt to their best autochess style game. I liked this one best."
18426,"Ace game, quick to pick up and learn.

Being an avid League of Legends player I actually prefer this game to Riot's version."
18427,"Very Fun. Good Balance between strategy and luck. The art is amazing! I found a bug when practicing against bots: I pushed pause, the time stopped, but it still showed the pause symbol; I couldn't unpause the game. After messing with random settings and menu buttons the time started again."
18428,"Fun little gem of a strategy game. Focuses heavily on discovering synergies and balancing current power for future power.
Games can be a little time consuming if you are doing well.
Easier learning curve than DOTA 2 :)
Review written during BETA, so a lot of bells and whistles are missing."
18429,Everyone should try it
18430,"Initially its fun and a good learning experience. But after figuring out what to do, it ends up being a cookiecutter or flavour of the month meta type of game that punishes creative/offbeat builds, ultimately it ends up getting stale. Do I recommend it? Sure for a little while, just dont expect to keep enjoying it after a few weeks."
18431,Not bad.
18432,Um ótimo passatempo
18433,"If you like chess and/or dota, you might also like this game, or not."
18434,Needs some polish but has potential. The games are damn long if you stick through them.
18435,"Great game, Still need more updates but it looks promising"
18436,A very complicated game with little explanation. Fun nonetheless.
18437,Nice...
18438,Meiner Meinung nach das beste Auto Chess derzeit
18439,GG
18440,Good game
18441,"If you are able to look over the less appealing graphics, this one of the best auto brawlers currently available.
The controls are smooth and the interface offers all information one could ask for along with a less rng based item distribution system."
18442,"Love it, but it's still in beta so we all got to wait for new heroes, item, and character rework. Can't wait."
18443,Game is good
18444,Good implementation of auto chess. The item system feels less random now with 1 guaranteed item pick per neutral wave.
18445,Interesting concept of game. Less RNG would be preferred.
18446,Some crash bugs that need to fix and I really like this game support offline mode and chillin option
18447,My RNG PepeHands
18448,"The game is fun, it plays and controls well, and it has the best UI of any of the auto-chess games. 

But, at the end of the day it's almost entirely RNG based. You will go through numerous games where none of your units appear in the shop and you can't upgrade anything. You will hit round 30 with half your army still at one star, while your opponents have multiple three star units. The balance still needs work , but that's expected in an early access game. 

Overall it's fun and worth playing, but it can be extremely frustrating at times."
18449,"Still in the open beta phase, Underlords is facing stiff competition from many similar (almost identical) titles, hence it cannot afford to stay in its testing phase for too long or people are just going to switch out. I had fun playing it for like the few weeks it has been out, but it has become stale due to the repetitive nature of the game. Nonetheless, thumbs up since it's free and I hope it stays free or it is going to have a really hard time justifying its playability over every other title"
18450,"Good game overall. Please add more heroes from time to time, and items too."
18451,"pretty heavy on the RNG vs strategy, but solid gameplay and well polished"
18452,Very Fun but also very hard to level up!
18453,Good time waster
18454,Has promise
18455,Auto chess was better
18456,"Mage build is definitely the strongest build right now, this game is still in beta season so we can expect more from it!"
18457,"All the fun of card game drafting with none of the annoying ""matches"" or ""skill"" needed, the better stuff just wins!"
18458,Great game with needed improvements to the original.
18459,"Would i recommend that to _friends_ ? No.

I find this thing quite stupid ; you have 15 seconds or so to prepare your pieces for the match, which gives you no time at all to have an in-depth look at the opposing team, then your pieces and the ennemy's are fighting (you only watch that happening, barely understanding what's actually happening), then ... you just repeat, over and over ...

Which i find quite pointless in the end."
18460,"Enjoyable on both PC and phone, thanks volvo"
18461,"Pros - Decent game, no issues with matchmaking like in autochess
Cons- 100% mobile game."
18462,fun simple
18463,"tutorial needs improving by alot, you have to remember what every single character does if you want to be good, the games last way to long, and its heavily rng based."
18464,very good
18465,10/10
18466,Good
18467,"Love this, cant wait to see more heroes being added"
18468,good
18469,very nice game
18470,top
18471,Great game
18472,A great strategy game that doesn't rely on reflexes and not too heavy on luck compared to other games in the genre
18473,dota for life
18474,"nice game
"
18475,wo
18476,Dota underlords is a pretty fun game if you get the luck for you to have good rng in ur stores other than that in general i enjoy the game!
18477,cool
18478,"Fun game. Very RNG dependant, but that's just the nature of the game."
18479,"niceee!
"
18480,great game for auto chess style games
18481,this game is so f**king addictive
18482,Great game
18483,"So after like 40 games my experience is a bit disappointing. Now when I think about it it's more frustrating than disappointing. The main motto of this game is ""Strategy, not reflexes, wins you the game"" but that is only partially true. RNG is the real king here. RNG is everywhere in the every move of heroes on the desk, in every target they choose, in every spell your heroes make, in EVERYTHING. IN BLOODY EVERYTHING. 

How can I be beaten by ARMY A, when my army beats ARMY B and ARMY B beats ARMY A?
How can I be beaten with an army where 5 of my 8 heroes are level three by an army of eight where there are no level three heroes?
How can I be beaten with an army of four primordial with 30% of disarm when any of allies gets hit for 4.5s? I tell you how, because the RNG is made 30% of 10000, meaning in one round enemy army cannot make a single hit and in next round I get only one disarm.

I've tried so many strategies but they are all dependent on RNG and that just sucks. It happened so many time that my heroes were being attacked by an enemy hero with like 10HP but they all focused on a hero with full hp. Or that a ranged enemy hero in far back selects first my most squishy and most defended hero so all the positioning goes to shit.

I still find the game enjoyable but only because it reminds me dota2 and i'm too old for dota2 but I cannot recommend it for now. I'm worried it's heading to some ""buy more luck with real money"" schema."
18484,time for battle pass for dota underlord :v
18485,nice game. good to kill time. ...
18486,damn i am addicted to this
18487,good
18488,I like it bit more than autochest
18489,great game
18490,Nice
18491,good
18492,better then tft
18493,"I've spent some time, and while the game is really fun and interesting, there are a few things I'm not a fan of. eventually we'll get to a place where 1 or 2 specific loadouts are the only good ones. As it stands currently, the game has lots of different combos that are WAY better than others. I hope those some combos are buffed and made easier to use. 

It's better than Leagues Auto chess"
18494,good game
18495,So unbalanced. It's insane how easy it is to win by playing with warrior deck.
18496,its free yet to expensive
18497,most gay game on earth
18498,I love trying new builds. Enjoying the game.
18499,Much Fun
18500,good
18501,Chill game
18502,no idea what i am playing.. this doesnt look like chess at all >-<
18503,pyke = op
18504,"World's first time travelling device. Instant transport 45 minutes into the future with each game!

It's not particularly complex, or hard, and a lot of it hinges on luck, but it's a very fun game."
18505,nice to try
18506,Highly recommended for people who like TCG and chess.
18507,IM CONFUSED
18508,love this game
18509,An overall improvement on Dota Autochess
18510,2nd best auto chess
18511,better than the league one tbh
18512,haha
18513,Auto-chess 7.00
18514,"Good move from Valve to adapt the AutoChess mod into an intuitive standalone.
Let's hope the content will keep coming !"
18515,Very freaking addictive
18516,"Good game, but needs more characters and stackable items. Hopefully by the full release their will be proper ranked matches where you can gain and lose titles they you've worked for."
18517,Good game.. New updates are good
18518,The best auto chess out there. Plus DOTAA
18519,nice game nice grafic
18520,Simple and fast. That makes it a better game among other auto chess games.
18521,Better than DAC
18522,"Creep round choices distinguish it from the other auto chess variants, meta is also somewhat different. Nice that it supports cross-platform play. Waiting for the couriers :D"
18523,Nice
18524,"It's honestly just like every other boring ""auto chess"".  If you are looking for something new, fun, or exciting in the auto chess genre then you will be disappointed."
18525,"If you've played DotA Auto Chess before, you will love the gameplay, but the interface is much more frustrating. I also dislike that it is not an open map, and there is no courier for me to move back and forth in an OCD way while I wait for the round to end.

8/10 would recommend."
18526,"Having an absolute blast with this game so far! Finally found a game I'm not complete trash at, plus it's free!"
18527,its good
18528,Good one +!!
18529,good
18530,"fun game, needs updates"
18531,Great auto chess variant. Still requires decent knowledge of DOTA heroes to get the most of it without feeling like you have no idea what you are doing. Item system is nice as it garuntees an item out of 3 options unless you lose the PvE round then it picks for you.
18532,RNG always hates me
18533,Well......
18534,"The gameplay is almost identical to the mod. The heroes ported over have identical abilities, with one or two notable exceptions. Several heroes and combinations have been added, which adds further depth to the strategic element of the game."
18535,"very badxd
"
18536,not bad
18537,"It feels blank and boring. Despite all these ""alliances"" and so forth, few are reliable and when you try to switch it up, RNG c*cks you for no reason.

"
18538,I hope that on mobile version is more flawless and UI more simple
18539,Fortnite Bad
18540,nice game
18541,Strangely addicting
18542,10/10
18543,Need improvement
18544,Dota Underlords is fun but overall long game. It is worth checking out.

18562,"Good game. 
Really easy to understand and play from the get go which gives it a huge edge over TFT in my opinion.

Plus it's free."
18563,Cool timepass
18564,"better interface, iyaudah gitu aja"
18565,nc auto chess
18566,Actually pretty good. I prefer this to TFT I've decided.
18567,An amazing game.
18568,yes yes.
18569,My thesis going nowhere because of this game.
18570,Lots of potential. Just need some shorter turbo game modes.
18571,"ahhh auto catur.. ehh 
Dota Underlords is best auto catur i playing"
18572,"Artifact was crucified for this.
[spoiler]It's dac on steroids simple as that.[/spoiler]"
18573,"Well,it can be hard although fun to play"
18574,"Allright, First off the good things. Run Extremly well and the UI is pretty and clear.

But I feel the game is too much relied on luck. I´ve seen videos and reviews that say otherwise, but after my humble playtime I come to the conclusion, that you´re depended on the Rolls you get when choosing your Hero rooster.

Game that made me deinstall was simple. Game started, I checked the other Players and choose Bloodseeker as First hero. None of my Competitors had him, neither on the hand nor in the Field. Right.

3 Rounds later, some guy instantly gets him to level 2(3 times a level 1 hero, grants you the hero leveled up). Allright, no biggie. Time to rotate. Adapt and Overcome. So I do the same thing just like the First round. Check out my Opponents hands and roosters. And Adjust. I lost pretty early on, since it seemed that I was just out of Luck. Others get their heros they want like 2-3 times in a single draft and I can spent 20 gold each round and struggle to upgrade my starters.

I feel this game is way too much relied on ""having a good consistent draft"" rather then Tactics. 
Since some heroes are Clearly stronger then Others, there are some gaps in Balance. Not every Hero carries his weight and some outperform. Especially every hero that is Tanky and/or can summon additional troops on the Field e.g. Lycan, Natures Prophet, Venomancer,Techies and so on.

I Tried to like this, but in the End it turns often out just Frustranting and you´ve just spent 30 Minutes into a Game where you just lost because you where Unlucky.Others get radiant in the Loot rounds, you get your 3rd Blink Dagger(Happened really) Aint no fun.

Also this game has some mechanics that the game never tells you about. Shared Hero/card pool. Interresst in Gold, and some more."
18575,Dota 2 Auto Chess Simple !
18576,this game is fun

18612,cool
18613,"I think underlords is a great game by valve, really like the item mechanics here. Have spent hours on it figuring out the meta and there is a lot of depth to the game"
18614,"Plays a lot smoother than DAC, and offers some new and interesting mechanics for synergies. Overall still a great game and a lot of fun!"
18615,"Better than other Auto Chess games. Solid interface, almost no bugs and less RNG."
18616,I USE KOTL
18617,Better than autochess that's for damn sure
18618,"game is addictive and fun to play, but considering how it should also be played on mobile. it would be nice if they made the game lighter and lower req for the mobile version.

Regardless, been playing this game mostly on PC and have been having a great time. Hope to see more content in the future and also if possible fix the slow/buggy menu/interface, thx"

18631,the game is good if play with a friend

18640,nice game
18641,"Never though I could get addicted to such a simple game.
Very chill / fun game to play when you have some time to kill, with multiple ways to play."
18642,pretty cool autochess game ! Enjoyed it on mobile
18643,Excellent game but still needs to be developed.
18644,great game!!
18645,Where is Riki
18646,Waste time
18647,"I like how you can start on mobile, then switch over to PC. 
Nice regular and big updates keep things fresh."
18648,it good game yes
18649,"new style of chess, i love it"
18650,"Really great DoTA Autochess recreation. This game is highly recommended for those who enjoy playing strategy game and have a pretty good luck, since this game isn't like your normal strategy game. If you don't know how Autochess is basically different from other strategy game, they basically don't really rely to pre-made strategy, but they need you to make the strategy while you're playing the game, which is hard and the RNG is kind of, yea... For now in my opinion, there's not really that much Cons I guess so, good job Valve.

Overall rating : 9"
18651,"Неплохая игра. Лучше аналогов.
"
18652,very nice game
18653,well let say you will love it if you love dota auto chess  ! it less RNG about item ! upcoming cosmetics too ! just remember to save interest

18657,good
18658,"Pretty solid spin-off of DAC. 
Constantly being updated which brings me hope that it will only improve in the future.

18670,Good strategy game.
18671,Get some interns to add some goddamn content.
18672,Why is my Dota broken?
18673,"Not much to say about this. It's basically auto chess, but the UI is better and hitboxes are much clearer. Great game."
18674,"Game for phones, but PC version FeelsWeirdMan"
18675,fun gaem
18676,"Best ""Auto Chess"" out there by far!

No cheeky Epic Launcher.
No trash game comes with it.

What do you want more?"

18690,lol
18691,"Absolutely loads of fun from Valve! Check it out definitely, it's free anyways even if you don't end up liking it. :) Yep."
18692,cleaner version of autochess!
18693,"Great relaxing game, has some depth.
Great support from Valve as the updates flow"
18694,GOOD GAME BUT THE CARDS OF THE SAME DECK WONT APPEAR
18695,these kinda games are pretty boring. you literally do nothing. if you have time to waste on this id suggest playing a real ACTUAL fun game
18696,Good casual game
18697,Good game
18698,Great game good game

18700,Its a fun Game with many abilities you have to think hard and quess what might happen next definitly recommend it
18701,good game
18702,"Kinda cool, but traditional chess was better"
18703,"Based off the Dota 2 mod Auto Chess, this is recreated with prettier graphics and more clunky interface. Smooths item randomness comparatively, however doesn't add more the differentiate."
18704,"Great game, fun, well balanced after the patch. works well on Phone too."
18705,Nice game
18706,game tempek
18707,ok
18708,Mages
18709,"A lot of RNG and luck in multiplayer.. little ""skill"" involved. That being said, it's fun when you can get those lucky picks early and steam roll everyone."
18710,"This game is tons of fun and I've already gotten a bad case of one-more-game syndrome. You don't need any Dota 2 experience to jump right in, but it might take you just a tiny bit longer to get familiar with all of the heroes. If you've never played an ""auto battler"" game before then you're definitely going to want to play through the tutorial and maybe a few bot matches as well.

Once you're up to speed though this game will hook you fast. There's a good mix of strategy and RNG to keep every game fresh while still giving you room to learn more. If you enjoy drafting in card games or any type of resource/economy management games then this will scratch that itch."
18711,This game make a Fun
18712,sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers
18713,Little bit complicated from start of the game to learn the game mechanism but its awesome that its connected with phone version.

18744,"If you enjoy dominating with good synergy early then getting fucked by bad RNG so you can't upgrade anything, then this is the game for you!
If you do not enjoy losing simply because you got unlucky then stay clear."
18745,never played dota but this was surprisingly easy to understand
18746,"Esse jogo me deu transtornos bipolares, são tão horroroso que tem horas que não sei se choro ou se caio na gaitada.



Podem jogar e por favor não baixem 6gb pra jogar um auto-chess que você nao pode levar pro banheiro.


Só ta faltando um chatzinho e steam avatar."
18747,nice game
18748,"The RNG is wayyyy out of control here, and the games are frankly a bit too long - I can't even imagine playing this on mobile. Mobile games are usually like, hey, I'm taking a dump or I'm on my break, let's play a round or maybe two. Most of the games I played while I was giving this a shot went almost 40 rounds. In my 7 hours of playtime I think I only played like, the tutorial, 2 bot games, and 2 real matchmade games against human players. It just felt... not really very fun to have so little control over the outcome when it takes so long to finish a game.

Also basically no customization of any kind. You don't make your own deck, you don't level your characters except during the match, no custom UI features, you don't even have an avatar to make you feel unique or anything at all really. Now this in particular I can excuse because its a fresh new release and is still in basically beta, but it was still a con for me and I can imagine it would be for others.

What you ""draw"" from during the matches could literally be any creature in the game, which might be cool if you weren't trying to make combos with similar factions, but worst of all you have to repeatedly draw the same card to power it up (3 of a 1 star makes a 2 star, 3 2 stars makes a 3 star - that's drawing the same guy 9 times in one game!).

Sorry Valve, I really like the premise, the look, etc. but overall this is just... not gonna take off unless the RNG and game length is adjusted to make it feel like the player is actually in control of the outcome of their game. I think you might achieve both fixes at once if you could maybe just ban several Alliances for yourself that you just never would want to draw or pick (5? 3 even? IDK there's way too much variety for not being able to narrow it down).

You would only play this if you literally don't care at all what the outcome of any game you play is, and you have hours upon hours of time to waste losing to people who just happened to draw 9 of the same guy in one game and now have a rampaging god on their team. What I'm saying is, don't bother with this until some significant changes are made."
18749,The feeling you get when you win a game of Underlords is second to none. If you are new to the auto battler genre I would highly recommend giving this a shot.
18750,Really fun to play. Great game mechanics!
18751,Fun game
18752,"Made for mobile so the controls are easy to use but also comes with huge drawbacks of mobile games.
The game has very little information about other players easily accessible compared to Auto-chess or even TFT.
Seems to have some bad simplifications and lacks some of the best improvements to Auto-chess."
18753,nice game
18754,"A very fun game for playing by yourself or with friends. It's an auto-chess game where you pick your team and your team auto battles and you see if you built the better team. It plays up to 8 players and is good for a relaxing time. The game is also playable on mobile devices, so you can play and practice on the go.

As an introvert that likes to play with his friends, I love the fact there is no voice chat, nobody is pressuring you to play a certain way or play well even. You can play with your friends, not worry about people chatting with you unless you are on discord, and it still fun to play by yourself to get some practice in."
18755,Don't know how valve got away with stealing someones idea. Gameplay is fine. Engine is trash tho.
18756,Solid Game.
18757,"Original mechanics of auto chess, plus its free to play on almost all platforms. (thumbs up)"
18758,pretty good game and the developers update frequently so far
18759,Better than Teamfight Tactics
18760,"the best autochess. love the item system that doesnt have a drop rate, so unlucky guys like me can  get itens"
18761,A berry Good Game Indeed ZULOL
18762,This game drains my iphone's battery like a tampon during a girl's period. And I still suck at it.
18763,Sobble likes this
18764,its good
18765,Good Games
18766,So much better than the original version! and item system is a million times better than TFT's overly rng dependent shitty system. This one is so much more balanced.
18767,auto chess but its not a mod
18768,One of the better games in the Auto Chess Genre. The item distribution system is great and it also features a solo mode. It can be played on mobile and even offline. The Dota heroes are also a plus.
18769,ok
18770,mantab lur tp tapi dewa RNG tidak berpihak kepada saya
18771,underlord system needs work
18772,Love this game
18773,Awesome game! More balanced than dota autochess. And also available for mobile.
18774,nice
18775,great game
18776,nice game
18777,"great game,
mobile version is shite though

EDIT:

They greatly improved the mobile version. 5/5"
18778,"It's pretty good. 

How was that Smaass?"
18779,By far the best Auto Chess on the market. Valve really stepped up there game and didn't turn this into a blunder like Artifact.
18780,It's free.
18781,Me pick carry blyat
18782,.
18783,good
18784,good game
18785,:3
18786,"I know it's totally cliche, but the game is simple to learn and hard to master. It's a simply-crafted game yet it has so much depth. Not going to lie though, the system could be improved upon. That being said, the game is still a solid entry in Valve's catalog."
18787,Fun game the original autochess based on a moba
18788,Light and lots of fun
18789,good game
18790,"One of the best chess game out there, still need more balance between classes"
18791,7/10 alot better quality of life than Dota Auto Chess but still prefer the original
18792,Good Game. Needs blitz mode for faster matches though.
18793,"Still has some room to grow, hoping Valve continues to support it and doesn't drop it like Artifact."
18794,Enjoyable
18795,"Eh its okay
"
18796,"Pretty fun game, feels more balanced than the mod version two and has some nice ui to easily see whats going on."
18797,Awesome Addiction
18798,Awesome fun!
18799,"Save your life, don't play this."
18800,Miss creeps rounds
18801,"not bahd, good soize"
18802,Pretty addictive
18803,Псссс
18804,Nice Game
18805,Polished Chess Game. Had many hours fun with it.
18806,I love Dota Underlords it is so good I had so much fun on the tetorial. 10/10 paws would play agian!
18807,coool and very strategic game!
18808,Fun game! The RNG can make or break you most matches though.
18809,"This game is very well designed. It has some minor balance issues right now, but continues to receive updates regularly to fix this. It's also free so why not play it."
18810,NEW ARPG!!!
18811,dotas
18812,NOICE GAEM
18813,Great game!
18814,ok.
18815,Like game
18816,"it's free
it's good
yeah"
18817,Cool Game Thumbs up from this guy
18818,sick
18819,play tft. its better
18820,need little improve
18821,"Very compelling version of Auto-Chess. It will need improvements and a larger variety, but it already is a very fun experience and can stand beside DOTA 2 on it's own."
18822,"Game game, shit name."
18823,"need a lot of improvement, but this game is enjoyable"
18824,"This is by far the most user friendly version of Auto Chess I have seen so far.  It has all the same strategic elements like items but implements them in a way that's easier to manage and requires less specific knowledge of hidden mechanics to be able to compete.

For instance, in this game items are simple boosts you give one of to each unit.  You're also awarded a guaranteed item from each neutral wave even if you lose the fight (though you get to pick your item from a set of choices if you win.)  In both Auto Chess and Team Fight Tactics, items are granted completely randomly from each neutral minion kill and must be combined in specific patterns to create the stronger items.  In those games you can also stack multiple items on each unit to create a single super powerful unit capable of carrying your team to victory on its own.

Due to that and many other user friendly changes to the formula, i'd highly recommend this game for anyone looking to either introduce a friend to this kind of game or figure it out for themselves.  Just keep in mind that if you're looking for a StarCraft level of strategy game, you're not going to find it here.  Due to the heavy RNG elements, you'll need to stay flexible about what you pick for each match or you'll end up burning all your gold and getting frustrated.  The strategy in this game is in managing probabilities and formations, not picking a specific build and executing it flawlessly."
18825,trashcan dumpster mobile auto chess 0/10 would play TFT instead
18826,"Horrible, horrible horrible.

If you are unlucky person, don't even try this game, you will end insane."
18827,F
18828,Good continuation from auto chess
18829,better than artifact
18830,deez nuts
18831,"I'd recommend trying it if you like strategy and tactics games. Easy to learn, hard to get good at. I think the Challenging and Red AI bots cheat in some manner but it is what it is, AI can only  be so good by itself. :p"
18832,OMEGAEZ
18833,a very interesting game
18834,Gerat game!
18835,Da pra perde um tempo
18836,better Than Auto Chess
18837,Great and fun game. Just be prepared for RNG to make or break you winning a lot of the time
18838,fkn garbage rng
18839,"Very frustrating game in my opinion. Too much gambling. First impression is that there are a lot of choices, but after trying the builds it's clear that it's all about following the meta and praying for good random number generator."
18840,"wow, its pretty good."
18841,"Good game, RNG can screw you over sometimes."
18842,+
18843,best autochess
18844,its ight
18845,Good but hard
18846,It's a phone game for sure
18847,Another RNG trash masterpiece by Valve.
18848,I didnt enjoy it. Guess it needs more time but it didnt get me hooked. Sry
18849,noice
18850,"I mean, its autochess."
18851,If you have time and you can think and you have enough battery you can play this and have some fun out of world of run.
18852,Probably the best way to waste half an hour on a bus
18853,Really great remake of the game autochess on dota. Everything is clearer and easier and you can also play on mobile!!
18854,very bad game fuck valve cant even make good game
18855,kill me dota pls
18856,i don't even play dota
18857,"One Word, EXCELLENT!

Was worry about that wasn't as good as the arcade one since the developers of the original went to create theirs, I like to report it delivered quality and added some quality of life improvementes.

PROS:
1) Same game.
2) Simplify use of items. (1 per character and get rid of combinations)
3) UI easy to use once used to.

CONS:
1) More options in menus and other features like replays, stats, ability to change portrait is no where to be found.
"
18858,Great fun. PC version is perfect. But the ios version is not stable enough.
18859,so far so good
18860,Fun Autochess
18861,"This game is ridiculously addicting and I have no idea why. Use coins to purchase heroes for your army and boost your xp while maintaining a decent economy, level up your heroes, and hope your synergy is better than everyone else."
18862,"its cool, but i dont understand how to win"
18863,yeah
18864,"Kinda meh, but still playable. It's just missing something, but I wouldn't be able to say what is that."
18865,I enjoy the match making and User interface over those presented in dota autochess
18866,"A spin-off of a mod, that was in a spin-off of a mod, that was in a game. Even though this game has no right to exist, it does - and it's good. It doesn't require any Dota knowledge, nor do you need any dexterity. It's simply a strategy game. I have no doubt Automatic Chess is going to be the next new genre, and Underlords is a great one to play."
18867,The best autochess.
18868,"Very great game, need to fix some bugs and improve UI"
18869,fine game
18870,i cant win play this game.....
18871,"Clearly rushed and still a work in progress in many areas, however, it still manages to be crazy fun and addicting despite the rough edges."
18872,Very fun yes fun game no rng very fun
18873,This game is only in beta and it has better design than Riot's League of Legends.
18874,"Still a litlle rough on the UI, but good game!"
18875,its aight
18876,Good
18877,Decent game
18878,best auto chess
18879,Very good! Much cleaner than the mod
18880,Mod of a mod of a mod of a mod. Nuff said.
18881,RNG hates me!1!
18882,sf is op
18883,Valve pretends to care: Part 15.
18884,"it's so addictive, i love it"
18885,Enjoying the updated Auto Chess. Learning options by playing bots.
18886,7.5 / 10
18887,This software product combines the worst features of idle/clicker games and slot machines. I cannot recommend this!
18888,Interesting..
18889,would recommend
18890,"95% luck , 5% skill :DD"
18891,ESTA WENO
18892,k i guess
18893,Bery nays!
18894,Fun auto chess variant if you are a fan of Dota. Bit of a learning curve but fun to play.
18895,Digital crack
18896,"Little bit of strategy, lots of luck. Fun times.

A solid Borat Veryy Niiiice /10"
18897,"My favorite version of autochess. Designed is optimized for mobile, so everything looks a tad large on pc. However, the general UI design is intuitive and easily gives you the information that you want."
18898,Very time consuming....
18899,From Auto Chess to Dota Underlords. New era of Strategy game is here! It's actually fun and easy to play. I know it still in Beta but I hope Valve makes this game even more better and greater in the future. I love chess game <3
18900,very funny game
18901,Very good.
18902,Have to say the games much cleaner and easier to get into than i originally thought def fun to play! The devs took an idea and polished it well
18903,not bad
18904,Fun Game!
18905,Underlords cannot  compete with Auto Chess in the short term.Needs more improvement and i think it could be for only mobile.
18906,not that bad
18907,Still the better auto chess. but updates have slowed to a halt.
18908,"Great game, but could use more content."
18909,"Yup, its great."
18910,good fun requires some luck at times
18911,I mean its pretty good actually. Better than artifact for sure Games are pretty quick and generally whole game is pretty smooth
18912,duos or bust
18913,"Easy to play, hard to master"
18914,Nice game for kill free time
18915,Even though the game is still in a really early state. Loads of fun and plenty of strategy. Looking forward to the changes in the coming months.
18916,good game hope it will stay like this forevah
18917,Topzera
18918,jaja muy bueno
18919,"Better than TFT, that's for sure."
18920,"DOTA UNDERLORDS IS THE THey perfect game for the strategy hungry casual gamer who just wants to sit, maybe watch some star trek on the side and still enjoy the competitive nature of tactical gameplay!"
18921,wow
18922,sik
18923,big fan of chess
18924,yo
18925,good game for your smartphone!
18926,Schlechte Version des Originals aus dem Dota 2 workshop
18927,Great for open beta...needs further balance and more heroes.
18928,"so i am fully hooked. I like how the meta keeps changing so you are always kept on your toes, no easy win builds, except 3 hunters, but nevermind. Stack hunters and some other dopness and get them Ws!!"
18929,"Volvo, where is my Borealis tour?"
18930,ok
18931,nice game tbh
18932,its fine
18933,Very good game!
18934,"Luck of the draw and skill to use what chance throws at you.. what a great way to challenge yourself! Know when to lose without losing too much; know how to continue that winning streak. 
This is a simple game with complex mechanics. I would pay for this free game."
18935,I really like the fact that I can play on PC and mobile with the same account.
18936,Cool game
18937,"Having little to no experience with DOTA, or any other MOBA's, I went into this hesitantly. I'm glad I gave it a try. DOTA Underlords is a simple to grasp; hard to master drafting game. Think of it as a card game where you try to create synergy with your units. It combines economy management, alliance combos, and item management while also being completely automated at the same time.

The battles take place without you having to do anything. This may seem frustrating to some but I found watching over the battles as overlord very compelling. 

You also need to keep track of what other players are doing so you can possibly pivot your strategy to counter them.

I have played primarily bot matches which I have found to give me a nice challenge while I gained enough knowledge of the good unit/item combinations to prepare me for online ranked play. 

Things still need a little work, mainly with UI but overall its a fresh new genre that has me enjoying every moment of it."
18938,"fun free game, specially on mobile"
18939,Nice free game
18940,Takes Dota AUTOCHESS and makes the controls and matchmaking better. It's enough to say that Autobattlers are such a strong new genre that this game is great without changing much at all from the mod that inspired it.
18941,A perfect blend of salt and skill.
18942,"Only had this game for 2 days and I have almost 40 hours, WTF I can't Stop playing.
This game has Ruined my Life.

I watched others played Auto Chess, I wanted to try it out but but never got a chance to.
Now I saw the standalone version of it, I had to get it.

It took me about 3 games to get to know the basics, but now Im a Smuggler (Rank) 

I wont say the game is all that fun at first, but IDK why is so addicting."
18943,"The UI needs work and the current hero roster is limited, but I still find it surprisingly fun."
18944,this game is like playing dota 2 on Mobile
18945,"Good and fun to play, might work on faster pace"
18946,"Enjoyable game, requires plenty of game time to really dig into the mechanics of everything. Worth trying if you are a fan of DOTA and the universe that has created, as almost all the heros from DOTA are present.

Can get a tad frantic and hard to follow towards the end of each game, with lots of characters/mobs on the board."
18947,Beyond unbalanced.
18948,"Amazing!! Enjoying it, loving the AUTO CHESS ERA!!!!!"
18949,yes good
18950,Way better than Dota Autochess
18951,"говно
стим дай токены"
18952,Good but still needs work.
18953,I ran warriors and won.
18954,it's okay so far
18955,Great version of an Auto Battler by valve. I enjoy how every neutral round you are guaranteed an item.
18956,Hearthstone heroes of dota
18957,Nice
18958,"Totally worth my time, even better than the original auto chess from dota 2 
They even added bot match that you can save and play it later.. very nice"
18959,its okay
18960,"It is nice to see something new from this franchise.
Can be really  addictive, good fun"
18961,Good game
18962,"Wait a minute, this is not Half Life 3!"
18963,needs so much balancing.
18964,fun game with updates coming regularly.
18965,"fun game, a mix of random and strategy. mostly random."
18966,More exciting than Chess.
18967,the nicest of them all
18968,Good fun game!
18969,good game
18970,"I've been enjoying this game quite a bit! 

It took a few games to better understand how to manage my gold and build combos that compliment each other. I enjoy the different phases the game is sorta broken down into. I also enjoy that you can viably play a losing streak strategy for a few turns, and due to the interest system bank a bunch of gold to level up and combine your characters.

I haven't encountered any game-breaking or crashing bugs so far."
18971,nice game
18972,"Although still in beta, I think it will be one of the top games on steam when it is fully released and has a very bright future."
18973,...
18974,Very well made and entertaining game!
18975,Slowly but steady this game is getting to be the best of the genre
18976,Good strategy game!
18977,best auto chess
18978,"they way i can pick up heroes is easier than lol auto chess.
Underlords Displays more information to the player.

"
18979,Interesting
18980,Just play real chess ;)
18981,100% RNG. 0% skill.
18982,I have to thank the developers for not making us use real coins for this wonderful slot machine.
18983,hmmmm
18984,Want to make 30-40 minutes disappear? This makes that very easy.
18985,It's a fun game. Gave me vibes to play some DOTA 1 :/
18986,Artifact 2
18987,Can and should improve a lot but still better then its biggest rival
18988,Interesting game!
18989,+1
18990,I'm terrible at this game but I love it!
18991,"a better autochess, lovely"
18992,good
18993,"A pretty alright game all things considered, I enjoyed it mainly for the snippets of DotA lore you get to see in item descriptions and the like"
18994,Good  game!
18995,"This is a relatively simple game that has a higher skill cap than originally appears, great game that doesn't require hours of grinding to unlock all of the content. Would recommend."
18996,I LOVE chess.
18997,Very Fun :) Cant wait for more features
18998,"Funny game, you don't make mistakes you just have bad luck with upgrades.."
18999,Pretty smooth
19000,"""New and polished versioin of Dota Auto Chess, strongly recommend to those who loved the original""
- I said two days after release. Now ot's unplayable piece of shit. Don't even bother, it constantly crashes and Valve doesn't seem to care"
19001,(Y)
19002,Interesting take. Bit too RNG reliant for my tastes
19003,Great on mobile
19004,It's ok.
19005,I would rather play the dota 2 mod
19006,worth a try but long games
19007,Great
19008,"Yup, its good"
19009,"A new genre is born!

Dota Underlords is a game that can be as shallow or as deep as you want. I'll mostly be playing this while watching TV or listening to music, but I'll also have moments where I'm fully focused, wanting to destroy my opponents. I've only played a few matches, but I'm hooked."
19010,"Fun.  Recommend. Free.  

Balance team doing a great job.  Art asset team needs to catch up :)"
19011,Looking for next updates for balancing
19012,Fixes a lot of the issues that autochess has in a great way!
19013,Very addictive game :/
19014,"Some interesting concepts here. Has positives going for it over TFT, especially the item system. My lack of familiarity with DOTA characters definitely hurts me in feeling comfortable with it. The shop and UI can be a little cleaner too, but I did like it outside of the AoE i kept getting wrecked by."
19015,good job
19016,huh
19017,A decent game that's fun to play now and then.
19018,An alluring experience with in depth strategy to exciting competitive play.
19019,"Um jogo casual, divertido e que faz pensar, mas falta uma trilha sonora de qualidade, balanceamento e rankeamento, de resto, é um bom jogo pra ficar de boa e sair a hora que quiser."
19020,Geras xD
19021,goodgame
19022,you will never get the units for whatever global item you choose. 10/10
19023,"So far, so good."
19024,"This game isn't based on luck, Pure skill challenge, you suck if you aren't skilled enough."
19025,just play tft
19026,Better than original ones
19027,this game sucks lol
19028,good and fun
19029,y
19030,good
19031,"Its not terrible, it needs work, but its not terrible."
19032,I'm really bad at this game yet I still have fun
19033,"Finally, a polished Auto Chess experience that does not suffer from unnecessary courier micro. Like!"
19034,Giff us immortal 2 and 3
19035,идея не нова
19036,fun autochess game
19037,tenebroso de ruim
19038,"It is plain fun.

Disclaimer: matches take a while."
19039,Nice game
19040,"Nice game, great for passing time"
19041,"Lots of fun, especially playing against friends!!! Should add some type of bonus/reward system, maybe earn coins to change the hero skins?"
19042,I enjoy the game but it has freezing issues that force me to close and reopen the game mid match.
19043,Pretty good
19044,"Pretty fun, needs a bit more work and balances between alliance options. I miss the couriers from the original mod."
19045,"Different combinations of characters.
RNG is 50/50 factor your enemy can just be getting everything they need or you could finish with 100 health and 6 tier 3's
Overall auto chess... I mean dota underlords is pretty fun
"
19046,Enough good realisation  of classical Dota Auto Chess with some additions and changes. I think it would be nice to play with friends few parties for fun.
19047,Still better then dota :)
19048,"I didn't think I would enjoy a Auto-chess game just by looking at it. Fortunately for me one of my friends messaged me a couple weeks ago and told me Dota Underlords was in Early Access and that it was free for me to pick up and try. So I thought that it couldn't hurt to try it out as I've already had plenty of fun playing Dota 2 many years ago.

I picked it up, played the tutorial, played a few matches with my friends - and I'm absolutely loving it.

There's something awfully satisfying about making your decisions and making up your tactics before each round starts and just watch it unfold. Try to get certain heroes that combos well together and move heroes around the board to try and improve your perfomance, such as putting a tank-like hero in the very back of the board in order for it to pick up the assassins that would normally go for your damage-dealers in the backline.

It's really satisfying to play and watch unfold. 

So far there's no monetization in the game, however I do know that there's plans to add a 'battle-pass', however I do not know exactly what that contains and it also seems like the dev team is a bit unsure of that as well (judging by their recent posts). I hope the monetization will stay healthy in terms of not letting it sacrifice the fun of the game or empower you in any way. If the upcoming monetization stays healthy for both players and devs then I can wholeheartedly vouch for the game. Big thumps up!

Note: This review was made during the Early Access testing and might not display the final version of the game. These are my thought during the FREE Early Access."
19049,Smoother version of auto chess.
19050,"In Underlords, you don't fight agains't other players. You fight against RNG. Got your levels early? You snowball and win. Congrats, gg. I'm not saying it's not fun, playing dices can be fun too... But don't expect any deep strategy in this. It's only pure randomness."

19052,DAC without 20 minute queue times.
19053,"Between Autochess and TFT and this, it sits somewhere in the middle, it has a lot of balancing to do still, but still worth a try."
19054,VERY GOOD
19055,"Easy to learn, hard to master.
Gather your heroes and fight vs players or bots. Having multiple heroes from the same alliance gives you a boost 
Combine 3 heroes of the same kind to level them up and make them.stonger. still a beta but so far I have not had any bugs.
Have a look and try it on your own, it's free to play"
19056,Never played DOTA and had no idea what auto chess was however I am enjoying this game very much!
19057,not a bad game
19058,GG !
19059,"Decent game 7/10
Will ruin relationships just like Dota 2
Look forward for a TI for this one as well cause Volvo's all about that money"
19060,Fun.
19061,Best of it genre!
19062,Great adaptation of the original auto chess mod! Fluid gameplay and of course the official dota 2 licence. Fun! =)
19063,"Nice game!!
 Be smart !"
19064,good shit
19065,GG!
19066,Amazing
19067,I was a big fan of Auto Chess. Now it finally has its own standalone game! What I love most is the fact that you can play this offline.
19068,needs a few fixes to succeed auto-chess but otherwise kinda good
19069,"It's good, but matches take about as long as an average game of DOTA"
19070,Gavnoy vonyaet
19071,Nice game!
19072,Dota chess but more fun
19073,Good game so far. But the RNG has a nasty way of biting you in the ass. There has been numerous updates and the progress is going well
19074,"A great alternative to TBT, with characters you know better, and with information on the Heroes, Items and Alliances. Overall I would recommend this game over TBT, but thats because I play more Dota than LoL"
19075,"UPD: GAME IS DEAD EVERYTHING THAT I SAY FURTHER IS ALREADY MEANINGLESS

When i had ~400 hours in this game, i made a negative review. Before I said that game is random and meta is always stale (even after changes, people find the best builds quite early). Now I'm changing my review in a opposite direction. Today I would love to see people trying this game. Valve doing tiny steps every week, improvnig the game. It feels like they test a lot of things, and try to add them in game, to make game more complex and diverse. Auto Battler genre is very young. There is not so many rules, how to make a good Auto Battler. And now i see, that Valve doing a great job in developing a game. They are very dedicated to creating a good Auto Battler.

Recently they started adding 3-star unit effects (when you make a strongest version of a unit, it has some unusual effect on board, sometimes its something not important, sometimes its gamechanging). Also, they shrinked the hero pool. Almoust halved the ammount of copies of units. And, also, they are fixing op things really fast. All of that makes this game have a really interesting meta. The healthiest ever been. And today its almost impossible to force same build every game. It's just doesn't work anymore. Now to have a consistent result you have to play way better than before. If you play mages, you can play different versions of mages, and you have to choose, looking at your opponents (to not contest same units and to pick counters, for example you can add health-percentage-based-pure-damaging allience, just to counter stacking health build). 

So now this game way more complex than before, and i see a bright future for the game. I should mention, that after release Dota 2 wasn't popular, just as CS:GO. And Valve spent some time developing this games to make them popular. I ask you to try this game to find out whether this game is for you, or not. And if you stopped playing this game before, maybe its time to try this game again. This game is better than before, and i think it would be even better. Today I enjoy playing this game, and i noticed, that playerbase stopped shrinikg (but its early to say). As I said before, I think you should try this game."
19076,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

not bad"
19077,Juegazo para los momentos en los que quieres relajar la mente luego de estresarte jugando Dota2 o algun otro juego donde encuentras flamers :D Podria decirse que parece complejo pero en un par de juegos ya le agarraste el hilo.
19078,Thank you for this great game valve. Could you make a battle royale with your dota characters next? I think it would work even better than this... whatever it is.
19079,Nice game to play while doing something else
19080,Относительно не очень

19084,Dope game
19085,Awsome game
19086,good times
19087,"A very polished game so far, especially love the cross platform mechanics. Now waiting for the progression system to be better"
19088,"I've been playing this game for the last few days and I'm having an absolute blast!

Considering that the game is still in development, I've only experienced a bug once (and not a malicious one, just a bit annoying).

No chat, just the few quick messages and ""liking"" an event = no chance for cancerous people to be vocal with it.

It's good, it's new and it's free - easy recommend."
19089,"ótimo jogo, me surpreendi, simples e sagaz."
19090,Very fun to play and easy to understand. Would recommend.
19091,"It's fun, brain storming and a great way to use your leisure time. If you are a hardcore DOTA 2 fan, you should really try this and fight to the top. The best part- It's available in Android and IOS too. So you can train your brain while on the go. It's a [b] Thumbs Up [/b] from me!"
19092,I play the mobile version alot
19093,"Horrible game, waste of time, no skill involved, totally random"
19094,yet another card game
19095,"Good Auto Chess game. 
This far I haven't found anything to complain so easy to recommend this game to all."
19096,It's ok
19097,meta decks are too strong
19098,yes
19099,Gud

19122,"Great, Free, can't wait till full release."
19123,"This game is fucking terrible. It has no balance what-so-ever. After lots of hours of auto chess this game feel entirely broken compared to the other auto-chess style games out right now. The synergies dont make any sense against each other and they threw in units auto chess didnt have mucking up every class synergy. 

The battles seem almost random, having several higher level units and a good synergy but still getting demolished by a board with 2 less units total and overall lower level of total units. This game lacks any semblance of fairness, seeped with RNG bullshit."
19124,"Fun game, even after new updates."
19125,A polished take on the rapidly-growing auto chess genre that has exploded in popularity.  This is probably the closest you will get to the DOTA 2 mod experience.  The movement and attack animations feel smooth and there is no lag between commands like the mod.  A few great quality-of-life additions have been provided as well as a revamped item system that encourages more strategic play instead of item stacking.  Best of all it's free to play!
19126,"That's a decent one, however can't spend endless time on this game like Dota 2"
19127,GOOD GAME
19128,gacha battle arena
19129,nice

19147,"goty

19148,"Its very promising. I have found that it is less clunky than TFT, (thats all I have to compare it to.) overall its quite fun and has been a great game to play with friends."
19149,A really interesting game design - for me a new genre. Complex a deep mechanics that keep bringing me back trying to find new winning combinations. Especially enjoy the trade-off between early-game or late-game powerful units!
19150,"10/10 would make Savage druids make my enemies bleed again.

Tldr: is great on PC and mobile. It's fucking free try it.

This game is great for beginners and experts alike. I'm currently an enforcer and am loving the gameplay. Being able to play anywhere is great. Hell this is the second game that I actually play with a mobile experience that is good.
The biggest problem with the mobile experience is the ability to learn all character abilities but that will be worked on. Nonetheless the builds are great. The items feel rewarding.

Also btw if you care. I don't play original dota. This is different and better IMO for the way I play games. So don't feel like your Dota 2 opinion should have to much baring on this."
19151,i love this game but it is just auto chess

19177,"It's the original mod with a much better item system, slick UI, and way faster matchmaking (including reconnect capability). The hero skins and spell effects could use improvement, but willing to wait for that vs. dealing with 5-minute queue times and the risk of people not connecting. Plans are clearly laid out on underlords.com; wish they would include patch notes in the game itself. Looking good and my preferred version of all the ""auto-battlers"" especially since it will be DOTA-themed."
19178,Really fun game
19179,"for all ages! :D
cool game"
19180,"Great Entry into the Auto Chess Series, barrier to entry isn't super high though has a lot of decision making that can make or break you with RNG in the mix.

19192,"Auto Chess is a great game genre. Takes a few games to get the hang of it, but a nice way to kill an hour or two. Underlords is very clean and lightweight, which makes it king of the mountain right now.

19195,really fun
19196,its OK
19197,Good game!
19198,The game's now dead. But this was an easy game for me at least. Reached the highest rank possible in a short amount of time. Kept beating all of my friends who played this until I beat no one that lead me bored to death and eventually quit the game. R.I.P Dota Underlords. Thank you for the memories.
19199,^_^
19200,This is a new try from Valve to create another game based on DotA and it's free this time and is actually enjoybale. Players who have played DotA 2 before obviously have advantage over those who didn't so the learning curve is not so beginner friendly and you kinda learn how to play it only a few tens of hours later but still the game is extremely addictive nonetheless. Would easily recommend to a friend.
19201,"Too long game play, can get bored quickly"
19202,Good game overall. Seems like it was meant to be for mobile and was ported to PC to take advantage of the ever growing Auto-Chess craze. Simplified piece movement is very nice. Game is free. What more can you ask for?
19203,iT'S SO GOOD LIKE CHICKEN NUGGET
19204,Really fun. Although rng is a bit annoying at times.

19232,THIS GAME IS LIT
19233,I enjoy this kind of game but others might not. It is free to play so try it out. I played during the beta. I really like the game but it needs a few key features still. I would still recommend it.

19240,Good
19241,"This is a fun casual game that is great for newcomers. With that said, this game does have depth to it that hardcore players will appreciate. I do not think this game will become the next big e-sports title but if you love strategy games and deck building then this game is for you."

19286,A game of patience
19287,"The newest joke from Valve: A game for people that don't like videogames.
Gameplay is similar to tower defense games in which you place uncontrollable units on the map and literally wait for rounds to pass, then repeat ad nauseam. It has a lot of visual glitches and most sounds are from Dota, same as models, voices, etc.
In my opinion it's fucking garbage. It was fine as a mod but I find insulting to call this a videogame on its own.
Probably good for handicapped people and children as it requires minimum atention and no skill, like other casual mobile games.
If videogames are truly headed on this direction from now on, I'd rather kick myself in the balls than play this shit. Honestly I can't understand that someone would enjoy this."
19288,"Very intelligent approach by Valve. This game will crush any other contender, first, Arena of Evolution, then Dordo's Auto-Chess, and RIOT's clone (dunno what it will be called)."

19329,"A really fun time waster of a game. There's lot of QOL improvements compared to the original Autochess.

Some features I like:
-Can leave games without punishment (nice for when a game drags on and I don't have time to finish it)
-Solo/bot games to practice new strats 
-Things like moving units, attaching items, etc. all much cleaner and easier than Autochess
-UI much more user friendly than Autochess

Biggest complaint is there are certain subtle mechanics like gold interest and whatnot that really aren't explained in the game, so I'd recommend reading up on these online if you plan to take it seriously.

Overall a fun game."
19330,"This game really curbs the Dota addiction when you are on holiday

I enjoy it on my Mobile as it feels more enjoyable"
19331,worth it

19342,"Finally we got an ultimate crossplay Android/iOS/Win/Linux/Mac Game!!!
Without a need to login to playgames, nor game center bla bla bla..

Whether you have played the autochess mod in DOTA2, or not, this game is still simple and easy to understand. But not quite hard to master. All you need is 80% luck. Just like playing mahjong, you can get stuck on a furiten. You know, when you should've keep your winning card, but you already throw it.. Like my people used to say: ""Regrets always comes at the end""

19343,lets the RNG be with you <3
19344,cool thank for helping
19345,Adds the much needed polish to Dota Auto Chess. Praise Lord Gaben!
19346,"Really good, like the tempo."
19347,Its so addictive. And the cross platform allow you to play either from android or PC.
19348,not really enjoying this game or maybe my taste are horrible ? :/
19349,Genuinely fun rendition of this style of game.
19350,"Its pretty good, but so much RNG. Games are around 30 mins for what they are, and... its really obvious when youre getting rekt and so if you drop below 30 or so health and the top player has like 60-70, just leave. If you get a good set, you have a high chance of winning. Worth a shot, but I needed to watch a pretty long tutorial on how to play."
19351,Not bad
19352,Solid game
19353,its lit
19354,Where is my underlord ?
19355,Great version of the popular autochess genre. Needs work but I'm excited for what's to come!

19420,"Just like autochess but better. The neutral round got adjusted, smarter AI of the chess, wider hero pool also the alliance."
19421,"PROS:
+good amount of strategy and planning involved
+if RNGesus loves you, this is your wet dream
+ you can play this game anytime and anywhere

CONS:
+some strategies are dependent on item and/or unit rolls
-if RNGesus hates you, you're gonna get screwed
-just be ready for the repercussions when you try to play this anytime and anywhere"
19422,Good waste of time .
19423,Solid port for what it is and quite fun
19424,"So far so incredibly good. Auto chess is a challenging genre, where you can get so many combinations through an alliances, buffs and items. For now its very much fun to play and git gud in it."

19439,Could of been better.
19440,"[b]Dota Underlords[/b] is a wonderful game, the gameplay is relaxed, but sometimes you have to think and create various tactics. The best autochess game on the market.

The game is constantly updated, so let's see what happens next...

19441,nice game
19442,"Its ""Free"" Because Battlepass"
19443,The game good
19444,Great game to help pass the time while you're in bed.. alone.. with your dog.
19445,good game
19446,Though the game is very fun it can be very complex for a new player. Other than that the Hud is pretty dhit and feels annoying and clustered
19447,"Good game, but could get stale quite fast"
19448,"The concept is easy. Spend money on heroes and let them fight opponents to earn more money and buy more heroes or improve them. Lose as little battles as possible as that makes you lose health. Be the last remaining player with health. Win.
You improve your chances by managing your gold income and choosing the best heroes that compliment each other with so-called alliances resulting in buffs for your party of heroes. That makes this a very easy game to pickup but becomes challenging quite fast as there are always ways to get better and more efficient."
19449,noice
19450,nice game
19451,yeah aight
19452,ini dota?
19453,Better version of Auto Chess

19491,Well it's an auto chess game. I don't like moba games like dota or league but i just play for the auto chess so yeah.

19500,"The flavor of the week in gaming gets a Valve version.

Let's hope this works out better than artifact!

update: after 100 hours played and a few updates I really think this game is actually shaping up to be quite good!

If only Artifact would have gotten the same love!"
19501,I'm gonna be honest I don't understand this game even the tutorial to me is like WTF.
19502,gud game
19503,beter than autochess
19504,"it's insane, but can be better."

19507,Fun yet frustrating~
19508,pepeLaugh
19509,"Very fun casual game.  I had no idea how to play the game, but each round you go face to face with your opponents by building up your army from the pre-selected toon and each are unique but offer bonus status if you have one of the same class.
Every time you purchase the same type of toon more than three of them, you'll upgrade their status and make them even more powerful.

Highly recommended for casual gamers."
19510,"-Nice UI
-Very Fun"
19511,good game to pass the time.. had lots of fun
19512,"Gamer!
"
19513,"Fun, but needs more characters & balancing still, but only in Beta, if you've played the dota 2 custom maps, you'll enjoy it."
19514,"Game is highly addictive and fun, great to play while conducting other tasks as interaction is kept to certain play windows."
19515,"While the random element is sometimes a bit too much random, this is a really fun strategy game and has a good client on mobiles.

EDIT (after playing more): I found this game on the Apple store, and tried it because I used to play DotA. Played against bots until I could beat the most difficult bot-level. Then went to ranked, where I saw a lot of people winning with 2-star heroes while I only had 1 star over the head of my heroes. Started paying attention and realized that if you buy the same hero 3 times then it becomes 2-star, and if you buy three 2-star heroes you get one 3-star. OK, I learned something and started climbing ranked faster. Figured out that some alliances always makes you lose and others make you win, so I always tried to go for the winning ones and climbed ranked faster. Then a patch came where nothing seemed to be strong and everything appeared to be random. At that point I gave up on the game, but stumbled on a guy called Bebe from Korea who was streaming on Twitch, and he was ranked 1 in the world at the time, and he placed number 1 in almost 20 consecutive games. Learned from him to manage my economy better and how blacklisting heroes works, so I climbed a bit. Then I fell back to my own style of playing, forgetting lessons from Bebe, and I started falling in ranked. Conclusion; there's a lot of skill involved in playing this game, but sometimes it seems random. 

Out of curiosity I tried Teamfight Tactics, which is part of the League of Legends client, and I also used to play LoL a lot. Hated TFT in all kinds of ways, just didn't find anything they did better than Underlords in my opinion. So I do recommend this game as the number one ""auto-chess MOBA version"". 

I think the game could be improved by focusing more on strategy and less on ""actions per minute"" (working the shop fast can give major advantages) but I guess the APM is an inevitable heritage from the MOBA genre."
19516,unbalanced
19517,best autochess game
19518,Not sure i fully understand the game.Seems to be heavy on RNG. Overall not my kinda game
19519,"awesome game 10 out of 10, phenomenal gaming experience."
19520,"Nice Idea from Valve, but still prefer the in game version. Content updates are fast and I don't have to leave the game to play a game of Dota 2.

-Fun
-Fast

But at the end of the day there is a small gambling  mechanic in it that doesn't help allot of the times.
Give it a go. I Like Dota 2 Auto chess more."
19521,Very time consuming but fun nonetheless
19522,"Casual fun, can be played on mobile as well"
19523,Its amazing so amazing its the reason im alive

19547,Cool adaptation

19567,"Hard to play on mobile, still fun, 8/10"
19568,"Good Mobile to PC game. Not very complex, but doesn't mean its bad."
19569,"Since playing the original dota auto chess (having to download dota 2 just to play it) this new version Dota Underlords is leaps and bounds above it. The item system is just awesome. one of the main reasons I still play.

Dota Underlords is 10 times better than teamfight tactics as well. that's coming from someone who has been playing league for over 6 years. TFT's has so many problems, yet Underlords is refined and the developers listen and understand their players.

Overall quality game, best game of its genre!"
19570,"Pretty good game...

19589,"Good game, still developing"
19590,slot-machine for nerds
19591,Quality of life is better than in Teamfight Tactics - you can see all buffs / synergies and you don't need to worry abour RNG item drops (except which ones you can pick from).
19592,Great Game
19593,Strictly better than Artifact.
19594,good game
19595,"They should have started with this not artifact 

(EDIT) 

I no longer recommend this game, Its changed too much for my liking. ever since they added the underlords and and started changing the game drastically iv lost interest."
19596,"Best autochess game out at the moment.  Easy to learn, shows the synergies very well, and doesn't over complicate the game.  Better than Leauge of Legends Teamfight Tactics by a long shot."
19597,New to auto chess like games.  I like this adaption very much.  Nice tutorial.
19598,COPYCAT BUT GOOD
19599,"auto chessssss
use all assassins, u will see jumping pieces in action
XD"
19600,"Very deep and complex game, but it doesn't take too long to pick up the basics for it. Very fun, extremely addictive"
19601,"The DOTA for people who hate DOTA, unless you hate DOTA.

Pros:
- Free (for now)
- Feelings of satisfaction when you get that one unit or item you needed to turn the tides.
- Game well suited for mobile thanks to the drag/drop control scheme and idle mechanics.

Cons:
- Randomness dictates the game. Games are won and lost more due to luck of the draw than careful positioning and item optimization.
- Unintuitive. Several game mechanics not explained in the tutorial and not immediately obvious that are crucial to win.
- Slow early game that has little impact on overall performance and exists largely as a formality. Takes 4 rounds until your decisions actually have weight.
- Steep play/counterplay curve if you're not familiar with the DOTA units and what they do. 

Would Recommend To:
- DOTA or MOBA fans looking for something more relaxed than a full MOBA game. Fans of games based around the thrill of lucky rolls or random swings of fate. Gambling addicts looking for something that won't actively prey on them . . . currently.

Would Alternatively Suggest:
- Teamfight Tactics (League of Legends) - This is a lateral recommendation. Tactics has more comeback mechanics to help out losing players and a larger variety of tactical considerations (limited champion pool, item combos, etc), but arguably is more random due to the smaller board and is definitely not coded as cleanly. Oddly enough, Tactics is the more complicated Auto Chess game, while DOTA is the more complicated MOBA. Also, it's free.
- They Are Billions - If you see Auto Chess as an evolution of Tower Defense, They Are Billions is a polished refinement of the concept. Same emphasis on positioning and unit composition, but now with actual agency in your gameplay.
- ARAM (Also League, but likely present in other MOBAs) - All the thrill of competitve randomness while also engaging throughout the entire match. Technically free, but in League your random pool is limited to the rotation champions plus who you own.

Recommending only because it is a free game and doesn't hurt you to try it, but would pitch my ""Would Alternatively Suggest"" list to you depending on what appeals to you about this game."
19602,from doto to doto underloot
19603,GOOD
19604,why
19605,"Auto Chess Clone?
Nope It is Underlord OwO"
19606,"Easy to play, hard to master. Excellent that they made a mobile version of this as well."
19607,VERY EPIC
19608,"A really fun auto-battler with a great UI. Could still use some work, but that is what feedback is for :) They seem to be on top of balancing and patches are happening fairly often. If you are looking to try out the genre, it is a lot easier to learn on Underlords than TFT, as there are more information points readily accessible on screen."

19620,This is the best successor of Auto Chess I have found so far. Mainly because of how seamless you can transition from playing on your PC to playing on your phone. You just need to link your steam account to your Mobile app.
19621,Good game!
19622,"honestly it's my new addiction. Goodbye sleep, its been nice knowing you."
19623,nice game (y)

19640,"been playing the game for quite a while, easy to say this game is about 10% knowledge and 90% luck.. luck is the key factor determining your winning or losing..  try it yourself and you will understand what i mean.. but it still in beta so.. lets see what improvement will come in the future.."
19641,good
19642,wew
19643,Good improvement from the Dota Auto Chess custom game in Dota 2. Lots of quality of life and balance changes to make the game better and more enjoyable.
19644,"though i dont have much time in the game, i think its alright if this kind of game is your own thing"
19645,Fast battles and Random Fun

19650,Fun game to play while watching a stream or something. Can be played on mobile too.
19651,отличная замена шашкам
19652,Not usually the genre of games that I play but the PVP and offline game modes are well constructed. + I'm told to review this game so yeah...bye....
19653,nice game
19654,"Pros: Easy to get into quickly, an addictive gameplay formula, polished for a beta, the ability to craft a new strategy every game (and reinvent it when it fails horribly).

Cons: RNG will screw you sometimes, little/no mechanical skill expression, and the UI is clearly optimized for mobile, not PC.

I am a League of Legends veteran and have never played DOTA. Having tried Underlords and TFT, I prefer Underlords given the current state of both games (they may change substantially in the future; it's early yet)."
19655,this is just a epic game
19656,"it's autochess with quality of life improvements, don't expect balance or fun but it's fine I guess"
19657,Pretty chill game for those times you want to PVP a little slower.
19658,"Razoavel, mas ainda eh um jogo de sorte."
19659," everything seems good, but when can we see the battle history."
19660,"too cool, but it depends on your lucky"
19661,wow
19662,is cool i guess
19663,Kinda cool! The loot rounds are easier than in dota auto chess. I like it.
19664,"Very cools xD, I'm liking this over AutoChess"

19669,"This game has huge potential and the benefit of using the actual DOTA characters.
While I never got into the mod, I did play AutoChess for Mobile (and emulated on PC).
This is honestly a fun experience which I hope they expand on and tidy up."

19674,A solid Free to Play auto-battler
19675,nice mod
19676,Definitely not Auto chess
19677,"I WANT ARTIFACT UPDATE

wasting company money  on free game  and not do anything about artifact 
WE WANT UPDATE ON ARTIFACT  underlords FPS is 120   artifact  FPS in my labtop is 13    
we want to get item drop in dota with playing artifact we want item drop in artifact with playing dota

12/3/2019 :  waste of space and time"
19678,Great for falling asleep!
19679,asdf
19680,"If you have interest in trying out an Auto Chess game, give this a shot. It's solid."
19681,this game has a lot of potential
19682,Artifact died for this
19683,Amazing game that keeps getting better. Not the easiest to understand and has a lot of depth.
19684,Sometimes RNG is a determining factor for win or lose
19685,a great knock off of auto chess. i hope it gets attention and maintains a constant flow of updates and patches
19686,its a game
19687,"fun game some good qol changes from the DAC version, would still like to see a standalone version for pc."
19688,Good dota chess mod
19689,Its like most other semi afk mobile teamfight games
19690,"Pretty fun, easy to learn the basics."
19691,finally a chess that im finally good at
19692,"Personally, in the current state I think Underlords is the best Auto Chess out right now. 

The UI is nice and clean, the rounds make sense, items are not too complex and overpowered. Definitely a great way to learn how an Auto Chess game works."
19693,Very very good auto chess platform. Much better than the mod on dota 2. LOVE the mobile version
19694,"The game is good and have a better mechanism then the original auto chess; like guaranteed item, global item that boost synergies, etc.
But there's some deficiency at this game, like we can't see the overall synergies at enemies chess, and can't see what heroes enemy have without checking his chessboard.
8/10"
19695,"Having tried DOTA 2, I appreciate how easy this game is to get into. It is easy to learn and has a high skill cieling.
Would recommend."
19696,10/10 would chess again
19697,"Great game
"
19698,It's pretty fun
19699,"super simple, easy to pick up, hard to master"
19700,"repetitivo, partidas longas demais"
19701,Obligatory review for Steam Grand Prix
19702,Pretty good.
19703,Valve abandoned this game.
19704,"Far better than LoL copy of it, I hope it gets some nice new and shiny updates."
19705,"There are 3 main autobattlers.  Drodo's Autochess, Valve's Underlords, and Riot's Teamfight Tactics.  Drodo's Autochess, the originator of the genre, is primarily a mobile game now (unless you're playing Autochess through DOTA), but will see a release on the Epic Games Store soon.  Teamfight Tactics, by Riot Games, is plagued with bug after bug, and is missing key UI elements, along with an overall lack of balance (6 noble + Ashe + frozen mallet Vayne is unbeatable).  

In Underlords, I have yet to encounter a game-breaking bug on the level of the ones in TFT, and the units and spells feel relatively balanced with there not being any sort of single piece that can bring you back from 1 HP to winning (Kayle).  The main thing that Underlords changed from DAC is the way that items work.  Items are far less RNG-reliant due to you being given 3 item choices after every won PvE round.  Items can be moved from unit to unit, but cannot be combined or upgraded.  There is also the addition of global items, items that can do things ranging from insanely buffing specific comps to reducing the cost of units in the shop.  Pure luck in early item drops will not win you the game from the first PvE rounds, but it can determine how you play out the game.

Underlords is by far the most polished feeling autobattler we have available.  The UI isn't missing anything important, it looks good, items and units are relatively balanced, and there aren't any glaring issues.  If you enjoy autobattlers, I recommend that you pick this one up."
19706,it's good
19707,ok
19708,EXCELLENT IF A BIT CONFUSING FOR UNIT PLACEMENT
19709,10/10
19710,THAT FUN LA... Slark all flying everywhere. Warlock all that big like an ogre magi. Troll warlord all that fast throwing! Too funny la. You'll be an overlord when you play.... cottage fries la. :D
19711,"im just writing this for grandprix, but yea good game"
19712,"Fun game, but so much emphasis on RNG that it kind of renders most rounds pointless after a point, when someone gets such good RNG that it becomes almost impossible to topple them."
19713,Fun
19714,Corgi
19715,Fun game.
19716,"Pretty good, the UI makes the game much more playable."
19717,Pretty good.
19718,"As others have said, it is basically auto-chess.  If you like auto chess, give it a shot.  I personally prefer skill based games.  RNG is fun to watch and good when I'm feeling lazy, but for real gameplay, I'll look elsewhere."
19719,nice game
19720,thought i would hate it but between the pc and mobile version its taken most of my gaming time
19721,"Pretty good game, you don't even know how to play DOTA to get into this battle chess clone."
19722,Weird but ok
19723,Better than any auto chess games easy to play and understand.
19724,"ok first of all, this game CAN be very fun, if the rng is in your favor, but half the time i find myself never having the units i want/need for my current stratagy, and mos of the time its too late to change my stratagy, so i just end up loosing and not wanting to play anymore, so maybe if they implemented better mechanics that help give you similar units to the ones you currently have, the game would feel more.....balanced? i guess. just as of now i am really sick of never being able to upgrade, i havent had a a lvl 3 unit is like 10 games in a row now and im just sick of it, please fix that valve, still fun overall, that is just my main gripe."
19725,shits dope ya feel me?
19726,it okay :)
19727,1
19728,Gaem is EZ
19729,About as engaging as every other game released now days. Needs more Mario.
19730,"So this is a yes, for a very specific reason.

I can not play Dota 2 anymore because not only are my hands slower as I age... but I have little... mental hiccups.

I'll just pause for a moment while whatever thought that got stuck dies a lonely death.  So now I play against bots.... sure its not nearly the same but its enough to enjoy.  The Underlord bots are all I have ever played against... and it is certainly enough for me to recommend the game to anyone.

So... if you can not, or do not want to play together with people... by all means try this game anyways"
19731,"It's alright, bit boring but there's tactics to it"
19732,i like it
19733,great mix of rng and skill keeps the game inresting even after hours of play time always new thing to learn
19734,"i mean its autochess but made by valve.

at least its not leagues shitty version"
19735,.
19736,"Chess is a strategy game, and one of the oldest games in existence. Historians have determined that the first game of chess was played in the early 1980's on the Nintendo Entertainment System."
19737,still BETAh
19738,"Dota Underlord shows great potential in overthrowing Dota Auto Chess. I'm not a huge fan of the tablet/mobile design choices of the game, but considering how clunky Dota Auto Chess is this is certainly something I can live with and get used to.

Still not ready to move over to Dota Underlords but with the rating system in place I think it's just a matter of time."
19739,bestest
19740,Completely Meta driven not for me....Tutorial takes over an hour to complete for no good reason.
19741,iss pretty good mang
19742,"Fun but takes a lot of time to make a single game.
"
19743,"good as is, need more improvement on the interface"
19744,Haven't played many games like this before so my knowledge is limited but it has been surprisingly enjoyable.
19745,"Nice game to pass some time, still need some tweakings but overall its a fun game"
19746,"Pretty good! UI still needs some work, with some things being unclear, but the flow of the game is pretty good."
19747,"Dota 2 Auto-Chess with new features and better playability and interface. Definitely a good game to spend hours raging over needing 1 more unit for level 3. 10/10, would re roll again"
19748,TFT is better
19749,good game but needs more adjustment
19750,"best ""Auto-Chess"" game there is in the market. and its FREE!
mix and match different heroes and comps to make the perfect combo against the competition! 
having basic knowledge of dota heroes helps tremendously aswell."
19751,Simple mechanics with a surprising amount of depth. Less rage inducing than it's MOBA counterpart and certainly far superior to Artifact.
19752,"Good game, DOTA is always a good game."
19753,"RNG yes, but you can manage it easy with skill and good coordination. Great for every strategy gamer. But the game needs more features and game modes, ranks, etc."
19754,Chess for intellectuals.. sehr gut ahh
19755,Love it! UI is so much better than TFT.
19756,very nice
19757,"- innovative 
- fun game

It still requires a lot of work."
19758,Why play the game when you can just stand in the corner
19759,meh
19760,Highly addictive. DO NOT TOUCH IT!
19761,blablabla
19762,better than TfT by a mile
19763,"Great Free Game, Needed to review one for this sale and happy it was this one."
19764,"After spending hours in the Dota 2 mod of Dota Autochess, this valve version feels empty, as there is no incentive to keep playing the game. However, what i do like about this game is that it has controlled RNG, in which the player can pick and choose their item throughout the neutral rounds, in which makes the user focus into the item builds and how effective they are. After playing the Dota Autochess, Team Fight Tactics and Dota Underlords. I would rate them like this;
1. Dota AutoChess
2.Team Fight Tactics
3.Dota Underlords"
19765,meh
19766,"It's a nice game. But it takes a lot of time

so play it if you have A LOT OF TIME to spare"
19767,"If you like randomness / luck, this game is for you. The concept is awesome, but god damn RNG ruins everything to me. it's incredibly frustrating to be at round 25 with people already owning a few lvl 3 champs while you struggle to get yours to lvl 2 because the god damn game insist on giving you alliances that you currently DON'T PURSUE.

Damn I can't stand luck bases game."
19768,"for auto chess player fans. still needs some polish, but its solid little game."
19769,"Дисбаланс, рнг и трата времени."
19770,Waiting for some fun things like silly hats. Phone game with better graphics
19771,Good UI
19772,"Pretty solid as a standalone game.

Horrible for people coming from the original Dota Autochess since you can smell that this was a mobile port.

Anyway, not as bad since the mechanics work well.

6/10 for me"
19773,Better auto-chess so far even if its copied by its own game :)))
19774,Its Auto Chess
19775,"So much fun! Great way to pass time on PC or mobile device. Really great layout, lots of unique strategies, and interesting characters."
19776,Big fan lots of fun
19777,Just doing this review for the sale thingy. Game didn't even start on Linux though.
19778,Good game for burning time
19779,"goocha

19782,great on mobile and pc
19783,Banana power. :D
19784,Annoying
19785,"""Rng hates me"""
19786,"Frequent updates and communication from Valve is a rarity, and it's nice while it lasts."
19787,"pretty cool, but we need a pass soon and costumization!"
19788,"Really addictive, fun mechanics, enjoyable time"
19789,"Very addicting, plus you can play it on your phone."
19790,Definitely not addicted
19791,"pretty fun
i enjoy knights and mages :)"
19792,POG 9/10
19793,what a nice game with hacks
19794,Hat viel Potential. Meiner Meinung nach ein guter Remake des Originals. Bin gespannt auf Season1!
19795,"I just wanted the steam check box so I could further serve team corgi.

Game is good its free what else can you say."
19796,auto chess genre is opopie!!
19797,tis pretty fun ig
19798,"Even as someone who was never really invested in DOTA's world and lore, the game was super easy to pick up, is very fun, and the cross platform support is amazing. High hopes for the future development of this game."
19799,Not so fast but fun game
19800,Copy of AutoChess Mod but good.  We will see who wins.
19801,Good Initiative and more relaxing than its parent Dota 2.
19802,Tons of fun!!!!!

19828,Good game
19829,Devs care about this game. Constant updates and upgrades. 5/5
19830,Fun. Can wait to see new features added.
19831,Seems good
19832,Okay so far.
19833,4Head i guess
19834,good
19835,A fun game that will waste your life and you will enjoy every minute of it
19836,good
19837,"Really enjoying it so far, medium to steep learning curve imo"
19838,yee boi
19839,addict
19840,"Cool game even though it's still the beta, has a lot of potential.
Requires skill, but also quite a bit of luck.
Nice to come back to all the different loveable heroes :)"
19841,Thumbs up!!
19842,!
19843,good
19844,XD
19845,graphic su**s
19846,"Fun if you like this kind of game, definitely worth a shot."
19847,Game is SO clunky and doesn't even launch 50% of the time.
19848,"Great concept! Valve really making a lot of effort to keep it on par with other Auto Chess games that existed.

Even in beta is already playable and quite enjoyable!
"
19849,Depend on luck 100% not really fun.Feel like stupid
19850,awesome game
19851,Is good
19852,"got 2x brawler item , didnt get brawler units untill round 14 10/10 would smash keyboard again"
19853,Good kill time
19854,Simple and enjoyable.
19855,Very easy game to pick up on.
19856,very fun game
19857,Spin off
19858,"Just here for the grand prix!

But seriously, this game is pretty fun :)"
19859,i'm gonna play this on my phone.
19860,"Decent improvement on the original Auto Chess. 
Changes to traits and skills are mostly good, less random item acquisition helps to get over having bad early picks.
Definitely a visual improvement thanks to much better animations."
19861,"It is lacking that ""je ne sais quoi"" from dota autochess, most likely because of the camera angle as well as the lack of skins for various levels of units.

That being said, performance is through the roof compared to dota autochess.

I'd like to mention that the UI is quite cluttered and could use being streamlined."
19862,Fun but too long
19863,very nice game good grapix
19864,"In comparison to the original Auto Chess it has lost a little bit of flair. I think there is huge potential in it to become even better than just the Dota Workshop game. It depends on Valve, how much time spend in the game and how much they listen to the community."
19865,RIP Artifact
19866,fun and better then the mod
19867,jorj bertyray me
19868,mantul
19869,valve did it the best change my mind
19870,9/10
19871,"Too dependent on RNG tbh, but its fun."
19872,Fun game
19873,"its like chess but not

"
19874,really good game for a bog fag would recoment
19875,"It lacks lootboxes and microtransactions to be a modern game.
No progression either. But thegame itself is fun."
19876,Fine
19877,ResidentSleeper
19878,Ok.
19879,clean and fun game...hope to get more update
19880,Easy to learn and hard to master. Fun anyway :)
19881,"Valve's addictive standalone version of Auto-Chess; the most approachable top-tier auto-battler, with killer PvP and an extensive City Crawl campaign mode with puzzles, challenges, and street fights.

19883,tft is better lol
19884,nice game
19885,"A true Pepega game, addictive even though i keep losing, remember to not roll because you will NOT get the heroes you want. F this game to be honest."
19886,A perfect drafting game for people who like multiplayer games but absolutely hate being social in any possible way. Kept updated regularly and the Devs show passion in working to make this game the best Auto Chess variant.
19887,Enjoyable and ability to play on mobile is a big bonus.
19888,"cool game, good time waster"
19889,"Thank you Gaben, Very Cool!"
19890,It's fun and addicting
19891,Nhân phẩm kém
19892,fun. Feels like the original DOTA Autochess
19893,A nice improvement on the auto chess custom gamemode.
19894,It's a dead game.
19895,"very good game very gud valve pls do more games i miss u xoxo

Onto a serious review though, the game is pretty solid. The item mechanics are pretty unique compared to the other Autochess games(as is with each one of them), and the game plays solidly, asides from some bugs that will probally be patched soon.

On that note: valve pls fix assasin ai thx"
19896,its nice game to try and play with all your friends :3
19897,"I like underlords but I feel like I've ran out of things to do with the game and its repetitivness, I am a person who doesnt like rng but i can appreciate it because its in a quantity where i feel like my choices in the game matter, otherwise I think it a well adapted version of the DOTA autochess game."
19898,Pretty cool...
19899,Not really chess
19900,It is a good game for value to finally release something new in the last couple years! I enjoy this game and cant wait to see what come from it!
19901,"A good Auto-Chess (especially with the limitation of only one item per champion, to avoid OP combo); it has still some network issues on iPad, but otherwise a fun game."
19902,"This is my favorite of the current auto chess versions that are available. The interface and the play at your own pace bot games are what sets this one apart in my opinion. All presented information is concise, complete and intuitive. The graphics are smooth and detailed but this probably wasn't a hard feat to accomplish since the sprites were readily available.
I like that I can pick up and play even if I don't have a lot of time because of the play at your own pace option in the bot games. This is the only one I know of that has this option. I think in the long run the limited time in matches is part of the challenge of the game but it's nice to have this relaxed version to learn with or simply play in short bursts here or there.
Games like this can have a steep learning curve especially if you are not used to draft style games. It is worth mentioning that if you don't have patience with this type of learning curve this game may not be for you. I am not terribly good at it at this point but I am finding learning and trying new things enjoyable. 
I do think that some of the synergies need some work to be balanced and the game might even benefit from a few more character additions.  I'm interested to see if there will be limited synergy game modes and such in the future.  It could also really use an exit button as I'm not a fan of alt +F4 to shut down the game.
All things considered though this is pretty well polished and definitely worth checking out."
19903,Now its so ez to play and low q time.
19904,IT SUCKS
19905,"Addictive, stahp now while youre ahead"
19906,"Good addition of mini game, good concept and a better version of Dota Auto Chess!"
19907,there is no tactic mactic bam bum bom
19908,"Отличная игрушка, когда хочется отдохнуть от динамичных игр"
19909,"First autochess game for me, easy to pickup and addicting"
19910,fun but looks like a mobile game
19911,PÓKI CO JEST OK
19912,Abandoned game.
19913,"Good game, awesome if playing with friends.

Needs some tweaks and extras to become addictive but overall nice neutral fun. Can be played without 100% focus."
19914,I am enjoying this game so much.
19915,Copy of Teamfight Tactics
19916,"Its a fun game, but relies entirely on what you are randomly given in the buy  phase."
19917,10/10
19918,"Vast improvement on the Dota2 mod, with better controls, visuals, and a much more elegant item system. Cross play on mobile is the icing on an already delicious cake."
19919,is ok
19920,this is a great game i have been switching back and forth between tft and underlords and find that all the changes being made are making it more challanging and fun and or comperable.
19921,More bullshit dota
19922,s grood
19923,Fera demais
19924,"Cleaner controls compared to the dota 2 mod, but also has some good changes here and there to items and UI design. It's free to play so defs reccomend"
19925,"So, this game is not for me, but overall i would recommend it.

+ Its free
+ It helps, but you don't really need to be dota player to master this game
+ Noone has any advantage over you other than skill as all is random

- Its all RANDOM (although i admit, that with experience you are probably able to work with this random better and better)
- The game drops from time to time both in mobile and PC version, but hey, its early access, i belive they will fix this
- This is purely personal as i got little kid - games are too long with no way to pause."
19926,not that good. very boring game. stop building this game dev. you are wasting time.
19927,.
19928,Good
19929,"Good game, let's hope the devs don't abandon it like Artifact"
19930,GAME HAY LAM DU MA MAY
19931,"Well, I like this game BUT it's nothing for me a game takes like 40 Minutes...

if u don't mind its fun, u upgrade your heroes and place them, fight happens automatic, ""auto chess""

"
19932,Great game i like it!
19933,"nice game
"
19934,Tidehunter
19935,"Between LoL's TFT, Auto Chess/DOTA2 Auto Chess, and this, I personally feel like this is the most fleshed out. All of the auto battler games out right now are pretty solid, but this game just does the loot system so well. Having a good team comp but not getting any items? That doesn't happen in Underlords. On top of having guaranteed items, there are also passive effects to choose from, which can really make or break team comps, especially early on. I also really like the fact that you can drag and drop an item onto another unit, so it's not a hard commitment to throw an item on a unit early. There's no item combining either, which I both like and dislike. Overall, this game definitely feels more fair, but we'll see what the other auto battlers do to compete."
19936,Highly addictive game with not a lot of substance to really justify it. One of the few games where you will often sit there knowing full well you are wasting time.
19937,Cooool Game
19938,The Dota Autochess Remake looks amazing.
19939,Much better than TFT
19940,I had fun! 5/7
19941,its ok
19942,"nice..
good game ..
good update"
19943,beleza
19944,"Fun auto chess, need better party system"
19945,"Already a very good standalone auto chess game despite the beta status.
Much better usability than the custom map and a better item distribution system.
Fast loading times combined with short queue times gets you into a game very quick.
Looking forward to the balance updates and new features coming in the next weeks.
"
19946,gud
19947,"It's autochess, and I'd really recommend checking it out on mobile."
19948,"It's addicting as fuck and I might be consumed in an Auto Chess hole that no one gets out of.

If you lose: The games are long, but they play fast. You can search another game right? It's all RNG, anyways, I'll get lucky.
If you win: Well, time to find a win again. I'm really good at the game."
19949,Its funny
19950,It was interesting at first but then it becomes somewhat boring.
19951,riot on suicide watch
19952,123
19953,"A decent adaptation to the DOTA2 Auto-Chess mod. Biggest problem is that the map is focused on your own field and thus lacks that worldly appeal the original game had. Units are different, but that's okay. Due to you not seeing other players' boards, the game can feel a bit too slow.

Overall i like the adaptations, 9/10"
19954,"This game is cool,but truly to say i'd prefer to play League of Legend's Auto Chess Called ''Team Fight Tactics'' or just play from Google Play Store, ''Auto Chess'' They look more interesting than cartoon Comix one."
19955,is still gud.
19956,Easy to learn if you've played auto chess before. They made slight changes to how synergies and income works but nothing too wild. If you're looking to waste 20-40 minutes per game be it PC or mobile then this is the game for you.

19967,"Pretty great game, lots of potential."
19968,Got sucked into 4 hours of Youtube tutorials for how to level up my cards. Surprising amount of depth in this game while remaining fun for a casual player.
19969,"Pretty good, i like the fact that you can play solo against bots, good time sink and pretty deep strategies."
19970,sometime games longer than expect
19971,Am bad at chess
19972,Nice game
19973,I like it so far. It needs some improvements though to actually compete with other Autochess clones in the future. Sometimes I feel like I'm playing a singleplayer game. The map isn't appealing. Balancing could be better.
19974,Leider nicht wie die mod :-( wird wohl leider tft gewinnen. Trotzdem ganz okay item system gefällt mir sehr
19975,Its a copy of league TFT with dota heroes 10/10
19976,All the frustration of Dota with none of the teammates.

19994,"Very well optimized for the PC.  Very poorly optimized for mobile atm (7/4/3029)
Is quite fun but feels much more unbalanced than the original auto chess.

Also wish there was a way to play a shorter version, as if you go late game it will take 30min+"
19995,P-retty good

20005,its fun i love it
20006,Definitely needs some kind of sustainability; most people will probably burn out of this game relatively quickly unless it is updated very consistently
20007,Use tiny with warrior build 100% easy win (BROKENGAME)
20008,good
20009,"This still on early access so there are it major improvements that can happen but despite that it's super fun and addictive.

PROS:
It's super fun once you get the hang of it.

Joining to a game is a breeze. You can jump into a game in under 10s or 30 max unlike Team Fight which takes 30 MINUTES

UI is great everything is working and intuitive

Has decent amount of RNG YES THAT'S a PRO for me. No longer are you playing with same hero(s) with same tactics(jungling or rushing to build an item) over gain this forces you to adapt and learn the game. And once you do learn RNG will still matter but not so much. 

CONS
still early access so the graphics look ugly on PC(hopefully get updated)

Hard learning curve, there's a lot of stuff going on. You'll probably need to watch some tutorials or pro players streaming.

Most sounds are missing(probably change in updates)

Takes a decent amount of your free time like a single match can go for 45 mins."
20010,This game is great!
20011,Wowie it's like chess with less thinking
20012,"I just started playing this game out of curiousity from watching my brothers play and I'm hooked. There's a lot of strategizing involved in this game; from choose which pieces to go with, which synergies to focus on, to managing finances, positioning of the pieces, and choosing the right items to equip. It's a little more complicated than just placing your pieces on the board.
There's still a ton of room for improvement but even as it is now it's already very fun and challenging. I'm excited what else they can add to the game to make it even more interesting.

I don't really play DotA and I'm not very familiar with the characters but it didn't really matter when I started playing with my brothers who have played DotA almost every day."
20013,10/10
20014,good good good
20015,good
20016,"I played a decent amount of rounds in the Dota 2 Mod ""Auto Chess"" and really liked it.
However, as it was a third party mod, it did have some flaws and bugs - Underlords feels like a more polished and professional alternative.

It's a really relaxing and fun strategy game and they also integrated a nice leveling system."
20017,"It's free to play.

Buggy, clunky, unfinished. 

Fun if you have a lot of time to spend hoping you get lucky."

20037,"Feels like a mobile game. The item system is much better than autochess, though overall autochess is better."
20038,"I can see why people enjoy this game - I'm not one of those people, though. 

RNG is king here, if you're not getting good rolls on draft then there's only so much you can do to turn the tides.

Good polish, clearly will be coming out for mobile platforms soon - play if you like competitive games, but avoid if you think skill should be what decides winners / losers."
20039,Great and Addicting...this is what ARTIFACT should be
20040,NIce and easy!
20041,"while this game is still under dev, this looks promising"
20042,demonlar çok op olmuş
20043,"Good game. The character model is taken from the original Dota2 characters, my suggestion is to add a sharing skin from Dota2, so that it can be applied to Dota Underlords. It would be amazing to see the Planetfall - Earthshaker Arcana at Dota Underlords. Like this comment, if you agree with me."
20044,Топ гей м если ты удод

20056,Not bad....
20057,fun game just some times u need luck and some more informations than someone who never played it but fun
20058,Very nice game ;)
20059,Little slow to play
20060,pretty decent
20061,Not sure I like this one more than the Dota 2 Auto chess. Item system being able to choose what you get and move them around as you please seems over powered with no draw back.
20062,RNG <3
20063,good game
20064,"Bad Graphics UI Design. Really confusing and preventing most things that I want to do in a short time.

The bad UI is basically the most important thing in the Auto-Chess genre since you'll need accurate information to know what to do, how to win, and why you win/lose a round. Yet these informations are mostly locked behind menus that don't even need to exist in the first place.

Fix your UI"
20065,I enjoy.
20066,nice game
20067,MANTAP
20068,"Defenitely a great autochess game. Very optimised ( like all games with Source Engine do ). Great graphics. Very satisfying if you know how to play the game. Really addicting ( I mean a game takes around 20-40 mins but I have finished so many games without even realizing it ). It's still early access so it's lacking balance and in-depth tutorials but if you manage to understand the basics and then spend time playing the game, you will know how to use alliances combos and stuff. Again, very satisfying if you know how the game works! Props to Valve, since this is also a free game like Dota 2."
20069,fun game
20070,Most polished version of AutoChess available.
20071,"Good Autobattler, less RNG needed than TFT needs. This is the best Autobattler for me."

20075,This game is trash
20076,Good chess game with Dota 2 Layout
20077,Great strategy game. I'm playing on both on my PC and iPhone. Great to kill time during waiting or boring events. Hope to see more interesting updates and patches to come. The game is a little buggy at this stage but it's okay.
20078,Fun. But the interface could be a lot more beginner friendly
20079,"Hey thats pretty good... 

and the devs are adding units...

THATS PRETTY GOOD"

20090,"fun and smart
a great way to kill time

update: still fun to play, now has 10 minutes turbo mode"

20111,wowie!
20112,"This is a really well crafted and thought through game. I am having a lot of fun with it but the matches tend to take some time, especially when you are a better player and always come out top 3 :P

love the ideas and how you get excited when theres 2 or 3 of the same characters for sell. a little heavy on the RNG side though."
20113,PLZ GIVE ME GOOD RNG

20115,Pretty clever item system. I prefer playing on my phone than on PC.

20130,Good game high hopes
20131,"Dota Underlords is Valve's take on the Autochess genre. It does a lot the same as Autochess and those who played Autochess will likely pick up this game very fast, as the characters and buffs are roughly the same. Its item balance is a lot better than the other games in the genre, as everyone can pick up the same amount of items and they can't combine, limiting it from getting out of hand. The game is balanced well for as far as I know, but it does seem that going all in for 1 synergy is the way to go, which does limit the creativity. All in all enjoyable, but not a lot of risks were taken either."
20132,so cooooooooooooooool
20133,gl & hf!

20139,Fun times! Though a bit less RNG would be appreciated.
20140,"While fun to play at first, I got tired of the game (much in the same way as Heartstone) for the RNG and for what it takes to get better at it. Forget figuring things out, go online and find what is the best strategy in the current patch."
20141,"Not bad, autochess with more bugs and better graphics. 
Wait and see after 5 years of beta, like dota2"
20142,It's pretty good!

I hope they keep on adding many more different classes and other stuff so the game does not become stale."
20167,Another perfectly imbalanced Dota title filled with bugs.
20168,Pretty goood
20169,"Great game that is even better with friends. Its just one of those games that takes you back to those nights way back, when you would stay up and play games at someones house till morning. Good Job modding community for bringing games like these to the surface."
20170,"Nice game, has a lot of depth."
20171,A very nice game with an intense storyline expaning upon the already great heroes of the Dota Universe!
20172,Very cool game. I can't for it to be fully launched and have the whole game balanced. I love the idea of being able to select items after each loot round. It's pretty neat and a good adaption of the Dota Auto Chess mod.
20173,"ehhhhh.
still need more works on."

20190,"It's free and seemed like the best choice to play in between other activities. There's enough choices to make gameplay wise that doesn't bog you down to fully commit your attention to it. Nice time cruncher. Game Rounds take too long though but that's up to personal preference. Play it if you're bored, it'll keep you entertained for the most part for a few hours or so depending on how much time you have to spare."
20191,"First experience with auto chess, really enjoying it.
"
20192,kong ming empty fort best strat
20193,"very good game in my opinion.
when I am bored playing honestly this game can improve the mind of what the next step is. This theme is almost like chess but has a random attack pattern, very extraordinary outside. Increasing the Hero / character and also the initial loading game I think is too fast."
20194,jesus
20195,"fun game, both this one and TFT have things better that the other doesnt have, if you like the genre give it a try"
20196,asdsad
20197,Great game to play if you want a chilled game. Definitely tactical but one you have the basics down its all down to practice. Plus it's FREE.
20198,"God this is truly addictive,This is such a step up from Dota Chess and it is so much easier to understand and learn,Free and early access can only get better."
20199,Pretty shite game
20200,Good game!
20201,A worse version of autochess (but with easier matchmaking).
20202,yes
20203,the best strategy game I've ever played
20204,"great,"
20205,"This game is good, but i liked the original minigame. Some of the fun in the game was to walk around with the donkey, or other animals that you had. But that is not a thing anymor in this game. I hope it will get in this game after a while. But if you look away from that. This game is great."
20206,kkK
20207,Via Phone...
20208,The game is great
20209,This is my first and only auto chess-type game so I can't really compare it to the other ones that are currently out but I found this interesting and definitely worth a download to at least try it.
20210,its ok.

20216,"Honestly, simply amazing. Any fan of strategy has to give this a go. It does have a steep learning curve, but the options are limitless, and it really racks your brain."

20222,A good method of engaging in gambling fallacy rabbit holes without the impending bankruptcy.
20223,"Definitely needs work, but fast load times and uncomplicated friend mechanics make it better than the mod"
20224,nice game
20225,"You might be inclined to think this is a copy/clone of the original Dota 2 Auto Chess mod, and while the heroes are pretty much the same, there is enough differences to allow this to be its own game. So much for all the work put into Artifact and this game is vastly more popular.

UI is kinda awkward to use in the sense that when you open the shop, it hides the whole UI on the left side (leaderboard/champion info) so you cannot view both at the same time. Quality of life features that are much appreciated include Auto-combine/upgrading, indicators in shop showing you how many of an alliance you have to get a particular buff (eg: +15% attack to 3 Savages)."
20226,good game
20227,best chess
20228,Very addictive. Better than the dota mod (less RNG).

The new voicelines for some characters are fun, EXCEPT FOR QUEEN OF PAIN. She needs to shut the heck up, oh my god."

20256,Better UI than its competitors. Still an RNG fest.
20257,"Very clean and fun upgrade for DAC fans.  The graphics are outstanding and matches well with the Dota theme.  
It also has a great tutorial and slower pace mode for those learning the genre, items are clearly explained for players not used to what each item upgrade would do.  Excellent Valve addition!!"

20297,big gay
20298,Very good very fun :)
20299,RNG simulator ez
20300,It's not a game for 2019 in my opinion.
20301,+
20302,no
20303,"The game got incredibly balanced as of now. Huge efforts from the developers to provide updates regularly.

Duos is super fun."
20304,"Simple game
Easy to learn the concept 
Challenging since its RNG which can be a win or a lose it just depends on your luck"
20305,Very nice game.
20306,yes
20307,Good game
20308,gg
20309,This game is very easy.
20310,Fun
20311,"Good alternative to autochess, still lacks balancing issues"
20312,Easy to play hard to learn all the things.
20313,A well made Valve game in 2019. Huh.
20314,"Very gun game, worth a try. If u want to chill and have some fun"
20315,good game
20316,h
20317,NICE
20318,A lovly game and a job well done by valve.
20319,Great game!
20320,Very simple and casual game. Games can take time to complete compared to other casual based games but doesnt require to much interaction. Has mobile and PC crossplatform play. Very fun and addicting great for playing when trying to avoid the family or when ya on the pooper.
20321,goog game
20322,chill game for a casual day if you're bored and the fun thing is you can play it on your phone with your steam account Thank you valve for this feature.
20323,everything about this game is great in almost every aspect but the only problem I have with it is how long the games last.
20324,Pretty nice game
20325,very cool game with dota2 experience !@
20326,good
20327,"better than csgo to be exact







no honestly this is better than csgo no lie"
20328,Its unbalanced need more work. but overall good start
20329,It's okay I guess
20330,"Well they should work on the sound effects most. Also need to add new variations like ""god"" in autochess. Overall it is quite entertaining game."
20331,Best Auto Chess version out there.
20332,เอามาปรับใหม่จาก autochess เพลินมาก เล่นบนมือถือได้อีก
20333,wp
20334,somehow okay
20335,RNG :(

edit: bruh. i love it"
20341,Battle pass in beta-version
20342,k
20343,Autochess...not much different than others. if you like strategic pvp battles  with RNG...this is your thing
20344,UNDERRATED
20345,"Nice game,recomended"
20346,I haven't played for a long time cause I suck at the game
20347,ok
20348,Very good strategies game from a mod to a new game like this!
20349,I cant play this game since im using a 32Bit 3in1 PC. So sad that 32Bit is not supported since you have many great programmer.
20350,good rng simulator but not better than tf2s autobalance.
20351,Dota autochess or as the standalone has been called Dota Underlords has easily become one of my all time favorite games
20352,"First time playing this type of game; I'm really mostly into solo simulations. It's a lot more fun and much less stressful than I expected it to be. It helps that there's no direct interaction with other players, and that it's (so far) free of payment mechanics. I was just going to try it out - being free and all - and suddenly I have 28 hours in the game... Even if you're not into online multiplayer games or any kind of real-time gaming this is well worth taking a look."
20353,This game is good to your's brain
20354,"Never played Dota but nevertheless having fun, played for almost 4 hours on my first session"
20355,11/10
20356,Game is hard
20357,many wow
20358,Addicted as hell
20359,Was a solid start. Now seems to be abandoned. Don't waste your time. Shame.
20360,"Good, low stress way to get a taste for dota tactics with more time to think and plan but a whole lot more dependent on random luck."
20361,"nice
edit: nice"
20362,"too much rng
good"
20363,Chilled game for when you're relaxing or on discord with the homies
20364,"Unbalanced, triggering, yet lagging and so addictive"
20365,pretty nice and the devs are rly active
20366,Really great game 10/10
20367,"Yo
Pst
Yo
10/10"
20368,"It's Auto Chess, it's good"
20369,IMHO Best Auto Chess available
20370,Aight.
20371,cool
20372,"Even though I don't play any Dota games, and I have no idea what I'm doing this game is still a lot of fun."
20373,GGWP
20374,perfect for strats
20375,legal
20376,gg
20377,tft is more interesting
20378,"if u like dota autochess u will like this one too
its like upgrade from dota autochess but more tactic"
20379,Played on my phone it drained 20% of my battery and by the end it was very hot. Played on a Samsung S9
20380,nc game
20381,The best Standalone version of the Autochess Mod in Dota 2. With a unique twist to the items it has a better system than the original mod. Would recommend!
20382,"Nice game, nice concept"
20383,Good Game :)
20384,"Not bad, even the concept is similar with auto chess but it's in a more familiar way for the dota player as the skills and items are related. With the new concept of getting item and buff is a new idea as well !"
20385,this shit good
20386,nice
20387,needs improvement still good tho 8/10
20388,Very good game
20389,"Needs some improvement, but overall looks great."
20390,Needs to get balanced and explain the hidden features.
20391,Noob
20392,It's basically autochess but more polished. Valve have lots of plans for the future of this game and no doubt will be adding more content soon
20393,"Nicely made
"
20394,great game sometimes a struggle but awesome!!!!!
20395,"Its good. Better than teamfight tactics, sack them copycats"
20396,RNG hates me!
20397,way too long matches
20398,Love it
20399,"With constant communication from Valve, the Open Beta going very smoothly, Minimal bugs and Balance changes being made every day, this game looks to be very good."
20400,"Reminds me of War3 custom games, would recommend."
20401,"Its fun, once you get the hang of it. It takes a bit of practice to actually become good in it so dont get upset if you lose a couple of matches!"
20402,Loving the random aspect of the game. Makes you try out different builds
20403,FREE
20404,"This is a very polished autochess game. It's pretty easy to pick up, bots are decent for learning with and trying out new strats, and the visuals are fantastic in my opinion. I also love being able to play away from my computer on my phone.

Hopefully the ""Battle Chest"" system they are about to add will be reasonably priced and contain worth while content."
20405,"The RNG is strong in this game.  It makes strategy difficult because if you can't get that one last duplicate, you're stuck with a severely stunted comp.  Fun, but if you're super competitive, this will likely be a frustrating game."
20406,gut
20407,"8/8 mate, would wash out in 8th again"
20408,"This game is fun to play.
Nice small size strategy game.
which is fun to play.
once you understand its mechanics it gets addictive.



This review I am writing after playing the mobile version of this game.
This game is the stepping stone of Auto chess version of any game across the globe.
The gameplay is unique and brilliantly planned.


If you are thinking of playing this game for it.
It will take some time to understand but once you understand its simple mechanics you will love it and 
Yes!!!this game is suitable for all ages."
20409,In a playable stage but still need some balance works
20410,Dota 3 confirmed.
20411,Peak of autochess!
20412,"Need few changes, overall its fun to play."
20413,"Decent start with lots of potential. I see great things for this as it is already fixing a lot of the issues that other ""Auto-Chess"" games have (items drops, clarity of UI, optimization, etc.)."
20414,"its alright, not really a fan. but its free soo yeah you arnt loosing much. just give it a try"
20415,"The auto chess format is a fun and casual stategy experience and Dota Underlords does it well. In its current early access state the game is a bit unpolished and rough, but the base game is there and it is good."
20416,better than mobile lejen
20417,nice
20418,best game
20419,s h i t g a e m
20420,mantap anying!
20421,Best autochess rn
20422,Very unique game
20423,ANJAY MANTEP JIWA GAME NYA BRO!
20424,gg
20425,very yes
20426,Very fun and way promising for the autochess genre!
20427,It is great take on Auto Chess mod from Dota2 with reducet item RNG by letting you chosse one of 3 items/buffs after beating neutrals so all players have same number of items or buffs (witch items you get offered is RNG so you can still get bad ones). There are few different/new pawns compare to Auto Chess mod and some synergies have bit different efect or requirement to work properly in your composition (mostly based on positioning). Overall it's really fun to play and exploid new strategies and good alternative to Auto Chess or TFT.
20428,great game
20429,niceeeee
20430,Better version of Dota Auto Chess
20431,Nice game
20432,good game still learning how to play
20433,"Great Game, Much room for improvement tho!"
20434,Currently better than the League of Legends' Teamfight Tactics. A lot more polished and what not. Only problem I've really had is there's pretty much one go to alliance and if you don't have them in your build somewhere you're getting dumpstered.
20435,"Needs better UI, but gameplay wise it's really fun to play."
20436,dmc2 is good game
20437,I love to play this game with my friends
20438,шашки
20439,Its fine... wish there were more content
20440,"A great version of the newly popularized genre of ""Auto-Chess"" games :)"
20441,"The UI is a little weird, but its able to be played on mobile which is a plus."
20442,at least it's free
20443,Its fun but takes a lot of time to learn.
20444,"Simple to play and hard to master.
How a good strategy game should be.

There is RNG, but the multiple layers of choices reduces the impact of the RNG

- You need to play around Synergies of your classes
- Synergies between heros 
- Best items to pick according to your composition, or what heroes to pick according to your items
- Economy
- What are the enemy compositions and how that affects or counter your own
- And finally unit placement 


Plus its a match for 8 players, which allows for the luck factor to not be as impactfull. 
Top 4 win, last 4 lose.

I highly recommend"
20445,Meh
20446,GREAT
20447,cool
20448,beri naice indeed
20449,my rng sucks
20450,"After just downloading the game and trying it once, it's quickly become my ""Go-To-Game"" when i just want to kill some time. An excellent game!"
20451,Auto Chess ripoff.
20452,It's a great game.
20453,RIP Artifact  :)
20454,"Smoother then the mod but Valve has introduce more RNG into the game by taking certain passives from classes/races and turning them into drops.

Its a fun game overall but the original mod still feels more fun (for me). The match making in Underlords is SO much better. Match making in Dota 2 is a grind in it self, you should be given levels sticking through the horrible lobby system.

I would give this game an undecided vote but steam doesn't let you. Overall I dislike the gameplay (currently*) more then I like the quality of life improvements Valve has added to the game. The mobile game is better IMO (currently*)."
20455,cool
20456,plot is very nice
20457,.
20458,"I played all versions of autochess available today, this is the worst version. My main complain - Valve tries to appeal for new audience, not familiar with original mod, everything simplified (interface, item system, even synergies.) 
+ it's not a pc game, it's port from mobile..."
20459,Nice
20460,ggg
20461,iy bgs
20462,fun shit
20463,very fun in the sun
20464,"pretty much just depends on luck, if you get good heros and manage to keep getting them to upgrade the said heros you win. if not your screwed and will probably get done in by the others around round 30."
20465,promising game
20466,It's fun
20467,great auto chess game
20468,So good and little unbalance
20469,"Compared to other auto chess games, this is right now the definitive version. Both mobile and PC versions. Easy, intuitive and informative UI. Nothing is hidden from the player besides the strategy. Unlike other games where item builds or background bonuses are difficult to find/do not exist in game.

"
20470,Happy to play it on mobile!!
20471,great game!
20472,Nice game
20473,Best autochess
20474,Great for dota fans
20475,Yo!
20476,"kinda fun.
"
20477,bretty good
20478,"A good and relatively easy to grasp concept with a lot of depth, but each game takes an insanely long time to either win or lose, and you just get really bored of it before it's even halfway through."
20479,"League of Legends one is better, ahh jk"
20480,bad
20481,gitgud
20482,It's like DOTA arcade autochess but easier to play
20483,good game
20484,wish this was Artifact.
20485,good game but sometimes any some bug
20486,fun game but they could add more less randomess to it maybe talent tree or catch up system is game is not going well and more more more more heroes
20487,good
20488,"very good game, it's a lot of fun
can't wait battle pass for this game."
20489,"AutoChess!!!

What else do you need."
20490,good
20491,"The best autochess I've played. Try it, it's free."
20492,"Great auto chess experience. No skills need apply, just luck."
20493,A really easy game to play but really hard to master
20494,bruh
20495,What do you expect
20496,fun game yes
20497,<333
20498,"League is better
"
20499,nice to waste time
20500,"
I can play dota on mobile :')"
20501,So far so good. Valve touch makes auto chess gameplay even better.
20502,"A solid little port of autochess. Not the best, not the worst. Solid."
20503,Great execution on this stand alone title. There is still work to do for example on the mobile UI.
20504,kkool
20505,"Finally i can play it, thanks Dev"
20506,The game is interesting at its core but the visual clutter and odd controls make it hard to reccomend right now. You also cannot queue up with friends for casual matches.
20507,"Good shit. Still Improving. Promising game, hopefully devs do more good stuffs in the future."
20508,"really good upgrade from auto chess, good place to start and heaps of room to grow, would recommend this to anyone"
20509,Cool game
20510,10/10
20511,Very fun and addicting game. It's cool to try and make the most powerful comp and I like how you match in rounds with many other people at the same time.
20512,10/10
20513,yeet
20514,its what you think it is.
20515,gg
20516,"Its free

Its simple to learn, difficult to master"
20517,The stole this great game and made it better
20518,Good
20519,nice game bruh
20520,"Very fun but also very vanilla in its current, in development phase. There is not much different in this game as opposed to the DOTA2 mod; mostly quality of life cleanliness.
Has potential. Hopefully it will develop further due to outside competition from Riot's TFT."
20521,the original auto chess is way better
20522,YO !
20523,.
20524,good game.
20525,Good Game
20526,Happy to see Valve doing something differently from Drodo Team and make an even better game than AutoChess
20527,big gay
20528,Wow! Amazing post. Thanks for sharing.
20529,Good one
20530,"Very nice game that i played in awhil, very RNG favor but also strategic as well"
20531,fun fun
20532,Mantab
20533,"It is fun, that's for sure, but there is simply better out there. It was cool to have a separate game for this though."
20534,Spent thousands of coins just to get a level 3 unit. AMAZING!
20535,"30% Understanding of Hero & Item
30% Know hot to combo Hero
40% How Lucky You Are to Draw Hero

8/10 Good game"
20536,One of the better Auto Chess games available now.
20537,"So far the best autochess imo. It's better than the original and it's not a mess like the LoL one. I did get bored of it after 20+ hours.

But is still has the inherent problem of an autochess: randomness, pretty strict meta, long matches, not much content in general. I hope those will get less annoying in the future."
20538,late game is unplayable on mobile version :(((( laaags so much when more than 12 pieces on the board
20539,Processing more smoothly than drangonest one and it is the only real A-card.
20540,v nice
20541,Better than I expected. Can't wait for more features.
20542,Its genius!!😎🐉🦖🐳🐙🦀
20543,Is a great concept and has lots of potential and need more improvements. Can give it a try
20544,tft is better
20545,Auto Chess with Better item system
20546,Fun and addictive! A must have for all you Dota Underlords fans out there!
20547,best auto chess out there
20548,Artifact died for this... but at least its free.
20549,GG
20550,very good
20551,"Clean gameplay, very fun, and has lots of potential"
20552,A neat and tidy standalone version of Dota Auto Chess. Fixes a lot of the item RNG.
20553,"Blurs the line between fun time-waster and deep strategy game, with juuust the right amount of variance to keep you interested. It's a little difficult to wrap your head around at the start, but you'll soon wonder why you didn't ""get"" it earlier. 

Despite quitting DOTA due to the toxic community (and to be honest, my own tendency to get angry playing), it's become my go-to multiplayer game. Familiarity with the characters helps, but is in no way essential. 

It's great! It's free!"
20554,Better Item System than all other Auto Chess games
20555,"I thought it was boring and RNG at first. But once you play a bit, and start to get a handle on it. its actually very strategic and is really fun, a bit of luck is still involved but there are ways to reduce rng"
20556,Better than DOTA2
20557,10/10
20558,Extremely buggy and unstable.  Play TFT instead.
20559,"awal mula iseng main auto chess, terus diajakin maen underlords.

bisa dibilang gameplaynya ga jauh beda sama autochess cuman sedikit lebih kompleks daripada autochess. tapi ada beberapa fitur yang sebenernya memudahkan di autochess tapi ga ada di underlords.

rekomen untuk dimainkan"
20560,[VVGG] Good Game!
20561,nice
20562,artifact died for this
20563,Great
20564,Very enjoyable so far. Looking forward to seeing how this develops.
20565,really fun auto chess game would encourage people to play this game
20566,"Fun to play, definitely better than the LOL counterpart."
20567,Best auto-battler i've played so far
20568,"Very nicely executed autochess Mod/game - I like it a great deal - at this point its very early access - needs fleshing out a bit (compared to the android phone version by the 'other' guys) gameplay is great, animations great - played several matches against bots and thoroughly enjoyed it"
20569,"Complicated, yet easy to learn a fun way to kill 45 minutes to an hour"
20570,very addicting
20571,"valve's take on auto chess, with better item waves and balances"
20572,Best of Auto Chess Genre!
20573,TFT is better 2/5
20574,Super addictive and a fresh-feeling genre
20575,yes
20576,"An easy to understand but harder to mastery kind of game. The goal of the game is to place units and battle 7 other opponents till only one is left. Now getting there is the challenge you must learn be efficient with your units using economy, position, and straight outwitting sometimes. The game is intense at the same time very relax game that you just sit back and think. The games take a good amount of time, but even after a lost it keeps you wanting one more game. The adaption into it predecessor stays very true to what the original game up while cleaning the mod to be a more modern and smoother game."
20577,"basically a dota2 mod made to a mini phone game , based purely on luck."
20578,good game
20579,The best version of Auto_Chess yet!! completely easy and updated often. Would Recommend trying at least once.
20580,its k
20581,"A seriously good improvement over Autochess - with all its restrictions of being a mini game inside Dota2. The UI is intuitive, it's pretty easy to get into and learn, plus you can play against AI to practise. 

Recommended if you like Autochess."
20582,Waiting for the bunch of updates after Ti9
20583,Yo!
20584,Absolutely perfect
20585,Best auto chess
20586,Eyup
20587,YO
20588,"pretty good 10/10 would play again.

After putting some hours I have come to the conclusion that this game is much more fun with friends"
20589,it's ok i guess
20590,I like game
20591,fantastic
20592,TFT better
20593,"Really good fun already in the beta stage, haven't run into any ground braking bugs and seems to work on Linux, Windows, Android and iOS pretty nicely. I like how you can start the game on a different device and continue it on another one."
20594,"Love the game, my only issue I have seen is I will randomly have bot games freeze at the end of a turn, and I will have to reload the app. Other than that, no complaints."
20595,YO!
20596,(Y)
20597,Great Game
20598,GG VALVE!
20599,"Stays true to the feel of the original Auto Chess Mod, while improving on the overall user experience.

The tutorial could definitely be expanded upon, a few core concepts are not introduced clearly to new players (interest cap, shared unit pool etc)"
20600,Still needs a lot of UI improvement. I would still recommend the game since it's still beta.
20601,It's good
20602,PC UI needs an upgrade. Beyond a point RNG is really horrible.
20603,"gg, more options and team development that Riots(league of legends) take on the game, its been good so far"
20604,I like this game
20605,grrrrrr
20606,"I love auto chess
"
20607,its good
20608,the best auto chess game period.
20609,awsome game
20610,"It's the only Auto Chess available on both desktop and iOS, it doesn't require you to make a new account, and it's very polished. In my book, that makes it an easy choice for which Auto Battle game I'm going to sink my time into =)"
20611,big oof
20612,"good game, need some fixes"
20613,Great strategic game!!  Highly recommend.  Can even play on your phone vs. bots (varies from easy to hardcore).  Mostly play vs. bots at work and then other players at home.
20614,imba spirits
20615,pretty good
20616,It's good
20617,zoo wee mama
20618,Good.
20619,Better than TFT because it's made by Volvo
20620,good game
20621,Great game
20622,Very fun game. Taking so much of my time though which is a bad or good thing depends on what you do lol
20623,Addicting.
20624,cool
20625,"Never played autochess until this game. 

There's a lot of hidden strategy. I enjoy playing vs bots on mobile when I have nothing else to do."
20626,good
20627,y
20628,"The most boring ""addicting game"" in years. 
Seriously. This is not even marginally an action game. It isn't even a MOBA, though the ""chess pieces"" will look familiar to DotA players. No, Underlords is a straight-up traditional brain game with a lot of luck to contend with. It certainly isn't for every gamer, but it is a great change of pace for those that have previously enjoyed traditional games like chess and Othello. Give it a spin if the price is right, but be ready for a feeling of boredom the first game or two before you really understand the rules."
20629,Good start.  will see how polished it gets
20630,"was good, they ruined with the addition of the underlords and then they abandoned it."
20631,"Pretty fun auto-battler game. For those who already played Dota Auto Chess custom map, ""Underlords"" are based on that mod - a bit old patch, before Gods tribes etc. But Valve added and changed a lot, so these games are not really that similar.

Game still relies on random though.

""Auto-battler"" here means that you arrange your squad (in this game - up to 10 or rarely 11 units) and let your squad do the fighting themself while you watch. Of 8 starting players, each combat turn every player has to defend himself from a squad of another player, while copy of his squad attacks some other player. When you fail to defend, your health gets damaged in accord of number and power of the enemy units surviving (e.g. there's 4 enemy common units alive, they'll do 4 damage); your attacking squad does the same to the enemy. Goal is to be the last man standing - meaning reducing other players' health to 0 and survive yourself.

Game's is not meant to be played for hours and hours everyday, game is NOT that deep. Can be a downside for some. Sessions can last for 30-60 minutes, all depends on how early you get eliminated (or everybody else). Also there's bots, and bot games can be paused and continued in-between turns. whenerer you like.

If you'll play this too much, you'll quickly run out of things to enjoy here, so be wise about it"
20632,it is a very time consuming game and the basics are hard to understand but it is very fun but super hard to win
20633,Best iteration of an auto chess game I've played
20634,"Made a lot if interesting changes from the arcade version. I particularly like how loot is guaranteed, and you pick form several options of random items. Would like to see that taken further with more items and crafting of stronger items."
20635,Pretty Good
20636,aight
20637,It's pretty cool
20638,"1 match it's like 20+mins lol
Solid, simple and interesting like a auto-chess game should be and btw, auto-chess it's getting popular now???
there's this game, LeagueOfLegends has one too even mobile phone versions of auto-chess are getting made 
Maybe Blizzard will do a   Diablo 3 - AutoChess Of Doom   type game now lmao"
20639,so great!
20640,"Good concept, better interface than the original auto-chess mod, but poor balancing currently"
20641,yes
20642,Needs more polish to match up to its granddaddy
20643,Auto chess is the new battle royale
20644,not bad
20645,"IT IS NOT CHESS. DOTA Underlords is a very easy and fun game for gamers of all types, whether strategy fans or not. This is great for those that can't handle the MOBA aspect of DOTA 2, but still want the lore and visuals."
20646,10/10 would not play again
20647,not THAT fun after the big update... :(
20648,this game is so cool with plans and lucky
20649,"Such auto, very battle. WOW"
20650,"Great game :)
"
20651,this game so good bor
20652,Casual chill game for noobs
20653,makes my phone battery blow .power saving mode pls
20654,you can play this cross platform
20655,Good Game and easy to play
20656,not bad
20657,"There's a bit of a learning curve but once you get it, it is like a choir of angels will sing ""Youuuu got iiiiit, buuuuut you stillll suuuuuuck"".  It is massive amounts of fun so far, enjoying it quite a lot."
20658,"Triple mod inception game, how to milk money from games."
20659,Dota Auto Chess V.2
20660,ntap
20661,Good
20662,can you check my rank? i can lv up my rank even i win 4 5 game still lieutant 1
20663,"good game, cleaned up a lot of the awkward parts of autochess"
20664,It's okay.
20665,a really good game 10/10
20666,Amazing game with constant changes. Also helps to know some of the heroes.
20667,It is a game
20668,Very close to Dota Chess for whoever has played it. Even a lot of the builds are about the same. The only complaint I have is that they don't do a good job of explaining the meta. For instance in Dota Chess they would tell you there is a limit to the number of heroes in the game so if someone is making a similar build you may want to change. Little things like this being verified would make the strategy a lot different if we knew for sure.
20669,"The game is wonderful and I love this m o d may be difficult at first but you will get used to it in the end it is a game of intelligence with some exhortation.
What I hope to put in it 
I hope there will be challenging teams like
3v3 and 5v5 that.
will make it very impulsive"
20670,"I love this game , I hope we can have more heroes and items"
20671,"A fun, chess-like game that is free to play, I can see myself sinking a good amount of hours into this."
20672,Nice!
20673,"Got into this game after watching CDNthe3rd and seeing you don't have to be a young min-maxing god to have some fun. Not too complex mechanics, cool visuals, and decent pace. However, you best pray to RNGesus feller! Haven't played in a while so I don't know what the new mechanics are like but it definitely gets my nomination for best game I suck at!"
20674,its ok tft is better
20675,"Auto-chess with better UI

Sounds great, works well"
20676,good game
20677,Pog
20678,actually lit
20679,"No Variety
Predictable outcome"
20680,Auto Chess but better. Lots of usability improvements.
20681,Nice Game!
20682,its ok
20683,Quality game! Lots of fun :)
20684,its sht
20685,Not much variety
20686,havent been addicted to a board game since snakes & ladders
20687,Artifact's younger brother
20688,still better than league
20689,good game
20690,yup its good
20691,"Good good, theres promise. Hope they implement more features to spice things up"
20692,I can't believe valve copied riot again holy shit
20693,Good game
20694,This reminds me of TFT in LoL.
20695,Awesome
20696,Nicely finished game. Needs a balance patch
20697,It's fine
20698,"Great to have this as an official game, the controls are excellent and how info is displayed is great as well.

Also great that it's being updated quickly, hopefully that trend continues."
20699,"Great game, much better than autochess. Really impressed with how balanced the game is for being so new."
20700,Good Game
20701,Addictively simple gameplay .
20702,good game thanks for sharing
20703,games that steal your life
20704,10/10
20705,I never played dota before but I have no problem playing Dota Underlords! I tried Dota Auto Chess but I cannot figure out how to play! Dota Underloads is easy to learn and very fun!
20706,123
20707,"I have played mainly the mobile version of this. I have had a couple of crashes during the first few runs, but otherwise it has been an amazingly stable mobile game.  I have enjoyed the fact that they included a pausing bot version so you can take the time to figure out which champions go with each other, and what their abilities are, before jumping into the live multiplayer."
20708,Great version of auto chess
20709,not a waste of time
20710,It's pretty meh.
20711,"Good game
Anh tôi không thể miss stun trong một thế giới mà anh tôi không thể stun."
20712,Great Game need more improvement :)
20713,a bit nice
20714,nice game. great new mechanics
20715,Still unbalanced lots of bugs expected of a beta game. game just feels it has no sense of achievement unlike autochess
20716,"Surprisingly fun, challenging, and addictive."
20717,better
20718,very nice game and addictive play with friends is fun
20719,Very enjoyable. Addictive. Takes about an hour a game.
20720,Crazy addicting and fun
20721,"fun game on the phone, i don't play on pc seems like a good waste of time doing so.
 phone = good waste of time. 
 pc = not good waste of time"
20722,Brawler/Hunter op 10/10
20723,Game's completely captivated me so far and I just want to keep playing.
20724,"good game
"
20725,"very fun for a casual moba noob

i wanna be gud"
20726,Not bad. But the interface makes me feel like I'm playing single player.
20727,need more update for this game
20728,okay game
20729,Top tier. Great casual way to kill time and its free
20730,Good
20731,It's a fun fun fun!
20732,Good
20733,rng
20734,Fun tatical game. The fact that you have to draft different heros each game makes it fresh. Also really cool you can play on mobile too
20735,"My personal favorite version of Auto Chess. Runs super smooth for a beta, for sure still some bugs to work out, but it's free."
20736,Great game
20737,"the most exciting game, but still need improvements"
20738,"Good game , cant wait to lose my job over this! :D


Edit: my wife left me and took the kids, things are looking up :D"
20739,Much more polished than Teamfight Tactics
20740,good
20741,"its an auto chess game
"
20742,Had fun trying out the synergies between alliances
20743,"very good game, pls lemme see friend ranks"
20744,"Great game, I'd play!"
20745,Easy to learn hard to master.
20746,addicting
20747,Good game.
20748,nice
20749,This is the Future!
20750,Dota Autochess with a user interface that's clean and easy to use.  Great to play with friends even if you have no idea what you're doing.  The UI makes it easy to come up with a strat and go for it.
20751,"Less flashy/""cool""/powerful abilities compared to TFT but due to that a bit less random.

More user friendly with Tooltips showing what alliances you would complete directly in the buy menu/how many of a certain hero you already have.

Personal gripe: I dont like how ""stuck"" you feel in your little arena, tft feels more open (and a bit more like a wc:tft custom map) although for some reason they also dont let you look around freely and ""pin"" you to your builder unit.

Overall no reason not to try them both and be a part of the newest installment of ""dota vs lol""."
20752,aaa
20753,"Fun game, i click buttons. I like click buttons they make me feel happy. better than the dota 2 mod"
20754,"On MOBILE I'm having an issue. I try installing the game and when I open it it only says ""error, not enough storage"" and won't let me play the game. My phone is new so idk what's going on and I see no info about this issue."
20755,"It is a fun game, and a good iteration on the auto-chess genre. It will be interesting to see where they take it both balance wise and monetization wise."
20756,This ai perfect pick up and go game no matter where you are. Low skill floor high skill ceiling and very addicting.
20757,TFT waiting room
20758,not good
20759,GGWP
20760,yes
20761,This game is quite good but the gap after the fighting is too much!
20762,Great game. super engaging. Great on mobile.
20763,I liked it
20764,good game
20765,good game
20766,autochess bad
20767,oi
20768,"this game is good
"
20769,RNG's God hates me!
20770,"An easy to get into game that is basically a card game.

"
20771,Great game. Best in the genre so far.
20772,good chess game :)
20773,Best game I've played for a long time.
20774,"This game is really cool! The strategy elements keep you engaged, while the random elements keep you interested. There's a good balance between them. It's like drafting in MTG or Arena is Hearthstone, but you just keep drafting. I should also add that I don't enjoy MOBAs at all, I'm coming into this just as a fan of card games. 

I've played Underlords, Auto chess and Teamfight Tactics and this one is my favorite so far. I didn't like the roulette in TT, and it felt really centralized on getting characters quickly. I suspect all three are like that, but TT felt the most immediately blatant about it. I really just like Underlord's presentation better than Auto Chess right now, although we'll see if the pc standalone changes that. I will say that Auto Chess's shitty translation is very endearing though.

All in in all, I'd say now is the time for gamers everywhere to hop on the bandwagon for this brave new, emerging game genre! If only because it's just a matter of time before they're all ruined by awful microtransactions."
20775,Best Autochess game I have played so far in the genre. I will definitely be sinking many many more hours into it. I can't wait for the full release and new mechanics
20776,meh
20777,"I love this game, and prefer it many times over tft. However it keeps crashing on me which ruins the experience"
20778,Dota Underlords is to Autochess games what HotS is to MOBAs
20779,Fun game to sit down and play and then get angry because your stray from your normal strat to test things out and get absolutely curb stomped.
20780,what game is this immortal treasure 3 please
20781,very very gud
20782,Very nice game
20783,Best AutoChess Game
20784,Fun and easy game to play!
20785,Sometimes less is more
20786,best auto chess game
20787,I don't know what I'm doing most of the time and I haven't won a game yet but it's additive. I keep coming back to it for some reason.
20788,"I can't even open it, they need to patch it some more"
20789,better than tft!
20790,cade as voice line
20791,Oh........ Yes
20792,"Great Mod, nice job Valve doing it again bb"
20793,UwU
20794,GUD GAME
20795,"nice little autochess remake. love the item progression, much more balanced."
20796,"Simple design. Minimal interface. Solid gameplay. Drodo Gam3 went to make their weird Dota spinoff. So if you wanr to keep playing autochess with Dota characters, this is it.
The only downside is that there is really no cosmetic reward once you win games."
20797,"its a good game for short bursts. There is a skill aspect to this game as far as making good builds on the fly, but the RNG is nuts. Some matches you will have poor luck on your hero selections every round, meanwhile another player is getting all duplicates and has 2 or 3 3 stars by round 15."
20798,"Funner and more addictive than I expected.

It's also waay simpler than the Lol and autochess versions. This might be a good thing if you into that."
20799,Best Auto-chess game
20800,nice
20801,dope
20802,This doesn't really count as a game...
20803,Fun as hell
20804,Not T-Bag... needs some balancing but otherwise a decent adaption of the auto chess genre
20805,nice
20806,Very good game <3
20807,Kinda bad right now compared to regular auto chess. will probably be good in a month
20808,"All skill no RNG involved, I love it!"
20809,Great game!
20810,good shit
20811,If you like strategic games so much & AFKs during multitasking... play this gaem
20812,worst game
20813,One of the best and easiest auto games out there
20814,Seems Balanced
20815,Good enough for a timekiller but very unbalanced
20816,e
20817,Good Game
20818,"Alright game, similar to Auto Chess but different in ways that make it easier to play for newbies."
20819,a
20820,"edit : abandonware

Its fantastic, best autochess game around by a wide margin , maybe dota2autochess will be close when the stand alone app actually comes out but for now this is the pinnacle of autochess-likes"
20821,A very addictive game.
20822,Loving the game!
20823,"Decent attempt at the autobattler genre, but really reliant on the RNG items after creep rounds."
20824,TFT>>>>
20825,Cooooool!
20826,Nice.
20827,could use some work but it good
20828,"nice chess game, thinking and lucky to win."
20829,Its fun once you get the hang of it
20830,"This game is pretty fun. I haven't played much of it as of now, just a couple games against bots. But I can already tell that I will be playing this game alot. I'd also play this over TeamFightTactics (Leagues version of this game). 

I recommend this game if you like strategy games, or board games I guess."
20831,good game easier to learn than the dota 2 mod auto chess
20832,"O jogo é bem feito em comparação a outros modos  ""auto chess"" recentes,  o ritmo de atualizações está bastante acelerado, o que faz com que os erros e bugs ainda existentes sejam consertados rapidamente. O jogo ainda precisa implementar várias mecânicas de partidas, ranks e etc.
Atualmente é a melhor opção para quem gosta desse estilo de jogo, mesmo sem conhecer o universo de Dota."
20833,laggy
20834,"This game is great. Why are you not playing it yet people? All you do is buy Dota 2 heros with money you gain each round, and then they fight for you once you strategically place them on the square made of squares. How much more simple can it get? It can't. It is too complex for that. Just play it. It is free."
20835,Pick knights. Don't pick assassins. Valid as of July 1st 2019. Thank me later.
20836,fun time waster
20837,Real noice
20838,Best game chess in the world
20839,Shit Lidl mobile port.
20840,"Good game, still fixing bugs and stuff. But is quite fun."
20841,It's DotA. Just play it.
20842,still needs balancing
20843,it's ok to kill time.
20844,Is good
20845,"Great game
"
20846,Dota Underlords is a new autochess game stemming from the mod in Dota 2. Knowing the heros in Dota helps but is not necessary. The game is free to play and a good way to spend an afternoon.
20847,RNG hates me
20848,"Bags of fun, well made autochess game"
20849,this game would be better if it was a moba
20850,really great work :3 of dota autochess
20851,dota 3 sick game
20852,"I can't get into it but I can see where people would like it.

Poor Artifact though..."
20853,"Valve's take on a Auto-Chess game, a game inspired by Dota 2 and Mahjong, and it shows. It has incredible gameplay that's been streamlined and improved upon from the original iterations of this genre and it's incredibly fun and fast paced."
20854,Fantastic game at making you realize 40 minutes have passed without you realizing it.
20855,neat
20856,Game is pretty great. Still needs some balancing work. Beats league of legends.
20857,great game 10/10
20858,Best option for auto chess players for pc
20859,Basically dota 2 team fight simulator. Oddly fun
20860,Dota auto-chess converted in to a game : ) A bit of a learning curve but pretty fun (may take a while  if you're doing good )
20861,"Very similiar to Auto Chess if you ever played that. Race/Class names slightly changed but the overall effects are the same. 

Pros:
Items awarded after neutral rounds
Easy to use UI
Ranked system appears to be working at this time.

Cons: 
Still RNG based, i.e. It's highly frustrating when its round 15 and you've got no upgraded units and you're fighting people with 4+ Tier 2 units. Further frustration when you then roll down 30g and are only offered units outside of the 6 pairs you've got waiting for upgrade. 

Overall its fun, and since its free hard to not recommend because if it's the style of game you like the price can't be beat and if you don't like this style of game it's pretty easy to uninstall and move on."
20862,Great new game mode. 10/10 should play
20863,"Cleaned up Auto Chess, lots of fun with frequent updates currently"
20864,nice game
20865,Love it
20866,"It's okay, but you actually have to use your brain, which can be a struggle."
20867,NOT GOOD/10
20868,"* lose hp every round
* spend 50+ gold rolling
* roll every legendary unit x2
* still can't find the single crystal maiden you need
* lose again

10/10 would roll again"
20869,Very addicting. Its a luck based RNG tactics game. People hate RNG but thats what makes this game. Love this game.
20870,Very fun and easy to understand after a few plays in tutorial I was ready to multiplayer. I liked very much the way you can earn items and the strategy you can with different allinaces.
20871,auto chess
20872,9/11
20873,badly than mod
20874,its ook
20875,nice game
20876,"its a game that involves RNG, skill and thats about it. Got my ass kicked, and won a game or two. Worth a try




JK,
Just pick KotL put him in the backline and watch him do 10k damage. EZ cheese"
20877,"It's a pretty standard auto chess game. 

Personally I prefer the League of Legends version, but this one is great too. It's a little rushed but it's getting polished."
20878,good
20879,"Great game for everyone and you can also play on your mobile device, you can play with your friend also this auto chess from Dota 2"
20880,"As it currently stands, it feels like a clunkier version of the original arcade version in dota 2. Since it is currently in beta, I think that it will improve, so I think it is safe to recommend it."
20881,Such a good game
20882,"Overall a fun game. Fairly simplistic, though given it's free and given that simplistic base has a lot of variation and room for skill, well worth playing."
20883,"fun game, would burst"
20884,Man pretty awesome adaptation of Dota. love it.
20885,too slow. but nice one
20886,Melhor jogo que fizeram depois de Total Annihitaliton
20887,FUCKING AWESOME>>>>> SEXXXXXXXX
20888,"nice strategy game, lots of fun, tons of combinations to try out and win with."
20889,great game having loads of fun
20890,pretty good
20891,fun but hard am reviewing for the grand prix
20892,"Good game, I consider it a card game amongst my friends.  Free, easy to learn, difficult to manage RNG, so it balances itself, sort of.  Early druids win - do that."
20893,..
20894,nice
20895,"Eh...

It is right up there with cookie clicker.  It is repetetive and requires little input.  Sure, there is some strategy to your positioning and purchasing but in the end if feel hollow and like you as the player have little agency."
20896,Great Game ... i am literally adicted
20897,"This is a bit more refined than the version built inside dota 2, though it stays pretty close to the original in format.  It switches up the way items work, mostly for the better, and it looks wayyyy better.  The UI is different, but not different bad in my opinion.  It's free, so play a few games and see if you like it."
20898,The new face of chess!!!
20899,"Fun mini-game, has a ton of potential for growth if they add heroes/items."
20900,"A fun strategy game with a high skill ceiling. Takes a bit of time to learn all the mechanics, units, tribes, etc. You don't have to play against people to learn the game as the AI can scale from easy to very challenging which I found to provide a fulfilling experience."
20901,"Very Very addictive game, at first when I saw the screenshots I didn't like it, but when I downloaded it, it blew away my expectations. Give it a try it's just ±700MB"
20902,its kinda ok
20903,Free to play Strategy game. C'mon everyone loves that !
20904,"Game's still in early access, but so far it's fine"
20905,Game is okay i guess?
20906,"I play this game both on my phone and on my PC. TBH its pretty close already to what I think they player wants, BUT the mobile version isnt that optimized yet i feel since im currently using a Samsung Note 9 and I still get a FPS stutter alot, so yeah"
20907,I like it but TFT has more too it.
20908,"Just boring. If you want to use some time in train or smth, choose something else."
20909,даже с пивом не пойдет
20910,RNG gods
20911,Easy to pick up and learn. Reminds me of the old TD variants found on WC3. Recommended if you're looking for something to kill time whether it be at home or on the road (app).
20912,"1st time playing an auto chess game I really like it. Its easy to figure out, I can play it on my phone too which is nice"
20913,Hands down the best Auto Chess game out there.
20914,Overcommoners
20915,Great game to play while pooping...
20916,"It’s the best strategy and board game right now. Also, convenient platform to play everywhere."
20917,"Jogo de estratégia muito bom. Gostei muito da experiência dele e algumas pessoas falam que ele é um jogo de pura sorte. No entanto, eu acho que ele e bem cheio de estratégias, combinações e etc.
 
A parte de sorte mesmo e quando se escolhe os seus heróis que normalmente ele nunca lhe oferece as melhores cartas,"
20918,Sick game best in along time. Forget tft
20919,good game
20920,"Really great and much more polished version of the original mod, Valve, this just might be the one, don't screw it up, put in progressions and renew game modes and playability and complexity and this will be THE go to MP game for me for a long long time, it's already better and more balanced then DOTA!"
20921,"Weekly updates keep this game fresh and ever changing, right now game balance has never been more equal.

Edit: I miss the beta"
20922,"I like it. needs a bit more work on PC UI, but overall, I think it's improvement over the mod for Dota 2."
20923,Legal!
20924,"Launch week: Fun game, much better than TFT in its current state. 

Update 7/21/2019

State of the game is worse than it was at launch
They added challenges and top ranked leaderboard but the gameplay has gotten worse; it's less and less fun. 
As it stands I can't recommend this Auto chess that takes up over 30min per round to get dumped on by a random-generated-number... play a shooter,fighting game or MOBA

Update 11/2/2019

Game is actually trying to find its style and proactively make changes
Nice to see they are trying something different than rng-fest TFT"
20925,"A friend introduce me to the game after having eyed the game for a little bit now & there's no going back. The game is unbelievably addicting, consisting of a lot of RNG (which can be good or bad) and variety despite having so little content (characters, items). It's a nice way to feel as though one is playing DOTA without having to deal with all the glaring issues that DOTA has. On top of that, you don't even have to be familiar with DOTA to play well. 

PROS:
— Free
— Feeds the DOTA addiction
— Mobile version that runs alright
— No chat / voip which keeps matches void of toxicity
— Fun with friends & random players

CONS:
— Tutorial could have a bit more info, had to learn some things from a friend
— Some synergies and builds are a lot more reliable and powerful than some of the others
— Very RNG dependent 
— Lack of content and customization*

*I know the game is EA and has only just released, but it's something to note for prospective players."
20926,Surprisingly fun.
20927,So Much Fun!
20928,"Good, but long round"
20929,"This is my first auto chess game and I am hooked on the genre. 

I think this game will be great but right now I would say the meta is pretty... one dimensional. Excited to see more units, items, etc to make things more deep."
20930,"So, TFT vs this.. I'd say this wins despite me having hundreds of hours of LoL exp.. less RNG, the flow/pacing is better. it's hard to put my finger on it, but this one wins out for me!"
20931,Melhor do estilo
20932,Good
20933,Its a fun game. Because its so satisfying making a team which works. You make choices all the time. You try make it work. Can feel a little slow but at least its consistent.
20934,"Autochess. No one likes auto chess. But you can't stop playing it. it doesen't matter if it's DotA, LoL or blizzard. It's like cocaine. 11/10"
20935,is nice
20936,Very enjoyable take on this new genre. Quite polished for something rushed out so fast.
20937,best autochess ggwp
20938,"First impression, it is a very fun strategy based games to play. the tactical depths of this game is amazing and as also challenging. in the end you need to spend a lot of time to master this game tho, the learning curve is very steep, as expected on any valve game."
20939,Amazingly addicting
20940,"Interesting, made me lose my nova"
20941,TFT is better
20942,Demons are hilariously broken and I love it.
20943,it aight
20944,Valve's auto battler lives up to the original mods. Will be looking forward to minor updates to sound design and appearance to help liven the game up through out the beta stage.
20945,First time i play Dota themed game and auto chess and i really like the concept and the many possibilities to make decent builds and come back even with 1 life. I really enjoy this game and i am not hardocre fun of either Dota or Autochess genre.
20946,Nice Auto Chess Version with way better Interface then the Original.
20947,"Funish game!  The ability to pause while playing vs bots really helps new players out

And the item overhaul is really nice compared to the Dota chess mod"
20948,popcorn
20949,Love the game so far after around 50 hours. Gotta hand it to valve for listening to community feedback and being so on top of patches. IMO its definitely the cleanest auto chess available right now
20950,Great game!
20951,Auto Chess ♥
20952,Dota is amazing. This has Dota in it. 10/10.
20953,"yep its good played all weekend.. give it a whirl, its pretty easy to get the grasp of, and so fun just to try new combinations, and going with what you get... why arent you playing it right now?"
20954,fgfdgfd
20955,Keep disconnecting
20956,lots of fun
20957,"Still better than TFT 5/7
"
20958,This game is great even if im not to much into dota but i like a lot
20959,Nice little way to kill time
20960,"Pretty good, feel like its very simple, also alot of RNG.
"
20961,Dota undelord >>>>> TFT
20962,Just what I need after a long day of work.
20963,The MOD is way better but this one runs and loads so much faster
20964,"I'm done with this RNG game. With these 106 steam hours i got to Lieutenant 5 which was really enjoyable as I got so excited ""finally max 2 games and i'm Boss rank"" but that did not last long. After getting to L5 i dropped to L3 within 3 hours. (From Lieutenant5 4,550 rp to Lieutenant3 4,220 rp) within single day mind you.

I personally never complained about changes valve did, i even welcomed them, except for one specific that is later mentioned.

Heroes i picked and no one else. Good start, but then i see no upgrades for those heroes, 6 rounds passed and upgraded only 1 hero, once again no one else has these heroes. And no i dont rush to level up if i want to get fast upgrades for e.g. Axe or Batrider. Best part is that i got 6 hero alliance but still no upgrades only pairs and here i start to lose battles. How people manage to upgrade Bounty hunter to level 3 by round 11 is beyond me.

Side note: in one of games where i fought for 1st and 2nd place, i was lvl 10 and only hero i needed to upgrade to level 3 was CK (chaos knight) i still had bit of gold to spent, so before final battle whether i get first 1st place or not i rolled all my 40 gold to get final CK and got jack shit. Is this for real? 40 gold into roll and still no upgrade? while my fellow opponent rolled 2 heroes to lvl 3. That is not okay. I still ended up in second place and after this game i leveled up to Lieutenant 5 - last victory ever.

Another thing that annoyed me is when heroes don't try to finish off low health opponent heroes as they (after ability use) switch targets, WHY? Finishing off, at least trying to finish off low health heroes to receive less damage but no just attack the one who has 99% hp.


Rank game abusers. Oh m G.

Why on earth valve decided to allow people party (especially to que up in ranked) with lower ranked people than yourself?
This is by far the stupidest thing ever done. No, you cant que with friend who is same rank as you, why would you? 
People are dragging in upstarts, enforcers, you name it. Just to ruin games for others. At first they picked something whatever, weird combos/alliances etc. In mid game, whats that? These abusers now pick heroes i have which means i can no longer get full upgrades. WONDERUL. They dont care if they lose, hell why upstart should care when they can ruin game for higher ranked players. Rather pick smurf account que up with Lieutenant 5 and help party leader to win games.


My mental health is more important than this. At least this is sign not to waste money in rng mess."
20965,Normal game but TFT Better
20966,"Good
"
20967,"thumb sideways, tendency upwards.
Simple concept, enough variability and complexity,funny indeed but for how long?
w/ that amount of RNG dependency and little replayability I don't think it'll survive for long. worth a try tho"
20968,Good
20969,fun... but not DOTA
20970,supa cool
20971,Cool
20972,"Way too addictive! Games are a bit longer than I'd like, but to be expected as it follows a similar early, mid, and late-game pattern of an actual DotA game."
20973,Have a really fun time playing this i recommend to anyone who likes strategy games and a little luck.
20974,A+++
20975,Infinite Arc warden is my favorite way to crash someone else phone game !
20976,"I love DOTA, but I can't get many people to play DOTA.

Finally, here's a version of DOTA I can convince other people to play."
20977,great game
20978,"Interesting new mechanics, heroes and synergy groups. The item draft really brings innovation to the game and helps defining strategies. I hope the development continues"
20979,.
20980,Finally a game where I can tell myself that I'm a failure instead of everyone else.
20981,"Kinda simple and parts kinda feel like they don't allow for much strategy, but it is a good entry point for auto chess games"
20982,5/7
20983,noice
20984,its ok i guess
20985,Fun game
20986,well full RNG luck
20987,Very simple and fun. Even with it being so early in development the polish is there and each alliance feels unique. Can't wait to see what content will be coming out as the game reaches full release!
20988,"I played primarily on mobile, but games just take way too long for me to want to play any more."
20989,"Good port of Dota Auto Chess, cleaner interface than current competitors."
20990,Yeah its ok
20991,Great game but lot of work needed
20992,Nice game while watching youtube vidoes and taking it easy... Very Chill but fun
20993,"yes
"
20994,"Great answer to Auto Chess, so far so good with consistent updates.
Has a few guiding problems with the pieces on the board, but not game breaking."
20995,Very fun
20996,"good fun, a few minor bugs need to be  patched out but its an open beta so it is expected. would recommend"
20997,it gud
20998,A more casual approach to Dota. Everyone should give it a try.
20999,"This game feels like it's not even close to being a finished game.

Graphically Ok, audio is Ok, controls are..ok..ish..

But overall?  3 out of 10."
21000,"Good job valve, I look forward to underlords development"
21001,au ah gelap
21002,not my cup of tea
21003,pretty good
21004,...
21005,"After quite a few hours of game-play. After being a ""day one user"" seeing all the updates, this game has changed a lot. Good-Bad, I am not entirely sure, but my game style has changed every second week as the updates keep coming!

December 2021 edit: sad they stopped updating the game for a year now."
21006,fine
21007,great game very engaging throughout and fun to learn
21008,its good
21009,Aye.
21010,"It's very good game, but we need rank, skins or smth to grind, to keep playing otherwise its getting boring."
21011,Free to play. UI improvements over other auto chess games. Pretty good attempt so far by valve to make a stand alone auto chess game
21012,Very good
21013,Awesome
21014,"Amazing game, imo way better than Team Fight Tactics"
21015,Good auto ches
21016,Fun and addictive.
21017,"nice

21018,YO

Usable for Android and Apple phone. Very interesting game with those cute-graphic effects and brainy tactics needed to play this. :)"

21033,nooooooooo
21034,ok
21035,10/10 would spend more then an hour on one match again
21036,"If you have any interest in strategy games, and you have the time for them but not the skills, play Underlords."
21037,Lack of content means this game will live or die according to it's updates.
21038,"It is good, 2nd best Auto Battler atm"
21039,it's fast and fun
21040,Valve's refined and polished Auto Chess
21041,"Auto Chess the way it should be. ""Just"" a beta, but on point dev team is constantly improving it. ++"
21042,A really great Game that looks good and Plays even better. A must play
21043,Nice game
21044,"It's alright, but it's not as good as TFT, but if you're into auto chess then you'll likely enjoy it."
21045,"Good game, it's funny though that Valve can't even steal a game correctly."
21046,RNGsuses
21047,Interesting take on the DOTA universe. It got me hooked up. Eager to see it out of beta. Still has some things to be polished.
21048,GOOD
21049,"Its a really good concept but sadly its very laggy on the mobile version. Other than that, i totally recommend the game on pc"
21050,This is the most RNG game I've ever played.
21051,Nice
21052,Overall 7/10 good
21053,"If you're a fan of Warcraft 3 custom lobbies, and enjoy the autochess genre, Underlords is enjoyable."
21054,"Easy to pick up, cross play with mobile, all around good time"
21055,I know nothing of Dota but this is pretty neat.
21056,Great fun
21057,"u play mage u win
u dont play mage u lose.

21066,Well Made. Hope it stays like this.
21067,Not bad
21068,Good if you wanna try Dota Auto Chess but not download Dota.

21071,Good game
21072,wew
21073,"Considering it is still in beta it looks ok, I hope that with future updates they will implement more functions and ideas, that we've seen in Autochess"
21074,"Pretty good start, yet it has a space for improvement. I hope this game won't die like the rest valve games.."
21075,"Interesting twist on the item drops for the auto chess genre. Fluent on PC, horrible mobile port tho."
21076,"dota 2 but chess, it's good"
21077,I have no clue what I'm doing but I'm having fun while doing it.
21078,nice
21079,"Fun,"
21080,"in my opinion it has some simple features that make it better that the original custom game, so its a win"
21081,5*
21082,Good game
21083,"Just like the Autochess Mod but a little shinier and clearer in the UI
Good fun and loads of combos to try out"
21084,Very nice
21085,"As I have never played Auto Chess, or anything that is similar in the genre, this product is very polished and a lot of fun.  The units and diverse skill interactions give the game an unexpected depth.  Plus, it's free....what are you waiting for?"
21086,It's Autochess with better item mechanics and a functional match finder. Enough said.
21087,noibgame
21088,"Overall, it's a very nice ""remaster"" of the autochess mod for dota, with some added things for balance (like neutral creeps & summons no longer count as damage when you lose a round, and items are way stronger)

though it would help to have a teamplay mode and not just ffa."
21089,The beta is a promising implementation of auto chess mechanics.
21090,Better than Auto Chess.
21091,"The concept itself is good but it still needs a lot more polish.
The random element can snowball out of control.
You can get very lucky and get the best alliances with lots of leveled up heroes or simply none.
Expanding number of shop slots could help mitigate this.
It is free so its worth a try.
"
21092,Pretty boring. games take too long. graphics are pretty bad for being 2019 and a dota game. steep and short learning curve. rng based meaning youll just win a specific % of times at  medium to high levels of gameplay. youll feel like your in a cage when playing this.
21093,Cool game bro
21094,its nice poopoopeepee
21095,enjoy
21096,Gucci game
21097,"Not quite the Dota chess that we all go accustomed to playing.. I'd recommend reading the changes to Druids! All in all it's a ton of fun and best part of all, it can be played on the phone! (WOOOOOOOT). Ranking system is still a participation award right now though.. :/"
21098,I like. Nice game.
21099,Yeah i think it's pretty neado game. Interface is clean. Units look good. Learning how to play happens really quick. So ye i think its fun and more people should try it.

Closest we will get to the StarWars game Chewwy is playing on the Falcon"
21107,"Absolutely epic!!
Better than the original autochess mod by far.....no lag or crashes:)"
21108,Nothing like sending galloping horses into a horde of muscled-out creatures and one-shotting the entire team.
21109,!!!)
21110,"Nice game of the Auto Chess genre.
Still needs some updates thou..."
21111,Just a very good game to have fun and relax a little bit. It's very competitive and has deep strats that make the game more interesting. I never played Dota 2 o LOL btw
21112,Yo!
21113,Quite fun.
21114,It's fun and entertaining for a while but not even close to the original mod to dota2. It's missing some winning component.
21115,very fun
21116,"Начало неплохое есть куда развиваться

21117,Since the new big content update i quite enjoy this.
21118,It's okay.

21121,p good
21122,Autochess 2.0
21123,Good game but
21124,It's good fun - games feel a bit long at times though
21125,"The best standalone Autochess game to date, Underlords provides you with the critical detail and data that you need to make informed decisions.  This Autochess also relies less on RNG and more on making good decisions, reading your opponents, and being agile with your strategy.  I've played a few different versions of this genre, but Underlords on PC and mobile is the best experience I've had, hands down."
21126,"Good game, great support."
21127,"Hopefully, at one point, this game becomes the Autochess we all want and deserve. It's not there yet - the item system is overly simplistic, there is too little balance and not enough actual tactics as in the original custom game, and the game still feels like it's mostly meant for mobile BUT
This is still early access and the developers have been updating this game quite frequently. I would recommend it. It has a potential to be a great game."
21128,"Very surprised by this new uproar in games, but I am not complaining. This game is addicting af."
21129,Fun Coffee game for Casual gamers :)))
21130,Yes i have spent 4.5 hours on this game is fun yes very fun
21131,"A shittier and more ancient version of LoL teamfight tactics.
I love it."
21132,smeher
21133,Quite the addictive little game
21134,"Haven't been able to stop playing since downloading. Simple to learn, hard to master, exceptionally strategic and always new combinations to try depending on how you like to play auto-chess. 

10/10!"
21135,Good Gamé
21136,Yes.
21137,"Once all the bugs get worked out, it'll be much better. But even now I'm having a ton of fun, and I know next to nothing about DOTA, so that isn't a prerequisite."
21138,Great game. Balance patches are frequent and the developers listen to community feedback.
21139,good fun!
21140,Very good game!
21141,"Many fun, cant wait for it to fully complete"
21142,Fun game.
21143,Nice timekiller
21144,it has potential
21145,I'm only playing it because i can do so on my phone.
21146,"Excellent recreation of auto chess mode from Dota 2. It's very enjoyable even if you don't know anything about Dota or Warcraft universe.

Strategy consist of picking units and trying to build a board with good synergies and combos. Fighting part is automatic and shows you how good your strategy is vs other players. It is also highly replayable. RNG makes a decent amount of game but in the end it all comes down on planning and sometimes checking on your opponents because units are offered from shared and limited pool.

[u] Some of the most positive things about the game beside that is free to play are: [/u]

--> INTERFACE: Even on first game it's very intuitive and it's very easy to find information about synergies and everything else. Also it can be played on mobile phones as well as turning on the mobile interface on PC. Comparing it to the other auto chess games it's so much better.

--> UPDATES: Still in early access but already feels like almost finished product. You really get the feeling that developers are listening to the community.  Updates are almost daily and balancing feels really good so far.

--> REPLAYABILITY: Every game feels different if you choose so. Some of the most fun games are the ones where you are trying new strategy which will be even better when they split normal and ranked games.


[u] On the other hand: [/u]

--> TIME CONSUMING: If you survive until the last 3 or 4 players you are almost guaranteed to play 30+ min game.

--> CONFUSING AT FIRST: Tutorial could be better and it is better to watch some videos online to catch up with the mechanics.


All in all, I would highly recommend it."
21147,Really good
21148,A great free game
21149,"So far so good.

Quick patches for obvious issues, good communication, great on the toilet."
21150,lllll
21151,"8/10
Its addicting, but needs some balancing and bit more character."
21152,Bad game
21153,Very gud very nice.
21154,I keep losing but no one is yelling at me.
21155,"Verry nice and platform wide version of auto chess. 
the game still tries to reinvent itself :)"
21156,luck luck luck
21157,"Good game.
Very good game.

I'm saying this because I just won a match lmao."
21158,"It's fun, but the matches and the units you get relies on RNG which some people may not like."
21159,"after 6 years, valve finally made a fun game."
21160,"Really fun. It needs polishing, that's why it's in early access, but the core game is already there. Addicting and well balanced, every match is different, engaging and challenging. I really recommend it."
21161,)))
21162,"Not a fan of Dota, but this is actually pretty cool"
21163,skill dont know how to get 3stars heroes
21164,"Everyone is having a hard time, everyone is trying to make a shit sandwich edible, just like you. And no one has any bread.

Would recommend."
21165,GRAND PRIX requirement complete!
21166,"Honestly the balance seems to be way off atm
Of course that can get fixed with updates

But uhhh they have some good new systems in place to keep the game a bit different every time

Also the tutorial aint that good

Yee haw"
21167,"What auto chess needed was a clean ui, and accesable information. Underlords has this in spades, and with a strong community management team, it has nowhere to go but up"
21168,Nice overhaul of autochess with our favorite DOTA lore. Hard to get in to but very enjoyable with friends!
21169,:3
21170,10/10 Good game
21171,It's the best game for mobile devices and for pc when you want just to relax with some challenge.
21172,I support new games from Valve

21180,Still an awesome game!
21181,10/10 give me more goblins MORE.
21182,pretty good
21183,"Dota Underlords is based off Dota 2 Auto Chess, but is not only visually improved, but has added fun and interesting aspects to the game. In Underlords on the AI waves every player is guaranteed to get one item. The more AI minions you kill, the more choice you will have. These items could be given to one of your units, but some give passive boosts to multiple units. This adds a new layer of strategy (and luck). For example, I was trying to build 9 warriors, but I had gotten an item that permanently gives all my orcs +50 health for every kill they have... That could make such a big difference, that item alone was reason to change my strategy and go for orcs.

The only downside at this point is that there is no 'long term goal'. If you win a game, you're instantly kicked and get no positive feedback in the form of an ingame currency or (visible) ranking system. It is however still in early acces and Valve has already confirmed that they will add these things in the future."
21184,Nice Game to Chill
21185,Very exciting experience
21186,.
21187,"Quick to learn, hard to master.
Fun builds to try out and much faster than OG autochess."
21188,its okay
21189,game
21190,"Fun free to play Auto Chess game. The gameplay has been clean so far and the devs are keeping up with the feedback from the community with tweaks, QOL improvements and balancing! Definitely a fun pick up and put down style game but they do take about 30 mins to an hour per game. The game is also cross platform with their phone app version!"
21191,Finally a non-pay to win game that rivals same pass time as Hearthstone!
21192,Not bad.
21193,works
21194,A mixed bag of RNG and Strategy to pass the time with the characters from Dota 2.

21214,Good game
21215,Dont even bother comparing this to team fight tactics.
21216,Very nice
21217,Well this game is a tough one for me because i never played auto chess however the visuals are stunning. It almost look like a mini game and a good one too
21218,"Like every other auto-chess style game
Pretty good with a clean interface"
21219,Auto chess with dota characters. I realize other people have been making auto chess games as well but this is my favorite of the genre right now.
21220,It's basically more polished Auto Chess. A bit scarce on content at the moment but I guess that will be fixed in near future.
21221,Enjoying The mobile version a great deal.
21222,Nice
21223,"If you are too slow for card games, this might be up your alley."
21224,"Better than the Warcraft 3 custom map & dota 2 custom game, all games should get a standalone like this"
21225,Really fun take on the mod i enjoy this more then the standalone the mod makes made.
21226,GREAT GAME!!! Suggest it to everyone!!
21227,Norm (So-so)
21228,"fun, takes some time to get to know all the effects and stuff...but fun"
21229,GAY
21230,"very nice game, ttf is not worth your time"
21231,Oh new cancer yeeeey
21232,zzzzzzzzzzzz
21233,Fun game to waste time on.
21234,"I think it's different enough from the Auto Chess mod to recommend as a game in of its own.

However, I do believe that the original Dota 2 Auto Chess mod (Or the standalone game, by Dragonest) is a better game overall."
21235,It's fun and I love how well it works on mobile. Good job Valve!
21236,Doesn't work on linux without configuring so not worth it
21237,nice (here for points).
21238,Fun Game
21239,Fun game
21240,Two words (love it)
21241,Better than artifact
21242,"This is a complete AutoChess ripoff. Zero originality; (well, not really, they did ''rename'' some synergies and changed some numbers :) ) Boring. And the worst part being the DotA team was made to work on 'this' and the battlepass content was conveniently ignored. People paid for DotA content and this AutoChess copy was imposed on us. Tried it. AutoChess is better. Mobile version is horrendous as well. If wasting time is on the menu for you, I'd still recommend putting toothpaste back in its container."
21243,blood bound team best team
21244,cool
21245,"I had been playing autochess on both PC and Andriod for awhile, but this really steps it up a notch with the UI. The chat system could use a little bit of work but it sounds like most of the community has similar sentiments. I think it would be neat if you could upgrade an item on some of the neutral rounds rather than getting new items, but who knows. Great game though!"
21246,My Virtual Crack Addiction: the game
21247,league of legends rip off
21248,Decent game. Really miss the courier and simultaneous battlefields of the original Dota AutoChess. It's hard to know what's going on everyone's boards without that large scrollable map. It also makes the game feel more isolated. You can click through the players but it just doesn't feel the same.
21249,"I bought the characters that looked cool. Ended up winning all my battles.
10/10"
21250,its a great casual game to play in class XD
21251,mama mia
21252,Its ok.
21253,"This game is 98% RNG and 2% skill.

If you don't get duplicate heros (RNG) to level up your heros, you lose.
If you don't get good item rolls from loot rounds (RNG), you lose.
If you don't get good hero pairings to get the ""buffs"" (RNG), you lose.
Once you lose a couple you're basically never catching back up.

Don't waste your time. Not really sure how people get enjoyment out of watching a game basically play itself with completely RNG outcomes."
21254,"Pretty much replaced Dota2 for me, pls help"
21255,pretty good reminds me of the league of legends one
21256,Right now game is good as there is no money impact on the gameplay
21257,great game
21258,UI feels like a compromise to keep it similar to mobile
21259,Good recreation of dota 2 auto chess
21260,Retaliate OP
21261,wow
21262,Balanced game that requires quite a bit of thinking
21263,RNGESUS BE WITH YOU IN THIS MULTIVERSE THEORY CRAFTED DICE GAME OF A GAMBLE!
21264,"dumb RNG, but fun"
21265,Best mobile game EU
21266,"its ok, gacha with no real money, and i can hear my friends screaming all day because of bad units,"
21267,"great game, really great & fun. I used to play on PC but it's almost same as good on mobile. Even thou I think it's a port from mobile to PC it's still better on PC I think."
21268,Autochess 2
21269,The most balanced of all auto chess games so far. Could use more modes and twists like TFT.
21270,"Porbably my fav mod of warcraft 3, autochest is fun and this is too.

Short review to earn grand prix increased tokens."
21271,Best Artifact EVER!!
21272,quite easy to understand the rules of the game ... it's a casual game but I don't spend too much time playing it
21273,SeemsGood
21274,A very good game. If you don't like Dota 2 but like strategy games i suggest this game!
21275,Innovative and fun
21276,:)
21277,This game is really fun but still needs some balancing and stuff. Overall a great game mostly because of the dota heroes.
21278,Discount Autochess
21279,valve n1
21280,Play TFT it's better
21281,Phun.
21282,The game is really addicting and it's has a really high skill ceiling
21283,this is fine
21284,Very good gamer :) gamer gamer hunter mages gamers trolls
21285,had to play it but the lol version is better
21286,nice
21287,"Surprisingly good version of autochess. Matchmaking is very quick and you can play on mobile which works perfectly fine. Decent amount of depth while still being relatively approachable, unlike dota which is one of the most intimidating games for beginners. My only real complaint is the time between rounds, I wish games were shorter and I often feel like you are waiting around for no reason.

Worth checking out even if you don't like dota."
21288,great game
21289,I really don't know how to play it.
21290,"ok valve did a gud job
huge update difficult to grasp at first 
use ur cards well its great now

GOOD LUCK ARTIFACT :((

and u dont need  to play dota for this :)))"
21291,"Well after almost a year and season 2 nowhere in sight, I guess this game is dead.
"
21292,Insane Game.The best AC ever
21293,"Has a better item system than Team Fight Tactics, but overall not as fun"
21294,pretty good
21295,My personal favourite Auto Battler at the moment.
21296,very cool
21297,A little bit confusing at first but once you get the hand of the flow of the game and how everything works it is a very good and rewarding game.
21298,"Wonderfully made. I've dropped tons of hours into it. As both a PC game and mobile game, it is very fun and replayable."
21299,"if you dont want to play Teamfight Tactics (League of Legends version of Auto Chess) or are drawn to the aesthetic of Dota 2 and are looking for an interesting take on strategy games, this auto-battler is really easy to get into and satisfying to learn."
21300,nice game items are good better than auto chess
21301,Chess :P
21302,Will be great in the future

21306,Meh
21307,is good
21308,10/10 auto chess game. League has nothing on this game.
21309,fun game
21310,the go to autochess experience
21311,This game is a good game to play casually. Only thing to note. It requires no skill. it is all Luck based so you cant win them all. GG
21312,The game is really fun and has a lot of potential. It's basically the AutoChess dota 2 mod but already more refined and has a few quality of life changes that make it worth a try.
21313,govno
21314,i liek it big time. obama approves.
21315,"Nice game, got the essence of the ""auto chess"" mode really well done. Reduced RNG on item drop (everyone choose an item every creep wave). Valve is listening to the players and adding and balancing stuff every other day."
21316,fun for play with friend
21317,fun game to play
21318,The best autochess out there currently
21319,Hands down the best auto chess game type out in the market. TFT have no chance.
21320,great board game
21321,"Is a good game, if you understand it"
21322,I finally have a way to play DOTA without some teenager screaming at me or disrespecting my mother. 10/10
21323,asdasdasd
21324,Chato
21325,good
21326,ok
21327,Nice Game Because its cross platform
21328,Upgraded version of Auto Chess
21329,Best Valve new game 2019
21330,bloody sick cnt
21331,Probably best automated chess game I've ever played.
21332,Nice
21333,"Pretty Good.
Solid Gameplay and nice visuals!"
21334,Gucc
21335,"I was very sceptical at star thinking its just another card game .Bout its not.
i used  to  play Dota 2 so its nostalgic too. 
The design and interface is well made everything is easy to see and locate. You can play it on pc and your smartphone.. game is 99% same on both devices only in little interface changes on smartphone (there is an option to make pc game look just as on smartphone) And u can start game on one device and continue (same round) on another of curse if u'r logged in to same steam account on both devices. 
Game is really fun and easy understandable at least the basics (there is some thinking/planing and lots of luck involved too)
Easy understandable in game tutorial, option to play and practice with bots,create party play with friends.
Each round for average takes about 30 mins max. So if u have 30 or so minutes of free time turn it in to competitive fun.
Of course its newer just 1 game after a mach u just automatically pres next  game and its easy to lose track of time so i guess it indicates how good these game is. you could easy get addicted so better keep an eye on time cause u can lose many hours playing it. Must try for everyone because i think its best and easiest to learn of genre (autochess)"
21336,Awesome that you can play mobile and with PC friends!
21337,"""Don't you guys have phones"" -Diablo Immortal dev 2018"
21338,Good game
21339,pretty good port of the auto chess game
21340,Auto chess but much better
21341,better than playing chess with grandpa
21342,Esta en beta pero hasta ahora promete mas que el TFT de League
21343,"Auto chess is very fun an interesting. It is cool how much you can do with the characters provided. The only problem I have with the game is match length, but that isn't too much of a problem."
21344,good game to play while listening to a podcast
21345,good
21346,A pretty good game and I look forward to its development.
21347,Bad RNG
21348,I maybe losing too much but I still have a better win rate in this game compared to Dota 2.
21349,haven't been so hooked in ages
21350,"need more improvement, but overall is already good.

"
21351,Better then TFT!
21352,fun to play but can be frustrated at sometimes when RNG decides your top 3
21353,"Fun, well made, Plenty of updates"
21354,gg
21355,its like a game but not fun and not like a game at all
21356,The perfect learning curve & simple all at the same time! Quite balanced as well.
21357,"Really fun game to play and it's super nice that you can switch to playing on mobile as well (and Steam still logs your hours). However, the game length can be rather long, so unless you're playing against bots you need to consider how much time you have available. While there's definitely some RNG to this game, a lot of it is strategy based, and it takes a lot to completely dominate a game so no game is lost instantly.

Overall good fun and great for filling time."
21358,mehh..
21359,im only reviewing this to get points
21360,zaebis`
21361,very nice
21362,"Play is fun but there are issues with balance among units.
There are some types that just overpower all others like knights and warriors.

It is not always clear if an item is having an effect on your units once you place an item on a unit it should show that it has changed the armour or attack but once a battle starts the unit shows base stats again so no idea if the item is still active.

-Game needs a lot of balance changes
-More clarity on if an item is having an effect
-Better AI
-Perhaps a way to have a general focus for your units
pick one option for this round
/ protect your ranged units 
/ attack enemy ranged units 
/ focus strongest enemy
/ protect strongest ally
/ focus lowest tier first
/ focus highest tier first"
21363,lit asf (autochess 2.0 lul)~
21364,"great game 
ok balanced"
21365,"Good game, a glimpse of what Artifact could've been."
21366,Really Fun! Where can i spend my money?
21367,i have no idea what im doing
21368,good game but we all know its gonna die soon
21369,I made this OSFrog
21370,i like it
21371,sexy sexy hot hot auto chess yep
21372,a
21373,nice game
21374,"So far I think it's going to be the best iteration of Dota Autochess games.  Valve seems open to listening and making it great and development seems to be moving along pretty quickly.

The competition could become better though.  For right now though I think it's the best option and will always be a great one unless the others do something amazing."
21375,cool game
21376,Since i stop playing this game my health has improved and I'm living healthy again
21377,good game
21378,"Very fun, waiting patiently for the next updates."
21379,ВЫВАРПЕКУ56Г6
21380,"You should experience the autochess genre by yourself, but it is a super addictive game and Valve seems to do a good job making it head towards skill instead of more RNG. Pretty good!"
21381,"Nice Game engine, easy to understand, however unlike dota win probability is very low 12.5%, all on luck for drawing chess piece"
21382,"Fun little time killer, and its free. Mostly RNG tho so don't get too worked up over it"
21383,"This game is fun. 

But still needs some balance and some more things to make it fun for more then a few hours."
21384,Is ok
21385,"Awesome cleaned up version of Dota's Auto Chess mod. This is the one you should be playing and supporting, not the thieves at Riot."

21389,GOOOOD
21390,GabenClap
21391,Less balanced than an original auto chess
21392,Can't seem to win can't seem to stop playing.
21393,"If you like mobile games on PC, go play this. Require minimal thought and user input. Promotes non-action through gold interest over time and bottlenecks you into a certain playstyle. 

Matches takes an obscene amount of time (30-45 min). This coupled with no chat function, no direct matches, no counterplay based on matchups and with an UI that actively hides information, makes for a very mind numbing experience. 

Don't waste your time."
21394,pretty good i guess
21395,Very good game to play while wanting to relax and watch a stream or anything.
21396,really fun
21397,addictive
21398,"bhai, tod game hai!"
21399,"Good Game, 10/10 want to play this game"
21400,"After about 17 hours of gameplay, I can say that the game is interesting but at its current form, games take too long. The open fort strat is a bit counter-intuitive, but it's also a very good catch-up mechanic, so it leaves me conflicted. Generally positive experience, looking forward to see how it develops in the future."
21401,its like dota's version of auto chess
21402,"Not a game I would have pictured myself playing, but I'm honestly really enjoying it."
21403,"Team fight tactics is better and since steam keeps pestering me to review a game, I'll pick this one. Dota Underlords is still a fun auto chess that's accessible to new players but TFT is better simply because steam kept pestering me to review a game."
21404,"Good autochess game, a little unbalanced at the moment."
21405,nice game lucky
21406,nice work valve
21407,Too addicting
21408,Dota chess 2.0.
21409,"enjoy game, ui feels like mobile game tho"
21410,Despite this game constantly screwing with me on RNG I keep coming back to it trying to get better. Would recommend.
21411,good game
21412,best autochess so far in my oppinion
21413,Steam with PC/Mobile Crossplatform <3
21414,"Great game to casually play anywhere any time. Wonderful cross platform for mobile makes this game a breeze to squeeze a game here or there in during my day. The RNG and vast combinations you can create make each game different and unique. A simple to learn game, but has the depth needed to keep me and my friends coming back."
21415,Good game.
21416,actually pretty good. cant wait to see what else they have coming
21417,meh
21418,decent game
21419,good game
21420,Lots of fun but only with friends! Playing alone without others on voice comms screaming abuses makes the game boring.
21421, gut
21422,GG!
21423,"Very fun and addictive. Just enough randomness to be re-playable but not too salty. Currently sees balance changes very rapidly.  As more voices and models are added the game will hopefully feel fuller, otherwise seems a bit confusing or underdone at times. 8/10"
21424,"Extremely repetitive, shallow, visually appalling, and kind of on the slow side. Not much more than a half baked time waster."
21425,Not a bad game but more enjoyable on a phone
21426,Amazing game! I totally love the idea.
21427,Pray to RNGesus because you're getting screwed otherwise
21428,good game
21429,asd
21430,Had fun in it a lot and doesn't look as crappy as the riot games version
21431,Not bad at all.
21432,controls are much better
21433,"Great game
Can be played in chill mood.
Te new update made the game more complex which is always appreciated"
21434,Good for who likes strategy games
21435,Good game. Play if you gotta time travel 45 minutes into the future.
21436,"It hits those serotonin and cortisol receptors just right; 
gambling without accruing self-esteem issues or massive debts/10
give ursa"
21437,Mobile game 10/10
21438,Better than TFT
21439,Pretty neat.
21440,A budding flower
21441,very nice game takes time to understand
21442,DOTA 2 but turn based It's alright I guess
21443,Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Riot's TFT.
21444,aka  AUTO-CHESS
21445,It's very mind wrecking and really fun!
21446,It's cooool
21447,It's only about luck! RNG AF. I will wait for patch. This open beta is waste of time.
21448,"Seems Fun so far, But its hard to understand what hero combos are good against what also how placing heros one way could be better then another way. It would be nice if there were UI elements to show what things are good against other things."
21449,REC
21450,njir moment
21451,"you must play it, its auto chess stand alone version"
21452,Can make you mad without others knowing about it...
21453,Better RNG than CSGO
21454,NiCe
21455,"Since I played this game, I try to help so many peoples to get some 'karma' to reroll. Definite recommend!"
21456,"Pretty fun game, not as addictive as TFT from Riot but eh"
21457,Mobile interface need some work but it's a good game.
21458,its meh
21459,balanced... add more game modes plz
21460,:)
21461,pretty fun
21462,Love it
21463,If you enjoyed auto chess this is a very good version with very low queue times
21464,Game where randoms pick pudge and the hook never misses. 10/10
21465,"Great successor to the Dota Auto Chess game, still some things that need tweaks. However it should be noted that its in beta with frequent updates."
21466,Freaking awesome
21467,Less toxic than Dota
21468,Go play TFT
21469,Still waiting on that 3* Tidehunter.
21470,good ganme
21471,its okay need some work on the rewardsystem
21472,corgi win
21473,Very Fun
21474,"A bit confusing to understand at first. All the character abilities and whatnot. User friendly, and Whats this!??!?! Cross platforming from valve!"
21475,Gud
21476,"Very addictive game, lot of potential!"
21477,An excellent past time and hobby game
21478,Game suffers from poor UX design
21479,Ez clap game
21480,"Very Nice and good game, keep up with updates. :)"
21481,nice game 5/7
21482,The best autobattler game
21483,nice
21484,auto chess is better
21485,"It's Auto-Chess, but with a new UI, global items & much better performance.

Definitely fun if you enjoy Auto-Battlers."
21486,We League'd it
21487,I lose every match but I can just blame it on RNG and not me being bad
21488,didn't like the fact of a single item for hero
21489,"pretty fun and extremely addictive. Lacks some progression and a sense of reward but it's still in beta.
All in all a fun thing to do when bored or you have nothing else to do and wanna let RNGesus take the wheel for a while."
21490,It's an interesting concept. I hope they're may be better balancing and optimization on the UI as the game goes on.
21491,Game is still in open beta. so I hope for the best.
21492,Great game to play and loads to learn!
21493,Wait... i've played this game before...
21494,it good
21495,Cool stuff gaben
21496,Not a Good Game ....
21497,"not bad
"
21498,Increasing my summer sale maximum
21499,"The wheel is being invented again and the old custom maps from golden ages of starcaft 1 and warcraft 3 are returning to wider player base. What was once normal and widely popular is on this age of micro payments considered again ""Original and breath taking"". 

The game itself is a mix of strategy with high luck factor and actually quite intense decision making on short timers when do you want to stop saving the gold and when to push all in with dota theme. All in all some people think this might be a new battleroyale killer but i mostly find this game quick fix to just play something for fun when i cant make myself to spend time on grand strategy or moba genre games. 

Also just wait for the arrival of copys of this genre arriving Soon TM on various themes and platforms."
21500,Go elves if you want to lose. <:
21501,more rng mode came out while i cant see rng himself ._.
21502,great
21503,highly addictive
21504,good game
21505,nice
21506,10/10
21507,it's like teamfight tactics but slow 10/10
21508,"My name is odinN, and I recommend this game that must play everyone!"
21509,nice to skp of free time and you need 300iq
21510,"Pros:
- Easy to get into.
- Can drop out of matches without consequences.
- It's free (Your time is your investment). 

Cons:
- Hackers (Some users are using cheat engine to never lose health during matches. Smart ones take a few hits so no one suspects them).
- Very long matches which can last over an hour (May be add some sort of fast forward features)."
21511,"Better than Auto chess in DOTA 2, but looks worse than other games of this type"
21512,Valve doing the best it can: stealing mods... 10/10 would recommend
21513,"Cool
"
21514,Its great as it has cross-platform compatibility including mobile. But the tutorial is very confusing. I don't actually understand the rules of this game.
21515,"Very fun and a good way to pass time quickly.  Flawless cross-play with mobile devices.  If you like Dota, give this a try."
21516,need improvement about the skin and UI
21517,Ez Auto Chess
21518,Great game- just wish the bench was a bit bigger and there were more balanced champs.
21519,"An interesting foray into the new game genre that all the big companies are rushing to stake a claim in.

Featuring familiar characters from DotA, which largely perform as you'd expect. The game runs smoothly, matchmaking is fast, and there appears to be some tactical depth... at first. After several games it becomes clear that there are very few competitive team comps."
21520,"The game is great fun. Though there might be some balance issues needed, i really like that there are almost no wait time in matches and currently you are being matched with players with similar ratings.
All around i think this is a very good auto chess genre game."
21521,Good Game
21522,It's easy to pick up and fun to play. I'm gonna play it some more :)
21523,Best game
21524,"It's the best looking alternative to the classic dota 2 custom game, and it runs very well.

There are a couple of things I want to say about it, one is that the game will improve a lot in the near future, it looks like Valve is focusing a lot to get things right here.
The other one is that I feel like this game was kind of a missed opportunity to differentiate itself from the dota mod, they could have sticked to the dota lore and made alliances that way, instead they pretty much copied auto chess' units (apart from minor changes) and you have ""races"" that are not races and there is something that sounds wrong all around.

Game is good still, way better than Teamfight Tactics even on mobile, free to give a shot to it as well so absolutely worth the download."
21525,"Now I've been playing other autochess games, Like the dota mod or the standalone mobile game, but personally i think that this is the best one. The graphic is very intriguing and looks gorgeous.

I could sink alot of hours into this, and i probably will, But there is no satisfaction of winning. It just boots you back to the menu. 
A minor complaint, but a great game"
21526,"For those who loved the Auto Chess mod from DOTA2, this is a really nice alternative to it"
21527,is fun
21528,issa good game
21529,Unique auto chess game
21530,"Really makes me forget I have no life

5/5"
21531,"I find this game very entertaining, not exactly sure why. :)"
21532,"Easy to get into, yet complex in satisfactory manner. Client UI feels like the game was ported from mobile, but the team is updating it VERY frequently."
21533,"Enjoyable game but the RNG kinda ruins it.
"
21534,Better interface than the autochess mod for dota 2.
21535,Autochess MK2
21536,"i think they should definetly add at least 2 item slots to the heroes, it adds more fun to the game and also it makes auto-attack heroes like luna, drow or DK more viable. Besides that, i think the game is pretty good.
The phone version is also good but when trying to reconnect to a game you will have a lot of problems. The battery consumption is not small either, so they should work on that. Besides that, it runs smoothly both on PC and mobile, so i recommend gving it a try"
21537,Only good mobile autochess game.
21538,games still unfinished but overall not bad
21539,"Surprisingly fun game, but matches take quite long"
21540,Amazing game that are user friendly while easy to play!
21541,nice game
21542,GGEZ
21543,It is free
21544,underlords> artifact
21545,"its polished and cool, even if it was originally made by other people."
21546,"fun but pure RNG..
owning for 3-10 round then luck run out all the heroes on deck not in good roll..
for those who really2 lucky player..do please play.."
21547,"Looks and plays like a mobile game. On PC. Terrible tbh. Also it's a 90% rng simulator, compared to something like TFT that is more tactical"
21548,"Auto chess is very good yes, goblin mechs 4 eva"
21549,nice game

21570,Not bad
21571,"i was not into auto chess at all but this game made me interested, isa good game, well optimised ( BELIVE ME IT RUNS EVEN ON A TOASTER), decent graphics, and a quick learning guide, a game that can kill time with"
21572,please do optimize it for mobile and it would be perfect.
21573,You did good this game Valve.
21574,"Coming from Dota Auto Chess, this is an easy game to pick up. Reward distribution is more fair. Recommended!"
21575,This is great! :)
21576,Very good game. 2.5/5
21577,"Really liked the settings, hope they improve it more and more."
21578,"I wish they will keep 6 item slots for the hero. BTW, like it."
21579,"Just like riding a bike. Except not at all.

It's good."
21580,ok
21581,Tried it. Didn't like it much. That's about it!
21582,Loving it :D Must Try
21583,Wonderful Game. Great Autochess like in the regular game. Can't wait to see it in full form.
21584,pretty cool
21585,.
21586,Not as good as Auto Chess...
21587,wtf is this
21588,I have no idea what I'm doing but it's fun
21589,3 Stars
21590,different but fun
21591,Is good game. Does the autochess well. thank
21592,yes
21593,lol they made rng into a game
21594,It's kinda similar to TFT or Auto Chess. Not exactly but really similar to those. If you played with those you are going to understand the method or the style of this game.  Having a tutorial would be more useful if it's talks about everything even if the developers thinks maybe the player knows how are these works.
21595,Amazing. Much better than TeamFight Tactics.
21596,Interesting concept
21597,0/10 no battlepass to waste all my money on
21598,veri gud
21599,interesting
21600,"Nice interface, better item system than auto chess in dota 2. The only annoying thing is, even when EVERY BATTLE is over, we still have to wait for the timer. That wastes time."
21601,"fix the bug, but this game is pure adicting"
21602,Just
21603,Nice game
21604,"Pretty fun for someone who has never played the autochess custom game. It literally ruined my life needing to play again and again until I get 1st place. I spent so many sleepless nights trying to get 1st place and all that shit. 10/10 would play again, so much better than Artifact, fuck that game, play this gem instead."
21605,Quiet good
21606,i am malchik
21607,"SO GOOD, SO FAST, SO FREAKING EZ."
21608,jup
21609,10/10 not bad
21610,"i didn't expected to be good, played the tutorial and already got me hooked (played 3 pvp rounds btw)
it's Auto Chess but kinda better. Be warned tho, it takes a good chunk of your time, so play it only if you have a good amount of spare time

Played on mobile, good crossplay with PC and you can login with your Steam Account, you don't lose any progress at all ."
21611,"Welcome to FotM,

I guess the only reason you'd be reading a review is if you wanted to know which of the autochess games is the best. Underlords has a better UI and Quality of Life improvements. If Underlords applied the same combat method that Teamfight Tactics uses, attacking and defending the same player, it would be without a question the best of the lot."
21612,GGWP
21613,"NICE GAME
"
21614,"This is 10%  luck, 
20% skill, 
15% concentrated power of will, 
5% pleasure, 
5% pain, 
The Rest is RNG God."
21615,Good game is good!
21616,"Just Like Valve Before, taking mod into a game! GJ Valve!"
21617,Valve taking a Player idea and transforming it into its own game. Hope the og creator got something out of it.
21618,Win if have luck with heroes you get.. nothing more.. just luck what i think.
21619,great but i hope this have some sandbox bot for testing?
21620,Good game
21621,"Great adaptation from Autochess, with frequent updates and constant communication from Valve. Highly recommended."
21622,1
21623,not bad enjoyable
21624,Didn't play much dota 2 but this is realy fun!
21625,👍
21626,AMAZING!!!
21627,Weird chess but ok.
21628,OK but largely driven by luck
21629,Best version of the Auto Chess genre
21630,"got me hooked,dota all over again gg"
21631,Pretty random.
21632,Very addictive
21633,Is ok
21634,Wasted my week ... played for a friend... thought it would be bad ... turns out it wasnt...  10/10 would waste again
21635,"Basically DOTA Manager:
- buy units
- plan a strategy that works well with the units
- have match with another team at least twice (home away)
- comeback is very possible due to lose streaking interests 
- RNG will reward/punish you"
21636,"This game is just an absolute timesink, requiring a large amount of your time but very little attention most of that time."
21637,I was attracted to this game by the recommendation that it was great for card game players because its very similar to a deck building game. That is definitely true and I have been having a blast with this game.
21638,Y'all are playing auto-checkers...
21639,"already goods really enjoy it but need more updates so ""it"" wouldnt be a stagnant game"
21640,THIS GAME SEW GUD
21641,just a review bcs of the racing sale
21642,Great game. Awesome time passer. Love the upgrade system combined with perks and passive buffs. And Free!
21643,Fun

21646,"Very good game, easy to play"
21647,Good port of Dota Auto Chess with a much needed better UI.
21648,.
21649,better than TFT
21650,"I like it, but a single game can be pretty long for a mobile game.
E. 11/26: Underlord units are weird."
21651,"People claim there's strategy and tactics involved in this game, but it's actually all random."
21652,very nais
21653,noice smol game
21654,Auto chess is the new Battle royale.
21655,good
21656,"""RNG"""
21657,YO!
21658,Very fun new type of game. Better than Teamfight Tactics both graphics wise and the fact there's no micro transactions in Underlords.
21659,"Very nice, amazing mobile app."
21660,"Great auto chess game where mechanics, deep thought and strategy are key points into winning games. also great to play with friends that you want to compete against. overall in my 6 hour gameplay i had a lot of fun!"
21661,yes it is fun
21662,velhoshakki
21663,Great fun if you enjoyed the workshop game
21664,"All the un-fun, stupid bullshit you come to expect from Dota repacked into 30-40 minutes of dice rolling and foolish AI behavior.

EDIT: After 40ish hours of play and some helpful YouTube tutorials, I say the game's actually alright. Still frustrating at times though. Try it out, maybe you'll like it. Watch some videos though, there are a lot of behind-the-scenes mechanics the tutorial fails to explain that, if you don't understand, will absolutely tank your ability to enjoy this.

EDIT 2: Valve has given this game the Artifact treatment, abandoned it, and left it to die. Spend your time elsewhere."
21665,good rng game
21666,Good for a free game. Needs balance.
21667,"fun game, recommended"
21668,ok
21669,Good
21670,a good choice if you want to play autochess but not the best

21674,Fun
21675,wow
21676,"A nice take on the autochess genre. I find it more entertaining than DAC and TFT, though I hope it gets new content soon or it does risk becoming stale over time."
21677,"It's enjoyable for some time, but gets easilly repetive and sometimes RNG (specially in hero pool) can be stresfull."
21678,eh
21679,Cool game but needs many changes and improvements. Some classes are overpowered and we also need more heroes.
21680,"Just review for summer event 2019
Update review for winter event 2020."
21681,Dota autochess but can be played in mobile
21682,Great game :))
21683,Wow very cool
21684,me dota no
21685,"Fun for a few hours, but I feel that more heroes should be added soon to prevent the game from become stale. Some alliances/heroes are totally unbalanced, and others are just not viable at all. Good for killing an hour or so, but very barebones at the moment. I am looking forward to playing when it fully releases though, as I expect there to be more features."
21686,nice
21687,good stuff
21688,It's a fun and addictive game ^^
21689,no sredniawa
21690,Assassin's meta is neet
21691,kk
21692,So Soo Sooo GOOT DoTa CHOS
21693,"Casual and fun~
Better than TFT"
21694,The best Auto Chess game
21695,Fun time killer. A lot less RNG based then its tft counterpart.
21696,"By far one of the best investments I've ever made.
Its fun, easy to get in to and easy to let go again.

The ""replay ability"" isnt great and the RNG is atrocious - Its either you get a item combo or minion combo within the first 4 rounds or you're absolutely R4PED late game.

So you'll know quite early on whether its gonna be a short or a long game."
21697,"Nice game for arcade mode, it can be played on the mobile phone"
21698,Good One
21699,GAME KONTOL
21700,very epic
21701,"Good game, it took an already good mod and make it even better."
21702,Its addictive since loosing can be blamed to luck.
21703,...
21704,Great way to kill a half an hour.
21705,"A nice game for  when you are bored, at least for me."
21706,better than paying for decks in hearthstone it isnt p2w
21707,It's a good game that can ply with phone/pc featuring your favorite dota hero
21708,Is aight
21709,noice
21710,good strategy game
21711,A bit buggy with the AI combat but still an enjoyable game otherwise
21712,Its Dota 2 autochess but made by valve. If you liked the original autochess custom game you will like this.
21713,"yes please....
I love duo mode. twice the fun!"
21714,awesome game
21715,"Massive improvements all around, first off the changes to the loot system is by far my favorite tweak. Loot is now guaranteed after winning a PvE round in the form of a choice between 3 random items/passives that are based on the difficulty tier of the PvE round. Then you have the improvements to the UI and keybinds which make playing the game easier and more engaging. Lastly the balance of the pieces which is tweaked slightly with every patch to keep the game fresh and exciting by making lesser chosen pieces stronger and the heavy meta picks weaker. 11/10 would recommend to anyone looking to get into the auto chess genre."
21716,Interface little bit boring than auto chess but better than lol. Contant is the same with auto chess.We are waiting for the new and better development different than auto-chess because you are not a small indie company....
21717,"Fun, fast-paced gaem, many rng, much recommend, wow"
21718,"Sehr schönes Spiel, auch wenn ich vom Ranking-System noch nicht so überzeugt bin."
21719,good game
21720,where is the tutorial lol
21721,This game requires a lot of Practice just like DOTA and you need a lot of learning before you can start winning. I completely recommend this game.
21722,"Large amount of time required to play a full game, not bad though. High competitive strategy. (Mobile)"
21723,it's great time killer i guess
21724,Complicated!!
21725,Most addictive game so far....!
21726,"So much fun, and the best combo is the possibility of a mobile game together with a PC game!"
21727,Good game
21728,...
21729,A solid recreation of auto chess with a few extra quality of life features.
21730,Best of it's kind ATM

21732,yes
21733,bad

21736,Dota Underlords is a very good game and we think how to win
21737,gud chess
21738,Reviewing this game for the Grand Prix. Keep Scrolling!
21739,"Very balanced, fun and evolving game. I suggest everyone to try it. Plus it's completely free :D"
21740,great content and good graphic design
21741,An addicting game when you get into details and be whining about rng
21742,fucking shit bitch ass nigger game omg I will :)
21743,Fun strategy game in the auto chess genre and one of the more accessible version of the genre.
21744,the best game while waiting on time. i already recommend this to my friends :)
21745,Nice Auto-Battler
21746,"Warriors, come out and play"
21747,"Nice game, but not my lucky day :'("
21748,better than tft which gives me no items during neutral rounds stupid ass game
21749,Dota Auto Chess standalone game. nuff said
21750,Way Better Than TFT due to it not been very RNG based unlike TFT
21751,👍
21752,"INITIAL REVIEW

A card version of DotA 2. Truly awesome and remarkable.

As addicting as DotA 2 itself. It's also nice to see that the game receives frequent balance and QoL updates. Worth playing

NEW EDIT : Game is ded"
21753,ok game
21754,very nice
21755,Can't wait for full release
21756,"it is a fun game, only downside is the RNG"
21757,It's like autochess but better
21758,"Its missing some progression sistem. Like levels, ranks, somethign to play for."
21759,I LIKE RNG
21760,Nice game
21761,Fun game tho
21762,Meh
21763,gud
21764,i love the art style really amazing game
21765,great
21766,good
21767,Very nice game 5/5 RNG
21768,"Good game, Sad it's not playable from the Dota arcade"
21769,nice
21770,"If you finally manage to stop playing DOTA 2, download this game, you are kinda screwed."
21771,"A bit unclear at first, but starts to make sense when you push through a bot game or tutorial. one round takes a long time if you manage to be in the top 3. That's kinda boring, but if you are bored and have time, this is a good pastime"
21772,best chess game with dota heroes
21773,"A good game, but all those frequently updates it's killing the mobile experience."
21774,For RNG worshipers... would play again 10/10
21775,its great!
21776,Good game
21777,"After playing 200+ hours, I can confidently say that Underlords has failed to innovate. The same tired, boring strategies that you have to build to win. Balance is a mess. It is no wonder why Underlords has lost most of its player base."
21778,Best time waster
21779,"simple, fun and needs more work."
21780,good game this strategic game makes me think so stressfully to be the number one
21781,auto chess
21782,"Bad game. Even Auto Chess on Android/iOS is better. Looks better and has better UI, gameplay, graphics and everything. This game is shit."
21783,"pretty fun, HUD could be a little smaller"
21784,"Test your luck with this game. If you lose don't blame the game, blame your luck!"

21787,10/10
21788,nice game
21789,"World's #1 Auto Chess simulator. Don't understand why I keep ranking up despite losing every game, but I'm not complaining."
21790,"interesting promise, but hopefully won't mutate into another pay to win scheme like artifact"
21791,It's better than TFT thats all u need to know
21792,Good game
21793,wonderfull game
21794,RNG BASE GAME SO ITS GOOD
21795,"Dota Underlords is a game i enjoy playing from time to time, Its like playing chess but the pieces are characters from Dota 2. Its easy to learn and master with tons of combo and builds that you can try... and you don't have to be good at Dota 2 to play this game."
21796,decent ftp
21797,this game doesn't contain underlord
21798,"Fun game, but with my luck...Not so fun all the time :P"
21799,its good
21800,"When the Particles in a box didn't work, you had to think out of the box."
21801,"This game is not, i repeat NOT, Teamfight Tacticts. That is all"
21802,ok
21803,Meh. It's Ok.
21804,"It's already a masterpiece, and it's free!"

21806,hmm
21807,well
21808,Good
21809,Decent game but TFT is better.
21810,Fun take on auto chess - interesting to see if it's fleshed out more than it's inspiration.
21811,"It's a great game, but the name sucks."
21812,Good Game
21813,Infinite Arc Wardens/10
21814,Fun game to play while having a coffe or watching a show
21815,Its ok for early beta. Still needs balancing and work tho.
21816,I think it has alot of good features
21817,"So far the most well made version of auto chess as of now. Smooth textures, lighting, and movements as well as straightfroward gameplay. Player accessibility can be improved upon but otherwise great game."
21818,"Very cool, can be chill yet complex + I can play on the go"
21819,Wonderful strategy that is currently Early Access. It's a wonderful strategy that allows great skill expression without being concerned of crazy mechanics (macro/micro). Really fun game to play for all strategy players.
21820,meh
21821,Nice game
21822,New and improved version of dota auto chess. refreshing and more sophisticated. Good game
21823,"Still learning it a bit, but enjoying it so far.  Does seem a bit RNG to me"
21824,"Awesome game, kinda wished one game would take a little less time than a normal Dota match.
10 / 10 design 
10 / 10 fun
10 / 10 graphics 
10 / 10 dota
 2 / 10 match lenght"
21825,Very nice game but needs a lot more content like more heros and synergies
21826,not bad
21827,"If you liked Auto Chess, you'll like this one as well"
21828,"Pretty cool game, I like the variety of units but maybe put patch note in the game because I dont even know that some number of synergies changes."
21829,"a fun RTS game, with depth mechanics and reward player for learning. nice job valve."
21830,nice
21831,where half life 3 haha haa
21832,Great fun!
21833,100 percent give this game a type if you wanna rage endlessly because of RNG but have fun doing it
21834,luck game
21835,good
21836,Super good game. Don't like the depth of other dota games but this is fun!!
21837,I guess I just don't like the genre. Game creates a system where you essentially spin a roulette wheel against others to see who can get lucky enough to win. Every strategy essentially relies around rng which unless your braindead leaves you feeling like the game mostly plays itself.
21838,its a big yeet
21839,<3
21840,Solig game needs some balance changes but besides that great.
21841,"Great game, i tried both autochess and leauge of legends one ( i didnt like it and dont even rememer the name ) and  think its best of its genre ."

21863,One game lasted longer than my life
21864,"well, it was pretty boring tbh. it looks nice on mobile, but that's about it."
21865,"Okay so this game is a Valve Version of the infamous Drodo's Auto Chess
it's not a blatant copy, instead this game offer some new mechanic which i found it really interesting, such as buffs passive and 1 item per chess, and better item choice overall.
Still in Beta and i believe there will be a lot more to expect from this game given the popularity"
21866,Нуу пойдет
21867,If u not pay much more in dota 2 U never win this game release upgrade hero when u nearly lose for ??? Just try no pay no in dota 2 u get never win !!

21893,really epic although pls optimze mobile
21894,"Love this game, much better than dota 2 lol"
21895,nice
21896,+
21897,"Good starter game for Auto Chess, if you want a basic game to learn before you try Teamfight Tactics."
21898,Nice game
21899,nice
21900,not bad
21901,"Very Good, hopeful for the future updates"
21902,its quite faithful to the original dota autochess but a lot easier to get into
21903,10/10
21904,good
21905,An Ice breaker from your dota 2 games with cancerous teammates. Better to play with some knowledge about the game than going head first. Asks some basic tutorials if your new. The UI is very well done suitable for me. Confusing at first but can still be understood clearly after a short wile
21906,Chill and fun :)
21907,Pretty darn good for an early beta. The PC version is 10X more stable and reliable than mobile at the moment. I've raked up 40+ hours in a very short amount of time on this game. I hope they ensure longevity through seasons and new heroes/items over time.
21908,"Game is really addicting., If you know Dota 2 you might have some advantage to learn the game quicker. Unfortunately, RNG is a strong factor sometimes."
21909,Pretty deece
21910,i really love this game <3
21911,What can i say.. It's a great game. Time goes by quickly while playing this. Kinda refreshing.
21912,NICE GAME
21913,Too rng
21914,"It is a good concept of a game, but due to the reason of it being new there are a lot of cheaters. Was playing a match and then we where in level 4 the person had 6 people when he should have had 3 or 4. With 2 gold. Like what is that. Will try it again in the later future"
21915,Good Game
21916,I am having fun so far
21917,the best autochess
21918,gg
21919,"fun, but still lacking ion rewards --> low motivation to play unfortunatlly"
21920,The official version of the Dota 2 Mod. Very enjoyable and the item system is very good compared to the mod.
21921,"Its an ok conversion of the original mod but the mechanics are behind the mod and it feels a little more random at times. I also am not a fan of the HP hits you take after losing a round, feels a bit much at times."
21922,gud game like really
21923,Autochess by valve
21924,Nerf knights and slark pls
21925,Not bad but if you play league go tft

21941,"Dota auto chess but they somehow managed to make the graphics weird and worse?????

added more peices but less intuitive UI
why do i have loads of tabs to switch through to see my stats why cant i just have 1 page that shows them all...."
21942,gg
21943,=)
21944,Did you ever lika playing Chess? Did you ever like playing Dota 2? Did you want mentioned game to play itself with watered down Dota 2 iconic characters? Then this is the game for you.

21962,"Good game, needs alot of more QOL improvements, seems to be rushed out a bit"
21963,hope there are more different hero and types
21964,Gameplay seems simple at first glance but there's multiple layer of strategies involved
21965,nice
21966,"Looking good so far, but needs more units and what not"
21967,Nice game
21968,Attractive games
21969,"Pretty fun game, but the game time should be shortened, it feels like it takes way too long for something to happen in the game - about 30 min for one to finish
graphics are good
strategy, gameplay is no problemo
overall worth it"
21970,"Still buggy, yet more balanced"
21971,One of the best auto battlers out there.
21972,Auto chess is <3 !
21973,"Very interesting and mind engaging. I can see that this game could become something much more for the community of Dota 2 with just some more tweeking and additional features for the hud of the game and more information given with simplicity for the player, this game will be more enjoyable and fun for people to play."

Not terrible. Not Great"
22001,good
22002,"The game looks like a mobile game, which sucks, but it is still fun to play. It is pretty much like ""d2ac"" but feels faster paced and more fair in the way they handle their item distribution. (you can get it back without having to sell the unit wearign it and you get to choose your items after each ""creep round"" out of a pool of 3.
So all in i'll recommend it."

22029,"Still needs some tweaks to be up to par with autochess.
They did however fix the problem with items RNG"

22064,"Nice Auto Chess game, probably the best one on the market at this point."
22065,The best version of AutoChess out there! Highly Recommended
22066,Looks alright.
22067,Fun game. A few balancing issues but it is in Beta
22068,NAIS COPY FROM DOTA AUTO CHESS <3 I LIKE IT

22072,its just dota auto chess but a standalone game
22073,GEGE
22074,Really fun game
22075,.
22076,"Dota Underlords is currently the best Autochess game out there. Mostly due to it's fairness, it is less RNG heavy compared to the other Auto Chess games because of the item reward mechanic, where you get to choose among 3 items, so there's always a guarantee for atleast 1 item. 

Good fun"
22077,summer sale baby
22078,"Looks good, maybe if they do it more in Heartstone way, so you can pick exactly what hero you want in deck it will be better :)"
22079,nice
22080,great game
22081,Although its in the beta stage the game is pretty good compared to its counterparts. Worth giving it a try 3.5/5

22095,"Unstable on mobile, but hecka addicting, rip your free time"
22096,Best auto chess!
22097,Beta is beta for a reason.
22098,Very good game! worth the price of £0.00
22099,"Great game but needs Valve's monetary support to help it actually succeed more against Riot's offering. Also needs to change things up a bit and evolve, which I'm hoping is what the Underlord mechanic will be all about."
22100,"Good Adaptation on the Auto Chess Genre
still in development and with constant balance changes and items added already a fun game to sink your time into.
whether you just want to play casually or more competitively it definitely is worth a try"
22101,"Awesome game!
Works Perfectly, great F2P Game!"
22102,"A fun and casual game. Deceptively simple, it has a lot of depth in it. Recommend 10/10"

22116,!
22117,NC GAME
22118,It's fun.
22119,very good game
22120,"It's... decent. as far as autochess goes, it doesn't have major flaws.

I'm putting it on positive because, as it is still an early version, it might still get a form of progression or customization. Until it does, I will likely forget about it, and only play it absentmindedly on my phone."
22121,Fun if you like luck and strategy games
22122,"Very interesting gameplay. Typical auto chess type game, but still quite hard to master.
Despite it's ""youth"", it carries a potential."
22123,Fun when RNG does not hate you :)
22124,"It's fun, I like it"
22125,"Pretty chill..

"
22130,"I think this has potential, but as a Polygon journalist noted feels like a cheap copy of Auto Chess or even the LoL variant.  I enjoyed the artwork, but the endgame felt super not balanced.  I can't recommend this game in its current state."
22131,"Overall a nice game!
The item system is way better than in the original Auto Chess.
The style might not be vor everyone (kinda mobile look)"

8/10 UwU's"

22134,"The Most Fun you could squeeze out in the toilet ,where the magic happens.
Valve has certainly been working hard on delivering us masterpieces since they have learned from the *Artifact.*
I am looking forward to that *Flagship VR Game* from Valve that's announced to come out later this year."
22135,ya its ok
22136,good for brain but difficult to win :')
22137,a lot to learn at first but good fun to be had here
22138,good game for mobile
22139,very nice so far.
22140,Its better than auto chess
22141,I played it and I guess it's ok.
22142,Has a steep learning curve but overall a very fun and satisfying game.
22143,"dota for your smartphone, superb time killer... now comes with some of your favourite characters from DoTA.

Pro :
- Free
- easy to play
- seamless PC - Mobile

Cons :
- on mobile can drain your battery quickly
- 1 game take around 20-30 minutes to finish 
- random roll sucks"
22144,Apart from the mobile interface this game is a lot of fun
22145,Needs a LOT of nerf

22151,so good
22152,Great!
22153,better than tft

22157,Funny :)
22158,free and easy to play
22159,better then TFT
22160,A good and beginner friendly take on the Auto Chess trend.
22161,Best free game out at the moment
22162,More Asians than China Town.
22163,rip artifact q4 2018 - q4 2018
22164,"It's different, but same-y enough that it's still autochess. You'll warm up to the changes, but let's hope that they eventually implement a UI that doesn't look like it's made for mobile."
22165,nice
22166,It's kinda fun with friends
22167,very good entertaining game
22168,Good
22169,cant wait for chat function so everyone can tell me how bad i am at the game
22170,"So ughm, we had a MOBA, then we've got a card game, now chess, what's next? Dota fighting game? 10/10 Valve pls make Dota Kombat!"
22171,Easily the best board game
22172,You'll be praying a lot to RNG jesus
22173,on mobile fps becomes 10 .. when in mid game.. I hope they will fixed it.. anyways its a good game
22174,yes
22175,"Great game even for a casual, really simplistic yet hard RTS game, I don't even play Dota 2 which the game is based on but I still really enjoy it even when I lose."
22176,Dota autochess but better and simplier
22177,Like autochess
22178,has room to improve
22179,"Pretty Gucci, has custom games compared to League TFT"
22180,"General Comment: Basically Autochess with slightly different race-class synergies. Both games equally enjoyable with, Underlords being the slightly more complicated version. 
Pros: Mobile and PC connectivity - play on Mobile, or transfer to PC, or back, while in the middle of a match. Autochess will have this as well eventually.
Cons: No chat with public (yet)."
22181,"bad levelup skins but the game concept is better than dota ac,."
22182,"literally stuck on this game, just because you dont know what to do at first, DONT GIVE UP!"
22183,"No lo voy a negar esta bastante guapo
Tampoco a negar que esto es para los puntos de las rebajas"
22184,Better than Dota2 Auto Chess. Play against other players or against bots that can actually give you a challenge.
22185,Good free game
22186,nice stratergy game
22187,Not good enough.
22188,Nice 👌

22206,A brilliant game to kill time.
22207,I dont know
22208,ye
22209,This is Valve's take on the Auto Chess mod that started in Dota 2 and I think they did a good job on making the game streamlined and easy to get into. There is room for strategy and difficult decisions whilst there being some randomness to spice up the gameplay.
22210,"Great fun , best autochess game to date"
22211,"Good game , just like autochess, it kill time"
22212,Just play tft!
22213,Best valve game since 2012
22214,Me smart now
22215,should've added a certain iq to the system requirement
22216,Best Auto-chess game out there :)
22217,luck based af
22218,Класс! Моему сыну понравилось!!!!
22219,Feels like a gambling game
22220,Amazing game
22221,"positive reviews have tons of likes
negative reviews don't
weird, eh?
even the legitimate critique has few likes
even the soft hitting critique like: the UI is hard to read, you have to click around too much to see stats and some buffs don't even show, the tutorial does not teach you the hand full of mechanics that the game has (also it's very easy to mistakenly click away the handful of text prompts which explain a leeeetle bit of the game)

the hard hitting critique is: 
it's super heavy RNG, which takes 45-60 minutes to play out (if you win the tournament)
there is a little bit of meta strategy which is super quick to figure out, so half of the people do it, then after that it's just an illusion of strategy, since you're either gonna luck out and win or lose against someone who had a bit more luck than you
and there is zero tactics, since it's an idle game

(I'll post the meta in a comment, otherwise this is too long)"
22222,Amazing!
22223,"Never played any Auto Chess game before, and this felt accessible from the very start. Fun, addictive gameplay, a lot of strategy and a great deal of RNG to keep every game fresh. It's the only game I've played since I tried it and I love it so far."
22224,Great
22225,poo
22226,"good game, came"
22227,Psssst! Psssst!
22228,gj
22229,How do i inject this into my vein?
22230,Delightfully
22231,Nice..
22232,"Competitive RNG turned up to 11 in a highly entertaining way. Extremely interesting in how it puts players up against each other and makes coming up with an evolving strategy accessible and easy to understand but lends itself too well to feeling like you wasted your time every match you lose as they're each a huge time investment. Hopefully with future updates there will be balance patches and rule revisions that curb the frustration a bit, but as it currently stands it's very much a work in progress."
22233,"I loved this game from the first moment i played it. The graphic model is a bit different from what you are used to in Dota2 but i quite like it. The game runs very smooth and controls are pretty easy. The shared account to mobile devices is also a nice feature.

Overall i would recommend this game atleast to take a look if you like Dota2 Auto Chess as well."
22234,wp
22235,"Great game that follows the famous auto-chess mechanics. In it's current state, the game requires a lot more chess pieces as the meta follows a very strict set of combinations that makes other pieces feel stupid to get. I believe that future updates would resolve this, but as of now, it is best to just wait for more content (chess pieces) and balances to be added"
22236,What a game!!! It's really funny and friendly to new users!
22237,Boring
22238,"Good game, well played!"
22239,Berry Nice
22240,"artifact died for this, and its good"
22241,Same as the mobile version.
22242,"surprisingly good graphics and UI, but not for me"
22243,Goooood
22244,"Great game frequent feature and balancing updates, regular communications from the devs. 

Sometimes i wonder if it was actually developed by Valve."
22245,"Good auto-battler game, has some potential but i think requires more starting strats, which will likely come as the game develops"
22246,"This is my first venture into the Auto Chess genre and I have to say that I'm already hooked. Underlords feels to me like a TCG draft format, except here the signalling is clear-cut and easy to interpret, which is something I have always found lacking in said ""draft"" games. The randomisation of characters does a good job of increasing replay value while the 8 player free-for-all format mitigates this variance by allowing the better players to (relatively) consistently hit the top 3 spots. Updates so far have come incredibly quickly and consumer feedback seems to be being listened to. Valve appear to be on to a winner here (though admittedly the game is still in open beta so I could eat my words in a few months' time)."
22247,better than dota auto chess
22248,very cool
22249,"it's ok, I guess."
22250,good casual game
22251,"Dota Auto Chess mod, but its officially Valve's game. I like it more than the Mod, personally and visually. Would recommend trying it out if you haven't yet."
22252,good stuff better than autochess
22253,"I have Played Auto Chess games before. But I prefer Dota Underlords more than others, Cause Its not very easy to win in this game. You had to make your Own strategy for your success in match also had to make quick decision while your mid game.
I highly Recommend Underlords if you wanna play good Auto chess game."
22254,i loved this game it was awesome dude.. it was so fun and i mreocmmending it to anyone who wants to play a game. dude its so sick
22255,"After the full open beta season, many change but great. Now game is pretty balance. Quest was  fun, hope you buy battle pass for valve dev, they did great. Now, make Dota 2 great again, Gaben."
22256,"Good time killer game, easy to pickup and figure out"
22257,new to auto chess i like this alot.
22258,"Looks promising, much better UI than autochess."
22259,This is Valve's Spin on the popular AutoChess mod and isnt as balanced as the original however it is just as fun.
22260,"Definitely a good game but still needs work
"
22261,seems fun 5/5
22262,Too long to finish
22263,not good
22264,tis good
22265,Very nice game it definetely worths a try
22266,Not bad for a mobile game.
22267,best autocchess ever played
22268,"Super Performance on all Platfroms, great work!"
22269,Kinda fun
22270,looks good
22271,very good game
22272,:-0
22273,Fun game. Will be great if they can balance it and reduce the RNG a bit.
22274,Good
22275,Yo!
22276,"Great game. Underlords is based on the Dota Mod, 'Auto Chess'. They are the same game. However the feel of Underlords is much smoother. It does not haven any customisation but I imagine this will be added later. The main thing I would add is that Underlords dose not feel so biased towards good RNG. Each round against neutrals you get a choice of some very interesting and complex items making the game run at the same pace for every player. The games feel more strategic due to the change in the item system and overall makes it a brilliant and more competitive scene."
22277,Nice game i like it
22278,yeah it's okay
22279,Great chess
22280,GG XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
22281,its good
22282,i LOVE THIS GAME POGCHAMP
22283,GGWP EZPZ
22284,"Here are a few key things that need changing:

Currently the games drag on really long. Sometimes even longer than actual dota games. 

It is possible for 2 players to fight each other and both win or both lose, which comes down to rng mostly. In these circumstances it should only be 1 battle field for both so that the outcome is consistent and the 2 remaining players don't draw for all eternity. 

How you attack and defend against seems to be completely random. I had ""your first game against this guy"" appear as late as round number 13! I would find it better if there was a set rotation that all 8 rounds everyone attacked everyone else. That also prevents snowballs where one guy just feeds on the weakest player over and over again to get winstreak. 

Item and hero variety is currently lacking. There are way too few t1 heroes to make the early game interesting. It's alway axe, enchantress, bloodseeker, repeat. You could easily skip the first 10 turns and just give everyone a random starter hero to speed things up. 

And then there is some UI stuff that's missing. Mostly I want to just mouse over a hero in my inventory to show me what alliences it has. NOT having to put it on the field and click on it! Or maybe even just display it under them at all time. 

Otherwise great game Knight/10"
22285,"chill and fun game
"
22286,Veri Nais
22287,Like dota but for intellectuals such as myself
22288,Nice game.
22289,"For a dota game(lets not be reminded of artifact), its actually really good.  Now valvo, add some cosmetics :)"
22290,"Nice devs, they are listening what we feedback. :D"
22291,"Great game! Somewhat like a card game (MTG, Pokémon, gwent) where players draw from a shared deck and the unit battles are animated and complex. 

RNG is not an issue - - think of it like a card game where you should be able to strategize and pivot as needed depending on the cards you have on hand."
22292,Its made out of ( Dota 2 Auto Chess ) from Dota 2 Arcade game. It can also be played from an android devices. In beta phase at the moment and It is totally dependend on RNG mostly and there is few mechanic to learn. Hope your lucky and enjoy it.
22293,Hard but pretty good game
22294,hmmmm
22295,Better than Artifact and the idea isn't even from them.
22296,"Great game, I like how the items have less rng but still rng in the end, at least im getting something."
22297,game ok :)
22298,Very enjoyable game! Can't wait for the full release!

22323,good but need improvement but its in beta so its normal
22324,"You need a lot of luck to play this. I've been hitting the refresh button for 14 gold and no same card. Good to play on pc, fast game on mobile but need lotta juice cuz the game aint optimize for mobile"

22331,"The best autobattler.

Weekly updates with balance and changes, feels like a new game each week.

The devs are very active in discord and reddit and listen to all suggestions.

Untill season 1 gets released the game is free to play and has 0 MTX with some cosmetics to unlock for free. There isn't a way to pay even if you want to."
22332,good
22333,GG
22334,still good
22335,Best Auto Chess game. Doesnt take 1 hour to find a match. 10/10
22336,Berry Good Game !!
22337,much simpler UI as well as simpler team composition system makes it a lot more enjoyable than dota auto chess or lol auto chess. Also giving u a choice to play against bots with skipping mechanics makes it much more enjoyable to play casually
22338,V设良心
22339,"I didn't think it would be as fun and addictive as it is, it's free, it's fun and you can also play on mobile. Go for it"
22340,Nice autochess version
22341,great!
22342,Nice Game
22343,Its okay
22344,"It's free, it's addictive. Yh... don't play it unless you want to fail all your exams"
22345,"Based off of the highly popular Dota 2 custom game, Dota Auto Chess, Dota Underlords is an almost direct copy of it. Valve, attempted to do well by the original developers of the mod, however they denied Valves offer. As a result, there should be no moral problems with playing this game.

The only issue that I have is that there is a here in Dota 2 called Underlord. Somehow, he is not in this game."
22346,nice game for newbie :)
22347,YEY
22348,Nice game to kill time
22349,So addictive and frustrating!
22350,Fun
22351,Good game to play with one hand
22352,Its playable
22353,"It can be quiet fun and addicting, just as the original autochess was! Allthough it looks and feels more polished, it feels more like a mobile game than your typical valve game. I can just advice you to try it for yourself, if the new item and rankingsystem is something that makes it better than the original."
22354,!!
22355,"Good game, pretty fun, UI could use some work"
22356,"i dont think its fun to play in my opinion but if u wanna try it, its up to you."

22359,Good game - Needs updates for more stuff :D
22360,"I dont like dota, I like this, a draft based game. Is quite fun."
22361,"Best game, basically d2 autochess with different client"
22362,Everyone gangsta til the RNG starts changing sides
22363,Fun
22364,its fun :D
22365,"The new UI and UX is way better than the one inside DotA 2 but could be better still. The gameplay is the exact same, fun and pretty challenging."
22366,"Great strategy game, lots of depth, easy to learn and very approachable, crossplay works great."
22367,Best auto chess game till now
22368,Doesn't this kind of remind you of Auto Chess?
22369,Great new addition to the Auto Chess library been having fun. Hope the updates can keep the game fresh and interesting.
22370,Great Animations and Meta Balance. Hero Pool needs to be more broader plus the cart logic needs update to accommodate 3 star heroes faster.
22371,ok

22389,Very adictive gameplay
22390,good game
22391,A fun version of chess.  Take advantage of practicing against bots while taking your time so you can understand the synergies of the hero classes.  Time and money management are key factors.  It's fun and being adjusted all the time in beta.  Try it out!
22392,Hope for HL3!

Everything depends on luck, thats all it boils down to - not skill. And you will feel it.

22422,good game
22423,"As someone that likes the rng aspect of items, I do not like this game. I hate that you cant stack one hero and make them a carry. I understand that a lot of people that play this game like every character only having one item and items being less rng, but this was an aspect i really like in auto chess and i really like it in TFT. I dont hate the game, but comparing underlords to auto chess and teamfight tactics, i think this is the weakest of them (also the only one that you currently have to pay for)."
22424,"I enjoyed the mod greatly, and this is a massive improvement to it in my opinion.  Item RNG is curbed, with a system of choosing a single item out of three after a minion wave round.   There are class and origin perks that make the game more interesting, and the one item limit on characters prevent item stacking from happening, making the game less frustrating from its progenitor.  Very unique twist on the emerging auto chess genre."
22425,"Its auto chess, and its good. Not much else to say. Currently no unlockable anything."
22426,Time killer
22427,niceeeeeeeeeeee
22428,"This is surprisingly fun! Polished, cool concept, and nice implementation.

22435,pretty much good i hope they fix bugs soon
22436,nice
22437,Pretty good game
22438,It's simple on the surface. I like it better than TFT because it doesn't require me to look outside of the game in order to play the game.
22439,Not my tempo
22440,ka$ino
22441,Daank
22442,Good game but hard to navigate.
22443,"This game was first born back in warcraft 3 as custom map it was first many units fighting not only heroes. When dota 2 came out someone created the autochess and from there we have underlords: its polished, simple, tactical and fun. You cant find any real flaws in this game apart from RNG gods not smilling your way, but if we compare to the rival game that was also released recently, then the RNG in underlords are prety good. 

If you want fast combat with tactical placement and synegies then this game is for you. The only real downside of all autobattlers is that normal game last for 30-45 minutes."
22444,very gud
22445,"I wish there could be something gained more from leveling... Some sort of loop.Its overall a good take on the type of game just wish it had... something more to keep me playing.,"
22446,"This is still early access, but I like it so far. I like mix and matching a team based on what I'm offered each round and finding good combinations for powerful buffs."
22447,One of the Best New Games with different game-play style and I recommend to play this game to other players.
22448,i once did a think.
22449,shit ass rng base game
22450,wawwww
22451,"This game at first felt like a Valve edition knock off of the custom game Dota Auto Chess. But, it is becoming more and more of a standalone game that can be really fun playing. Still need to be developed more on the visual as well as the strategy to make the game top of the Auto Chess category"
22452,Me mum says this game is good!
22453,Dopamine dispenser.. especially when you get some great RNG and see your 3 star Terrorblade crit for over 2000 damage. I'm interested to see what strategies arise as it moves forward thru the beta phase.
22454,Note: In this game your enemy is bad rng. Thats it!
22455,trash
22456,"the game is good, but the UI is too ""mobile"""

22479,Pretty good.

22488,Good
22489,nice :)
22490,"Need more improvement, still good game though !!"
22491,It's like Dota 2 but even more difficult
22492,"I used to recommend this game it was my favourite game to come out of the auto chess genre and coming from the mod it was quite welcoming. However the latest big update has kinda ruined the game for me. 

I've tried to enjoy it I really have but every game has been met with frustration as the RNG balance of units has been completely thrown out of whack when they introduced 12 units all at once. They have introduced a jail system which bans a few heroes with all alliances being possible, but I don't think it does enough. I've still been met with frustrating situations where I've had anywhere from 2 - 4 units 1 or 2 units away from level 3. The worst time where I had 4 in that position spent 40 gold and not a single 1 ended up at 3 star. The way that I would rectify this would be to have a slight weighting to discovering the units that you're playing utilising similar mechanics to how the level 5 ACE units are found.

This big update also added in underlords. The underlords started out interesting to start with but have now started grinding on my nerves with the repeating voicelines and just how big an influence they have over whether you win or lose the fight. Picking the wrong talents is close enough a death sentence. I also feel that having to unlock the talents through playing multiple games with that underlord is a pointless mechanic. It doesn't feel rewarding to unlock them and because the talents are so impactful it creates an imbalance between someone having certain talents available to them or not. 

The UI is okay, not great not horrible. I think the huge portrait of the underlord is completely uneccesary and takes up too much screen real estate.

I want to recommend the game, if I could I'd give it a mixed review. But as that's not an option, in it's current state I lean towards not recommending."
22493,it's funny game
22494,very good game
22495,gj
22496,"I like this game, graphically it got a lot better than the custom game inside Dota 2. I am not that good with this game but I am enjoying a lot, in my mobile devices as well. Must try."
22497,A complex game with simple control mechanics
22498,Better and more balanced than the original Auto-Chess as far as I can tell.

I would recommend this game to beginners of the Auto Chess genre of games over the original mod, It's just way more polished and less RNG dependant."

22551,"Easily my favourite DAC game after many hours spent playing the original DAC and the mobile Drodo Version. 

It took me a little getting used to when i first started Underlords, but now it's absolutely my favourite of the genre. What sets it apart for me is the neutral round rewards of the race / class bonus passives you can choose instead of an item. For example you can choose ""Battle Hardened"" which causes each of your ""Brawny"" units to gain 50hp at the start of the round for every unit they've killed... which resulted in me having an 8khp beast master at one point, or another being ""Soul Sucking"" which makes any unit standing next to a warlock heal for 25% of damage dealt by items or abilities (includes the warlock themselves). 

I also found out that if you get REALLY lucky and get 2 of the same passive from neutral rounds, they stack, so i had 2 Soul Sucking and my units were healing for 50% of the damage of their abilities and items, which was great for my radiance doom!

When i'm not playing the game i'm thinking about comps i want to try out, or units i'd like to build around, or new setups i'd like to try depending on what sort of neutral passives i get from creep rounds. They really do add another layer to the game, and let comps that would ordinarily be meh, become really strong. 

Also the ability to start a game on the PC, then switch to your phone to go play on the sofa / bed, and connect to the same game and continue where you left off, is just brilliant. Need to go to the toilet mid-game but don't want to miss out on potential units from the shop that turn? Underlords has you covered!

10/10 cannot recommend enough!"
22552,"Generally a great game, can be quite frustrated to play sometimes. This game rely on quite a lot of luck"
22553,It can be a very simple game or very in depth. easier to play than TFT but its currently pretty buggy. Its in beta so ill let that pass. 8/10
22554,Interesting balance and the need to always adjust based on what you draw make this a lot of fun.
22555,10/10
22556,Well valve is now just copying stuff other people made just for the sake of the money and i dont like it.

22563,"I like this game, the mechanics is somewhat hard to grasp if you're a first-time player but eventually you'll get the hang of it. If you have a lot of friends with the same taste in this kind of game, definitely worth trying out."
22564,rather fun
22565,its aight
22566,Good Game but the game goes for like 30 mins miniumum which is a downer to me.
22567,Still better than TFT
22568,cool game
22569,"Interesting, Fun and Challenge. I think this game will be updated regularly to improve gameplay, visual and performance. May be weekly update, please!

Update 2019/11: still love this game."

22571,"Battle Chess is my latest in a long line of game-play addictions.
A game where winning is skill, and losing is luck. Because I say so."
22572,"A more polished version of DAC, the bots are a great addition as well."
22573,:)
22574,good if you love getting shafted by solid rng
22575,good game but need more time to dev
22576,Better Than Team Fight Tactics.
22577,"better than DAC, but needs to have item combining"
22578,"Imagine you sit at a poker table and the dealer simply throws part of the deck at you, then slaps you for buying in. 

10/10 would sit at the table again."

22586,"Welcome to Rng rage chess, good game needs a fixing cause that druid team is aids."
22587,A fun way to evolve dota characters
22588,"Personally not a strategy gamer, but this game has me going for more. It's quite luck based, needing the pieces you want to buy appear so its not just about skills. Matches isn't too long and it's certainly a game to try especially since it's FREE !"
22589,good job
22590,Good autochess clone
22591,Dope
22592,better than artifact AYLMAO
22593,its alright

22607,"For the time I have spent in the game, I would highly recommend this game to anyone to play. The only downside is that there is no real tutorial system in place (yet) which makes learning to play a struggle for about 15-20 minutes. Coming from never playing the original Dota Auto Chess mod, I have really enjoyed this, even if the balancing is not perfect yet."
22608,Mobile and PC platforms allows you to play this game anywhere
22609,Good ol' Auto Chess
22610,I don't know... The bots are even smarter than me
22611,Very fun
22612,nicee.....
22613,"this game is aight, kinda skill based but also very rng"
22614,"Dota Artifact? pfffttttt...

D O T A    U N D E R L O R D S ! ! !"
22615,Fun game based on Dota 2 Autochess mod.
22616,"Just as fun as the mod on Dota2's custom lobby, Some alliances definitely need other units to be worth while. About as much RNG as an MMO ""crit chance"" stat, but still worthwhile"
22617,"Help. I played this game to amuse my friends and now it's absorbing my life. I play it on my phone all the time. It's oddly fun, despite the fact that I SUCK at it. But I do recommend it, since it runs well on a phone."
22618,"Fun and casual sometimes frustrating game, playable on a toaster so I recommend"
22619,Fun and Easy to get into. Game does gets stagnant if you played it for hundreds of hours so frequent updates are needed to keep the game 'fresh'.
22620,"Auto chess is really addicting and Dota Underlords delivers a fun and well balanced game. 
Still some bugs and the UI needs a lot of improvement.

Recommended"
22621,a very nice game
22622,Good Game!
22623,nice interesting game
22624,"Meh, not that good of an Auto Chess game"
22625,"Fine so far for a F2P game. Needs a fresh rotation of characters fairly often to keep it interesting. How they are going to monetize the game is not clear yet. 
2021 edit: new underlord heroes are boring and made matches too rng. also they removed pve item rounds which i liked."

22627,The game is fun with new concept. It makes one game different to another.

22629,A great game with all the strategy involved! Great game!
22630,I liked it!
22631,nice
22632,Worst of the genre
22633,"it's ok, i guess"
22634,"Easy to understand, hard to master and just insanely fun to play.

I've never played more than 30 minutes of DotA 2 before and as someone that always wanted to know the characters more, I'm having a blast, especially on mobile since I just don't have time nor patience to play many games on my computer anymore.

Pure fun, highly recommend it!"
22635,Very Good. Easy to understand.
22636,"Cool game
Much rng much wow
Much fun Much dota"
22637,Pretty good
22638,"Nice free Auto chess game, a lot of fun :)"
22639,The game is evolving into something much greater than before. Keep going!
22640,how to lose dota 2 player counts
22641,"Cannot reccomend it right now, too many steps back from dota autochess. Not a fan of mobile games on pc"
22642,"Pretty cool concept, tutorial could use a bit more info on the icon guides though.  Give it a shot, it's free!"
22643,"When Dota 2 is unplayable, you can always count on Underlords"
22644,I don't play dota anymore but this game is so addicting.
22645,"Nice beta, =)"
22646,Its good if you have max luck in your stats
22647,"Ok, miss the couriers though."
22648,"An interesting concept that ultimately falls a bit short for me. The RNG is simply too impactful in my opinion, both when it comes to what is populated in the store and how your characters behave once on the field of battle. I enjoy it as something I can play both for free and casually, so I'll likely keep it in my game library, but it isn't something that will likely hold my attention long term."
22649,Very fun so far. Excited to see what they do with this.
22650,"Not Auto Chess, it's UNDERLORDS BABYYYYYY!"
22651,One of the more polished autochess / auto battlers out right now.
22652,"Easy to learn gameplay. 
various OP strategies/synergies to discover.
Don't have to enjoy Dota to enjoy Underlords.

I Still suck tho.

22700,Nice!
22701,The best autochess version out of all the autochess clones.
22702,"alot of the same bonuses like autochess, but has their own unique feature with neutral rounds"
22703,Pretty  much the dota 2 mod polished and slapped with 90% mobile players
22704,yes
22705,fantastic take on the auto chess mod from dota 2. Love how much attention they are giving it and really hope for it to keep growing like it is. Excited to see where its going.

22723,Good
22724,"DO NOT GO IN TO IT expecting a MOBA type game. It is quite different than dota. Initially I was not into it, gave it another chance and I am liking it. But if you play dota, it seems pretty much all of the abilities are based on actual dota abilities. So with a quick glance at a unit, you will know quite quickly what that unit does, so that cuts down on some stuff you have to learn I guess. 

Never played an auto chess game before, and still do not fully understand what it is. But if you are curious, and enjoy dota, this could be your thing."

If you decide to spend your money on rerolls expect to lose to the guy with 12 health after he goes on a 16 round win streak after losing 26 in a row.

22755,"A game with a little bit of strategy, and a shit ton of luck required to compete in. 

What i've seen so far off the game, the strategy part is shallow whit certain starting positions and hero combinations being inherently better than others, which is were the luck part comes in, you draw 5 heroes after each round and can spend some ingame currency to get five new ones, comining certain heroes give you ""Alliance"" bonuses which can give your team a big boost.  But this is were the luck part comes in, you can be shit out of luck for the entire match and never get any of the heroes you need to build a good team. in essence combining the worst parts of mobile gatcha games without actually forcing the player to fork over real money for it. 

was it an addictive experience? yes, did i have fun? Not really,losing games because you can't get the heroes you need leaves a bitter experience, but if you want to spend some spare time go ahead, but be prepared to spend a about 30 minutes per game if you want to win a match so if you are a mobile phone user you might want to reconsider."

22776,this game is pog
22777,"The game does a piss poor job of introducing or explaining the game mechanics, and this is coming from a MOBA veteran.

Not being in power of whatever your forces decide to do makes it not only boring, but frustrating at times when you see a better outcome but are entirely at mercy of whatever the fuck your AI's doing."

Definitely Worth A Try."

22788,A bit too slow :(
22789,"made some improvements of traditional dota autochess, all for the better I think. The game needs the ability to chat with the other players."

if you win, you feel like you're the best strategic master ever
if you lose, well it's just because the RNG

Win - win condition, and free to play. Also, currently no communication media except chat wheel so the community can't be toxic (YET)"
22798,"Never having played an 'Auto Chess' style of game before, DOTA Underlords is easy to get the hang of and a lot of fun - with constant content updates and balance tweaks.  Just make sure that you have about 45 minutes available for a full multiplayer match!"
22799,Recomended if you have time to read all the alliance

22813,good game
22814,"It's pretty good on mobile. Can play turn based vs AI, don't have to dedicate a ton of time to complete an online match."

22825,Fun game and the mobile to PC porting works well. Constant updates  and nice new features.
22826,just play tft
22827,Great Game
22828,"After a few hours i understand that this game is not in beta, its still like pre-alpha, wp volvo"
22829,Fun game but matches are pretty long (depending on how far you can get). Fast learning curve and easy to get a hang of!
22830,What a chill game that has a nice level of complexity. Im enjoying this and see a ton of potential.
22831,"This is a fantastic update to the Dota Auto-Chess format that streamlines the UI so much you'll hate playing any other version of Auto-Chess. It's a great and complex game and the new seasons with new alliances will be such a breath of fresh air to what is as of 6/30/19, a somewhat stale format."
22832,Good game. The graphics include is very much like of Dota 2 and how much you would enjoy the moment you lose or win that it is experience to know many combinations to move throughout the rankings.
22833,The game has been well adapted for the mobile format they were aiming for. The welcome screen and the interface are in need of some polishment and having the skins for the upgraded units in some form that resembles the original mod would be optimal. Also having a stable matchmaking system sure is nice but still needs something to rise above the wave of competitors that is going to flood the genre like something that replaces the courier skins of the original mod (in free obtainable way of course); a lot of the time investment of the mod went into that.
22834,very cool
22835,.
22836,good
22837,Dont waste your time!
22838,"this game is good. i play very much, it is good. valve steal idea and whole concept and now owns game. valve good. if you have ip and valve wants it, they try to give you cheap money if you refuse they take anyway

Get in on it while it's hot.

22855,I see this being pretty fun but I would enjoy a mode with shorter matches.
22856,I loved Auto Chess and from what I played of Underlords I think Valve has made the game more accessible to new players.
22857,"very fun, i do 0 work at work because this works perfectly on mobile. thank you"
22858,"Generally fun, the UI is a bit lacking and partying with your friends isnt the easiest thing to do but it works and is still fun."
22859,Pretty good and evolving.
22860,A nice way to burn some time.
22861,Fun time killer
22862,Takes a little to notice the little things you need to do (who reads the rules right?) but fun times once you figure it out.  You have to accept int he end movements and targets can be random or luck of each side's setup on the map.
22863,ez
22864,Great game!
22865,Good adaptation of the Auto-Chess game. Really great item system.
22866,"very good game from Valve. Cant stop playing this, even dreaming about this. LOL"
22867,"So far so good. I am enjoying this for now, but the thing that bothers me is the RNG and that just ain't my thang."
22868,"gameplay wise its not as interesting as auto chess and is overall bland, UI wise this game was designed for mobile"
22869,A game based of a game that is based of a game on a game from an inspiration from a game.
22870,Don't buy this game
22871,avoid at all costs
22872,The best autobattler I've played. No pay to win scenarios and the perfect mix of luck and skill for a great time.
22873,"Need an improvement, still many bug"

22885,better than TFT
22886,Just go play Teamfight Tactics instead
22887,better than the original
22888,It's a thinking man's DOTA with all the length and not as much activity
22889,Arc with two CM and Refresher is ultimate love - Admiral Bulldog
22890,"This game has a lot of potential. It's perfect for me because I want to come home to something cognitively challenging, competitive, but also lenient with slow reaction times. I don't have the cognitive energy, at the end of the day, to play competive MoBA's or FPS games anymore. This game helps me still scratch that itch."
22891,good
22892,I'm having fun having never played any auto chess before. Give it a shot. It runs well and matchmaking hasn't been too brutal on newbies like me
22893,It's pretty great with constant improvements and updates. I look forward to seeing how this fun casual game develops.

22901,Neat.
22902,dota lol
22903,This game is fun
22904,hands down one of the MOST addicting games/genres ive ever played. Accumulated a tptal of 20 hours in 2 days when i dont even play strategy games at ALL. The concept is super simple build an army and beat other peoples army but the way the game is made makes everything feel interactive and super fun. Trying different builds and having success with stupid shit that shouldnt work makes this game one of the BEST multiplayer strategy games on the market atm. Its free NO reason not to try it out.
22905,"Interesting game, tons of fun with friends. Easy to play, hard to master, etc etc
Fun to kill time with and not need o commit to about ~hour of actual dota"
22906,"Fun game, but heavily RNG based. Good for killing an hour or two. Feels a bit faster than TFT."
22907,game good
22908,rng rng rng
22909,Fun and Addicting
22910,gg
22911,it's okay.
22912,cross platform 5 stars!
22913,Only played while tft had long queues
22914,It's DotA Autochess.
22915,"RNG pile of s h i t... NEXT

you can counter pick all you want unless the cards are drawn in your favor so you can upgrade abilities your beat... your at the mercy of RNG... anyone who tells you otherwise is lying LMAO what a sad waste of time... just wait for those juicy micro transactions to pop up. Parents bank accounts are going to LOVE IT!

100% a tool used to prey on kids for cash. DOTA underlords mobile, NO WAYS! Think about WHY!? lol..."
22916,A seemingly simple game that has a lot of tactics behind it. It manages to be fun and to make much of the choices you make be impactful.
22917,ok
22918,"The UI could be better, as well as the RNG. but overall a great game, and best of all you don't need to be a dota 2 player to actually understand and be good at this game. Highly recommended!"
22919,Fun game
22920,"Never really got into autochess, but the game is really great and fun to play on the go or to sit at home and chill whilst watching movies and such. It has potential but just needs to fix the bugs and errors and slight imbalances that can occur with some of the races/alliances"
22921,fun
22922,"I enjoy Underlords, but the amount of time spent throughout a single game just waiting for a clock to tick down is super frustrating. I wish that there was more information or design that helped to display what is and is not working it a lineup. I have had dozens of games end poorly when getting to the late game because of a lineup choice I made early on. I get that there is youtube videos and twitch streams aplenty of strategy, but I think something surface level in game would be very helpful. Still a early game and I'm excited to see where the game ends up in the coming months."
22923,"A good time killer, works flawlessly on both mobile and pc. Recommend strongly if you enjoy the auto battler genre!"
22924,corgi.... UPDATE: Nominate and leave a review for steam good boy points
22925,cool game
22926,"A very fun game, which is 100% free. There is currently nothing in the game which you can buy with real money, although I definitely expect this to change once the beta is over. The game itself may seem boring to those who don't fully understand it as all of the actual fighting is done by bots, however the amount of strategy and different team compositions makes it very fun and interesting to play. The fact that you can also start a match on pc and pick it up again on mobile is a plus, as this isn't really a ""mobile"" game. Matches are long, gameplay is actually interesting, and as I already said, 0 microtransactions as of this review. There have been some crashes and bugs I have encountered, but these have been getting fixed with each update which have been coming frequently, and it is a beta after all. Great game, highly recommend for anyone who likes strategy games."
22927,psst
22928,great improvement from the mod
22929,"A good game, though basically a direct copy of Auto Chess, from units to skills.

The item system, with its guaranteed drop per neutral round, is a really nice touch. By otherwise would need to be heavily updated before it is on par with TFT."
22930,Nice game.
22931,Would buy 10/10
22932,"Valve's actually listening and responding to feedback. If that isn't enough to get you hyped about this game, I don't know what is."
22933,pls make the original creator of this game mode to develop this game kappa
22934,for potato pc that took forever to load autochess in DOTA2 client
22935,"A well-furnished slot machine.

With strategy and thinking, you can get into the top half of the players each match. But in the end, it mostly boils down to that 5-hero slot machine luck. If a side gets their 3-stars fast, they get a massive advantage.

It takes too long to finish a match. They need to pace up the game, as it gets more and more frustrating with each passing round as you are not able to get that needed 3rd hero to upgrade."
22936,"It's good, but it's not quite TFT good. POG. (Still good though)"
22937,awesome.
22938,this is a good auro chess game but it can be better
22939,"Oh that's cool, let's just all go assassins."
22940,MANTAP SIK INI
22941,"I mean, it's auto chess. Nothing really super new and game changing."
22942,"Better than the original mod, but still has a lot to improve. The game feels rushed and doesn't introduce anything fresh."
22943,Love it!
22944,"My friends made me play this without telling me anything about it. By the end of the first game I lost in last place but felt like I knew a little of what happened.
By the end of the second game I was hooked."
22945,It's okay
22946,It's ok
22947,"It's ok'ish, needs a lot more features and content though.
So far there's very little to it."
22948,good stuff
22949,Good game to waste time on your phone
22950,Addicting don't know shit about DOTA but this game is really fun
22951,"pretty good and devs seem nice, update often and active on twitter"

22953,Nice casual game!
22954,"Another unoriginal Valve game. While fun, disappointing for a studio of Valve's stature."
22955,this is a review
22956,Great stuff.
22957,Better than TFT.
22958,Its a game.
22959,Great auto chess game. clear game mechanics. many different synergies to mess around with
22960,Highly addictive luck based game
22961,"Great game but the RNG can suck sometimes, although you can counter it with some strategy"
22962,tft
22963,Mobile GOTY 2019
22964,This genre is going to be the next big thing.... well so i thought
22965,this is an obligatory review.
22966,"Yea it's Auto Chess but with less customazation than the OG ver from Dota 2. 
So ye try it if you wanna , but personally i would like more thinks from an Auto Chess , like characters skins , unlockables , and anythink else for progress than some random ranking that gives nothink at all :/"
22967,"Incredible game, have some fun in it!
Better with friends by far"
22968,"pretty good
"
22969,10/10 will play again
22970,"Cautiously, I recommend this as the most polished auto chess game out there. Assuming that the developers continue their current pace of development, this game will be the best of the genre."
22971,auto chess but dota ahahaha
22972,Unbalanced
22973,"Yes, let's review. For the event."
22974,nice
22975,it's pretty good.
22976,BETTER QUEUE THAN TFT.
22977,it's okay
22978,dis is trasch
22979,Better than LoL TFT
22980,"My favourite Auto Chess of the ones available. Surprisingly fast at implementing feedback, so I like the rate this game is improving."
22981,Good game but currently lacking in features.
22982,I just needed to review this for the GP. bye
22983,great!
22984,lol ez
22985,Better than TFT
22986,Addicting game. I swear its the best feeling in the world when you destroy the hardest bots but get rekt in multiplayer because of rng hehe!
22987,Cool game but need more interaction
22988,nice game :3
22989,"A minute to learn, a lifeltime to master."
22990,Very good game
22991,im confused but i like it
22992,Fun game but it takes a bit of time to get into it
22993,If you want to play a game that is more well balanced than valve's artifact this is your choice. SeemsGood FeelsAmazingMan
22994,Decent game in the Auto Chess genre. Bit of a downgrade from the original custom game currently.
22995,good stuff
22996,"Good take on the auto chess genre. Feels much more user friendly compared to TFT, however the atmosphere of this game is a lot worse. Every unit needs their voice lines and I think all chat should be implemented."
22997,good game
22998,Very good Autochess implementation. I tried this and the other offers on the market and prefer Underlords by a large margin. I wish they keep toning down RNG and adding interesting and complex mechanics (hopefuly the underlord mechanic deepens the strategy too!)
22999,"its ok.

edit: its still ok"
23000,good phjone gfame
23001,"Unbelievably fast reaction from Valve to push this game out. As of now the game is very playable and even fun, although the same strategies are repeated by most of the players constantly, since some of the perks are just better than others."
23002,Very good game
23003,Needs polishing but good
23004,Awesome and fun
23005,Extremely casual but addicting game
23006,______ OP pls nerf
23007,Valve's version of Dota Auto Chess is great. I strongly recommend it!
23008,"good autochess game
"
23009,Fun and Free
23010,I wish they had moba version of this game!
23011,Player friendly ui and easy to learn and fun
23012,"This game is very cool and has lots of potential. 
Also big up for the devs listening to the community.
It's a solid 8/10 for now but could get better"
23013,nice
23014,"good game for auto chest
"
23015,"Standalone autochess that plays on my toaster, hell yes.
love that this plays better than actual Dota 2 on my machine"
23016,Its nice. nad im reviewing this game for the quest XD
23017,"Good start, but needs some more balancing."
23018,Mages OP pls nerf
23019,"i like chess
"
23020,meh
23021,Fun game although feels little too much like the gameplay is entirely rng. But love the mobile integration.
23022,jogo é brabo
23023,"Surprisingly addictive, give it a go"
23024,It's okay I guess. But if you are interested in a real auto chess you should either play the real Dota Auto Chess or League of Legends Teamfight Tactics.
23025,good
23026,"A well done ""sequel"" to the original Auto Chess Mod.
The item system was redone and is much more fair now."
23027,yeah cool
23028,Amazing fricken game 10/10 dick on again
23029,This game is pretty fun.
23030,is ok
23031,good game
23032,"Great game, inscredibly addictive and works well on mobile too"
23033,Its not chess
23034,"ten billion times better than TFT, not quite as good as the mod yet. Underlords definitely has the most potential tho"
23035,"Great game, it's a good introduction to the autochess genre."
23036,Epic.
23037,way better than tft
23038,I enjoy
23039,gg
23040,It's pretty fun.
23041,"Nice Auto-chess, constant updates a bit annoying but its early beta and I'm liking some of their changes."
23042,Valve stole...I mean borrowed the Auto Chess format quite well.
23043,"Having played an earlier version of the original, I was positively surprised with the new hero additions like Pudge. This is a very cool and clean version and it's worth checking out."
23044,Really chill game :)
23045,#2 current autochess
23046,Balance is out of whack right now and it gets repetitive too fast. Needs much more development.
23047,"I've enjoyed my time with the early build. It has a lot of potential and combinations. 
The only down side is that each game starts out relatively similar."
23048,It's DOTA but it's okay
23049,Complete and utter rubbish
23050,Nice
23051,"Dota Auto Chess, but better and more balance in my opinion. The only thing it needs is more heroes!! (haha, maybe not)"
23052,better than artifact.
23053,Better than artifact
23054,Best Gachi
23055,"Got me into the 'auto chess' genre. Quite polished for an early access. Looks good, runs smoothly."
23056,Great game with balancing updates coming in very often!
23057,Very similar to the original mod with a heap of quality of life improvements and polish. It seems Valve still excels at turning mods into full games and I am interested to see where Underlords goes in the future.
23058,I like it.
23059,"Simple interface, quick match making, familiar dota characters. I love it so far.  The new update added a lot of polish, matches are a little long but that's my only gripe."
23060,i dont know if im winning or not
23061,"Haven't played or watched TFT, but this game is definitely better."
23062,Best mod best game
23063,"Confusing Game with an Equally Confusing Tutorial

Despite this, and not knowing what the fuck is happening half the time, Dota Underlords is still a really fun game, and one that you should check out!"
23064,game
23065,its a game like dota auto chess but its different enough to not be dota auto chess apparantly
23066,car checkers is very good
23067,Fun game but feels more like the game caters to mobile audience more than their pc audience.  Wish i could have more than one item on a character as well
23068,"Good, better than the Droto mod for Dota 2, but same quality as Leauges."
23069,good
23070,"Needs some work, but so far a great time killer"
23071,Good Game my wife and kids left me for not being top rank
23072,What Auto Chess should be like.
23073,Valve good; Riot bad
23074,"Fantastic shape for an early beta. Obviously Valve had a lot to work with having had access to the AutoChess mod first. Still, if their development plan rolls out as expected and they stay attentive to user feedback, if all you opened Dota2 for was AutoChess, you can uninstall that now."
23075,s'ok
23076,"Some heroes are very unbalanced, but it is nice causal game against bot.
Or try hard game against people."
23077,"The game is free. If you're not sure if youll like it or not, thats all up to preference. Download it and try it yourself. 

I give this a; Yeh is Good"
23078,10/10 Game devs.
23079,More features than TFT right now.
23080,hahaha n1 game
23081,The best autochess right now
23082,"Orange Man Bad.
Underlords Game Good."
23083,"Valve's new take on the auto battler genre, arguably better balanced and more fun than auto chess and teamfight tactics, but with less customization."
23084,It good
23085,Really fun and addicting game!
23086,"Really enjoy this game. Seamless between mobile and PC. Devs have been very quick with updates and lots of communication. As a long-time Auto-Chess player, I think UL streamlines items, and the game has a bright future."
23087,"It's pretty fun, I like it."
23088,"in this game you pick a random assortment of dudes who somehow win you the game.


i think"
23089,"Pretty fun game, hopefully they can start adding content at a consistent pace.

New cosmetics, New units to really get the game going!"
23090,Great game
23091,it ite
23092,"Easy to play, hard to win. One games takes at least 30 mins so a bit long for a mobile. Hopefully they implement a faster mode for easier to go experience."
23093,"[strike] RIP Artifact. [/strike]

RIP Underlords."
23094,RNG is life
23095,Pretty good and fun
23096,nice
23097,i'm suck at this game but good enough for casual play
23098,10/10
23099,"Feels more polished than the other autobattler games that I've played, the UI flows nicely, both on PC and mobile, and I never feel like there is missing information on how the match is progressing.

The character's animations could be more fluid, and the VFX looks good, but can get confusing during big fights.

Unexpected move for Valve to catch on to a trend as fast as they did, and I feel like their take on it is pretty good."
23100,"Вроде бы неплохая игра, пока идёт поиск в доте)"
23101,pretty good and its pretty pretty
23102,Nice
23103,solid autobattler with a lot of potential
23104,It's nice. Very good and frequent updates.
23105,ok
23106,Still tricky to wrap my head around but pretty fun
23107,horosho
23108,"It's good, just needs some work and additional features with leveling system and some kind of reward system."
23109,Very fun cant wait for season 1
23110,This beta is way smoother than the auto chess mod
23111,One of the best autochess games also there is a mobile version
23112,"Clearly a little rushed to get a beta out before competitors ramp up. Barebones features and some bugs at this stage but ultimately the game is fun. Is it worth playing over other auto chess games? Not at this stage, but updates are rapid so I do expect this game will outshine other auto chess games in time due to the professional polish that others lack."
23113,Simple and fun.
23114,paska mikä paska
23115,Really fun game kinda like TFT which I like a lot.
23116,"Auto Chess RNG based game, try your luck to win with tears of joy or be defeated with tears of dissapointment"
23117,"Now this is a good Valve card game. With your deck being units instead of cards of course. There's a deceptive amount of depth that you don't see at first glance but even though the combat itself is left to the random whims of the combat AI your units sinnergies plus your placement before battle has a larger role than the luck of the draw.

It's a matter of learning the combos and adapting on the fly while checking up on your enemies rosters. There's only a limited amount of heroes of a certain type and the higher the rarity the less of them to go around. So give it a go if you like strategy in general with a healthy smattering on RNG to liven things up. 

Good luck reaching the depths of the Underempire!"
23118,Best game since OG autochess. Has had a lot of changes since its release and continues to be a good game to pass time.
23119,Very fun
23120,"Could be better, but then again, I'm not a fan of DOTA in general"
23121,cool game
23122,ayy
23123,good game
23124,Half Life 3 died for this.
23125,its ok
23126,Nah
23127,The item idea is great. Aside from that they butchered it. Both the arcade and the phone app are better by far. #Failure
23128,"gud game
"
23129,Good Game
23130,Really fun addition to my library..
23131,Very good so far for the beta but needs some balancing changes.
23132,"This is super fun. My god the hours that'll disappear into this... I can just feel whatever respect my parents had for me vanish into thin air.

A perfect 7/10"
23133,Shadow fiend
23134,its ok
23135,"Super dope game.
Give me my points now silly Volvo."
23136,nisu
23137,quite fun to play
23138,Amazing Game.
23139,"great game, great adaptation. fun and free!"
23140,congrats Valve
23141,needs work but could be good.
23142,its flames G
23143,You can throw Rapier.
23144,Wow an autochess game! Very fun!
23145,a
23146,"decent enough game, good to play on mobile or on a computer, good to have running in the background whilst your doing something else"
23147,"Ehhh
Gets boring after awhile"
23148,going forward
23149,"A straight improvement over the original auto chess in every way; Dota Underlords nails the user experience. Buffs/synergies are clearly presented and labeled. Controls are straightforward and simple. Item system was tweaked in a way to be easier to manage, more skill-based, and more consistent. From my limited experience so far, the game just feels better, with less overall RNG and much more polish. Aside from a few occasions where my units have seemed to not register on the board, this game has been great fun. I have high hopes for the future of Dota Underlords, and you should definitely give it a try."
23150,Very very RNG related. but fun
23151,Auto Chess Sucks Valve Sorry
23152,"Having continued to play for a while now and seen the game change a lot, I'd still recommend it, but it was much better before. I just use it to up my proto pass against bots and to have something to do in the background."
23153,The best Auto Chess don't @ me
23154,Great game but the number of viable late game builds are a bit limiting
23155,"A game that plays with great fidelity and yet retains its casual vibe.

Round by round you select your band of brothers and conquer the chessboards. While the amount of ""combos"" can be daunting for newcomers, the losses along the path of learning do not sting, similar to games like rocket league or other casually competitive games.

You can put this game on a second monitor and play it laid back, or you can fully devote your attention to it and exploit the deep stratagems offered in lategame. Mid-to-lategame is where this game really differentiates from its Dota 2 counterpart. While rearranging heros and using your global items tactically (stealth for some heroes, death prevention, teleportation, etc.) you can really feel the feedback due to superior movement and attack logic of your heros.

I feel like this game has a bright future, and as is tradition, Valve makes the best gaming products from mods created via their flagship games and source engine.
"
23156,A very good take on Dota Auto chess that keeps the original vision of the game mode intact.
23157,noice
23158,"fun game.
edit: Juu eipä ollu. bs ruins this game gg...
edit: fixeded"
23159,"Like chess, if chess were dumb and mostly based on RNG."
23160,One of the best turn-based game I've played!
23161,Es Good RNG
23162,Hey its valve game!
23163,muito bom
23164,"it is ok, but i have more fun with teamfight tactics.
"
23165,Will ruin your life with the seamless phone connection
23166,Nice beta so far.
23167,deceptively facile
23168,c
23169,"Pretty good game, expecially considering it is in early access"
23170,Nice realization
23171,Its fun
23172,"Weird but fun
"
23173,Awesome game
23174,I have no idea what im doing... 10/10
23175,Pretty good autobattler
23176,really good game cant wait for future updates
23177,"The core gameplay loop is simple on the surface, while hiding a fairly complex system lurking underneath. Match unit types for buffs, buy multiples of a unit to level them up, and try to stay one step ahead of your opponents. Or...intentionally lose rounds until you're around 50 life, then cash out with all the money you've stockpiled along the way, going from zero to hero in a matter of seconds."
23178,great game
23179,"Autochess in the Dota universe 
with the usual incentive interface , the great sound design
and the valve polish
and it's also free,(and it's not even 1GB to download) 

so what are you waiting for? :o"
23180,"Really engaging game, with more tactical depth than you think at first"
23181,"It's pretty decent - pretty similar to the original DAC mod in terms of characters, synergies, and gameplay so if you were into that you will like Underlods. The movement feels a little clunky though, and the lack of BMing is disappointing."
23182,Awesome! Autochess 2.0 ;)
23183,More user friendly and features than the mod in Dota 2. Can also play on the smartphone using the same account which is great in this age!
23184,This was the first auto chess game i've ever tried so i have nothing to compare it to.   I do enjoy playing and can see it being very addictive once they add in progression type mechanics.
23185,"Seems good, the tutorial doesn't explain that you need to join heros to power them up, and it seems to drag on sometimes, but it's a great game to have running in a window while you do something else."
23186,"Surprisingly fun and addictive :)
But there is almost no content outside of the base game mechanics at the moment (June 2019). No Leaderboards, cosmetics, alliances, …

Promising nonetheless!"
23187,Good to pass some time
23188,"Fun game, nice visuals and interface.
More balanced than TFT"
23189,Game is very addictive like the original dac
23190,Fantastic game! I'll be playing this a LOT! So much more stable than AUTOCHESS from the Dota 2 game.
23191,Free and Fun! Although I like TFT a lil more.
23192,Fun !
23193,7/5
23194,it's very playable. find game quickly. no waiting. nice game
23195,Viciante!
23196,cool game casual game
23197,"Not a fan of how the champions react in game, and they do not personally represent what they are in the real game. Also
no rewards of any kind for winning or losing a game, no sense of starting over and over unless you just want to get better."
23198,review
23199,I don't know how did they manage to screw everything good this game had with one but extremely stupid Julls update but it's completely unenjoyable hot pile of crap now. Artifact vol. 2.
23200,"My first autochess experience, accurately described by a friend as a PvE and PvP tower defense game. Pretty enjoyable by both new and experienced players."
23201,Valve abandoned this game just like my father going to get milk from Wawa
23202,nice
23203,There must be a penalty for those who abandon the game :(
23204,better than tft
23205,"Haven't one a single match but I'll chock that up to other players finding better solutions, and the gigaton of Japanese Character Players, I won 3 matches already of TFT, and there are more complexities to that game so, I can recommend this game to get you started, then, switch to TFT"
23206,Fantastic Game one of the best auto chess game out atm
23207,"When you too lazy to play Dota 2, you play this!"
23208,I am not normally into games such as this but for some reason I can't help but to play it over and over again. It really starts to shine after you play a couple matches and figure out what you're doing.
23209,Somehow worse than the mod made within valves own game.

23232,Great UI improvement and much more easy for newbie to learn the game.
23233,"Needs more customization for ""chessboard"". nontheless as per gameplay. meh."
23234,Good game
23235,"nice game, but updates are required"
23236,Amazing game
23237,It is a good version of Autochess that streamlines interactions. I seamlessly transerred from the mod to this game and it seems to be even better.
23238,Yup
23239,Great Strategic game
23240,great when gaming with one hand!
23241,"This game was surprisingly fun.
The gameplay is smooth, the game has a strategic depth but still being simple enough to pick up.

Not to mention you can play on the go with the mobile version.
This game is quite good."
23242,Booring
23243,Its OK
23244,Best teamfight tactics clone so far
23245,Tanks all day
23246,haha aa
23247,"Fast-paced, building-focused turn-based strategy for anyone too late or ignorant for Dota Auto Chess. Builds into a much more optimized and understandable experience in comparison to its predecessor. However, it lacks any reward system which makes for less replayability."
23248,Fun game. It will be better with the updates
23249,It's looking good
23250,GG
23251,worse than TFT but hey it's on mobile
23252,"Pretty good auto chess game
(ngl I did this for the summer event and I'm not even sorry)"
23253,Bruh Moment For Sure
23254,pretty fun! would recommend

23256,"Pretty fun and challenging, more polished that auto chess mod in my opinion."
23257,"Currently needs a fair amount of balance certain builds with the right items are over powered compared to original auto chess
"
23258,👌
23259,Very interesting genre to follow and this game is the cleanest one to play.
23260,"At least unlike Diablo Immortal, this game is playable without a phone."

23262,Best auto battler.
23263,1
23264,"is good, yah?"
23265,its ok
23266,Looks like crap since its a mobile game. But the Item mechanic makes this one of the least RNG based Auto Chess games.
23267,good :)
23268,love it
23269,"solid clone, needs balancing"
23270,i think this game is better than league tft because it's less based on luck (everyone gets the same amount of items)
23271,Good Game
23272,"Fun, free and Valve actually care (RIP Artifact)"
23273,best game eva
23274,Great game
23275,"Pretty much Like Auto Chess which I know was copied from Dota before, however this seems ways harder to an unfair point at times....Maybe give it a miss or try it for a bit as it is free

Update: Played this again today to see if it has improved and not really. Way more confusing and so much more on the screen, shame really as I love the graphics."
23276,"Honestly really fun, with a simple UI and easy to follow characters. I find the other versions either to cluttered or difficult to understand"
23277,overpeasant
23278,"I love League of Legends and have barely played Dota, but I gotta say, in its current state TFT just sucks. It suffers under the same problems that Auto Chess did (very high variance). Underlords tries to solve this by removing RNG item drops and replacing it with a choice of items [i] or passive auras [/i] at the end of PvE rounds which just feels more fair and honestly more skillful. You are also able to constantly switch items around, but are restricted to 1 item per character which lessens the problem of constantly trying to only give your best characters higher tier item combinations and then not using 80% of your items. It gives you a fuckton of information about stats, numbers [i] and your opponents [/i] which makes strategizing that much easier.

I honestly hope that TFT will pull ahead, but as it stands, Underlords is the best out of the 3 most popular Auto Chess games."
23279,Better Version of AutoChess
23280,"great game, but matches are too long
"
23281,It's pretty fun.
23282,Best auto chess with the best learning curve
23283,Dota Underlords is an overwhelming game. Overwhelming in terms of how good it is. It's a game that literally plays itself. You barely have to do anything at all. This is the future of gaming
23284,"Great game, want to see how it'll update in future)"
23285,It was meh gameplay felt slow ect just like a card game if ur into that type of thing then go for it personally im not about that :)
23286,"As a fan of Dota Auto Chess I definitelly can recomend Underlords as a good game of this genre. Sure, there are things that should be done before game become a good one but even for now Underlords are in completely good shape."
23287,I can't explain why but I have sunk too many hours into this game already
23288,Hey children do you like drugs ?
23289,Best Autobattler
23290,better for phone than pc.
23291,its very epic
23292,Bad game
23293,Not much has changed from the original Dota auto chess units wise but the end round mechanic does change game play a bit. I still personally prefer the original dota auto chess visuals and HUD. It is nice that you can play this game on most platforms.
23294,"Until now its quite fun and keeps on improving
yet I still suck at this game"
23295,Awesome
23296,Way better than the mod for sure
23297,Good job
23298,quite good game tbh
23299,"Cool game. Hopefully, new content will come out soon. The possibility to play it on a mobile phone is great!"
23300,"This is a very fun game!

23301,"Thank you Gaben, very cool."

23307,Strong contender in the 'auto-chess' genre.
23308,shit dont download
23309,better than hearthstone
23310,It's great great great!
23311,"Seems promising, the DOTA 2 AUTOCHESS mod has become an official game."
23312,ded.
23313,Great game to kill time but a tad bit unbalanced. There are just teams that are completely useless and RNG wins games for the most part
23314,really funny but a few composition are too easy to build and to strong
23315,Pretty fun game with a surprising amount of depth. This replaced Hearthstone for my downtime game.
23316,"for Summer Sale

have only played a bit
still good"
23317,Surprisingly fun for such simple mechanics
23318,Not bad
23319,"Good game, slightly unbalanced and RNG dependent."
23320,Needs the RNG to be fixed
23321,7/10
23322,Love playing Dota Underlords if you're a fan of strategy games you will probably like this game as well. Game is fun and simple to learn with bots practice if you don't want to dive straight into online.
23323,:)
23324,tft is way more fun
23325,.
23326,good game

23332,"very good, but lacking statistics and elo ranking"

23334,i jusr started playing the game as you can see but its not bad for a free to play game will keep you sucked in for a few hours
23335,nice game to kill time

23369,Nice
23370,I love autochess and this is a great take on it!
23371,"it's ok, but not as good as tft for the original mod."
23372,Valve is actually giving this game some love with frequent patches and updates. Worth trying if you like strategy games
23373,10/10
23374,It`s a really good game !
23375,If you have played Autochess in Dota 2 this is VERY similar.  The game play has been greatly improved and streamlined.  Menus are more intuitive.  Units are the same with some additions and tweaks.  This game is overall fun to play with a good stretegy aspect to it.  Can't go wrong with a free to play.
23376,Autochess!
23377,"Piece of garbage, very boring and unbalanced."
23378,"Really addictive gameplay, many possible strategies and simple interface. I prefer Dota Underlords Over TfT."
23379,cool
23380,Love it
23381,Great strategy game about DOTA. You draft a team of characters and try to match synergies in order to take down your opponents.
23382,"It's really fun and addicting, but this new Half Life 3 looks really weird."
23383,madonna l'rng degli eroi che ti capitano fa piu cagare di quello di phantom assasin nel gioco originale

23386,Just play TFT by riot games dude.
23387,"Very good!!! Ez to climb ranks, especially versus my friends who are noobs"
23388,"once great and enjoying game (when it first appeared in beta) , massacred by Valve incompetence once again, gg"
23389,Record fast release for Valve. Fantastic fast-paced strategy.
23390,meep murp
23391,Solid auto chess game
23392,"update 2: a unique combination of boring and annoying; time to uninstall.
---
Meh, it's kind of a mess. Seems more unbalanced now than ever.  Some alliances are useless, while others have little competition.  The nature of having a RNG core means there's little you as the 'player' can do strategically...

It really is just kinda watching as the game plays itself.  *yawn*

---
decent game, getting better regularly!  Looking forward to the real release... They make bold changes, it's kind of refreshing."
23393,great
23394,"Great game.

Smooth and properly optimised.

More enjoyable than auto chess."
23395,meh
23396,"Clean, simple UI, easy to pick up with a tutorial video or two from YouTube."
23397,It is a fun time waster but the game as it stands isn't well balanced
23398,Autp chess is better
23399,"Amazing game, and playable anywhere!"
23400,fun game but u need luck luck luck
23401,h
23402,O do lol e melhor
23403,best game
23404,bad
23405,"lil' bit of technique, other depends on RNG.
good game to destroy your life"
23406,"just play it , its a good game"
23407,"Quite a surprisingly good game from Valve, dota underlords has absorbed my life-"
23408,If u play druids ur fucking gay
23409,"There's a reason why the game has a ""RNG Hates Me!"" emote. Feels a lot like poker, but without the ability to bluff yourself to a win. 

Everything about the game is random. One match I had a 2  2-star units and a one star by round 4. Other times I've gone like 12 rounds without a 2 star unit. It can be a little frustrating if you feel like you're snake bitten for a few games in a row with the same poor luck. 

You can fight the best players in a multiplayer match 5 times before you fight the worst one. I find this odd. It's random in who you fight as well as the outcome. Sometimes you can lose 15 health at the same time the same guy is fighting your team comp and lose to you.

One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the limited number of cards you can hold in reserve, and all the shuffling necessary to try and get a meaningful combine.You can try and get rid of a card you've been holding for 15 rounds in the hopes that you can match another a higher tier level 2 that just showed up, only to reroll multiple times just to get the same card you just got rid of. Reroll again and get the same guy. Now you're pissed off cuz you feel like you would have had a combine on your other card (but would you really?) This can happen late in the match when you see your gold dwindle from 50 to 0 only to maybe get one combine that was barely useful. It's so random.

Sure, you can pull an awesome few cards late and feel like a come from behind champ, but when you're fighting against 8 people each match. If they know what they're doing too, the chance that you are going to luck into a bunch of wins in a row is pretty poor.

They really need to increase the time limit later in matches. I get that everyone is dealing with the same rules, but it's hard to shift your units on the board if you need to, then make a judgement call on what card to lose, what card to keep. How much gold you should hold, and how much to keep to manage for next game. Too many times I have gotten a level 3 combine .02 seconds after the buzzer for the next round, gotten matched up against someone I could have beaten, and lost the whole match (and probably a rank).

Maybe that's exciting to some people, but since strategy is about the only thing you can hope to influence on your way to victory, cutting it short for an arbitrary timer is annoying when there's so much to do in such a limited amount of time. Especially if you've been getting beaten down by ""bad luck"" for the entire match (or matches), only to see your salvation evaporate before it has a chance to fully materialize.

Lastly. There is not much in the way of progression in the game, so there's not much really to keep you coming back except for your enjoyment of the game."
23410,"Captivating.
Works surprisingly well on phone.
Balance has a long way to go."
23411,"nice but gets boring quickly , needs more content"
23412,Fun Game
23413,better than tft lmao

23417,autochess for phone
23418,Good game nice strategy elements
23419,More balanced than AutoChess and TFT combined. However game was designed for mobile and not for PC which is why I can not recommend this game over TFT. TFT also has a bigger playerbase while underlords is not as popular.
23420,Pretty fun
23421,"como que ganha isso?

23427,"Fun, challenging for both casual and competitive"
23428,"Молодцы, что так быстро создали игру. Нужно только немного отполировать игровой процесс и добавить побольше интересных фишек. Одним словом, не ограничиваться только добавлением новых героев."
23429,"It's kind of hard to find a way to recommend an auto-battler game to someone who hasn't played them before, so I think the most helpful advice I can give is to download it and try it for yourself. It's free, and not that big of a time commitment.

If you played and liked the drodo autochess mod, you will probably enjoy this as well, because it doesn't feel awful to navigate the menus and move pieces unlike the original, and it seems like updates are coming fast and furious to bring it up to the same level of content."
23430,dope
23431,"Considering how fast they pushed this out, and how fast they are patching things, the game is pretty solid. The game has a lot of potential. For now I recommend, we will see how it goes for the near-term."

23443,Better than the mod but the hero AI can sometimes be finicky.

23448,I am loving this right about now.

So for now I ignore some of the bugs and what I can say is that there are no major bugs that I know of.
It didn't crash and works just fine on both Linux and Android.
I like some of the changes they did compared to the auto chess mod."
23506,Pretty good. A lot better than the in game custom game on Dota 2
23507,opzd grbbrtm brertyx 2vera very fun
23508,wow much good
23509,It's a stand alone auto chess game. If you like auto chess your going to like this.
23510,A great game to sit down with the boys and just watch madness happen. The clutch feeling from going from losing to winning is amazing.
23511,"Good, overall version of the Auto Chess game for Dota. There is plenty of interesting and fun strategies to implement in game. If you are a growing fan of this game genre, then I would definitely give Dota Underlords a try. Plus, its free and you should play it."

23533,"It may has its bug, but I love it so far. It needs a lot of balancing but looks promising."
23534,"You win , you die, all by the hand of rng. 
In its current state there's no incentive to climb the ranks.

Skill has ALMOST nothing to do with winning. Whoever has the most shiny maxed out unit gets into top 3."

23536,Its like dota but with a chess board.
23537,yes
23538,"This game is pretty fun, its a good game to sit down with friends and play. However the only thing I do not like, is that the battles are all instanced, and your not really 1v1ing your opponent."
23539,It's just one of those games where you can play for 6 hours and it feels like 2.
23540,really nice game. enjoyable

23554,Too much RNG
23555,kossher mahz
23556,fun
23557,It is a video game.
23558,"solid start, promising in terms of updates/dev communication"
23559,I think with time this game could get better. Right now I would give it 3 / 5 stars while in BETA. Seems like there is only 1 or 2 valid strategies to win and a lost of it depends on RNG.
23560,Great take of the original DAC
23561,"Good Auto Chess 
10\10"
23562,Its like TFT but better
23563,very cool
23564,cool
23565,Too bare bones and concept not explained properly. It has potential and would be worth recommending after a few updates.
23566,hm
23567,Enfuriating amounts of RNG and balance. Just like dota. Thanks IceFrog
23568,"Good game, much wow!"
23569,Feels like a solid standalone of Dota 2 Autochess.
23570,tft
23571,is alright
23572,"Probably my new most favorite past time now. Also great on mobile, even when in the middle of the game, just take out your phone and you can continue with your match that you started on the pc!"
23573,"Great game, if you enjoy Auto-Chess, you will enjoy this. Because it is LITERALLY Auto-Chess in its own handy dandy game."
23574,There's a good bit of potential to be had here if valve actually cares for it and doesn't try to immediately turn it into a cash cow.
23575,Got Strange Bedfellows 4 games in a row. 10/10 would wreck face again.
23576,continuously evolving
23577,"well rounded, best Auto-Chess currently out there. Preference tho, test all 3"

Good game to play when waiting for the time to just clock out of the office.
"
23584,5/10
23585,"Fantastic Game to pass the time.  Simplistic to get started, however the game offers a deeper strategic growth as you play."
23586,not as good as tft xd
23587,"Fun, addicitive, full of replay value, better than TFT (imo) and reviewed for the gp. Get it, it's free ;)"
23588,Nice game
23589,"This is a fun game that's equal parts luck and skill.
I do wish there was a bit more between-player communication possibilities, though."
23590,uga buga
23591,nice game
23592,"yep
"
23593,"I liked it at the start but quickly got bored because in online competisions you have to go only for the 3 stars nothing else matters
not witch charackters were raised, not there prise, you just cant play with charackters you like just the ones you have first mater. 

And worst is that everything is standing on RNG which often drives you against a wall."
23594,Nice time killer.
23595,All fun and games
23596,Pretty good!
23597,"Fun but gets old very quick
"
23598,wow very addictive and fun great job valve don't do artifact again tho
23599,Better than copycat League shit.
23600,nice game
23601,Really good game to waste your time.
23602,Cool Game (y)
23603,Good game

23605,"A mod of DoTA 2 which is a mod of Warcraft III, 10/10"
23606,fun
23607,Good combination of skill and luck. Very fun and addicting.
23608,ok this is epic
23609,"Absolutely Astounding, the experience is bland, but seems fresh every single time you start a new round. It never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat when a unit uses a special that turns the game flat on its head definitely recommend to try even if it seems boring at first glance"
23610,fun
23611,very nice. simple and fun. even better then artifact
23612," It's not quite Dota2Autochess, but Underlords is a reasonable take on the autochess genre. The addition of guaranteed items and passive items is a good thing, but it feels far less communal than the mod."
23613,Muito bom !
23614,Team Fight Tactics is Better. Nice try dota. You suck. DOTA....I think mean: DONtA play this.
23615,You'll love it once you understand how the alliance and item system works. It's fun trying builds!
23616,a good game even though knight/troll combo seems abit too strong
23617,Not too different from the mod that was in dota 2.
23618,Better than TFT
23619,Sans is my fav character
23620,"Feels like all the other autochess clone games out there. However, compared to Dota 2 Autochess, I like the Dota 2 bonuses more than the Valve Dota Underlords bonuses. Warriors in Underlords are too op, Druids have a hard nerf, Mages got a straight buff to being op. I can't tell if rangers got a nerf or buff, but they're also op as hell. Knights just suck. I've never tried going Goblin Mechs in this game, but it's easy to destroy them with the right bonuses."
23621,"Fairly heavy reliance on RNG, even the same battle with the same deployment of all the same units with the same items can have widely different results."
23622,Games are too long but  it is fun.
23623,Really fun and well developed!

Druids for the win!"

23635,It's fun. I keep switching between this and TFT mainly because i play LOL more than dota2 but underlords is less rng dependent.
23636,Was ok for a bit but already kind of bored with it.

23638,Multiple of the same global buff is crazy 10/10
23639,It seems a little rough around the edges and the UI reminds me of a mobile game but overall its solid

23642,Fantastic piece of gaming

23645,best of the 3 auto chess games
23646,Great remake of DotA 2's mod AutoChess
23647,good.
23648,...
23649,"An oversimplified version of a great mod for DOTA 2, I recommend that as well DOTA Autdochess, but this version holds up on its own with some good QOL changes, such as quick moving of units or being able to switch items around on the fly."

23656,"Quite a nice time killer. Easy to pick up, has a lot of RNG, but it's pretty good."
23657,"a very fun and new experience, with a good flow of updates and balances so far"

23664,valve savior.
23665,meh
23666,Ever wanted a pocket Dota experience? This game gives it to you in one.
23667,ok
23668,cool
23669,RNG Sh*t
23670,nice improvement on the original
23671,I feel like I'm better at it than actual DOTA but It lack some of the unique character that you can only get through toxic teammates.
23672,Amazing game to play with friends
23673,Valve did a nice job making this game their own. The updates have been regular and well informed taking in community feedback and taking it seriously. The overall game deals with the RNG factor nicely by offering options that can be employed fully so long as they are done in a timely fashion.
23674,good game!!!!
23675,Good
23676,"PogU
"
23677,"Good game by great developer. Jump in for game, play for hours. Even if you suck, or ""RNG hates"" you, you will still get the feeling that there was a way for you to make it a win, which gives you a push to play more.
Also, it's fun"
23678,By far the easiest and most forgiving game of the Auto Chess/MABA genre while still being complex in it's own way.
23679,This game is good
23680,"Excelent game to sink some time. Still PC version not as good as original mod, since it lacks some features present in mod."
23681,I enjoy it
23682,:) nice
23683,Very fun and reasonably paced game. They are still tweaking it so we will have to see how the balance turns out. Hopefully we will get more talking units too.
23684,"Great game, thanks for the remake valve. Just one thing the courier... Why remove the courier?"
23685,best game eu if u bored
23686,"After 20+ hours, this game great to be able to take with me on my cellphone. When I'm home however, I prefer LOL TT. I hope this game starts providing rewards and progress at this point it's just a game to practice the concept with. But, still fun."
23687,It's fun even for a new player who has never played dota or auto chess.
23688,It's fun
23689,NICE GAME
23690,Actually better than the app
23691,nice game :'3
23692,Good game
23693,"Highly recommended game.
If you want a chill, drag and drop type of game with rng look no further Underlords is the game for you"
23694,Good game
23695,"Very cool Volvo, thanks Gabe"
23696,TFT is better :(
23697,"After watching several streamers and trying it for myself, i can say im very satisfied with this game.

For me its a lot cleaner looking than LOL's. Cant recommend a more casual game for friends."
23698,Love it.
23699,funz
23700,"To RNG heavy. If you wining even after only 2-3 players left you still have all chances to lose only because after 6-7 rolls you cant complete a single 2 star hero for your ""deck"" only because RNG decided to kills you and haunt for entire nights with dreams about bad RNG."
23701,A grand game
23702,it works
23703,Nice
23704,Quite good.
23705,Yes
23706,"The game is very nice alternative of fast playable and cross-platforming games. But still has disbalance and UI/UX issues, looking forward for changes."

23712,Decent
23713,"I haven't play it enough but I think this one isn't for me, i will try again to see if it triggers my fancy.
Edit: played this for a while now and it seems to be very interesting, sadly it's been bleeding people."
23714,good
23715,"Not bad at all. I haven't been playing this game much, but any time I did, I enjoyed it. I like how easy it is to unlock characters, and when no human players are in game, there are plenty of bots to play with. I got Underlords because its free and the over all reviews are very positive and I can tell the amount of recommendations for this game are only going to increase (unless Valve messes up). Thank you Valve for a new game!"
23716,"The way this game was designed will have you lose more matches than winning any as there is a major random element that if you don't get some luck, you are left in the dust. 
Even against the neutral waves (non hero mobs) your chance of winning is slim to none.

23729,nice
23730,"It's autochess on PC that runs like a mobile game... still autochess at its core with a few new pieces like Pudge etc. keeping the game fresh. 

The partying system could be more intuitive...

23744,"Without prior experience in the Auto Chess genre, I downloaded the game and was hooked right away. Game is addicting, looks beautiful and after the latest patches also runs like butter on my phone (except on the latter rounds). Game is quick to learn and after seeing the other games in the genre on Twitch, Underlords looks the best, has the best balance and has constant updates and communication from the development team. 10/10"
23745,Definitely better than tft

The gameplay is identical to Dota Autochess however lots of things have not been fully polished such as units,UI,gameplay and so on. However i am excited for it to be out from beta. Would predict it to be around 9/10 if everything is done right."
23754,ok

23767,:)
23768,"The mod was aweseome, this is even better!
Only thing I hate is that selling units only works if you put them in a very small spot on the side, which is very frustrating.
You should also be shown the keybinds ingame samoewhere like in Auto Chess!
Very well made game otherwise - i'm excited about the future of Valve now!"
23769,Good
23770,Отличная игра!
23771,ok
23772,Better Item RNG than DAC makes this auto chess game signifcantly more fair.
23773,like it! luck of the shop keeps you in the late game on this one and not being scared to swap out units at key points.
23774,pretty good
23775,"nice game . love it

23783,decent enough rip off
23784,"A refined and streamlined attempt of an autobattler, Dota: Underlords is as good an introduction into the genre as any. Matches can be quite long with a lot of downtime, so it's best for a few laid-back casual rounds, but it definitely has more depth than a mere time-killer. I recommend having a brief look into tutorials and strategies after getting a feel for the game, because you definitely have to play it by the rules if you want to be successful."
23785,"Edit: What has happened to this game!!! So much promise, and now it's been ruined

RNG Hates Me!

P.S.

F**K you Bloodseeker"
23786,This is a interesting spin on the basic auto chess game
23787,It is a good game but it involves luck so be carefull

23801,Excellent standalone for the dota autochess mod
23802,It's a solid interpretation of the auto-battler genre. I like a lot of the quality of life improvements they made over the old custom game version. Item randomness has been reduced with everyone getting a choice of items at the end of every neutral creep round. They added a lot of new items that are focused on unit categories.
23803,Nice game to play when u want to chill
23804,fun game

23806,Daora!

23808,"Good take on auto chess, still a lot to improve on.

- See others board
- A clear matchmaking ladder"
23809,"I didn't like how UI looks, but it's efficent.

23833,"Now I dont need Dota 2 installed anymore. 9/10, needs ironing out to prevent bad rolls from killing near assured victories."
23834,A great take on the new Auto-Chess Genre
23835,Dota Underlords is highly entertaining. The strategies and team building you have to do is super in depth.
23836,"Very RNG, much tactic, such wow"
23837,Bretty gud meme value
23838,not bad valve but pls don't kill it
23839,"Great Adaption, especially with the mobile integration"
23840,Not too difficult for new players. But a large information buy in. Very stripped down and simple. The trick is to find a well balanced team. It's improvisational strategy.
23841,Very Nice
23842,"Easy to pick up and entertaining. Use your favorite Dota2 heroes to fight automated games.
Defeat creeps to get items and collect multiple of the same hero to upgrade them. Finally you can form alliances to improve your army or get new skills!

Dota Underlords is a nice little game that can be played while watching videos, talking to people or even when you should be doing work!
An additional bonus is that it works perfectly with touch controls so you can even play while you should be sleeping!"
23843,Its ok
23844,"gr8 game. playing since the mod release from dota 2.
wish for more heros in the future releases :)"
23845,Best game in the world
23846,Great game
23847,"I'll make this review based on the comparison to the original Auto Chess mod, and perhaps a little bit with the mobile game one (which I'll refer as the original/OR), so here it is.

Pros:
[olist]
    [*]The environment, effects, character, basically all design is superb, as expected from Valve. Their unique mark and touch can be seen everywhere.
    [*]Item mechanics: Love it. Always ensure that every player would get one and giving them the ability to choose. Perhaps opinion would be divided here, between Underlords (choose 1 in each neutral round, 1 item/hero, can be removed&moved to other units), and the OR (RNGod, 6 item/hero, cant be transferred/removed unless you sell the unit). But IMO, each of the mechanics suit each game, and each has their own pros&cons.
    [*]Still on item, the addition of passive items makes it more challenging and forces you to think about how each of your units are interacting and arranged.
    [*]Addition of new units are pretty well designed.
    [*]The effects of alliances are more balanced than the OR, especially Knights, and Primordial/Elemental(OR).
    [*]Addition of keyboard shortcuts are nice, as expected from a big company with their standards.
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
    [*]The User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) is just annoying. Designs are well made, but their positioning and size aren't that good. The most obvious one is how some (or even most) elements are too big in size, compared to the OR that has everything compact. Some element positioning can also be improved. 

I do understand that they want the arena to be the center of attention with all the battles and stuff, but the sidebars are important parts of the game, and having a hard time looking at them aren't going to make us happy when the time is limited.
    [*]Need to add explanation about how the damage to health works (or did I miss it when I'm reading the guide?, I'm sorry if I'm mistaken)
    [*]Mobile is still having problem, even though I played on PC. It's according to my friend btw, so PC Master Race.
[/olist]

That's all from me, and as you can see there's more pro then cons, and it's still in Beta so there's a lot of room for development. Basically this game is on the right track, very recommended. This kind of game is the kind that you can play while relaxing but still very competitive."
23848,nice game
23849,"Really nice game if you like the Auto-Chess genre. Easy to learn, hard to master, tons of possibilities."

23862,good game! crack on
23863,pretty fun
23864,good
23865,"Pretty similar to poker, focusing on long-term planning and creating specific builds and team compositions. Small skill barrier of entry, but once past it, you'll be winning quite often. Looks complex at first, but it's a very simple game. Currently lacking content, ends up being repetitive after a while, but the devs are delivering patches nonstop, so that's prone to change. Fun game, give it a shot. Also on mobile!"

23888,nixe try
23889,yes
23890,"If you like deckbuilding games, it's kinda like that but with this gridbased auto-battle system. It's good and gets regular updates. Also, IT'S FREE!"
23891,"Good one. Need more new units tho.
More units. Even better."
23892,haha
23893,"Great game, interesting and very addictive. Only one suggestion, time for turn could be few seconds longer."
23894,"1. Get 5 axe in the first round
2. Never see any warriors again
3. ???
4. Cry after finishing 8th place

10/10 would press the play button again"
23895,Just here for the max points :)
23896,"this is perfect for the days that you don't have nothing to do, great game once you get the hang of it"

23911,I'm sure it will be great. Glad there isn't a chat function.
23912,Very Good
23913,Better then Artifact
23914,"Great adaptation of the original auto chess mod, still some improvements needed like better communication system, some way to implement voice chat, easier way to check opponent chess boards. The game is still in beta so hopes are high that in time changes will be incorporated"
23915,"mantap bang, susah susahj nikmat"
23916,Good game.
23917,Noice of a beta
23918,GOOD GAME.
23919,This game is dope. 20 min with 100 HP and then 2 guys kick your ass with all 3-star heroes who come from nowhere. 11/10
23920,I think its great game but its hard to beat.
23921,good
23922,it's perfect because when you lose you can just blame RNG
23923,Goog Game
23924,I felt this game was too slow and preferred tft out of the auto chess genre
23925,"This game is fun. You get better each round and level up as you get a feeling which characters work good together.

Some people argue that it is easy to learn but hard to master. That is kind of true since the basic game is pretty simple, but to be good, you need luck (RNG) and have to learn all the properties of the characters. It is like in school where you have to learn a lot of stuff for a test that is not relevant for your daily life. The knowledge of this game might even be irrelevant in the next season.

I don't want to learn random stats of the characters and rather play something more ""casual"" like CS:GO where i actually can just have fun without knowing the names of the weapons are etc. I consider this game a waste of time since i don't like to play competitive and rather like games where i can play cooperatively.

The graphics are good, i like the style. The mechanics feels good, but could be faster. VR support like Dota 2 has would be amazing!

Considering that this game is an early access beta, it is already very good and fun. The best part about it is that Valve actually released a new game and hopefully learn from its development to release earlier and more frequently and communicate more with the community. Can't wait to see other projects!"
23926,mobiilimäng
23927,This game doesnt deserve the beta tag atm. It is way more polished than a beta game should be. Best of luck for season 1.

23967,"Still pretty RNG, but having it mobile is great"
23968,The latest updates were great. Underlords is becoming a complete autobattler experience and I can't wait to pour more hours into this game.
23969,"Bonzão, lek"
23970,"Literally wizard poker. Get a full house, straight, or flush and win. The auto-battle animations are just a bonus. The auto-battles make me nostalgic for old games like Ogre Battle or the more recent Gratuitous Space Battles. Both games I also highly recommend. If Valve develops some kind of single-player adventure mode like Ogre Battle this may actually become my favorite game of all time.

Multiplayer online games are pretty long but performance is good on my LG V20, which is fairly old now. You can play offline and pause games against bots. Amazing features out of the box for a beta. It's been an active beta with lots of balances and improvements already."
23971,It's a lot of fun. Try it out if you haven't yet

The cool part is Android-PC crossplatformness!"
23985,"06/30/2019:

Shows a ton of promise. More nuanced than one would think. Will be interested to see where it goes! Will update accordingly... for now, you seriously can't beat the price. Technically infinite bang-for-your-buck.

10/31/2019 (Update):

Wow, the improvement in this already-decent game has been phenomenal. Additions like ""jail"" (small, calculated random daily rotation of the hero pool) and the Underlord units themselves have added significant depth AND daily variety. At this continued rate of improvement, this will be the ""undisputable best strategy game ever made"" by 2021. 

That's to say: It's getting good quick, so check it out!"
23986,.
23987,nice game items are very important

24010,"This game is pretty much the same as autochess was with a couple of changes to the UI and being able to just click and drag pieces rather than having to use keyboard. Some of the formatting is still a bit dodgy, but that should get polished out.

The item system has been improved from random drops to a more interesting ""drafting"" items if you win and a random one if you lose the neutral rounds.

The interest system has been changed so that it check how much you have at the start of the round rather than the end. This has some implications when rolling during the round, but you are still limited by bench space so it might be fine?

In general, this is basically the same game, but a little cleaner."
24011,fun little mini games
24012,it is good
24013,"Greatly balanced and entertaining, good for casual palys when you want to waste 20-30 min"

- More balanced mechanism than autochess mod
- Item mechanism is a big plus
- Great BGM ...  hair..grows...C C (this is what I heard)

Cons
- lack of reward mechanism, so less motivation to play"

24034,Fun game.
24035,"LOVE this game between Drodo's mobile version, Riot's TFT, and Underlords. Underlords is easily my favorite version it has the best version of the item system that isnt TOO rng and doesn't reward mindlessly stacking your items on your single best unit."
24036,highly addictive
24037,Need more balance
24038,Fun game
24039,big update was awesome so many new heroes and underlords finally here! love it
24040,A really good revamp of one of the best custom games from dota 2

24043,JUST WIN 4Head
24044,Great!
24045,"[h1]A FUN GAME WITH OBVIOUS FLAWS[/h1]
As the title said Dota Underlords is a very fun and engaging game.
For starters, the number of heroes and combinations are the main reason why the game is so fun
while some might argue that it can be pretty overwhelming, I personally think that such a feature 
can open up many new opportunities and playstyle.

The cross-play between mobile and PC is also a very good addition to a fairly casual game as Dota Underlords.
Valve also consistently updates and patch the game so good for them and for us.
Now my only real issue with this game is that some heroes feel ridiculously underpowered and rather useless in 
most combinations which cause them to be less picked than their more 'superior' counterparts.
Also, the RNG can be a pain in the ass sometimes and while skills are fairly important, 'Luck' I think also play rather
a large or maybe even larger role than actual skill. 

[spoiler]it really shows when someone had a two 2 star hero at the fourth round.[/spoiler]

Overall its a solid game with fun gameplay and its worth to try out.
7.5/10"
24046,the friendlier autochess
24047,"Pretty fun, if only RNG was not such a big factor in the game"
24048,Good!
24049,"A moderately entertaining Auto-chess. I got pretty bored with it after about 6 hours though, so it may not hold your interest for long, but it is free."
24050,yes
24051,"Pretty Good Game, What else is there to say"
24052,It might be the game of the future ..
24053,"Easily addicting, testers beware. I do get frustrated when you endlessly search for a unit you have with no luck. Would love to see more units but concerned that the aforementioned issue would get in the way without more buying slots."
24054,Fun game. Many updates so far.
24055,I like this game a lot. It is super nice that you can play on mobile and then you can switch to pc during a game.
24056,Glad they didn't fuck this game up like Artifact
24057,Good
24058,very good fun
24059,Literally the most RNG based game ive ever played! After a certain skill level it's just purely luck.
24060,Gets boring after a while with no reward system. Other than that its rly ok
24061,"Fun to play. The UI and Control is a lot better than the original DOTA Autochess. Still has room for improvement, but overall is a good experience."
24062,Nice!
24063,"Best version of ""auto chess"" with updates every week and even though an early beta, feels like quite complete with just few additions needed ."

24080,Gabe
24081,"Solid game, takes roughly 30-40 minutes to complete a competitive game vs other humans, and stands up well when played via tablet/phone (majority of my gameplay). A bit too much RNG when it comes to 'levelling up' your heroes, which can be really crippling once you move past the early game though."
24082,The heavy RNG dependency quells my thirst for gambling
24083,Still needs a bit of improvement but okay at the moment.

24087,Best AUTOCHESS

Haven't played much Dota Autochess, so pretty new to this game, but always able to get second or third rank.
RNG sometimes pretty annoying, especially the shop, but everyone has that issue, not just one player tho.

I wish there were some kind of reward system for top 3. Some points to buy some different arena layouts or anything."

The stats of each character in this auto-chess game are somewhat similar to the character stats in DotA 2. 
If you play lots of DotA 2, you will probably enjoy this. 

It is nothing like chess."

There is always one thing more you could pay attention to.
Some amount of luck involved of course, but it doesn't feel too bad."
24138,Pray the RNGesus will bless you and u can win
24139,"The game is a bit lacking in depth but it is still in early access so this should be fixed in the long run. At least it is considerably polished with minimal bugs and glitches. Compared to the other autochess variants currently on the market, Underlords has the least amount of RNG, which is another plus. Overall, even in it's current state the game offers a fun take on the autochess formula."

24213,A bit buggy here and there but it still has a lot of potential to be developed. The mechanics are simple and mirrors some of the 'other' games tackling this genre of 'auto-chess'. Fun if you love DOTA and just want to see the heroes in team-fights doing minimal work.

24232,Great game.
24233,"Super fun and addicting, best ""Auto Chess"" IMO compare to the others currently in the market"
24234,"So far, Underlords is the most balanced autochess. TFT and AutoChess mobile have their own OP Comps that, if you are lucky, it's an easy win. While sometimes it also happens in Underlords, I've seen many different comps work, and some nice comebacks as well. If you're into the genre, you should try it!"
24235,фвіфіва
24236,The only version of Chess I am smart enough to win at.
24237,"Fun game!

Easy to pick up and play at any time and there's tons of different combos or setups you can go with.

5 out of 5 toasters."
24238,"Лучше шахмат в ирл. Хотя все равно нихуя не понимаю, но поставлю класс, да. 5+. Габен блять лучше бы выпустил 2 сундук, а не это."
24239,chess
24240,"This is Dota2 Autochess but playable. No, seriously just the fact that you can drag and drop you pieces is a huge quality of life change. There are also some rebalances that make certain combos more viable. In all this is a great time waster like hearstone."
24241,"Stays fairly close to the original DAC, has some interesting balance changes which I feel are an improvement over the old DAC. Decent interface but laggy as hell on mobile. Overall great considering it's free."
24242,cool :)
24243,"Underlords is a really interesting take on the Auto-Chess genre. It's much more streamlined then the original mod.

Since there is no item stacking, like in AC or Teamfight Tactics, it's much more focussed on the whole teamcomp, especially in combination with global items, which can totally enhance or even change your gameplan.

At the moment, i lacks a bit of depth compared with TfT, but I'm sure, that will come in time and I'm interested in playing it, while it evolves."
24244,Its a fun chill game
24245,"[h1][b]The Best[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Smoothness[/b]. The game feels smooth and nice, fixing one of the most important negative spects from DAC.
[*][b]User Interface.[/b] The ingame interface is just dope. Real-time charts? Yo. Splitted DPS between attacks, ultimates, and items? Yo. Pleasant colours? Yo. Full sinergy information? Yo. Be able to see who are you attacking (sword icon)/defending(shield icon)? Yo. People complained about being too much mobile focused, but you have to keep in mind Dota Underlords, unlike other games out there, is a crossover multiplatform game, which is fantastic.
[*][b]Item mechanics[/b]. Dota Underlords fix the major DAC problem: players that started poorly are extremely punished since they do not get items, and they keep losing HP. I think the mechanic proposed here is close to be perfect. Note: I would make last PvE rounds harder in order to give them more epicness, right now the Dragon, Trolls, and MonstarNian are too easy (moreover I would be a slight nerf to mages, which is necessary in my opinion).
[*][b]Graphics.[/b] Subjective topic, you can love them, or hate them. I do love this kind of graphics. Mobile friendly. I hope people that do not like them, do not wait hyped for Borderlands 3. :'P
[*][b]Gold Interest.[/b] The fact of getting the interest by the gold amount at the beginning of the battle reduces the early game RNG because you can buy everything from the shop, check if the next free roll helps you, and if It does not you can sell everything with no drawbacks.
[/list]


[h1][b]What I Would Change[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Something to farm[/b]. Candy system in DAC was neat. I would add something to progress ingame further than the rank system.
[*][b]Dragon Alliance. [/b]Dragons are epic by nature. They should not be easy to get, and they should not fill in every lineup. Since you are sacrificing synergy slots due to their different nature, they should offer a high reward, corresponding the high risk you are taking. Currently the fact that you only need two dragons in order to get their bonus lost all their epicness, and lost the risk, therefore they can't offer the reward I talked before.
[*][b]Opponents sequence.[/b] ""The easiest way to accomplish this would be ""pulling opponents out of a hat"". This way you play against every opponent once in the first 7 player-rounds. Every fight gets you a more predictable opponent, and for fight 7 you actually know whom you're playing against. This way repositioning and maybe even switching champions would become relevant much earlier in the game, and would greatly increase skill-cap, while also making the game more accessible to newbies."" — u/OrdinaryPriority
[/list]


[h1][b]Unpopular opinion[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Lonely feeling.[/b] Not for me. You can check quickly how are your opponents doing, how is your army doing versus someone, who you are attacking and defending, as well as who is your friend attacking/defending.
[*][b]Alliance icons under benched units.[/b] I don't see this as a good idea. I mean, this information would be redundant once you learn the alliances. Would it help new players? Yes. Would new players want to get rid of it once they get experience? Yes. Could it be an optional feature? Yo.

When I'm working on my laptop, it distracts me. When I take a work-break to talk to my wife on the phone, it distracts me. When I settle into bed with my tablet to watch my favorite shows, it distracts me.

If new, it's best to play on the PC because hovering over icons while playing is a great way to learn. It's fun to see new things being added, and it's quite stable on all platforms.

This is going to be a huge hit."

Hopefully it doesn't go the way of ""pay to win"" as that would be tragic! All I need now is a chart showing what is strong and weak against what other things!

That aside, I think they should change heroes abilities, they don't as efficiently as they are in dota since you can't expect AI to be able to use all those complex skills(though both sides are AI so this doesn't broke balance). Overall, it seems like a boring game and too much time consuming."
24412,ok
24413,great game super competitive and fun
24414,Fun
24415,"So far I'm not surprised that this game has far more players than other authochess's could dream of! 
A really fun game for anyone who wants to solo or play with friends (against them, actually). Plenty of builds and variations to try, plenty of characters to choose from, enough chances to try to counter someone else,  enough opportunity to try to come back from the lowest of low. 
All in all, am very happy I decided to try this game. 

The only two things that might ruin this game is:
1. If they somehow manage to make it a pay-to-win game (they gotta earn money somehow, right? Just hope it will be some cosmetic or battle-pass style, not PTW).
2. If all of a sudden they won't listen to community. So far they've been great though - nerfed what was OP, buffed what was underpowered etc...And let's hope their ears remain open to the community :)

If you haven't tried this, defo do!

24418,"It's amazing how mods lead to new game modes then potential new games. DoTA Underlords came from such a development, and I'm glad to say that it is receiving that level of polish from Valve.

It's a draft-based auto-battler with synergies and items. I hope they expand the alliances/synergies as they add more units and items as well, and bring a bit of a balance (coughDROWcough).

Solid transition from mod to a game and as a bonus also on mobile, but needs further balancing and more units, alliances content. 11/10 will streak wins again."

And valve did a pretty good job at making this game accessible very quickly, currently this game is also available on the PlayStore and the AppStore. The best part about this game is that it supports cross-platform multiplayer.

24467,"INDONESIA REVIEW

Pertama kali gue main chess beginian itu di Autochess yg sekedar cobain sekitar 5 game dan nyerah sama gameplaynya. Dalam hati gue mungkin emang gue gk tertarik main game chess2 gini. Tapi, setelah Dota Underlords ini rilis, gue nyobain pertama kaliya dan punya kesan ""kok easy to learn ya dibanding autochess"". Dan ternyata emang bener, temen2 gue yg gk pernah main autochess pun bisa cepet belajar dan sampe sekarang keracunan ini game.

Dari segi grafis, standar aja. Bedanya disini atmosfer lebih dipergelap, dan ada fitur borderline di setiap karakter heronya. So far, gk ada cons di bagian ini, mungkin berharapnya cuma ditambahin animasi2 apa gitu kyk Artifact biar gamenya gk ngebosenin di bagian background (chessboard)nya.

Dari segi gameplay, easy to learn, hard to master. Belajar ini game bentar doang pasti udah bisa, masalahnya, belajar mechanicsnya yg rada ribet dikarenakan fitur informasi mengenai hero, interest, items, dll itu gk ada di game ini. Cons yg cukup besar menurut gue, karena player harus belajar/berkembang seiring jam terbang bermain.

Overall, gue gk tau gmn ntar valve bakal jadiin ini sapi perahnya (sistem micro transactions), yg pasti, so far sih ini game udah mulai keangkat publisitasnya dan mulai punya banyak player2 baru. mungkin sekitar 6 bulan lagi bakal keliatan gmn cara Valve ngurusin game ini"

24507,"Not my normal type game, but gave it a try and really enjoying it. Looking for other titles like this."
24508,"Yea nah, Nah yea"
24509,good game
24510,"Not bad but it feels too rushed and much less interesting than direct competitors like TFT. After playing those said competitors for a while you start seeing how much more shallow and boring Underlords is. 

Pretty much bang average for the genre. No reason to play it when there are clearly superior alternatives out there"

24512,sometime UX is hard to understand but it's fine
24513,very nice game :D
24514,Its pretty good but auto chess is better
24515,Awesome game!
24516,"What can I say?
Boring game, nothing to do just watch, how game plays by itself. I did not played dota autochess before, just only got invite from my friend, but, on the next day the game avaliable for everyone"

24524,"Good game. I really enjoyed this new genre (new for me).
But there are some suggestions from me:
-Add battle cutscene
-Add card planner
-Adjust and adapt game time and graphics for mobile user
-Add ""buy if appear"" features in shop
-Add ""view mode"" for not boring scene
-Competitive matches.
"
24525,"Probably the best auto chess variant I have played so far - balances the RNG elements of items and characters very well, making every game feel different and doesn't make games feel unfair due to item discrepancies like other auto chess games."
24526,"More user friendly than Auto Chess but still lacking a lot of fun synergie, units and an easy stat overview. Item system is vastly improved though."

You do have to be able to stomach RNG not favoring you and losing simply because you had a good setup but then never saw those units again to upgrade them.

A bit to much luck involved for my liking and some aspects are still rough but for a beta it is pretty polished"

24625,Garbage
24626,"The game is still in rather early beta, so there's a lot of improvements to be had (especially regarding the UI), but the gameplay itself is already very fun. If you have ever played the Auto Chess mod in Dota 2, then this game is probably going to replace the mod completely.

Pros:
[list]
 [*] strategic and engaging gameplay,
 [*] already has a ranked mode, so competitive players can prove their skill,
 [*] simple, but decent tutorial,
 [*] has an offline/bots mode, with 4 difficulty levels,
 [*] also available for iOS/Android,
 [*] AMAZING mobile integration (seriously, you can start the game on PC, close the game and then rejoin it on your phone, it's seamless),
 [*] developers are communicating a lot on Twitter/Reddit and update the game multiple times a week,
 [*] it's F2P, and Valve already proved that their F2P model is fair.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
 [*] UI is very mobile-like, needs changes, so we can see more stats etc.,
 [*] gameplay feels ""lonely"", but devs are already working on improving that,
 [*] missing some key features (like, you know, the Underlords themselves), but they are also working on it,
 [*] personal opinion, but the game could be less ""dark"", maybe we'll be able to change that with cosmetic boards or something."

24660,"I had not played the autochess arcade during the craze, so I was completely new to this game. Nonetheless, after I tried one round, I was able to figure out the game rather quickly. Thus my review as follows:
Pros:
1. Easy to pick up
2. Cross platform with iOS/Android
3. RNG, tactics and strategies makes it not repetitive and rather fun and full of challenges
4. You don't get toxic chat because chat has already been simplified

Cons:
1. Mobile platforms are not performing smoothly (but I think my graphics were no longer very choppy after last update on my android phone)
2. You don't get to ""socialise"" with other players (there's no chat rooms per se if you are into socialising or straight up trash talking)"
24661,"It's like autochess mod, but better."
24662,:)
24663,this game rad
24664,"Dota Undertakers belongs to a genre slowly becoming known as the ""auto battler.""  This game takes a team built from the familiar heroes in Dota 2 and pits your team against 9 other people.  The goal is to build synergy within your team using items, composition, and most of all - traits.  Traits like ""Warrior"" or ""Savage"" stack, and each unique monster with a specific stat counts toward a cumulative team total.  Use your wits and steep yourself in strategy with this beauty, Dota Undertakers is a well-polished game (even in its beta form) and has the potential to be a serious competitive game."

24669,"good game, and I still new in here so idk much about the game, but i like it"

24677,"Dota Underlords is a great start for valves take on the auto chess genre; however i think theres room for improvement, i think it could use a secondary ""ghost board"" during fights so you can move pieces around while youre actually able to see what works where and what doesnt. another trope i have is that it could use a few side things to check or do, idk stats dmg amount of dmg taken just a general board of all the piece stats so theres something to check and do while the fights go on. just small improvements and addings here and there, other than that fantastic game, keep up the great work!"
24678,"Time to waste this what you called ""TIME""

24681,"Das Spielsystem ist insgesamt besser als Auto Chess, insbesondere die Itemvergabe. Wobei die Globlen Items noch sehr unbalanciert sind. 
Aber hier fehlt definitiv noch etwas für das Auge! Kaum Action auf dem Feld, keine bzw. kaum äußerliche veränderungen beim aufleveln, etc. Leider merkt man sehr, dass hauptsächlich an den Endkunden am Handy nicht am PC gedacht wurde."

24697,"Everyone cheats + RNG + OP builds+ lack of builds = really not worth playing anymore. I've won enough games with different builds to know when I'm being cheated so it gets real old when you lose because game cheats your damage/unit or player 2 gets every item and every unit and every spell exactly when and where they need it to counter you. If the game was a 6 player free for all instead of 8 player it could be better but that's if they fix the cheating problem and add a lot more units,abilities,items,ect."

24706,Summer sales told me to...
24707,"Surprisingly addicting. I was against the fence for trying this as it looked too RNG based, even though it does have RNG elements it is highly skilled based from coin management to the unit composition you choose, highly recommended to give the ""Auto Chess"" genre a try."
24708,"Absolutely love it.

"
24719,"too lazy to go with tutorial, too noobish to play with fellas

edit nov 2019: i still suck donkey balls at this game... too many updates/nerfs/op.."
24720,"This is a polished version of Dota 2's Auto Chess mod. They have removed the crafting and made it so each chess piece can only equip one item at a time. You can move items around as they are not bound like they are in the Dota 2 mod. They also changed a few race/class bonuses and how they work like Druids for example. 

I enjoy this much better than the Dota 2 mod. I have spent 15 minutes in the Dota 2 mod attempting to get into a game while going through a cycle of queueing, loading, and then the game requeues me automatically because someone left and then it looped a few times before I got into a game. There is nothing like that in this game. The queues are fast and at any time you can see all the chess pieces and their info while in game. There are mobile and PC viewing mode and they vary a bit, so there is options for how the UI looks. 

If you liked Auto Chess then ditch Dota 2 and play this!"
24721,Addictive! still need a couple of new content and balanced heroes
24722,i like it
24723,"Why I am stopping Underlords... ...


... ...I need to sleep"
24724,Very fun very toxic
24725,too much RNG.
24726,"I've never played the main DOTA game, but apparently this here is derived from a mod called Autochess, a self-explanatory name.
But I'm not really sure this one has anything to do with chess. You only control the management part, and as soon as the fight begins, the units fight on their own while you watch.
So what is the game expecting you to do, exactly ? 
Simple. Hire heroes, place them on the grid, and attribute them items.
And by ""hire heroes"" I mean spam the reroll button so you can have that one piece that's cruelly weighting you down for not coming out.
Heroes level up when you acquire three of the same hero of the previous level. And they grow a lot more powerful when they do, so not being able to find the last hero to level up can be really frustrating, and lead to unavoidable defeat.
The game is only expecting you to do a single thing of the whole game, and it's the most RNG-based thing there is.

So yes, this is a bit like chess. If chess forced you to roll a dice everytime you made a strategical choice.
Just another DOTA mobile spin-off."
24727,This is has been the most addictive game since cs go !
24728,Good game but the tutorial takes its time. When you fucked it up at the beginning you can't win.
24729,"I thought this will be a quick match game, but surprisingly it didn't bother me at all. Some things need to get balanced I think."

24731,mehh.....
24732,Gud gaem
24733,"This game is great, better than Autochess, but it needs a better graphics not this cartoon which is good for mobiles"
24734,Okay for passing time. it's a looooongg game. not that rng. but some hero packs are definitely stronger than others. dragon and knight units need more damage.. still early mode so it can get better.
24735,"This game recipe is nice, could use a pinch of spice. 
Any truers in the chat?"

Most of my friends are new with this game and the characters in general but they easily got the hang of this game.  It's definitely more wholesome when you got friends to play with. Solo is sorta boring"
24748,Strategic skill thinking game that will blow your mind
24749,"at first it's nice, keeps you going, looking for better team-compositions. after some time you find the meta and than you realize how RNG is everything in this game. if RNG is the salt in a good game, this one is salty AF!

24780,"Even though Valve published the game much earlier than they probably wanted, it already shows a lot of promise. Compared to the Auto Chess mod, the game looks better and many concepts, such as the item system, have been improved significantly. In my opinion it feels more balanced as well. The only thing that the game is really missing is some kind of turbo mode. It's not uncommon for games to take 40 minutes. That's a bit long, especially for those who play the game on their smartphone. One game draining half of a phone's battery isn't exactly great either.

Update: Since my review, a quicker game mode has been introduced and the game doesn't drain battery as fast any more. It's still not close to feeling finished, but fun nevertheless."

The new system is a lot less RNG based and in my opinions adds  more strategy elements. The lack of customisation is one big negative though, the game does sometimes feel empty. However, I do believe that this is a good successor to the Auto Chess mod."
24814,Very Nice
24815,RIP
24816,can play ah but auto chess better
24817,"DOTA Underlords took me by surprise. I wanted to see what the 'AutoChess' hype was about so I decided to give it a chance. I did not expect to like this game as much as I do... especially because I used to favor playing League of Legends over Dota 2 back in the day. 

This game fills a need I had almost forgotten I had. I'm someone who always enjoyed doing things in RTS games like making a certain type of army/attack squad/defense grid and just watching the battle play out. I'm also that one dude who always loved the 'gladiator pits' type options in games like Dungeon Keeper II. This game takes this, mixes it with the feel of a card-game like Hearthstone and adds some extra's on top. 

It's deep, has a lot of mechanics (including comeback mechanics from a losing streak, intentional or not) yet makes everything pretty easy to learn due to the fact that the (oddly large and mobile oriented...) UI provides a lot of information. This game is very addictive, runs well and is the first in a long time that just sucks hours out of my free time with the whole ''I'll just do one more match before I go to bed'' thing it's got going on. 

I also play its direct competitor Team Fight Tactics (by Riot Games). In my opinion Dota Underlords wins in every category except for one very important one which Valve should take a look at: player interaction/providing the feeling of a 'visceral'  win. In DOTA Underlords in this point in time you only fight 'clones' of your enemies boards. There's no chat functionality and no way to physically interact with your opponents. TFT has you and your opponents always watching the same fight, has chat functionality and has couriers that can walk/emote/do silly stuff to interact with your current opponents. 

If Valve works on this one issue (and makes sure its battle-pass is going to be fun) I'll probably drop TFT since balance and comeback mechanics are far superior in Dota Underlords. 

I highly recommend anyone to check out a few youtube videos and download this game: you mnight be very pleasantly surprised as I was."
24818,o do lol é melhor
24819,great game
24820,"It's like crack, but somehow legal.  
The UI needs some tooling, but it's gonna get there."
24821,Nice auto-battle.
24822,the best way to experience the Autochess genre
24823,somewhat okay
24824,GABEN 'LL TAKE MONEY SOON
24825,Valve has done a great job with this game.
24826,nice game
24827,"It needs rewards , some work but overall it is good. The mobile version is a little to demanding though."
24828,haissss demon strat so freakly difficult
24829,"A very good game of auto chess

24830,harder than dota lmao
24831,"It has become an standalone autochess game, and I like it"
24832,You should try it.
24833,Better than other competitor :D
24834,Good game !!!
24835,"good

24844,Interesting game lol
24845,"Very cleanly made game, even in beta the game feels really good and really fun."
24846,Memes
24847,Nice game but still has alot of bugs
24848,too RNG
24849,Fun little game
24850,A little too dependent on RNG. Tutorial needs work.
24851,"Good game, devs are fairly quick to fix bugs, even when new ones pop up with new patches. Willing to experiment with new features and take them out if they prove half-baked (see noises from other player's boards)."

24866,pepega game
24867,Good game.
24868,Easy to pick up and play auto chess.
24869,Fun mobile game
24870,"Well, the game is fun and light. Easy to pick up and play.

But the RNG is somewhat rigged. I'm looking for just 1 Abaddon and there is only 2 of mine on the table ( no one else have it), and I spend like 10 re-roll but it did not show up. It just happen that some heroes will not show up in a particular game. Love to play and learn more about chance of these happen..

"
24871,good job valve
24872,"Shitty game tho?
"
24873,Go Corgi
24874,Having fun so far
24875,"After playing for a bit I can fully confirm this is a RNG-fiesta type of game. You can go in with a plan and get some insanely strong globals, like double strange bedfellows, but get nothing at all that lets you use it for long enough that you've already invested into another strategy so you end up just wasting those drops from neutral creeps. There's skill involved, yes, but a not small portion of the outcome of a game is dictated strictly by RNG and it's not the good type of RNG. It's the type where you're waiting on one unit to get the power-spike you need to turn the tides but it never comes even after spending 30-40 gold on rerolls. One too many times have I hit late game with 0 3 star units. Game starts out fun as you learn it but quickly becomes stale and extremely frustrating after you know what's what and you're trying to win. I only got to Rank Boss level 1 before I just utterly lost interest."
24876,Very addictive. The strategy that you choose effect the result.
24877,Good game to get addicted !
24878,nice
24879,May seem silly but no pause option for Proto Pass killed the game for me.
24880,Nice implementation but as of now RNG matters too much.
24881,good game
24882,Quite a well designed game. But probably takes up too much time per game
24883,this is totally me when im driving
24884,Very nice game!
24885,"Although the concept is not from Valve, Valve has capabilities to make the concept into a more completed solution, performance has been greatly optimized, UI is also nice."
24886,great!
24887,kek
24888,yeet
24889,"I enjoyed the fast pace and randomness, but the rules are a bit vauge. I loved how random and exciting it was though, very fun yet tacktick."
24890,Game itself is not bad but I would like to see more freedom for customization after the beta ends such as more maps or player profile picture.
24891,"Easy to play, but hard to master."
24892,"Great game. And... When you start game on PC, you can finish it on mobile. :-)"

24895,gud
24896,you can play on phones!
24897,good
24898,Far more entertaining then expected.
24899,"Nice time consuming game but need some more fixes or updates to fine tune it. Also, the time per match (more than 30min in average unless you get knocked out very soon) is a bit longer than most people can afford in weekday. So far it's good start and look forward to seeing some more exciting improvements."

24901,my brain stop working after the new update
24902,"im not recommending this current state of underlords (i was when it was first released). dev doesnt seem to read my suggestion at the feedback bar so im gonna write it here. my first autochess game is the one as a mod in dota 2, so i know my fair share of knowledge about autochesses games.

after the ""Jull-tide Greetings"" the game took a nosedive, from good to ruined. this are my opinion to the current version.

(+)

1. unique chess piece called ""underlord"" that both damage your enemy and buff your team;

2. unique mechanism that you can remove items to other heroes if that hero already equipped with that item;

3. choosing of underlords is now at round 10, where you given a great chance to counter your enemies and strengthen your team;

4. unique gameplay of ""knockout"" where you only need 4 loses to be defeated. its far more faster and the perfect mode if you are busy;

5. unique gameplay of ""duo mode"" where you grab your friend and create a team and fight 2v2. you could give them money, units and your HP is combined, if you take damage he also take damage;

6. sandbox mode, where you can tryout a new composition for your team;

7. special effect of ""Aces"" where it give a bonus effect to that particular alliance, not all aliance has aces for now.

(-)

1. removal of unique mechanic, ""whitespire jail"". the jail ban random heroes daily, making some alliance could not work, it destroys your main strategy and force you to think a new strategy;

2. refering to negative 1, the game now only consist of player using the same alliances over and over again. this makes the game boring and frustrating if the alliances are OP. you could still try an unique combo, but expect your defeat;

3. the removal of talent choosing, where you could strategize your underlord by choosing an ability at creep rounds. because theres no creep rounds, this talent tree is also removed. this could also give you the chance to adapt. this feature is replaced by ""default skillset""

4.  removal of creep rounds, at this round you will not lose your HP if you are defeated but only get low tier items as the punishment. the removal of this makes the game far more quicker and doesnt give clear punishment. 

5. the duo mode has a big flaw, that is if your buddy is afk or slept in the middle of game (yeah, i meant you, Mndo). i already gave a suggestion on feedback way back in november. i'll give you a short version here, basically i wanted to partial control over my buddy's team, but some mechanic will be prohibited so trolling will not happen;

6. bad balancing issue for alliances, where some might flop and others triumph.

a little of both (+/-)

1. each underlords gets 2 unique ""default skillset"" it divided to offensive and defensive, though this is randomized each match. and you dont decide what kind of skillset your underlord have if the time to choose has come;

2. a limited customization, only to your team banner, but not to the underlord;

3. you will given a chance to pick one out of 3 (or 4 if you picked an item called ""embarassment of riches"" before that), the choices will be random.


i only hope this game improved, it has a lot of potential that are currently being wasted. just like many people here, we wanted the jail, the original talent choosing, and creep  rounds to be back."
24903,The UI is so simple that at my first play through it took me awhile to understand what is what.
24904,"Good Game Need Improvement For Future in Graphic, Heroes, And Skill"
24905,"this is will take your time, take your young, your life and your girlfriend lul"
24906,nice
24907,This game is good
24908,"Pretty cool, would recommend."
24909,good game
24910,good game
24911,a better auto chess.
24912,I'm addicted
24913,Runs well.  Nice update from the mod overall.
24914,"very good, just need some competitive elements"
24915,Complicated and time consuming.
24916,"This game is pretty fun. But I don't see a lot of in depth end game strategy. Right now, it just seems whoever has the most 5 cost characters wins. I don't see anyway someone can end the game fast via rush strategy. I would imagine this game would have some kind of rock-paper-scissors mechanics. e.g. rush beats tech; turtle beats rush, tech beats turtle, etc..

Update: This game got Underlords in now. It's like a completely different game. I would say most of the additions are positive. Although, increasing the roster, makes getting to 3 star a bit more challenging. Overall, I still like this game."
24917,"Love the improvements on Auto Chess

Update: Still getting better"
24918,nice
24919,"This is great.

And that is my review I had to write for the summer sale."
24920,incredible
24921,pretty cool gam play even though its just an alpha
24922,Like Undertale but with dota characters.
24923,"Runs great on my potato laptop and is fun with friends. It's literally Autochess, but with an actually good interface and optimized. It's great."
24924,"This game is really good it blends the strategy of the original auto chess while making the ui easier to use and makes the game more intuitive, also with a valve developing the game it is much more polished than autochess was and with the game being as raw as it is right now i see great potential in this game."
24925,AutoChess?
24926,fun game
24927,"This was my first foray into the auto chess genre. I saw a favourite twitch streamer of mine try it out and it looked like fun, so I tried it out. With bot mode to learn and try out strategies, the learning curve isn't super steep. This game is mostly about finding synergies for your own units and counters to other team compositions while managing your own economy. We shall see how long this will keep my attention, but for now it is a decent free to play game."
24928,"""Still in beta"" they will say for a while, the game is too much RNG even for something as simple as ""autochess"", for a mobile oriented game matches take too long, it doesn't require too much input once you set up the units, you need to keep an eye on what the other players have purchased and hope you will be able to rank up a unit, still a waste of time."
24929,sobo ko oten mo ha ncnc
24930,The autochess era is coming. Invest while you still can. Game still buggy but volvo will fix in time.

24938,"Игрушка весёлая, но в ней нужно разбираться т.к. система, по которой выдаются герои за раунд крайне сложна (Это не рандом, уважаемые Гении!).. 

Toy fun, but it is necessary to understand, because the system by which the characters are issued per round is extremely difficult (it's not random, dear Geniuses!).."
24939,Nice
24940,xdxdXDXD
24941,Honestly it's easy to get into and pretty fun.
24942,It's a fun to have a auto chess game made by Valve
24943,Gud gam
24944,good game but needs time to learn it
24945,rng
24946,Noice
24947,"Love the game but it looks and feels like a mobile game that was ported to PC rather than it being the other way around.  It for some reason got rid of simple things like hot keys for re-rolls and leveling up like the mod which is frustrating.  The information like gold count, exp count, etc is so scattered compared to the mod as well.  

Also feels like I am playing alone rather than being in a huge free for all.  I get that you can click on others boards via their name on the side but nothing can replace the free look the mod had in place.  I remember knowing where certain peoples positions were on the minimap and sometimes just liked cruising around on it and checking out everybodies builds. 

Lastly, bring back couriers.  Even if they serve 0 purpose they were such a great feature.  The League of Legends version not only kept them but found a use for them in the duck duck goose feature they added.  

All in all its far from great and lacks a lot but hopefully it will get a visual overhaul soon."
24948,good
24949,"Upgrade of Dota2Chess ?

Game is OK, hope valve will add more special  themes or maps to the game"
24950,"I think its fun and has good depth in some areas, however, the heros that you get are all luck based."
24951,"Nice iteration on the Auto Chess genre, good use of Dota Heroes."
24952,should have handphone highspecs
24953,"I'm not Dota player but i enjoy this game. Aaaaaaannnnnnddddddddd, i suck."
24954,good game
24955,Underlord > Artifact
24956,This is what Artifact should have been: Free and open to community sugestions
24957,Great
24958,Git gut.
24959,fvking gooooodddddd
24960,Fun I guess?
24961,"It's pretty good. Out of all the auto chess games, it has the most consistancy. That being said, though, because of the nature of auto chess games, it is heavily RNG dependent. Just pay attention to the meta, have good crowd control, and you should be fine, though!"
24962,This game is so frustratingly random I had to uninstall it.
24963,Bad UI i think thanks :)
24964,"This game is fun, and free, so I would give it a shot. Pretty easy to learn and pickup.
Prepare to either have really good unit RNG, or horrible unit RNG. 
RNGesus rules Dota Underlords."
24965,It's a nice valve version of auto chess
24966,"Volvo's version of auto chess is awful, the only good thing is optimization."

24970,goood
24971,<3
24972,Really good remake of autochess
24973,Better than autochess. needs more updates!
24974,Needs more work on balancing and team cohesion
24975,"Dota but with RNG.

It takes no skill but addicting."
24976,nice funny but hp is damn much need to spend long time to play
24977,Like dota but without your teammates yelling at each other for 30 minutes
24978,Very nice game to waste a couple of hours on. Seems pretty balanced for an early access game tbh.
24979,Amazing!
24980,Best Chess currently. Hopefully LoL chess smooths out their UI and moves the genre forward
24981," It's fun, but there's too many people that leave the match in the first few rounds."
24982,very nice
24983,"I was a huge fan of Pokemon Defense back in WC3 days, and this game feels and plays very similarly to that mod, at least for me personally. A minimal barrier of entry, free to play, RNG heavy, just the type of game you can play for minutes or hours on end. Finding players is very easy as it is very very popular."
24984,"a shit game ,but always playing it everytime"
24985,lul
24986,item/buffs selection is very nice
24987,very fun
24988,"great and fun alternative to the usual Dota honestly, mostly RNG based but usually strategy based, im happy Valve and Dorodo studios had a good agreement"
24989,Fun and chill game
24990,"""Valve"" on the go......"
24991,i like  this
24992,best Autochess game everrrr
24993,"Pro: 
-Improved quality of life from the Dota Custom Game (Auto Chess). 
-Items from neutral creeps are guaranteed. 

Con:
Some minor bug: Overlay issue when browsing hero attribute
Druid skill now does not combine unit to level up. Instead round start, lowest level unit will temporary increase 1 level"
24994,Not bad
24995,If you win this game at least 3 times in a row for one day. I suggest you to go to Las Vegas and play poker to make money instead since poker is obviously easier than this game because no one can see what cards are you holding on your deck.
24996,This game is just fun.
24997,Good but repetitive
24998,GREAT !
24999,Causes addiction
25000,Hunter Build = Noob
25001,Not bad
25002,too much luck based mechanics
25003,The best Battle chess game so far
25004,best game ever
25005,"Overall is a game to play on mobile and PC.
But be prepared to spend quite some time on the game.

Update: after stopping. game is getting more n more complicated with the underlords.
lost interest."
25006,"great game, especially for mobile. A great gateway game to full dota"
25007,Fun game. Good for casual play with friends. Also good as background noise.
25008,Auto chess is better
25009,I like the auto chess <3
25010,Nice adaptation of the autochess genre.
25011,"As Autochess has become a new genre of game, this one is the only one that keeps me coming back. The class bonuses and little nuances of strategy make it fun to experiment with different combinations of classes. There is also a decent amount of rng that can play to your favor or against you, so watch out for that."
25012,user friendly game
25013,Really good.
25014,the waiting room for nu-artifact is comfier than i thought
25015,Solid auto chess.
25016,"super fun and easy to pick up, but plenty of depth"
25017,Good
25018,Good for just casual gameplay and competitive! really like the lore.
25019,Fun game over all but takes like 3 hours a game
25020,"Really clean gameplay. Having played multiple hours of both this and League of Legends: TeamFight Tactics, I've got to say Dota Underlords is remarkably simple to understand, far more intuitive and enjoyable... and addictive."
25021,Good game well-played Valve :D
25022,great game to kill time
25023,This game totally is RNG! High learning curve! Strongly recommend!
25024,auto chess game easy to play
25025,Excellent game!
25026,"It's pretty good, even if the interest mechanic is dumb."
25027,"In what seems to be the quickest turn around for a valve game ever, the public received a new title in the Dota franchise. Named Dota underlords, this game is valves official take on the popular Dota 2 mod, Auto Chess. While obviously similar in style and core gameplay, this release sports a variety of features not seen in the original product. Where it stands Underlords is in closed beta, and the final product seems very promising. The short queue times makes it a more viable option than Riot’s release of team fight tactics and the ranked matchmaking makes it more replayable than the mod. This game makes it clear that valve learned their lesson from Artifact with very few issues to complain about. To start the game was released completely free on Steam as well as mobile. Which is another feature that sets it apart from other games in the genre. The ability to seamlessly switch between mobile and pc while in a match makes the game a great time passer whether you have to commute or are staying in for a session. The only current monetization method being through a, at the time unreleased, battle pass shows that this product is not here to take all your cash. The core mechanics are very addicting and easy to learn. The concept of each match consists of 8 players including yourself battling on chess-like boards with armies that you build and upgrade each match. At the start of each round, you are able to purchase heroes for your army with gold you earn by winning or losing a round. Losing a battle affects your health, and the goal is to be the last surviving player. Winning increases your rank for the season. This gameplay loop lends its self to both mobile and pc and does not seem to be superior on either platform. The games shine especially with tactical and strategic options. Heroes have synergies and classes and items can be collected throughout the round. Certain classes grant buffs and synergies counter each other in different ways. Every match plays out differently and there are many options you can utilize to win. If you are new to the auto chess genre many resources exist to teach you the game, such as youtube videos and written guides. Bot mode and a tutorial also exist within the game to teach you throughout playing. The only issues currently in the game have to do with bugs and balancing. However, this team works to put out updates nearly daily to fix these problems, and the game is in beta so this is to be expected. One of the best features about this project is how communicative and responsive the team for this game has been in creating it. They regularly make update posts and twitter responses. A large button is even featured on the main menu of the game for all players to submit their feedback directly to the team. Most if not all of the feedback is quickly addressed. Where it lacks in quality of life adjustments it makes up for in all other departments. And even though the surrounding lore is not a current focus, the team seems very willing to implement such items later in development. Overall the game is very fun whether or not you are a fan of Dota. You can learn the game and background without any prior knowledge, and watching your skill increase feels very rewarding. Competitive ranking features keep you coming back to the title and with no entry fee, there is nothing to lose by trying the game on your pc, smartphone, or tablet. It is clear the team at Valve cares a lot about this game and will be working hard to make sure it is the game everybody enjoys in light of the unfortunate failure of Artifact. Download Dota underlords now and try it yourself, the community is growing and it's a great one to get into.

25028,any chance I could get RNG god to bless me all the time ? :thinkingemoji
25029,Nice game. Better than Auto Chess

25031,Good shit
25032,Fantastic game.
25033,nice game

25035,"I know nothing about DOTA or Autochess going into this and it wasn't hard at all to pick up.
Fun, works well on mobile, I recommend."
25036,To be honest i think this game can be a lot better...
25037,"Solid gameplay, and the most recent updates I think have made for more satisfying combinations of play."
25038,"Very nice game. A lot of fun especially if you want to lay back, relax and have a nice time. You can try out many combos and find new strats. Very intuitive gameplay with a lot of depth to get into.

8/10"

25040,nice ive biggest luck in here
25041,good game xD

25046,pretty ok...

Not Good, Not Terrible"

25055,"When Valve shows support for mobile and PC cross platform, you know they mean business..."
25056,it's a game.
25057,"จากที่ได้ลองเล่นดูแล้วหลายเกม

ตัวเกมยังขาดความสมดุลย์อยู่หลายจุด ปัญหาปลายเกมที่ไม่สามารถปรับตัวได้ถ้าไปผิดทาง
อาจจะต้องมีวิธีบางอย่างมาแก้ไขตรงจุดนี้

เกมจะสนุกสุดๆคือตอนกลางเกมเพราะทุกคนยังสามารถวางแผนให้ทีมพลิกกลับขึ้นมาได้
ส่วนตอนต้นเกมเหมือนช่วงเก็บตัง

สิ่งที่เป็นปัจจัยอีกอย่างคือ การสุ่มของในช่วงเจอครีพป่า ถ้าใครดวงไม่ดีก็อาจจะแป๊กไปเลย"
25058,A good game to play
25059,cool
25060,Worth a try
25061,fucking trash RNG based game... I love it
25062,best chess game
25063,"Addicting, doesn't explain anything in game about how it works, fun, RNG slaps you a lot."
25064,Cross Platform Support is great. Was waiting for this.
25065,best auto battler out there
25066,Overall acceptable
25067,Just wow
25068,cool game
25069,"Заходишь в стим, а там армяне в нарды играют"
25070,"It's a game, and RNGesus will NOT take the wheel."
25071,It's maybe too simple right now but there's a good base.
25072,Better than Tft cuz the gameplay is faster and valve actually nerfs stuff but don't overnerfing it
25073,This game has more potential
25074,"Winning' is not a 'state of mind'. It's a 'fact of life'.
Can you dig it? It's not hard to find. Or is it?
Is it something that you earn or do you have to reach your term?

Based on a 'game' of 'skill' and 'chance' known as [CHESS]. 
It's not really [CHESS] but I think you'll dig it.
Because this is [CHESS]. A 'game' of 'skill' & 'chance'"
25075,better than tft
25076,This game is so bad. It's very addicting can't stop playing.
25077,Nice game
25078,not bad!
25079,"Interesting concept, fun way to pass time"
25080,noice
25081,Not HL3
25082,yeah jumpy men
25083,Not better than tft.   2/5
25084,Pretty fun game and not too difficult to get into for an AutoChess amateur
25085,you know what? well i dont know. sorry
25086,Fun cant wait for the updates
25087,<3
25088,Enjoy autochess? You'll love this more!
25089,Such a fun game to play.
25090,Cool
25091,The only time I've stopped playing is when I'm sleeping.
25092,"everything looks fine besides some bugs, dk not attacking or board stuck on all all screens etc."
25093,"a nice simple game, dont know but im pretty addicted"
25094,Very enjoyable mix of strategy & card game elements. Great new genre
25095,bEST GAME
25096,"Fun, but no levelling or progression?"
25097,(Y)
25098,autochess is better
25099,Cool Enough
25100,"Still clearly in early development, but a very promising new genre made from mixing mechanics from Strategy & Card games. Great game to play while watching TV or listening to music/podcasts"
25101,True successor from the origin DAC
25102,"devs work extremely fast - constant updates means this game is going to be very well supported as valve wants this to succeed. 

this game is stupidly addictive and the mobile crossplay means you can always pick up a game easily"
25103,This is nice for a change of pace even tho is as almost rage inducing as the moba but still pretty good.
25104,Man this autochess thing really blew up
25105,Tumb Up
25106,bom
25107,yeboy hunters 4life
25108,when will dota abovelords be released? pog
25109,"These ""chess"" games are trending now. I enjoyed very much watching the DOTA characters fighting and moving around the board on their own. The only problem I faced was the hotkey remapping, which returned to default the next time I launched the game."
25110,"A very relaxing game either on mobile or pc, just fire it up and play. no questions asked, no worries of competitive environment, and wasted time is satisfying! another masterpiece from valve."
25111,Nice game
25112,Casual kalel26 !!!11
25113,Guuuuut
25114,even more soul crushing than DotA
25115,"It was nice to play while I was waiting for TeamFight Tactics, will also be the game I play when TFT is  down."
25116,"An upgraded version of the famous game ""Auto Chess""."
25117,"Dota 2 
- IQ

Dota Underlords
+ IQ"
25118,yes
25119,haven't play yet
25120,"Fun to play but, RNG plays a major factor in winning like other card/random build games. It has skill involved ,but the choosing mechanic doesn't really allow for it to be a pure skill game. This might be a drawback to some but it is pretty funny to see unexpected results like 2 lvl 2 chaos knights running around on round 6.  Hopefully Valve adds different modes that reduce/ eliminate  RNG. One such mode could be an actual card deck format where you draw a hand then you can anticipate moves and make items also cards/rewards instead of the pure RNG they are too. 

Overall good game that is free ,but the Random aspects can crush you sometimes no matter how skilled you are and it feels less satisfying that card game where you can at least guess the randomness of something happening."
25121,"Great game, easy to pick up, but hard to master. Looking forward to QOL and balance patches!"
25122,"Should rename this game to ""Dota: Metalords"""
25123,I have my virginity
25124,its neat and free.
25125,"That's a new game for VALVE, LIke a Dota Auto Chesse on ARCADE Game on DOTA2, but Overall I Like this :)), i hope i can see my recently history of my competition like i see if i win or lose, i can see my profile friends, and many others"
25126,a
25127,"Amazing, can't wait for loot boxes, cosmetics, etc"
25128,best auto chest
25129,It's fun.
25130,Much better then Auto Chess!
25131,"Best Auto-Chess adaptation so far, nethertheless I would like to see some new refrashing machanics and a more precise balancing. Currently Druids seem to be too strong and ist is not really enjoyable to play ""fresh or new"" tactics since they are allways weaker then the metas"
25132,"a fresh new game, very intuitive and practical, you end up addicting it. I recommend!"
25133,good
25134,"I may adjust this review in the future if things change, but as it currently stands I can't recommend this game.

When I heard that this game went to a public release so quickly and even had a mobile option, I thought it was going to be a good way to get back into the Dota characters without too much of a time commitment. However, unless you are playing against bots and save your progress to come back later, expect to set aside anywhere from 15-30+ minutes for games.
The desktop client UI feels a little ""off"" with where some things are placed, but I haven't played any other autochess type games to compare whether this is standard or not."
25135,Dota without russians screaming at you.
25136,Good game but it need balancing
25137,It's fun. All it needs is a rewards system
25138,RIP Artifact
25139,Yeet
25140,Ggwp good game

25142,Dota Underlords = Dota Auto Chess + Artifact
25143,"Not great, not terrible."
25144,Love this game so much ! Gimme more updates!
25145,"A bit different from the Dota 2 Custom Map, but still holds true. The tutorial is a nice touch to get newer players into the game.
WARNING: Can be extremely fun or extremely frustrating depending on RNG and general game knowledge"
25146,"This is a fun little game that has a lot of depth to it, fun for casuals and the EXTREMISTS!"
25147,The app is better.
25148,ma game
25149,"This game is fun but it needs some kind of progression system to make each match feel like it's contributing to something bigger. The game is insanely addicted, has no microtransactions (as of the time of this review), and has gotten a few nice updates due to player feedback since launch, so it's definitely worth checking out."
25150,"fun game, and still in beta."
25151,"A good version of auto chess that will eventually be better because of a good team working on it.

Updated: With new game modes, features, and heros, Dota Underlords is definitely the most innovative auto-chess game available that is still carried by a hard working development team."
25152,"Unbalance heros, android version is very laggy, ..."
25153,Better Balancing than Auto Chess.
25154,am i playing underlords or is it playing me?
25155,It's Chess but Auto
25156,"Not bad for an alpha build, look forward to what else they add"

25162,"Very promising game that derived from a Dota 2 mod. I hope they paid the people that made the mod. . .

It's still early to judge, but I feel it's heading the right way."
25163,Amazing auto chess game! Really love the tactical strategy
25164,"Oddly compelling, a good time-waster."
25165,"RNG can be a bit shit, but generally enough room to correct initial mistakes/shortcomings."
25166,"Pretty fun, pretty tilting"
25167,It's a good doggo
25168,Best tactical game in terms of Dota 2. Need more heroes and on top of that it can be played on mobile.Nice!!
25169,Game sometimes crashes on mobile
25170,Yo
25171,What make me play this game is the mobile version. Really good way to past some time.
25172,Eh its okay
25173,autochess is a good game
25174,Cool
25175,pretty good
25176,"Definitely lives up to the hype, lots of fun, even if it's a bit reliant on RNG"
25177,pretty fun game to play
25178,"Note the Beta is fresh and therefore the game is extremely bare bones beyond the multiplayer.

Positives:
The use of alliances and planning smart uses of the items plays well.
The games balance overall seems solid

Cons:
Valve relying too much on DOTA cash cow to push gamer investment in this title. There needs to be more to this game on release. A wager table to bet on friends, elite players, or even against yourself would make things interesting.

Some sort of single player aspect beyond bot matches would allow new players to feel like there is an avenue into this title. DOTA was always fun but the sharp learning curve makes it a deep end only pool."
25179,TFT ripoff
25180,"It is an RNG based game, but I like it."
25181,"really fun and addicting, but the league version is still better"
25182,Fun and more addicting than it should be.
25183,"When they fix the shaman broken build, i will change this review"
25184,a good casual game that can be played everywhere even offline...if the lag on mobile can be fixed it will be a great game after all
25185,Best because have crossplay Feature!
25186,at least it's not artifact.
25187,"Fun free game, but still needs a good bit more to feel like an actual pc game."
25188,boring set of match it takes too long...
25189,"So far so good, looking forward to the updates."
25190,Tis a good game
25191,It's a good game
25192,Play this if you hate yourself. RNG is not your friend.
25193,morokai died for this
25194,Decent autochess variant. Still in Beta.
25195,Really fun version of auto chess with DOTA stuff and some nice little tweaks to the formula.
25196,After Many hours the game is fun .. However so many balance issues .. followed by you better love RNG .. game can make you punch things because the RNG is so bad .. Example some people get great draws and level their toons  others  get very few .. I actually had a game today where on T-1 I got 5 of the same guy to choose from now this might be good on a later turn with some cash but on T-1 I have 1 coin .. Fun hope it becomes more playable over time.
25197,The only Dota worth playing.
25198,gud game my friemd
25199,GOod Game.
25200,"Haven't played much yet, but I love the game. Easy to play, hard to win. Sometimes you think you are good, then the dices are not in your favor and you're going to lose. gg."
25201,this game is a fun and nice to play everywhere.
25202,PogChamp artifact 2
25203,"AutoChess but a lot less buggy, actually loads into games instead of circling in the lobby. Much cleaner UI."
25204,wait for update dota2 costume to the game
25205,Better experience on cell phone : )
25206,amazing
25207,cool game
25208,"Tried to like this game as it is right now, but the balances are still a bit off."
25209,FUN & VISUALLY APPEALING
25210,"A good game but it still needs some tweaks to balance the game.
Winner streak bonus gold is broken."
25211,"I have never played Dota Auto Chess, however this game was very easy to get started with. It has a helpful tutorial and you can play versus bots to get a grip on things before playing versus other players online."
25212,If you fall behind even slightly early you're doomed to lose the game. Comebacks don't happen. So you either win early or you might as well give up.
25213,ok
25214,Topper
25215,Its Ok mein
25216,"It can be a fun game to pass the time with, but the mobile version does not seem to be well optimized. At least, it didn't run smoothly on my Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite."
25217,"While some folks may be into Autochesss, I find the matches overall to long.  If there was a way to speed it up, I'd find this more fun"
25218,lul auto chess
25219,"This game is good and have less salt than Dota 2. 10/10.
Battery is a real struggle if you play it on mobile."
25220,"all hail GabeN!!

tbf. Teamfight Tactics by riot is better than this game, because gameplay mechanics in this game is just a ""copycat-modify"" from old dota auto chess. But the multiplatform access to mobile games makes up for their lack of creativity. So it's all good! 

Best quality mobile game of ALL TIME."
25221,Good to play
25222,"fun game to play with friends, very addictive, requires no skill xD. 
overall 7.5/10"

25232,I have no idea what I'm doing
25233,Great
25234,Nc Game :)
25235,"Valve's own twist on AutoChess cleans up the UI, adds some quality of life mechanics, and adds to the already exceptional original mod. Instant classic."
25236,Better than Artifact. Knockout mode is great!
25237,Great entry into the Auto-chess genre. Plenty of communication from devs on both Twitter and Reddit make me excited for the future of this game.
25238,good game
25239,"Keeping in mind that this game is still in its beginning stages, there are a lot of balance issues with the teams.  Like other auto chess type games, RNG can be either amazing or terrible for getting the right combination of units to come out on top.  I have played on both mobile and PC and would not recommend playing on mobile until they update the interface. It is incredibly difficult to manipulate the units around, especially when they are grouped together.  
The design and actual gameplay itself is much better than auto chess on mobile.  The AI seems more intelligent and there are only minor bugs.  For a free game, it is worth giving a shot to play on PC."
25240,:)
25241,"Never played Dota, but love this auto-chess spin-off.  A little bit simplistic and susceptible to the RNG Gods, but overall it's good for a quick 30 minute session without having to commit any further."
25242,dota chess is better
25243,just a full version of auto chess mod for dota 2. really fun
25244,"Still don't understand what's going on, but seems fun?

UPDATE Nov 2019 - Still lost."
25245,"It's a nice game, it's like the underdog of the mobachest games.

Still need some balacing (druid second trait is a bit too strong and CM is a auto include in any team)"

25249,This game made me relax after toxic matches.
25250,"Great game, still need more polish though"
25251,Game sux. its like 80% rng bullshit. But i keep playing cause its pretty engaging.
25252,good game just need to keep the updates
25253,best game ever
25254,good game
25255,great game easy to get into but i would say TFT by riot is a little more clean.
25256,this game needs luck with the shop choices of heroes !
25257,"So far so fun, there's obvious potential for this game to get a lot better but even now its at a really good spot, where most of the shortcomings are the fault of the autochess genre as a whole. I wish valve would implement better ways to avoid getting screwed by RNG, however."

25267,git gud
25268,This auto-battle genre makes me want to relax more rather than stressing out even when losing. And its a good thing that its a crossplay
25269,"A really great game, just doesn't have much game play, but makes sense seeing how this sprouted as a Dota arcade game"
25270,ok
25271,A much more better game than the Artifact.
25272,Easy to pick up and very fun to play. Great casual game to play
25273,fun
25274,"Hard to get a hold of the strategy at the beginning, but hopefully you can catch on quick
"
25275,its fun
25276,Still think the Dota 2 workshop version is better...
25277,confusing game.
25278,gonna be honest here. only downloaded the game to get more max points for the event and this was free to play. i expected to sit down and play for a couple minutes and then be done with it. now here i am hours later and thirsty for more. this game is super addicting and extremely easy to follow if you just do the tutorial. i love the UI and how easy it was to navigate between different points of information. overall 10/10 game for sure i can't wait to get into the multiplayer.
25279,"Very exciting, especially to those who likes to play or played Dota 2 in the past, the combos are a thing to remember..."
25280,It's aight
25281,nice game
25282,Pretty decent game!
25283,First Auto Chess game and I love it! Its great to play when your bored or want something to sink some time into. 8/10
25284,thank you valve
25285,"Its aight, Teamfight tactics is waaaaay better though. 
only upside to getting this game would probably be you can play it in the bathtub, bathroom, school or anywhere cause you can play it on your phone!

Also the bots are rather smart sooo if you dont have time for a full game you can play bots and continue halfway through

"
25286,it ghud

25290,good stand alone version of the mod
25291,"This game manage to catch people's attention, it brings joy and competition for casual gamer(s). I recommend this game 10/10"
25292,Poor RNG in the shop between each round ruins the game. It can be difficulty to upgrade your troops simple due to bad RNG. Don't waste your time.
25293,"This game's release is very misleading. It's not Artifact. Me and my 2 year old son have been waiting since the Artifact announcement at the International to finally be able to play it, and only recently have we conjured up the funds to be able to play that masterpiece. But instead, I got a free-to-play game which reminds me of playing with my toys when I was my son's age. I have never been more disappointed. If one of you can send Valve a message highlighting how much we do not want this game, I will personally send you a 5 dollar gift card for The Home Depot (Sorry I spent 3 dollars from that card on thumb tacks). Please Valve, give the people the Dota strategy game they really want."
25294,"its got mobile lads, its worth the time 100%. I didnt play auto chess over dota when it was up, but i am a pretty big fan of this one so ya."
25295,Same as the real cyka dota
25296,Makes me feel smarter and dumber at the same time each round. 10/10

25304,yes. cool. right. thanks. bye.
25305,It ain't Half-Life 3 but it ain't Artifact.
25306,Didn't think I would like the game and had never played auto chess so I came into it with no idea what it was going to be and it is a great game.
25307,"not good for competitve.. too much rng
late game is bad designed 


or maybe im just bad 7/11"
25308,A very addicting game. Can't wait to see where this game goes!
25309,A game that looks simple but is surprisingly deep.
25310,"Pretty nice timekiller for those who want to stay away from Dota, but still want to feel it."
25311,meh but fun if u like auto chess plus free
25312,"They nerfed Knights, game is playable and balanced again"
25313,Nerf knights
25314,Game is so so long .... total rounds should be reduced
25315,Great game so far :)
25316,aaaaaaaaaaah yes
25317,If the last 2 games were head to head it would be awesome
25318,goodgame wellplayed
25319,"Solid entry into the Autochess genre. Works well on mobile, great UI."
25320,Doesn't click with me like the original mod does :/
25321,"I cant really put my finger on why I like this game, I just do."
25322,OK
25323,good one
25324,"I'm just as bad at this as I am at the original autochess, but it's got some nice UI improvements that make it slightly less clumsy, which is good. Still the same basic game, a few name changes for classes which is confusing at first."
25325,Please rework interface
25326,:)
25327,itgood
25328,much appreciate to those devs who makes this games
25329,"Still needs a bit of development and tinkering, but a solid start to another auto chess clone."
25330,"Its alright, just reviewing this to get the grand prix thing done. :^)"
25331,Yes
25332,This is(not) Gabens game
25333,A good game to waste time one
25334,"This game is like chess, only without the dice."

25336,what a great game!
25337,Oof
25338,"Great spin on this new ""Autochess"" wave of games. 
I do enjoy playing it quite a lot.

Too bad it didn't live for long."
25339,This game set up sucks and I didn't enjoy it at all.

25344,"Fun and addicting game.  Nice to sit down and relax, but builds excitement over time."
25345,"This game is quick to load, fun to play, graphically slick, and re-playable.

-- As soon as you click to play you are instantly in a game.  I wish more games were like this. No loading screens, company logos, 
   etc.  

-- The layout, units, abilities, items and the whole interface is smooth, and readable.  Very little clutter.  Simple to understand what 
    you need next.

-- Unit types, and item customization and the various combs make the game deep with many viable paths to victory.  

-- Lets talk about RNG.
   
""RNG is about creating controlled chaos in your game, and every title handles it differently. The one constant that we see in good game design is providing the player with hard-coded elements that are consistent. It’s important for the player to know just what exactly their options are and have an idea of what the possible outcomes are.""

The RNG in Underlords is in the good design category.  You always have a chance to go for that unit type you need to complete your build.  Some games you get there, and others you don't.  In one game I was down to 14 hp but still managed to win with some good units and a set up that no one bothered to counter.  Losing due to RNG is not frustrating because the games load so fast you can always just start up a new one instantly.  Also, sometimes you dont get the unit you want, but end up with a strong item that you can drag and drop on a unit making it powerful enough to carry on.

Again, you pick a build you want, then try to get there with the units given each round. You can re-roll using gold to try to get the unit type you need.  This does not feel cheap, you can't fully blame a loss on the RNG because YOU decided to go for that build.

This makes the game enjoyable to play, even when the number generator is unkind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Room for Improvement

-- Disconnected from the other players in multiplayer.  Seems like people these days are so sensitive that they don't want any 
   communication due to ""toxic"" behavior.  So, in this game you cant talk to the people you are playing against.  It would be nice to 
   have more ways to interact with the other players.  Of course a global mute option can be added.

-- Allow a way to see exactly what units you have when in the purchase mode.  Meaning, when buying units and you click on the 
   units on your board you cant see the type.  You have to close the buying, click on the unit on your board and then you can see 
   that units stats.

-- Make it easier to view other players boards, some kind of scroll option so that you dont have to click on each one.  Reduce 
   clicking.

25346,autobattlers need to steal this UI
25347,This isn't Team Fight Tactics
25348,"needs to balance some units, other wise they fixed many troublesome issues from dota2 used map"
25349,"fun games, but sometimes it would get boring, but it is a lot more friendly in terms of rng considering with the other auto chess"
25350,good
25351,gg wp volvo give us more dota content
25352,"need to work on it ,but nice for the moment"
25353,Nice game
25354,"It is a good game, and Valve is quickly updating and adding more and more. I cannot wait to see what it will be after the first big update."
25355,GG
25356,It is a lot of fun with friends and you can fill the remaining slots with bots from easy to very challenging.
25357,So much fun when you are away from your pc 👍
25358,"Good game, a little dependent on luck but over all really fun!"
25359,"Really good game, needs some balancing though."
25360,Cool game when you just wanna chill. Would be more nice if it was possible to que up with friends
25361,"Pretty good game. 

If you like artifact, you'll probably like this. 
If you hated artifact, you'll probably like this."
25362,a
25363,It is ok.
25364,в 1000000000 раз лучше автошашек
25365,Great deal.
25366,Bad players will say they lost because of RNG
25367,"Much cleaner that its mod counterpart, has a few bugs but that's mainly because Valve rushed it out as fast as possible. Definitely worth trying out to see if this new genre/sub-genre is your kind of thing."
25368,"It's a entertaining ""team fight simulator"""
25369,"Not a bad game by far, but a little hard to understand at first. 
When I play it, I think about how it’s a bit heavy on the RNG side of things and less on the strategy. You go into a game having a plan but sometimes the resources at your disposal just aren’t there. The game has you doing less theory crafting and more making the best out of a random scenario.

Pros: 
-No microtransactions (yet?) 
-DotA flavoring is enjoyable and 1:1 to the actual DotA 2 game (sounds, hero selection, items, etc)
-Has a mobile counterpart which allows for cross-platform play

Cons:
-Not able to group with friends to play against (as far as I know)
-RNG heavy which means you might not always have a good time, strategy will only get you so far
-Mechanics at hand are punishing if you fall behind
-No achievements, skins, or unlockable rewards. You level up but for now, that’s purely just a single number which might as well be hidden. 

Conclusion:
It’s a “new” genre of game that seems to be sharing the light with others that don’t really know what it wants to do. One opinion I have is that the game should be more rock paper scissors (a classic approach that RTS’s take) but in this case, it's really just who has the biggest and most combo inclusive team. Overall it's enjoyable for a little while but doesn’t give much reason to keep going after a couple of days."
25370,Best mobile game valve has!
25371,Its alright wish you could stack items
25372,better than artifact.
25373,The game mode that everyone loves is that good.
25374,its the best game
25375,"This is a faithful reproduction of the original Dota Autochess mod, with a number of welcome changes. It runs much smoother than the mod ever did, and matchmaking is quicker and easier. The graphics are pleasant and the UI, while clearly designed for mobile, isn't too offensive on PC either. The changes to various classes - like new assassins, a better hunter perk, and bloodbound - seem to provide a more balanced experience (I feel like more strats are viable in Underlords than in Autochess). I also really appreciate being able to play on my phone; I know some people complain about the PC version looking like a mobile port, but Autochess is such a simple game that I don't feel like I need anything fancier. My biggest gripes are small visual ones: I definitely miss having a customizable courier, I miss the courier effects from winning multiple rounds, and I miss the cosmetic changes that were applied to units as they leveled up. It's also slightly less natural to check other people's boards in Underlords, though that might just be an adjustment I need to make. All in all, I'm happy to have a smoother version of Autochess that I can play on mobile, and I hope the game gets better with future balance changes or seasonal rotations."
25376,Muy entretenido sobre todo si tienes unos momentos en los que no sabes que más hacer.
25377,"Pretty addicting and fun, seen a lot of people complain about RNG fiesta and while there is certainly a good degree of RNG involved, there is a lot of different strats you can do to combat a great level of RNG. If anything, there's definitely some balance issues with stuff like knights being a bit overtuned atm but here's hoping they're attentive to updating their game. Overall, worth giving it a try seeing as how its free."
25378,recommended. i like it
25379,"Good game, works also as a screensaver"
25380,"My Personal Experience:

I didn't play Dota Auto Chess mod. I'd only heard of it. Underlords is my first game of this kind. It was difficult in the beginning but once I got a hold of the Alliance system and hero leveling up, I started to enjoy it quite a lot, win or lose. So if you are just starting now and find it difficult, watch some explanation video about it on Youtube. It's really fun and I recommend it. I might update the review later down the road as I get more experience with it."
25381,Yes
25382,"Even if your not a fan of Dota2. I would highly recommend you take a look at Underlords. Though there is a tutorial in the game I would recommend watching some Twitch streams or reading some tutorials to get a idea of how the game works. Its not very difficult to understand the basics and to get a grip on the game, but can be hard to master.


Awesome Auto Chess game. Which creates its own rules and move away from the trends. Hard working team that brings us a very unique auto-chess-like game.

Also fun as a team or Co-Op. You can play ranked or unranked.

Only downside I have heard is that mobile version is to resource hungry for most Smart Phones. I'm sure Valve is trying their best to sort this out in future patches. For now they are more focused on balance and bringing new content to the game as frequent as possible.

As with any game from Valve. This is a true masterpiece in its own right and would give you many laughs and head scratching on why you could not get that last unit to upgrade moments."
25383,Great new game!
25384,Great game to relax while trying your luck and wit in constructing a team of heroes with the best synergies to beat your opponents.
25385,Awesome game. Just wish they could tone down the RNG a bit
25386,Every round feels the same after a while. The choices you make are heavily influence by RNG and with limited time to make them mistakes are very easy to make. At the same time most of the game time involves you watching the AI play. Give me a real idle game over this any day.
25387,JOGA ESSA PORRA AI
25388,"Awesome auto-chess from Valve. I like a few of the upgrades, like items on every creep round. Looking forward to future updates and improvements."
25389,Easy enough to understand that anyone can play it but complicated enough that its a challenge to win. A pretty good game in my opinion.
25390,artifact 2
25391,"Great game, a lot more balanced than TFT. The ""leveling"" system suck tho.
    Still the same. Not enjoying it anymore."
25392,highly recommend
25393,BAD
25394,Actually quite fun.
25395,"The RNG can be frustrating at times, but you just need to not stick to one plan if it's not working.
The game is pretty chill and fun."
25396,Alright game. RNG dependent. Clunky AI
25397,"Dota autochess with a better item system.
Have fun :)"
25398,Fun auto chess game. Could use few improvements. (more item slots and more item drops and item combos would be nice)
25399,#teamcorgi
25400,PRETTY COOL
25401,nice game
25402,like dota chess but with a functional ui
25403,perfect game to smoke a bowl to
25404,hype shit
25405,never played dota but this game is extremely addicting. would highly recommend giving it a go.
25406,"It is pretty okay.
The game needs a better match making system."
25407,"This game is fucking epic, just play and enjoy"
25408,Match length: >35min...
25409,My work productivity has significantly dropped since this game came out
25410,It's a good auto chess game. I wish I could have more than one item on each character.
25411,Still Dota Thunder Thighs
25412,better than artifact
25413,"Boring, the matches are too long for this kind of game."
25414,good
25415,Good game
25416,LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!
25417,Bruh.... How good this game though!!!
25418,ti ts
25419,Just need daily updates
25420,Great game
25421,this a nice game
25422,Autochess but my computer doesn't stutter.
25423,"no idea what dota is, never played it, this is pretty fun though"
25424,Better than Auto Chess.
25425,First artifact and now this
25426,Very fun game will play again.
25427,nice !
25428,"pretty fun game, nice gameplay. cool that you can play it on your phone with PC users."
25429,Addictive as fuck :)
25430,"Pretty fun game, started out initially playing Auto Chess on the mobile device. Converted over to playing Dota Underlords as soon as it released. 10/10 would recommend."
25431,It's a nice. Pretty good.
25432,This game is looking very good so far it takes what the mod has and tries to adjust some areas to cut down on the randomness.  a little bit of balance is needed but it is shaping up to be a very good game.
25433,It's fun but pretty much identical to Drodo's DAC. I might be more interested in playing if there was more variety.
25434,Great game at the time of this review the Devs still updated this week and fix bugs and do improvements daily of the pc and mobile and all around Great fun
25435,Better than teamfight tactics
25436,amzing game
25437,gacha gacha gacha
25438,"Plain and simple: It's pretty good. Nothing too complicated. Yeah there's mechanics that create a strategic element, but they aren't so in depth that a numskull like me can't understand them.My only issue is that every game is 20+ minutes. But that's not too much of an issue."
25439,Nice
25440,artifact 2??
25441,"A frustrating, maddening experience in RNG that I just can't stop going back to no matter how much it beats me down."
25442,"Nice game, but in the endgame if you are not lucky it's a defeat 10/10 and the matches are all pretty similar. They should do something about this"

25446,Autoplays so you dont have to
25447,"It's AutoChess++

Much easier to control and much faster to get a game going."
25448,"Great new game, only complaint is that valve is focusing on this game rather than releasing promised content for their other games, 10/10."
25449,solid
25450,awesome
25451,"Interesting take on the new AutoChess genre that is blowing up. Exudes a lovely atmosphere of familiarity if you are a DOTA player. Seems to have a lot of potential, hope they improve on the foundation they have built during the open beta."
25452,Good enough
25453,It's a pretty well-made and fun Auto Chess clone.
25454,Great game ! Easier than Auto Chess !
25455,"+ There wasn't any Pay-To-Win Aspect so far (30.06.2019).
+ Nice and new gaming idea
+ I didn't encounter any bugs so far (30.06.2019).
+ It is well made

- Tutorial decided to wait really long till it told me how to upgrade the units
- Game looks childish
- There ain't no story in the game - thus it will get boring soon

I recommend to at least try the game."
25456,is aight
25457,its good comrades
25458,"It's still in early access and it has bugs of course, but it's great and addictive!"
25459,"Good, I think the bots could use a little work. They are very clearly robots playing a counting and risk estimate game lol. But all in all, good stuff for how quickly this was pushed out"
25460,what a prank
25461,"Easily one of the best auto chess games out right now, 10/10"
25462,Mage Meta really dominate the game
25463,Nice
25464,"Good but

WE DID IT LITTLE ROCK needed"
25465,"Not a bad game.  The tutorial doesn't cover how unit types stack or how to level up units, but a few games later you'll figure it out."
25466,very fun strategy game.
25467,Yo
25468,Amazing
25469,i don't know xd
25470,"I'm not sure this is a good game, but I can't stop."
25471,"New valve product ,not bad game :)"
25472,Dead game
25473,"Draft monsters onto your team,
manage resources by upgrading your crew.
This game is fun if you like to watch little things smash other things and feel a sense of control."
25474,This is game is fun and easy to learn. I'll be playing this game a lot in the future.
25475,Fun Battle Chess game. Lots of future content planned. Frequent updates. Dev team seems to listen to the community.
25476,"After playing the ""beta"" first version on dota 2, this was a totally amazing upgrade. the gameplay and mechanics have been smoothed out and focused. great little pvp strategy game"
25477,pretty fun
25478,good strategy  game.
25479,YO!
25480,Recent changes is quite POG :) ty for keeping it updated Volvo
25481,Good fun. Will be interesting to see how it develops
25482,fun game
25483,this is a game
25484,a great game like an optimized version of the original mod only i would wish to have a mascot like in the mod and it would be perfect
25485,"I love this game??
"
25486,OK
25487,addictive. 10/10 recommened
25488,seems good tbh
25489,good game
25490,Awesome!
25491,"Very good conversion of the Dota Auto Chess Mod.
I like the freedom of switching items.
Would like to see a solo mode like in the mod but with record list of which player got to the highest Round."
25492,its fun
25493,"It's nice that it has mobile crossplay. 

Now you can poop without leaving your match"
25494,No on epic store = success.
25495,really challanging takes time to get use to
25496,I'm addicted.
25497,wtf i love chess now
25498,goood
25499,Rng will kill you
25500,Game had promise but it's mostly turned into Knights and Mages the game I know it's still early beta but I can't recommend this to anyone in it's current state.
25501,"Algunos inconvenientes de sincronismo entre jugadores debido a las plataformas, pero fuera de eso. Perfecto."
25502,"It's autochess but the valve version with dota characters.
So far it seems like the old autochess but with some graphic improvements an mechanics.
It could be more enjoyable with future access to rankings, friend lobbies."
25503,"Is good game - has a lot of depth with some mild but manageable RNG elements when compared to TFT and the original Dota Auto Chess mod, so good alternative! Item system is well made and imaginative and less RNG than original mod or TFT and is good for beginners (helpful tool tips, easy icons + income breakdown, as well as in game wiki for what everything does that can be accessed mid match), however some features like interest and positioning could be explained in the tutorial, maybe in an advanced section etc. Quick queue time, regular good patches and updates that actually improve, fix and add to the game are great and option to play offline against bots is also pretty good as it saves your progress and gives you the option to continue your game. Is good for partying with friends too so you aren't a complete loner in lobbys online or that you make yourself.

Worth a try!"
25504,Meh..
25505,fun game
25506,So far this has been my favorite Auto Battler on the market. It does items the best and relies the least on RNG.
25507,good strategic game
25508,game is awesome that is all
25509,Good game and relax
25510,"Really good
Please valve give it more love"
25511,Like Dota if it were turnbased on nobody was screaming at you in Russian.
25512,very good
25513,big pp nergy this is
25514,"Pleasantly Surprised by this game.

Have not played for a long time, but i was never bored in the time i played this game. 

Matched are always fun and the outcome is never Really foreseeable.

its has a Simple look and is really easy to understand.

7/10 Recommended if you like automated chess-style Games."
25515,"Great game. Absolutely love jumping in directly with my phone and resuming the game. 

Polished and no annoying major bugs"
25516,"addictive, but the tutorial needs some work, doesnt really explain much especially in the area of upgrading your units"
25517,I'm very new to Autochess games and this one made it extremely easy to learn and improve. The item system is great and overall enjoyable.
25518,Good game!
25519,Great game - easier compared to dota 2 autochess. Item selection is a plus!
25520,Good clean fun.
25521,Dota autochess was better tbh
25522,it is something
25523,"Underlords is fantastic. I didn't expect to enjoy it, as the idea of hands-off teamfights didn't exactly seem like my cup of tea, but the layers of strategy involved with the different alliances, gold management, health-as-a-resource, and more reminds me of DTCGs in a very good way. Definitely give it a try."
25524,RNG heavy but that what make it fun as you won't be able to get the comp you want every time
25525,I went from zero interest to hooked within 2 matches.
25526,Best autobatteler at the moment
25527,Like chess but not
25528,woow
25529,Pretty Nice
25530,Game gets repetitive after 10 hrs
25531,"Thank you valve, very cool!"
25532,Great game 10/11
25533,"Its pretty confusing at first, but good fun, when you get going."
25534,Nice variation of original Auto Chess.
25535,"RNG fest with some strategy in it.


Underlords is a game you can play ,while playing something else ,its easy to learn,and more or less easy to master.
It requires little attention,just in key rounds and in buy rounds.

And i would not suggest re-rolling at the start,just play with what you can get.And save money ."
25536,Weirdly addicting.
25537,
25538,"currently can't buy any chess without bench space (not like in mobile auto chess where you can still buy chess to the board and put it as a place holder to hope rolling to upgrade), so upgrade a chess to 3 stars is a lot harder.

hopefully it implement this, cause that's what makes the difference of casual player and pro player"
25539,faithfull recreation of the original with better ui and faster matchmaking
25540,Should've been called Dota Overlords.
25541,"It feels like a mix out of Hearthstone, but instead of cards you get firgures you can place. It has this oldschool strategy game vibe to it, but it is sadly missing something for it to be complete, as the random factor is removing a bit of the fun.
All in all I have a mixed feeling about this. I can neither recommend nor disapproved this game, but as steam doesn't give you a neutral choice I'll just say ""positive"""
25542,sick
25543,great game
25544,"Steam Summer Event, Yet decent game : )"
25545,A competitive and welcomed entry to the Auto Chess genre!
25546,"A really nice take on the AutoChess formula. A bit more streamlined but an overall fine experience. The item system is really nice, the fact that you can move items between your Chesspieces is really cool.
The Underlord system adds another really good and compelling layer to the game, which makes it still the best AutoChess game out there."
25547,git
25548,Very fun if you like a Dota like game
25549,Definitely worth a try.
25550,Seems similar to DAC but actually quite different. The item system is for sure a great news for players who generally suffer from bad RNG.
25551,KOTL in the back
25552,not bad
25553,"While this is the first of the ""auto-battler"" genre I've played I'm quite impressed.  For an early beta the load times are good, the play feels dynamic, and while some serious balance passes are needed the baseline isn't that bad.  Looking forward to seeing how this evolves as it gets closer to a main ""release."""
25554,"I really enjoy this game. Its still in beta but there are a lot of updates coming out each week and the game keeps on getting better. once you play it and understand it, you will see that you can control to a certain degree the rng. you will also notice that you can consistently get at least top 4 if you know what you are doing and you are better than the opponents. I can recommend this game its also free, so why not try it?"
25555,"Very nice, gives me da best times...."

Gameplay is pretty nice, but there is RNG in pretty much every aspect of the game:
- In the store, where the heros offered to purchase might be completely useless for the team you're building or might be exactly the ones you needed;
- In neutral rounds, where the item gained may or may not be good for you;
- In the battles, where its possible to lose to someone and win against them in the same round, due to crits;"
25591,ok
25592,Love the game! Has great potential but would prefer a better ranked system. Would reccomend.
25593,nice game
25594,"Definitely better than some months ago, worth playing now.."
25595,"A Great way to spend some extra time on both PC and mobile device. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, you're going to enjoy playing it! RNG plays a huge factor here, and if the luck is not on your side, you'll get brutally kicked out of the game. Some skill/knowledge is required however, if you want to spend your coins wisely, so at least there's something to learn."

25613,"It's just sad how this game has gone from one of the best and most well-balanced Auto Chess games to an incredibly unbalanced mess. Even since the Underlords themselves have been added, the game has spiraled out of control. Alliances don't even matter anymore; the only thing that matters is if you're lucky enough to be the first person to 3-star either a Lycan or a Viper. Get either of those, you're practically guaranteed to win, as the only thing that can stop them are another 3-star Lycan or Viper."
25614,Nice and Fun !
25615,I've never tried playing Auto Chess before but it seems really interesting. I won my first tutorial and I can say that this is a battle of wits and not about who can click faster and react faster. A fun game in the Dota 2 universe which is certainly better than Artifact.
25616,nice
25617,I can say this game is fun but needs to be more friendly to new players when it is out of beta
25618,chill game! 10/10
25619,Never felt as fleshed out as Autochess and didn't innovate/update as much as TFT

but the pc version seems fine. thank you."

It has this underdog charm in which you see it as a ""meh""-diocre game until you play it and the time winds down so fast you end up having fun just because of the game mechanics , luck, and strategy combined."

Despite this, the game is surprisingly easy to get into, and it is the most fun I have had in a game in a while.

25665,"Boring RNG-based minigame.
Mastering it won't make much fun.
It is addicting, but nothing more."
25666,Valve's take on the latest auto chess genre craze. Kinda barebone and gets boring after a while.

25682,"Fantastic effed by numbers game. And those numbers are the randomly generated variety. If you want to play chess that plays itself and all you do is buy pieces but from blind boxes that seem to never have what you want, then this is your game.

These are the worst ""card draft"" mechanics I have seen in a video or board game. You are left completely at the mercy of the tiny purchase tableau's penchant for suddenly never having the choices you are collecting and considering you need 9 of a card to get to three stars, that's a bit of a gut punch to any build. And I say ""build"" loosely since that implies any plans you make matter. It feels like there is some sort of draft mechanic at play that is not explained. I once got two of a card in the first draw, bought them, and never saw another one in 35 rounds despite many rerolls.

Finally, the game does a poor job of letting you know why you lost. You can switch to view starts for how the other guys vs you did or click them on the left to see their team. But you only have something like 10 seconds to do any of that AND still do your own upgrade/tweaking tasks. Just give us some better number overlays or something.

I guess it's a work in progress but when the only appeal to me is seeing what sorts of combo teams I can make (and the facility to do that is minimal) it's not worth the lost time. Something like 30 minutes for a play through that feels often like punishment.

Wait and play it when it is streamlined."
25683,"Good game, fluid interface.
Thorough documentation in game."

25692,one of better card games but still a card game
25693,"I was frustrated at first, but once I learned the strategy, I realized that the game has a lot of depth, and is really very fun.

I initially gave this a bad review, it felt like a complete crap shoot, every game determined by chance. Some of that may have been problems with the earlier beta version - the team has made some amazing gameplay and balance improvements, and continues to make the game more fun. But a lot of it was that the game is just deceptively deep, and I didn't have a grasp of the strategy at first.

Now, that's one of the things I really like about Underlords. It has a simple premise, and my kids love picking units and moving them around the board and watching them fight, but it also has a lot of strategy when you learn more about the game, and it's a challenge to move up in rank and fight better and better opponents. There is always an element of chance, but knowing how to work around that chance, take advantage of lucky points and mitigate the damage of bad luck is how you get better. 

Super fun game, and I'm very happy with how many improvements the development keeps making."
25694,Interesting!
25695,Pretty good much better and more stable then the dota 2 in game but has some serious balance issues that need to be resolved

25725,I like it.
25726,"This is one of those games where I wish I could have a sideways thumb for meh.

Despite not being familiar with auto-chess and unable to get into Dota 2 I found the game entertaining for a couple of hours.

But... there is nothing there.

What do I mean? Well the game gives you the illusion of strategy and there is but only in most minor barely even mattering amount.

The entirety of whether you win or lose is based on levelling up characters. Whether you'll be offered to level up those characters through the RNG is the sole determining factor in victory or defeat.

If valve actually introduced some form of gameplay it'd be worth recommending but I honestly can't at this point.
"
25727,"I can definitely see the appeal but the game relies far to heavily on luck. For a game that can last as long as a game of real Dota, relying on solitaire-like mechanics means it feels kind of like a real board game in the sense that you play it once in a great while but likely won't play it every day or even every week. And, to be honest, the gameplay loop is largely unexciting. Buying, arranging, and equipping items to heroes isn't a bad loop per se, but when the majority of rounds consist of you buying one hero and readying up, or even worse just dumping points into your level, it's hard to feel at all like you have done anything to affect the outcome of any given fight more than the random shop items and heroes will."
25728,Pretty fun game
25729,Harry potter's chess but upgraded version
25730,Pretty good so far! Love the new Updates!
25731,its good ok
25732,just to get steam badges haha
25733,Great game. Now Valve can go back to working on Artifact.
25734,Certainly addictive game!!!
25735,Addictive :firealone:
25736,My chess to go. Very good production value. Better mechanics on item drops.
25737,"Easily the best auto chess game out there. Lots of quality of life improvements over the original, more consistency with items (Item drops are guaranteed with every neutral round, even if you lose, and everyone gets the same number of items), simpler/more straightforward item management (each unit can have 1 item equipped and items do not combine together), and more interesting alliance synergies as well as global items to change what each alliance does in unique ways.  Over all, Valve has done a great job polishing and improving upon the original Auto Chess formula."
25738,"what can I say, candy crush is pretty good"
25739,"Dota Auto Chess gets a normalization through Valve with it's own client. Some small changes, a ton of interface upgrades, and subtle changes to synergies and item generation make this a fun and accessible alternative to Dota Auto Chess."
25740,DODO UNDERLORDS NO RUINERS
25741,"Kinda like an rts, kinda like a card game. Strategy and learning units, items and their combinations. It's okay."

25750,Recomended
25751,Wel good fam
25752,"This game is pretty fun. I haven't played DOTA 2 or any other MOBA in years, but it didn't really matter when it came to learning or having fun with the game. Its classified as an Autochess Game. What that means for Underlords is each unit acts according to its Alliance in terms of moving on the board (for the most part). Warriors will charge towards the nearest enemy. Hunters/Magi will stay in their static position attacking from distance, and Assassins will warp/fly/jump behind the enemy lines, attacking the furthest away unit.

Thats just the basics of the AI movement in the game. What I love is the teambuilding aspect. There are many units, and each unit is classified under at least two alliances (Warrior/Hunter/Assassin/Scrappy/Inventor etc). This makes in important to get the right synergy and combination for your team as you build it. There are many other factors but, its a free-to-play game. Just download it and try it out. Personally it hits my niche of wanting to teambuild in an RPG without having to go through the story and other aspects of the game. Just pure teambuild and battle."

25754,it is better to go.

25759,"As of this review, the game is still in early access and is on build 177.

The game is basically DOTA Autochess made into a full game with a few key improvements and differences.

The core game play of playing Dota autochess is there and you can take it on mobile making it easier to shift from PC and take a shit in the toilet while playing which is an advantage I would say.

The game comes with an in-game codex/game manual which writes down each and every heroes detail making it FAR superior from DOTA Autochess where you had to look up information online to find out about the heroes and best of all it can be accessed any time even when in game.

The game comes with 2 main modes as of now, multiplayer which is ranked and versus bots. Your main choice is multiplayer but you can train or try different compositions and learn more about units by playing with bots which is pretty much great. Tutorial is bare bones which is good enough for new players.

However the game lacks a few things as off now, WE NEED CUSTOM LOBBIES with the option OF CUSTOM RULESET in which the host can customise the rules of items and heroes this would make playing with friends more challenging and fun.
The Single Player bot system can be improved much further as well such as including and EXPERIMENTAL Mode where players can have infinite gold or can free choose items or heroes, of course this MODE should be limited to a SINGLE PLAYER, with a mode like this players can experiment with units and come up with strategies instead of depending on RNG for a single player mode.

With all that said the game is still good enough to play since its free however the bot option needs a few more tweaks."
25760,"This is Underlords, they can never be Overlords!"
25761,GG WP. only random no skill
25762,"It's SO much like a slotmachine. It pulls on the same dopamine levers. Instead of seeing little icons of banana's and coins you get Axe and Druid. You can't pull of any ""real"" strategems, because you can randomly be withheld a unit despite spending a lot of gold just to piece together a build and lose because of it.

So, effort doesn't really matter due to RNG. As we all know, RNG tends to even out after 1000 or 10000's games and by then skill becomes apparent. And there is skill to the game, knowing how to place things and which units are worth it. However, one ""game"" takes approximately 30 minutes.

Which means this is a poor and frustrating waste of time."
25763,Lame AF
25764,nice
25765,"When you have time to waste, this small easy game is one for you. good game for the days you have no clue wat to play."

25780,A bit more polished than Dota 2 auto chess but its still a bit lacking so far
25781,"Way better than artifact. Seems to be more polished than the original Auto Chess, uses dota heroes, altought the skills are often different and you can only use one item(+ global which is a nice addition to gameplay style). But all in all its better, less random luck.

Con:
i dont know if it would be nice, but somehow i want a chat.

25817,"At the present moment the game lacks a lot of polish when compared to it's counterparts.
Also the unit balance leaves a lot to be desired, since you can see the same units across the board most times."
25818,Hands down the best autochess game on the market.
25819,Hey.. no surprise mechanics yet...
25820,"still beta, but this game definitely defeats Artifact in every levels... Gaben sees money"
25821,"Easy to learn, good gameplay, good concept."
25822,Great game could maybe be something
25823,"Game looks good, controls feel good and the graphics are satisfactory. RNG can be atrocious, some matches can last up to and beyond an hour, so plan ahead. Gold management is a thing. You can leave the match at any point and it only loses rank right before and after Lieutenant. Sometimes assassins will shamelessly waltz between two tanks with 0 consequence and none of your other troops will care that your backline is being demolished, they'll just keep fighting an irrelevant weakling, letting your dudes die. But dat Pudge hook doe. 

8/10, needs a bit more polishing in AI behaviour and targeting + RNG, but the devs seem to take good care of that so far. Still, we have yet to see where this goes."
25824,its good

25829,"Really cool and interesting game, didn't liked the ""feel"" of the game when it was a mod, now it is a lot better."
25830,Best auto-chess game at the moment!
25831,Really fun game.
25832,"Highly addictive and while simple at first glance it has a high skill ceiling that will keep you glued to the game as you play, each game even when you lose may give you hints at what you may improve, some times you may have a plan and you will have to discard it entirely and come up with something else, in that sense you have to have both a flexible mind and a steady strategy, recourse management then it is key if you want to make a good team, however since everyone else is drawing from the same pool, you will have to manage and have an eye on what teams your rivals are building in order to avoid being cut off from completing a synergy or from leveling your own team.

With the arrival of the Underlords to the game, the addition of the jail that temporally removes some heroes from the pool, and items that can be placed on the board itself, the game has acquired triple layer of deep, now on top of the previous things to take into account you have to be mindful that not all alliances and strategies may be accomplished from the start, this in turn has to be considered alongside the characteristics of the underlord you choose to play with, and the ways in which you may build them and how they interact with your team,  and the items placed on the field.

And of course it wont be a Dota derived game if we don't mention the constant amount of rotating heroes and new ones coming into the game, each one changing the alliances and their attributes, in short making it an ever changing fresh dynamic and challenging game, designed to keep to keep you engaged."
25833,"A version of Dota Autochess, Nice graphic but need to improve and please bring the model update  hero when we level hero!! nice game so far

Update 11/03/2020 : Nice update to bring back this game, goodluck"
25834,"The game overall is average, you are definitely having a blast when the RNG provides you with fine 3 star heroes and you manage to finish your alliances, but if not you will face unbeatable Troll + knight combos, untargetable 3star spirit combo with mages, full 3 star assasin combo (slark with satanic, moonshard or mask of madness) fucking with your backline and your units won't even bother attacking him, Repositioning does not help as they tend to jump at random positions. Additionally 3-star spectre even after 2 nerfs does not seem to be balanced, 3-shotting my 3 star bristleback with shiva is not cool. Avoid at all costs, the amount of rng is abysmal. Solo might not be that bad, but still playing with a friend is more fun for me in general ."
25835,its a fun game. Lots of clone with different skin

It takes a bit to understand what the hell you're doing, but after a bit of trial and error you'll get the hang of it. I'm sure there's higher level strats and combos but I have no idea. Give it a try."

25898,"amazingly cool, and works well on mobile too!"
25899,Pretty polished and the item system is much better than Teamfight Tactics or AutoChess mod
25900,RNG HATES ME!
25901,Matches take quite long and game is pretty RNG but its very fun
25902,Unless you have been playing DOTA awhile and understand all the characters and items it's going to be a pretty steep learning curve for you. It has been awhile since i played DOTA but i remembered most of the characters moves. The damage got so convoluted there towards the ends of the matches I was playing though I didn't know where I needed to improve my characters or replace them.
25903,gut
25904,very good but not so good as league of legends
25905,Its a solid Autochess.

25913,not badd
25914,aight
25915,fun game i guess
25916,"Disclaimer: Played all auto-chess variations, not claiming having reached queen and such ranking in any of them.

Decent graphics, still in early stages, could improve numerous ways, yet I feel Artifact's dying embers cozying me up with a more coherent world and characters contrary to the rest.
In gameplay the 1 item/hero limit is enough change in itself to muck up the balance we all learned in the Auto-Chess mod, might turn out even more diverse in the longrun. Yet now the heavily item-dependent heroes with passives feel a lot weaker their past average.
Music/sound effects, atmosphere blows away the rest. 
My only yet huge drawback in Underlords is we don't have any collectible 'play thingy' like a courier to pick up items, roam around, and most importantly whip out the rare courier bling to showoff. Yes this is crucial to demonstrate how cool we are with the rarest couriers. ;)

Personally I dig Underlords the best. I feel like Teamfight Tactics is different enough so these to can live along. 

"
25917,"Great game with so much potential. Really looking forward to the future of this game.

Still going strong. I love the autobattler genre and it is staying fresh with frequent updates."

Final thoughts:
I will compare this game to Hearthstone which is spin of of WoW. Dota also is spin of of WoW. And as we know Artifact  failed to meet expectations. So valve pushed new concept which is called ""auto chess "". Which i was unable to understand.
Played 12+ hours, watched other Youtubers, tutorial isn't helpful. So it's surprising that i spend so much time trying to understand this game. At least in hearthstone totorial is more helpfull . In place of Artifact and this ""masterpiece"" i would expect at least one level of Half Life 3 to be done. I playd this game 4 free and i want my refund

25978,Frequent updates doesn't make me feel stale at all focusing on strategies is key but I admire the optimization done by devs so far
25979,"Like Dota 2 but with 1,000,000x less clicks"
25980,A pretty well cleaned up version of the DOTA Auto Chess mod. Less item RNG and interesting passives make it an interesting game with a pretty good mix of strategy and luck.
25981,It's autochess. And it's on phones so there's that.
25982,yaaa kn fue -.-
25983,"It's Autochess, not much else to say. If you enjoy the Dota2 Mod, you'll enjoy the valve standalone."

25994,"Awesome, much better than DAC!"
25995,It's hard.
25996,AUTO CHESS ON STERIODS
25997,It's a pretty good auto chess game.
25998,Game is pretty random and your creatures are pretty dumb. They will stop attacking an enemy that is almost dead right next to them to concentrate on someone at full health.
25999,Its fun to play occasionally.
26000,"Nice & Enjoying Game
8.5/10 :)"
26001,"Even though some small things are unfinished and/or unbalanced (it IS in early access/open beta after all), you can have a really fun time with this game. Especially considering the rate they bring out patches which buff/nerf and keep the game fresh through that.

Just go into option and set your camera distance farther away, the board won't get obscured anymore and that actually solves a lot of the ui problems combined with some of the changes in the last patch (you can simply click out of the shop instead of having to press the button at the bottom right/pressing space)."
26002,"Great simulator, can't wait to see with future updates"
26003,"Really fun auto-player. Very heavy in the RNG, but it still gives an opportunity for the player to have a great time. I'm impressed. I will recommend this game to all of my friends."
26004,good game
26005,+1
26006,"Fun auto chess game, similar to the mod, but different enough to make it worth playing as well."
26007,Great game!
26008,I really enjoy this game !
26009,Fun to play
26010,This game adds new items and some new hero's to change up the existing meta from Dota auto chess making more builds viable while also keeping the feel of the old auto chess and everything you liked about it.
26011,More consistent tft
26012,game is fun
26013,Not so bad huh
26014,good game:=)
26015,For an early access title the game feels like thought out and polished addition to autochess genre. Suitable for both serious or click for a while gaming sessions. Easily accessible character information helps new players get into the tactics.
26016,"Don't play WoW but play Hearthstone.
Don't play Half-Life but play G-Mod.
Don't play Dota 2 but play Dota Underlords.

What is wrong with me?

Good game though."
26017,"Great game. The RNG is a little bit...uhm...way too random.

Edit at 15 Feb:

Don't bother with this game. It's all about luck, no skills required. You might as well go to a casino."
26018,"Basically the Autochess version of Dota, made by Valve

I did my best trying during 40+ hours.
It's too slow and a game is way too long.

It's boring and the ""tactic/strategy"" doesn't even exist."
26019,yes
26020,"I think its a really cool startegy game, but since im not the fastest one, need a bit more of explanation, everything else its perfect"
26021,A good mobile game to pass the time during commute.

26026,Autochess with standalone client AND active & communicating marketing team. What else would you need
26027,New sensation!
26028,Pretty Good Game For Early Access!
26029,"Much like AutoChess but with a few different characters. There's buffs you can choose instead of item loot. It's fun to play but I feel like there's less achievement to it than AutoChess which, for me, is a small issue.

It is free (for now) so if you like the autobattlers it's a good one."
26030,Fun Time Waster
26031,Funny and nice to play game with mobile intergation and interesting mechanics.
26032,zaebumba
26033,It's fun to play but it's unbalanced and sometimes too random.
26034,"Played 2 games,won both."
26035,"Pretty fun, not better than the original DAC, but on-par if not slightly better than riot's TFT"
26036,The cross-platform and the possibility to swap between devices is fantastic.
26037,"Really fun game. Even with all the RNG involved, it's perfectly possible to build and execute strategies"
26038,"If you are still playing Autochess on Dota 2, please move on to this.  It is cleaner, better, more functional, optimized, all that stuff.  Do it."
26039,"this is not a review, this me ranting that underlords is literally everything artifact wanted to be and something i really tried hard to believe in

i would compare valve to a boosted teammate in dota
they are playing in a league clearly not suited for them (trading card games)
accomplishes nothing in the game (artifact) 
but because the other players of the team can carry valve's heavy weight on their backs (drodo studio)
valve never gets punished and instead is rewarded for playing with said good teammates (underlords)

still good game tho"
26040,This game is really good for people who want something to play on the side or when they are on the go. The mechanics are simple and easy to understand while having enough depth that there is a decent skill ceiling to hit.(at least to my basic understanding of the game)
26041,Casual Phone Game version
26042,Very fast and fluid game. Would recommend for any casual to jump in on for a new game.
26043,sure is a game

26045,"If you like games that are mostly RNG based then this is fun. 

Valve needs to keep copying games and stop trying to change them. Dota and this was great, but their card game not so much."
26046,Actually bearable.
26047,Veryy good game!
26048,"great game, it has a future."
26049,so good
26050,Best Chess game so far! So easy to get into and the quality of the game are so good.
26051,Game takes a little getting used to but still a nice casual game to play

26053,TFT can take a few things from this.
26054,Залупа коня
26055,gud4chilling
26056,Nice
26057,Probably the most user friendly and accessible of the auto chess games out there. Alright tutorial and good UI informing how you're team is doing damage wise as well as how the comp is going.
26058,Probably one of the easier Auto Chess games to start with.
26059,Better than TFT
26060,Very fun but almost makes me sick not being able to move around.
26061,I would say its worth a try if u like auto battlers
26062,"Still in beta but a good take on Auto Chess.

I believe that there are some mechanics that could change (regarding items, for example), but I believe that it is on the right track."
26063,its ok
26064,SICK GAME !!!!
26065,"Fun but Frustrating game, Hard to get used to the play style and combos but rewarding when mastered.
Auto chess was a huge success and putting this game on mobile was an amazing decision Rate this 9/10 Tangos

I don't recommend this game if you easily get pissed 

Recommended if you like getting pissed and annoying your family and if you like strategy games."
26066,"Good game, needs updates"
26067,"Never played an auto chess game before, it's pretty fun!"
26068,"As someone that doesn't really dabble in strategy games often, or games like DotA either, This game caught my eye.

As A newbie, the tutorial isn't exactly the best in showcasing how to play the game 100%, but i'm sure over time that will change. The HUD is simple so it's easy to learn what you're doing, and there's certain styles of play that you can use to get an advantage on your opponents.

If you decide to download this without having played any other strategy games like this one, go for it! games are always hit or miss, but this one was a hit for me."
26069,Don't know what I am doing and I won't win any game. But it's still fun!
26070,ez win
26071,nice
26072,the best autochess i think
26073,"First truly cross-platform game from Valve. Decent adaptation of Drodo's Auto Chess mod, missing a lot of polish and a bit quirky with balancing but's that to be expected from a beta game. 

Glad to see that Valve got back to it's roots: picking up good projects based on mods of their titles. Seems like they are not sleeping."
26074,"The changes Valve have done to their version Auto Chess compared Drodo's Auto Chess is for the better of the game.

Having a drafting stage for item greatly improves the impact of the game. Back in the mod version, often I see other players with the stronger and more expensive item while others are stuck with a cheap, basic item. The RNG was brutal.

Even with that major change, this game still favours heavily on luck. I often find myself missing a few key pieces to upgrade and through multiple rolls and re-roll I still don't find them. This isn't addressed but in the item stage, there is an option to get pieces one-level higher than yours.

That's just one issue, but the core game remains very similar.

EDIT: 11/26/2019 - They added Duos, if only I have friends to try this with!"
26075,"game based on luck. boring and uninteresting mobile game. valve is dead.

volvo made a game in maybe less than 10months for a shit trend and it brought so much cancer to the gaming community. now everyone thinks this auto chess bs is a new and interesting ""game experience"".

ITS A FUCKING SHIT MOBILE GAME I PLAYED BETTER ON MY PHONE.

GIVE US HALF LIFE 3; LEFT 4 DEAD 3 AND UPDATES FOR TF2 ALREADY
I AM SICK OF YOUR LAZY CASHGRAB STUFF VALVE
GIVE US WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY WANTS."
26076,"Fun, comparable to the mod but different. Has a unique identity. Fairly balanced as well."
26077,Gameplay is amazing. The rest will surely improve over time.
26078,"Feels awful to play a mobile game on PC. UI is clunky, too big and too simple."
26079,"Everything that artifact should have been haha such a great game !! Even with the RNG mechanics the combinations of team composition are vast and complex and timing is essential. Highly addictive and enjoyable, excited to see where the game goes in the future"
26080,"Pretty fun, would like in game chat though"
26081,"Community: Did you do it?
Valve: Yes.
Community: What did it cost?
Valve: Artifact...

"
26082,sicko
26083,Interesting take on Dota.  Still in beta but hope they round out the tutorial.
26084,"Has a lot to be done ... but imo it's still has a bright future ahead, as this is valve's"

26107,yo
26108,"Probably the most accessible and streamlined autobattler of the three (TFT, DAC, DU). Item system is a bit too simple. And the game freezes horribly when going into the settings menu. Despite it's simplicity and flaws, it still is worth playing."
26109,If you've never played an autobattler before It's Free to play so why not but be careful with your time ;)
26110,"As original DotA born and define the genre itself. Dota Underlords come the same way as it's root does. Coming from the Dota 2 mods called Dota Auto Chess, the game also began to define the new genre, The Auto Battler.

Since last Dota Auto Chess release and other Auto Battler evolve.
Dota Underlords is probably the most unique gameplay mechanic with the Underords, Barricade and Target Buddy items, and the latest Jail mechanic.

Now with the new Knock Out mode, you can play as fast as it can on a hurry, or play ranked, solo or even duo with your friend."
26111,Cured my gambling addiction.
26112,"Pretty simple concept but quite fun. 

I wish there were a little less RNG in here, but then again, I don't think that balancing is much of a focus at this point.

I also hope the mobile versions will run a bit more stable soon. Crashes are semi-frequent, but at least you can pick your game up again pretty quickly."
26113,woah
26114,RNG simulator
26115,Welcome to dota pitlords
26116,"I had doubts about this game pre-release but man what a pleasing result, i am impressed.

If you are a DOTA fan this game somewhat tickles the fan feels but very strategic where no two rounds are the same and anything can happen.

Good way to pass the time."
26117,its ok
26118,"Fun in small doses, and there's a lot of RNG at play here, but if you're a fan of Auto Chess you'll be a fan of Underlords."
26119,It is a simple game. Synergize your pokémons to defeat scrubs while preventing bankruptcy.
26120,a really fun game to pass some time
26121,"In a much better place than TFT right now, and that's coming from someone that never played Dota 2/only played League before.
I was skeptical about autochess when watching people stream it however, after playing it, it is indeed surprisingly fun."
26122,a game takes too long for my taste and the end game needs some drastic improvements some more gold sinks or something else

26130,"Having spent so many hours in DOTA appx 7.5k, I am loving this new standalone based on Autochess. There is a lot of RNG involved and luck, it also feels creuely unfair so lets hope they can introduce some balancing before the mode becomes boring. At the moment I give it a thumbs up"
26131,"A little rusty right now but the game is very fun and will only get better as they update it. For a free game, I can easily recommend this"

26191," Another instance of wanting a neutral review, but i'm confident this will still be a positive:


Underlords is around the same as auto chess,  and while it has some changes for the better (items being moveable and not locked to a character) , the game is still pretty bare bones (muh corrier customization :/) but that's likely going to change  as more updates role out

However, I can't give the game anything higher thana 7? why? because the games called dota UNDERLORDS, and yet, Underlord is nowhere to bee seen..  free the underlord!"
26192,piece of shit
26193,noice
26194,friend ship with autochess broken now underlord is my new friend
26195,it was cool
26196,10
26197,Has been very fun so far. Obviously needs alot of work but i'm sure that the game will only get better from here.
26198,this game is damn awesome in a way
26199,Yo!
26200,"E divertente, ma non troppo."
26201,I've played the original Dota 2 Auto Chess and Underlords and Underlords does a great job of keeping what was good from the original and adding new elements for depth. If you like gambling then this is an easy game to get sucked in to.
26202,Great Game
26203,Prayse the RNGesus
26204,Nice game
26205,Very awsome game!
26206,"Best done while procrastinating or doing something else on the side.
Good game."
26207,Good game nothing to say
26208,"Good, i think"
26209,ricar
26210,Great Auto Chess game :)
26211,Yo!
26212,Very cool. Just play knights and mages for an easy win.
26213,Best auto battler yet. It's still a work in progress but can't say it's not great so far. I especially like that I can take a game from PC to my mobile and go.
26214,"Too much RNG in the early rounds (and the late rounds) to be an eSport.
Otherwise it's a fun competitive strategic defense deck-building puzzler."
26215,nice shit to spend ur worst time in irl life
26216,"Cool concept, but needs something added to it to give it something more."
26217,game SUCKS i go to BED
26218,has potential
26219,"RNG or get the fuck out game, perfect for gambling addict"
26220,hoped up to this game for like 2 weeks and its awsome
26221,"Amazing take on auto chess XD
"
26222,Nice
26223,Highly addictive and greatly made auto chess game! Even better that it's on mobile too!
26224,"I haven't played any other auto chess games but I have had fun with this one. The rng elements can be largely mitigated if you know what you are doing, The game is updated every couple days, and finding a match takes only a couple seconds. The main issue I've seen is the fact each player attacks each turn, which is independant of their defense for that turn. Because of RNG, when its the last 2 people the fight can play out differently for each, meaning both can win. This causes games to get drawn out at the end because nobody is taking damage."
26225,Free game no bitching
26226,... never thought i would say i enjoy a DOTA game
26227,"Ok valve nice game, now please gib the 3"
26228,"Игра тупо зашибумба,больше нечего сказать!"
26229,THIS GAME IS GUD GUD GUD PLY IT !
26230,"Easy to learn - needs better balancing, but quite entertaining!"
26231,Good
26232,nice and addict gameplay
26233,"You got repeats offered? You win!
No repeats offered? Welp... guess you're bad at the game."
26234,Game is changing every month.Please make not so critical updates. Step-by-step
26235,"great game
hope to see more heroes shortly"
26236,Cool and new idea for a new game .
26237,Remember Dota 2? This is him now. Feel old yet?
26238,Auto chess but better
26239,"Dota Underlords is a part of the new fad of ""Auto Chess"" games, released along side of the LoL version as well. Basically, it's a PvP tower defense game. It is a good genre of games, however I feel like it is a game you cant play for too long of a time without getting burned out. It's a game I'll come back to whenever there is a new patch, or am bored with my current games."
26240,"Nope, not for me.
No idea how does even this game work"
26241,"Tutorial sucks at explaining mechanics, go look them up on Reddit or Youtube instead. Once you figure them out, its got a surprising amount of strategy involved, and fairly easy to tell yourself ""just one more game""."
26242,Simplified Management and UI from the Dota 2 MOD.
26243,niceeeeee
26244,Best auto-chess port!
26245,"excellent start, already super playable so quickly, very intriguing gameplay/strategy and lots of promise with refinement/polish"
26246,"Like that one game, auto chess, but with more valve put into it."
26247,шашки
26248,"Haven't play Auto-chess before, but it is quite fun to play.
However, one game is a little bit long."
26249,nice
26250,Fun AutoChess game from Valve.
26251,Another RNG
26252,It is really good game and i hope it will stay that way.
26253,Fun and engaging game... that's when the RNG is with you. Very fluent and elegant UI.
26254,Great game
26255,"An upgrade from Dota Auto Chess. Certain things are simplified such as itemization, and a little bit more balanced from the previous one (this one is subjective)"
26256,"Currently worse than DAC,  maybe check it out later. It feels like a mobile game"
26257,"It's alright - personally not a fan of the item system in this game vs TFT/AutoChess on Dota2, but it satisfy's the crave on mobile"
26258,A good mix of strategy and RNG
26259,"It's fun.
Didn't really know what to expect, not really a DOTA fan.
MOBA genre just feels like work with no real pay-out IMO.
Artifact felt the same, work work work.
This game has just the right amount of do a little and get a lot.
It's simple and very entertaining. Pick some hero/players, place them on the board and let the game do the rest.
After a few rounds pick some more hero, repeat.
I don't really know what happens most of the time but i'm ok with that.
I can't tell if any real skill is involved but I'm ok with that as well.
Try it out, it's free and runs on mobile so you can take it with you when your AFK."
26260,"It has plenty of potential, and hopefully Valve will not make the same mistakes they did with Artifact.

EDIT: It has gotten less bare bones-y. And It has started to improve and show how it will be different from other games in the genre."
26261,My Android phone is on fire!!!
26262,"Pretty cool game, but a bit too random."
26263,Good
26264,"The new UI takes some time to get used to compared to Dota Auto Chess. However, the FPS issues faced are no longer present. Overall the game still has a very familiar feel to it while making a certain elements of it better."
26265,Great way to experience the MOBA Dota 2 in a different way without the frustration. There isn't a lot of heroes/items at the moment but the games are quick and easy (to learn) that it's still enjoyable.
26266,Best since autochess
26267,naah
26268,this game for kailuke so that he can have a 3 star unit at round 10
26269,"It is fun but a very detailed tutorial would be appreciated. It took me a few tries to learn the game by myself and google. I was watching all those 2 and 3 star heroes kick my butt wondering what I was doing wrong!

"
26270,Still better than artifact. nice improvement on Auto battlers
26271,Fun for a short term only for me
26272,"Good idea to have standalone auto chess.
if they add more heroes and classes it would be more fun."
26273,"Very fun, but gets repetetive real fast"
26274,Better than Auto-chess gabenClap
26275,Focking A
26276,Too addicted to be true
26277,Good but still need improvement
26278,Cannot stop
26279,get adicted to this game
26280,Dota 2 was my favorite game for awhile. I had spent a decent amount of money on in-game items and irl merch. I cashed out one day and didn't look back. Was excited for Artifact but you know how that went. I never purchased it. But heres a F2P Dota 2 based game! I grew very attached to many of Dota 2's characters. Both the easy to learn gameplay (far easier than Dota 2 ofc) and the charm of the Dota characters have drawn me in. At the time the game is in open beta so it has occasional bugs and gameplay issues. I expect Valve not to abandon this game after a succsesful launch. The game currently feels a little barren with features currently. I believe Valve pushed a playable version to compete with other Auto Chess games. I really hope this game can stay on top and add to the Dota 2 lore.
26281,easy game easy play
26282,Very nice
26283,not bad
26284,good version. good gaben
26285,"I don't like League of Legends or Dota 2. TBH I think Dota 2 is better purely because friends don't hound me to play it. But because of the existence of League of Legends version of auto chess I can not recommend this. I have played both and new to both with no allegiance, but It is clear to me League's version is better and I have clear reasons why.

-UI: The UI is a mess in this game it is about 300% bigger than League's but show so much less information. Literally everything in League you need to know is constantly displayed no menus unless you want deeper info. Not here, to see shop(which you frequent a lot) you need to hit a button. To see power ups you need to hit a button. The UI is also just less intuitive, to place a character you drag it on which is perfect, but you don't drag to buy which is what you do for everything else. League on the other hand is consistent and dragging is used for all character actions. Not only this, but in the Dota version there is a question mark to click on that tells you about the character, I hit that every other time I chose a character and it sucks, League just made it so left click picks character and right tells you about them.

-UI pt2: Since there is a lot of UI I split good and bad up. I will say understanding how to level characters up and knowing a character is part of a set is much easier in the dota version. Honestly that is the only Ui thing I prefer


-Gameplay: Well this is literally identical to league with minor changes. You don't race for a character you just buy one, which has ups and downs. This means you don't get super unlucky and lose the one character you want because someone else got him. But it does mean there are less characters to choose from so there is less chance the character you want will appear. Although it means multiple people can start with the same character which is nice, but it also means less diversity in the first fight.  I'd argue Dota wins slightly here. Other than this literally everything is identical. From character types, money earned and xp are different values, but the same ratio. My biggest complaint is on Dota's end where end screens have obnoxious Ui elements come in and out which would be fine if they didn't increase time between rounds, thus time not playing. Dota does have a less wide board, but deeper. I actually much prefer this because it gives better uses for assasins, heavies, and other.

-personal gripes: The Dota version seems like a kid version in a way. Flashing lights, colorful, big font, fireworks when you rock, just everything  tries to make you feel like you are amazing and hype you up. All the buttons have sounds like springs or doors opening. To me all of this just gets in the way and annoys me. It is like in COD when you get a kill streak and it slams half the screen to tell you. like ""I KNOW I DID THAT, you don't have to tell me what I did"" Then while that kill streak is on screen there are tons of sounds with it. The most annoying to me was as I was reading character I leveled up meaning I can put 1 more character on the board. Instead of letting me do my thing (reading and understanding) I just here ""PSSSST PSSSST ME PICK ME PSSSST ME ME ME PICK ME PSSST"" my backlog of character just kept asking me to pick them. I am looking for a new character just let me be

This game basically just has a ton of annoyances around every corner which is the main reason I can't recommend. If they calm down on the sound effects that is enough for me, but there are other reasons I would highly recommend the League version over this.(Although to get the League one you must install all of league. Which kind of sucks, but i see how it helps bring players into the new genre)"
26286,Love this.
26287,aight bruh kinda boring tho
26288,"Great game, very addicting! It's easy to play but hard to master and learn all of the good alliance combos."
26289,Might the next big hit
26290,":)
:)"
26291,"A nice Valve comeback after ""Artifact"""
26292,Actually a pretty good recreation of the original auto chess
26293,very cool
26294,"When you grew up with some skills in Dota 1 and 2, what actually means, you were just not completely useless in every situation, but then you realize you have lost all of your reflexes due to your gandalf age and only a sad old piece of rediculous fat f*ck of yourself is left, so you switch to playing Dota underlords, since you have lost hope about yourself getting your shitty gaming skills together again and you need those 20 seconds every round to overthink every move in the game like 10 times, then this game is what you need."
26295,It's good
26296,Awesome game. Plus if it's FREE it's for me!
26297,"Being the first Valve mobile game they actually did a pretty decent job. I honestly thought it was going to be another Lords Mobile cash grab, but there's no microtransactions at all. Well, not yet. I would still assume they would go the way of Dota and Counter-Strike and just do skins rather than P2W judging from how the game is ran."
26298,Reminds me of a pretty cool Pokemon custom map I used to play
26299,"The game is ok. Very cool concept. My problem is it takes to long for a match and there is no progression of any sort. Give me some loot boxes or skins for like the board or something?
I love to take on chess. Recomend if u like some sort of stratagies. :)"
26300,"Needs some polish, but addictive to play and a fun way to kill time your mobile as well."
26301,сойдет ...
26302,hiiiiiiiiiii
26303,Promising Auto Chess
26304,"This is similar to Trading Card Game's drafting meets chess and MOBA.  Assuming RNG doesn't potato your team. 

Underlords team is very responsive though. Frequent updates and communication with the community. 

Game is off to a great start/beta season."
26305,Very Ok. Thank you for Steam Sale points
26306,"YES, cant wait till they add more characters and expand on this awesome game!"
26307,is nice
26308,much game very lovely
26309,Great for wasting time and for short bursts of gaming. Needs more alliances however and a clearer explanation of game mechanics like armour/dmg
26310,good for you
26311,satisfying
26312,Epic ;)
26313,nice gameplay
26314,cool
26315,"Great stand alone game.
Also supports mobile play."
26316,yes
26317,pretty good
26318,good game for beginners
26319,Game is addicting for the first day and the days after.  I would recommend trying out the game but in order to be good you need to constantly checking what other players are building and hope that you have RNG on your side with the pieces you need to build before them.
26320,Probably the best auto chess.. TFT a little slow
26321,another best game from valve
26322,THE best autochess game!
26323,"Estratégico e Divertido !
Alguns Heróis precisam de um Nerf básico mas nada que afete a sua gameplay <3
De resto, marabigold !
QQ ISSO VALVE !"
26324,soo faarrr sooo good
26325,yea she goes alright
26326,oynayın
26327,"Yay Phone
Still fun"
26328,lav
26329,Another Dota another time to spend
26330,noice
26331,meh
26332,cool game 10/10
26333,awesome update to a great formula.
26334,"Fun Auto-Chess game. If you like the genre and Dota 2 I recommend trying this. 

Update: Recent updates have added more fun challenges to the game."
26335,John Lennon beat his wife every day and abused his son
26336,"It's good, but it's chess good"
26337,"there could be a option of a room with faster rounds, I mean 1,5x the normal speed, nothing that would change the game's balance, aside from how long it takes, this is a really fun game, and remember kids, dota did it first."
26338,"""A game, developed from a mod, developed from a game, developed from a mod, developed from a game."" 
- Somebody from the subreddit."
26339,"Definitely still needs improvements. I am still a noob on this type of game mode and the multiplayer is ""unplayable"" in the sense that I'm getting owed (always) my the majority of the players - so a balanced matchmaking still needs improvements :)"
26340,Noice!
26341,Easy to pick up but has good depth of strategy without feeling overwhelming. Beta has some issues but Valve is quickly updating and addressing bugs while adding new features.
26342,"Smooth game, works good on mobile"
26343,good
26344,a
26345,Игра = челендж для неудачника...
26346,"If you like chess, this is none of it."
26347,Psss..
26348,Looks good. is free. long matches. Linux version is excellent
26349,Not as good as what came before but still enjoyable
26350,They copied dota autochess
26351,Dobrá oddehovka
26352,Its worth trying all the current Auto Battler type games available right now but I currently think Dota Underlords is the best one due to the guarenteed item drops and overall polish to the game.
26353,Additive and fun and most importantly FREE give it a try.
26354,"Fun Game , looking forward to the finished game"
26355,AUTO CHESS
26356,ya is gud
26357,"odlicna igra, bravo haha"
26358,"outstanding support,game is growing so fast"
26359,good game
26360,                                                                            .
26361,its okay i guess
26362,not good enough
26363,Bast gam of de yer
26364,"They are trying, but they dont have any experience in the balancing. Need to find IceFrog of Underlords and Artifact to be successful."
26365,good for mood
26366,gooder
26367,I'm a mobile gamer now
26368,I just can't stop playing this :)
26369,Very good game
26370,This game take me from real life for forever
26371,"Theres a rank called Big Boss, this is actually Metal Gear in disguise"
26372,"I am so into Underlords. Kinda exiting and get you addicted so easily.
<3"
26373,"It's free, it's fun, you can play it on mobile and keep your progression and even switch between different platforms while playing an online game. As long as the developer support continues (and right now the ideas posted on Twitter and Reddit are getting converted into gameplay features within a week's time), this is a grand game."
26374,fun * fun
26375,"fun
"
26376,good luck
26377,Bit less boring than dota
26378,"+ Frequent updates
+ (Global) items matter a lot
+ Probably best autochess game 

- UI issues, a bit too much like the mobile game
- Some balance issues
- Too long games ~40 mins"
26379,Mmm!Nice!
26380,A nisman le hubiera gustado
26381,Good
26382,Not bad
26383,"Cant get enough of it, developing team is amazing with lots of communication with the community."
26384,"The games pretty good , better than the mod in Dota 2"
26385,"Very fun, cleaned up some of the RNG from auto-chess. Looking forward to more items and heroes."
26386,Gooe game to play.
26387,"Super fun and loving the underlords and multiplayer additions! 
Was not expecting multiplayer to be so much fun! 
Hero tiers and items are also quite cool making games a lot more varied.
All in all, recommended!

Really excited to how this further evolves and in retaining a fair business model."
26388,Not very interactive
26389,xd
26390,"good but not excellent, optimize ui, power performance and we need more decorator items thanks!"
26391,Very tactical
26392,"chess + dota = 10/10 , also , nerf bastion pls"
26393,it good at start but when time to pick is random luck
26394,this game ....
26395,such a great game
26396,"Good game, entertaining. Good plan, well executed."
26397,it's fun
26398,just like autochess
26399,"99% rng, 1% strategy"
26400,A fun game where you just have to shop and watch the fighting go down
26401,"Well this RNG game is hates me so much, but i still enjoy playing it while i take a poop"
26402,Better than the Dota 2 custom game
26403,I like it
26404,Much more polished than other auto chess games
26405,pretty fun to play here and there
26406,Really good game imo but less player count
26407,"Nice game. Interface looks better than in dotachess, more fresh. Also like the new item drops system. This way it is more balanced. Waiting for more heroes to be added"
26408,Better than Artifact
26409,"It's alright. Really long games, not much fun. If you like Dota and that stuff might be good. Please make another real game valve."
26410,nice
26411,such game iz so hard...
26412,"When i first heard about Dota Underlords, i thought it was going to be another Artifact level type of game, turns out it's an actual fun game and very well done. Congrats Valve, it's a good thing to hear that you guys are making games again, now it's time to release games in a different IP."
26413,โครตสนุก
26414,everybody needs this game
26415,10/10 autochess`
26416,a
26417,"It's is like a deck building card game. Not exactly, but somewhat. Think of this like Bakugan, but with characters from the Dota Universe. Runs good on my 2nd Gen Intel with integrated graphics as well. And the best part- No gameplay affecting micro transactions. Currently it has none whatsoever, but in future Valve are gonna add a Battle Pass ,which is fine in my opinion as it only rewards in cosmetics."
26418,"Not for me, surprisingly boring.
I enjoy Arena of Evolution: Red Tide  way more."
26419,nice game ....
26420,good rng
26421,Everything feels like RNG until you believe in the heart of the cards.
26422,"goood game play and make ke thinking about strategy
"
26423,"The addition of global items is refreshing and make the strategy more interesting. However, the mobile UI is cluttered but still undergoing massive rework."
26424,Much better than Artifact. Best place to waste time during work hours.
26425,Its ok
26426,Solid
26427,I love this game!
26428,There is something unique about this
26429,Very good compared to other autochess options as this game can display more info while playing and doesnt need other websites to learn
26430,Good game to play in free time but not for try hard
26431,It's free and lots of fun to play. Easy to get into and some deeper strategy to it. Try it out!
26432,autochess for babies but its ui isn't buggy shit thank fucking god
26433,"The best autobattler out there. Easy to learn and best UI. Also available on mobile, like made for the current generation of gamers."
26434,nice game
26435,I like it
26436,cool
26437,Best Game RU
26438,So far so good
26439,"Good game, I like to play auto chess. I like this game because balance than every auto chess."
26440,"Improve communication skills. Help hand eye coordination. Teaches me to be patient with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 10/10 would recommend
"
26441,Very addicting
26442,Valve worked good on it after their failure with Artifact. Porting it on mobile devices and making it crossplay just ads points to Volvo
26443,MEH
26444,nice
26445,Not bad.
26446,"From what's currently in the game this seems like the worst Auto-Chess game. You can only have one item on a hero, the hero pull is lower and the game feels like a mobile game (both for Art Style and Gameplay). Tried the mobile version for it and it went into a crash loop after I entered my Steam username. If you want to play a good Auto-Chess just start up DotA 2's mode or League of Legends spin on it, both are better than this."
26447,VS against bots make this game more fun
26448,aids
26449,"Fun and Interesting game.

If Valve adds more stuff like rewards, game would be even better"
26450,Good game
26451,fun
26452,never been into auto chess but the dota 2 theme here works very well and i've been really enjoying this game a lately. this game also has an app for mobile where it fits very well and the game works perfect with cross platform.
26453,"Valve's take on ""auto-chess""
Very early in development.
Search the net auto-chess so you can get some idea of what it is.
Has some potential.
"
26454,"I don't like DOTA, I don't like card games but I really like this game. It is highly addictive and there are some really fun challanges to it. The mobile cross play helps."
26455,Good stuff
26456,Nice to play on mobile while you are commuting to work !
26457,Not artifact
26458,its okay
26459,Really Addictive game. Hope it was a bit faster. Takes about 40 minutes to complete single game.
26460,Good game !
26461,Not great...
26462,"The auto-chess genre boring (the games are too long), too RNG based and you can't even control your creatures when the fighting happens."
26463,Have Mercy Please
26464,"For now the game it's OK since everyone play this kind of game these days..
RNG based games.. casual strategy game that is great for passing time..

"
26465,sD
26466,Good
26467,TFT > Dota Underlords
26468,nice game..!!
26469,"This game feels very much like a deck building card game like Star Realms. The synergies, the snowballing, the RNG. If you like that sort of thing I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

I enjoy playing it to a certain degree but most of the time I just find myself confused as to how someone has been blessed to already have a 2 star on round 4 or a 3 star by round 10. I'm saying, ""boo hoo RNG"" but i think I am wishing that, like the deck building games it so heavily borrows from, it had more nuance and complexity.

Well worth a try though if you've wondered what this whole ""auto chess"" thing is about. You'll probably know after 20 minutes if you're going to love or hate it."
26470,"Really time consuming, but a fun way to spend an afternoon for sure."

26547,Good but little glitches here and there
26548,"not bad, needs more combos, cosmetics, 2-player team mode, and some minigames on the map"
26549,"Its a great game. After playing teamfight tactics by Riot, this is far far ahead.  Riot's game engine has some catching up to do. Still the barrier to entry is higher than teamfight tactics, and that is one area valve can improve on. I'll give this a 8/10."

26560,"Decent game, same as its predecessor Dota AutoChess custom game. There are some minor differences, though.

Item mechanics reworked: 
   Each creep round offers choice of 3 items to pick 1.
   Only one item per unit, can change item allocation.
   Added global items - affecting all units/specific alliance.

Positive:
- Way better UI and controls. No clunky courier interactions and all that.
- Clear DPS/Damage dealt stats for each round. Clear active alliances info panel.
- Added AI to play around with
- Mobile client! (Although, for me it consistently crashes around the lategame, which makes competitive play quite difficult)
- Yo!
- Global items

Negative:
- Some in-game info is missing - spells/items damage type, magic resistance (can be found only in detailed info)
- No leaderboard in top tier.

Other:
- Some heroes already present in original game are still missing - to be added in future.
- Interest calculation fixes at the start of the match. (Except for +1 gold for win which still will be accounted)
- Unit AI sometimes does strange things. Not casting a spell, standing still (poor disarm visualization?). Not exactly clear how target prioritization works."
26561,It ain't Half-Life 3 but it ain't Artifact.

26578,"I really like the idea of the game, managing your luck of the draw to optimize your unit setup - you have to work with what you are offered and it makes for entertaining, fresh choices.

While it's a beautiful game (graphicswise), the UI still could use quite a bit of polish.

All in all well designed, I expect this to become pretty adictive."
26579,"This review has been written on the 29th June 2019 during the beta. Gameplay may have changed in the meantime. Since I’m not a native speaker some expressions may be awkward.


Summary
Dota Underlords is an autochess battler. First of all, I’d like to explain how the game works. If you’re familiar with board games you could also call this kind of game a deckbuilding game like Dominion. In this game you have to assemble an army to battle other players or NPC enemies. In every round you gather gold and spend in on new units. These new units are stored on your “hand” until you set them on the battlefield. Apart from buying new units you can also use your gold to increase the maximum number of units on the battlefield.
Every time you lose to an enemy army, your life points are reduced according to the amount of residual units of your enemy.
Your goal is in general to buy units to assemble an efficient team. That means spending just so much money that you win, but still keep some money to get interest rates. An efficient team is a team, which fits together well. One aspect is to have tanks and damage dealers. Another aspect, which is more important, is that you have to assemble a set of units with the same type. 


Criticism
First of all, the game is very fun for the first 5-10 times you play it. It’s easy enough, so that you have first successes after 1, 2 playthroughs. After that you can try many combinations and it’s quite fun to see how well an army of 9 assassins works. In the longrun, you are quite aware of which combinations work and which not. The game then resolves more about luck and can be quite frustrating then, if you don’t get to buy fitting units for your current army. Though you can assess how many fitting units will come up, much like in Poker, I have had lots of rounds, where I had 10 rerolls without a fitting unit.
Which gets me going is that there are repeatedly changes to the game, which are not very big, but still change the meta a little bit.
Ordering your units on the battlefield seems to have a significantly lower impact than having a set of good units for example. The units quickly disperse so you cannot really to plan where the units go on the battlefield. For some strategies you need to predict the movement of your units. This is especially true for all effects, which just have a reach of one square, like the paladin effect or the special healing effect of the warlocks. This doesn’t work so well. All in all, regarding the positioning and prediction of movement of the units, just general strategies seem to be possible. For example, let the tanks stay in front and let the assassins attack the mages in the back.
Some Items are too overpowered. Especially the 2 second invincibility for the warrior type and especially if you have that trait 3 times (that happened to me twice). If you have this combination, you have already won, congratulations.
One major game aspect is that you have to adjust your strategy to the strategies of the other players and make a counter. That is often times not really possible, especially if there are still 8 players in the game. So you focus rather on making your army stronger than to adapt. If just 3 players remain, it’s very expensive to adapt, so in that point in time, you probably still won’t adapt. It would be better, if you had a smaller pool of adversaries or some kind of a tournament mode.
Since there are 35 rounds in average, the game takes 45 minutes. Since optimally you want to get interests and don’t change your team every round, you have sometimes very few actions during this time. So for focused players, this game drags way too long. For unfocused players the choices of items for example are too important. If you make a bad choice there, this can screw up your whole game.


Conclusion
Very fun game for a few runs. In the long run just for players, who want to calm down after work. For heavy strategy gamers this game might be too shallow. For a few round I give a 9/10. In the long run rather a 6/10, because it’s mostly luck not strategy. Also, this game takes too long for being a light fun game.
I am interested in how the game will develop and will have a look into the game, when it’s fully released. Some of the issues I had with the game, will probably still remain the future, like the random movement of the units. I am also excited about how future expansions of the game will affect the current balance of units. Most of all, I’d like to see some elements, which will tone down the randomness of the game.

26620,"Quite interesting but for now Underlords still don't match it's parent in the way of content-filling.

It's much better as an alternative - the random in Underlords has lesser impact on the result of the match. Still, in champions and items/passive abilities drop, there is still much to improve. For example, it would be great to sell items or, even better if you could combine tier1 items into smth more powerful.

For now it's 8/10 for mobile."

26628,"Autochess is a popular mod for DOTA that was a big success. I myself have accumulated more than 40 hours of playtime in Dota while never touching the MOBA side of the game.

What is Auto-Chess?

Auto-Chess differs from regular chess in several ways, the most notable, is that you are playing against eight players, not just one. Each round you enter the shop and get a choice of heroes to hire. Hiring heroes with similar skills allows for certain bonuses to kick in, including more HP or magic resistance.


As you would expect, you can’t play Chess against eight different players at the same time, that would be chaos. Instead, each turn you go up against a different opponent, if you lose this fight you will take damage. Each player has 100 health to start, and there can only be one winner.

Is it fun?

Auto-Chess is one of those games where you can’t drop in and expect to win. There are certain characters and combinations that take a while to learn and perfect. But once you have got the basics down, it is an enjoyable game to play.

You can’t buy units because they are pretty, they have to serve a greater purpose. There are nine classes of monsters to recruit, getting a certain number of each class will cause a bonus.


Matching three of the same creatures will allow you to merge them together to create a two-star version. This character will now have around double the health and damage it did at one-star, so aim to get characters to level two or higher.

What are the Negatives?

As with any Battle Royale game, there is the issue of time. How long does one game take to finish? The answer is a little flexible, but it depends on how well everyone in the lobby does.

If you are one of the first to be eliminated, then a game is anywhere from ten to twenty minutes. But, if you are trying to win, then a game can last over half an hour.

I don’t know if you guys have half an hour to sit in front of your phone in one go, without doing anything else, but I don’t.


I believe mobile games should be quick and simple, which is the exact opposite of Dota Underlords. Underlords is confusing for new players, there are so many elements that can change how the game plays.

I will admit it doesn’t take long to sort of understand what is going on and what you should try to do. But a lot of the game is down to blind luck. What units appear and what upgrades you get is down to luck.

Yes, you can choose which unit or upgrade best suits you, but you can go entire games without getting what you want. I kept seeing enemy units spawn behind my lines, it took me two games before I got one of these upgrades for myself.

Should I try it?

If you like strategy games that take a lot of your time, then this is the game for you. However, if you are like me and don’t have an hour to spare for two games of auto-chess, then I wouldn’t bother.

You can get better at choosing units, upgrades and positioning your units. Although, if the enemy has better units and skills then how can you win? Combat is simulated, so better units and skills equal victory.

From all the autobattlers currently on the market, Underlords was the one that caught my attention. The hundred hours I spent on it were fun BUT you must know that the game hasn’t been updated in ages. Covid seems to be one of the causes but it’s been literally months without a word from Valve so from all purposes the game was abandoned.

Do I recommend Underlords? Yeah. It’s good fun and it’s free so you can get a few hours of quality entertainment and there’s still an active player base so you can get into matches easily, but like I said… No updates for the foreseeable future.

[h1] Español: [/h1] 
De todos los autobattlers que jugué Underlords fue el que llamo mi atención por ser basado en Dota 2 y segundo, por su jugabilidad. ¿Lo recomendaría? Si, pero es importante que tengas en cuenta que el juego lleva meses sin actualizaciones y parece abandonado, el juego sigue siendo entretenido y se le puede exprimir unas buenas horas de diversión (y es gratis), pero a estas alturas no pinta muy bien el asunto."

26720,"Amazing game. The only problem is that Valve abandoned it and now it's slowly dying... I just can't recommend it anymore. 
I wish they would start taking care of this game and update it frequently again, but, at this point, I've lost all hope.
Sad to see a good game abandoned like this."
26721,"If I had a way to lock people's positions on the scoreboard to more easily remember who had what units, and if item crafting was still in this like it is in the custom map, I'd like it a lot more.
As is, it's a perfectly serviceable clone of Autochess, but some of the minor changes (unit walking, alliance synergy items) don't feel that good in my opinion.

The UI elements showing current alliance power and what units do what are super nice though, and make the game very easy to pick up."
26722,Mates can't blame me anymore while playing Doto
26723,Well it's just auto chess with a few changes there was really no need to make it a new game.

I have now played it on both and even though it is cross platform, it seems like there is a handicap in favor of mobile users. Very fun but lacks some of the difficulty/charm of the original.

26750,It's more Auto Chess. Needless to say i'm gonna play a ton of it. I love Global Items.
26751,"Dota Underlords é um jogo legal, estilo Dota Auto Chess que quer ser o melhor dos dois mundos: Quer ser tão bom quanto o mod do dota 2 e tão portátil quanto o Auto Chess Mobile. Infelizmente nessa tentativa ele saiu como um jogo apressado que é um pouco pior que os outros dois. Ainda assim, é muito divertido e vale a pena jogar!"
26752,nice valve
26753,"Pay money for Artifact, get a free game of auto chess?"
26754,good
26755,Good game to play .
26756,"good, but its RNG battle
"
26757,"Tutorial doesn't help, but then again, its pretty easy to understand"
26758,hardd game
26759,Not played any of the other autochess games but this is a pretty slick implementation.
26760,Like it very much!
26761,"Fuck I lost 3 times against mages ended up in 2nd places.
Against majority 2 stars mages and i have four 3 stars character with 1st tier scales
this game is bullshit"
26762,Really feels like Valve tried to replicate autochess rather then innovate. Would have preferred something a little more refined.
26763,"Autochess but with great tweaks and shortcuts, really helpful. Gets boring real quick tho"
26764,I love this game!
26765,nice games tho
26766,Nice Move Valve
26767,great one for spending time
26768,"Great Strategy, fun game to run for  session or 2, and a diverse set of heroes and items to make many tactics work out, Won my first game just a few minutes ago from this review good learning curve to game, maybe a bit rng at times but fun most of the time 9/10 Edit: over 100 hours now and some changes, still finding it fun  and enjoying some of the varied new season 1 stuff, still recommended and still 9/10 rating imo"
26769,"Currently the best autochess game. (2019.06.29)

It was the best autochess...  :(
Now it's just Underlords Scrappy Edition (2019.12.29)

Valve fix your shit!
Who am I kidding, they are just a small indie company..."
26770,Good
26771,"Easy to start, hard to master"
26772,Muy divertido
26773,Fun casual game
26774,"RNG is still prevalent as dota autochess.
For long time dota autochess players will enjoy this game for sure with similar controls though the casuals may not enjoy this game.
It's easier to adapt to new strategies based on RNG heros however some players have it easier getting 3 tier heros within round 4 while some players without even tier 2 heros. 
Even if no player is getting X hero from the hero pool u willn't get tier 3 heroes due to RNG and game mechanics.
"
26775,"Pretty decent game, however it suffers from quite a few flaws.

1: It's very basic. This may be good, may be bad, but it's basically just picking units of a certain type and combining them together and hoping for the best. Sometimes you win, sometimes RNG makes you lose.

2: It's too RNG based. Literally everything is based on randomness. Where your pieces move/attack first might be different the 2nd round of the same enemy. The items you get are RNG. The units you get to pick are RNG. Your enemies are RNG. You need to be lucky to win, not skillfull.

3: It's too much for a mobile game. The game takes upwards of 30-40 minutes depending on how far you get, this makes it almost impossible to play on the bus or a ride to somewhere, and unless you're plugged in, your battery is going to die. For reference, I have an S8+ with the graphics settings turned to low/med for battery saving, and 30 minutes of playing drains me from 100% to 40%.

4: It's also too much to be a side-game. You can't just pull this game up while you're playing something else or doing something else as it takes slightly too much attention to be able to keep it in the background and pop in and out."
26776,Another Artifact remake
26777,"Good Introduction to the Auto-Chess Genre, does a good job teaching how the game functions and the fundamentals. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn auto-chess."
26778,better than dota chess
26779,"nice
"
26780,heh
26781,prettyyyyyy good
26782,"Great game, easily jump to mobile"
26783,a great game for those who likes to make their own strategy. i enjoyed this game! and its for FREE!!
26784,"More time consuming than Dota.
Less strategy than Dota.

If there was a bit more strategy involved I wouldn't mind the RNG."
26785,noice

26790,It's ok
26791,"very good game, balance pls"
26792,Nice
26793,Play like Auto chess but not at all.
26794,Когда уже релиз 1.0?
26795,"Very similar to its inspiration AutoChess. 

this game does not have a courier.

10/10 would play and reccomend 

10/10 Stolen idea"
26796,meh...
26797,Very nice game (this review sponsored by Volvo's achievement system)
26798,"Solid game, gets repetitive, but what doesnt.. Mostly play on mobile, would like to see more classes or units, and more a variety of items. But solid game."
26799,ULALA DOTA CHESS!
26800,7/10  balance shop items passive plz
26801,Interesting game. Now is getting even better.
26802,Still sucks
26803,not bad for what it is I wouldn't call it strategic tho. once you work out what you are doing luck plays the biggest part in how you go it also has room for improvment. i have had games where i have been winning cumfutabuly and suddenly i cant get a single hero that will go with my team for ten rounds and i will waste a heap of gold cycling threw groups to get somthing i can use and suddenly im getting overwhelmed. it would be nice to see some more oviase counters between the class sets and the item choices in the early game could be a bit more generic because it sucks when you are forced to take a trait spesific buff only to not be able to field a team to benifit from it. tho if you are looking for some thing casual and free its not bad
26804,An improved version of Dota Auto Chess.
26805,You will have no idea what is going on at first. I gave up on the game half way through my first game. Gave it a second try and was intrigued and by my 3rd game I was hooked.
26806,"Never played the original Autochess, but i really like this take on the genre, while I do not enjoy others' take. Hopefully this can be somewhat encouraging for Valve."
26807,Its Auto Chess But New So its good i guess
26808,still better than LoL
26809,"I am actually really enjoying this game! yes, they're things to fix and improve but I think allowing most of the community into the beta will help find theses issues way quicker. Anyways, its fun and great!"
26810,"Feels like a complicated and at times confusing idle hero, then again it is fun."
26811,good shit
26812,"love it.

i don t think RNG  is so important in this game"
26813,Surprisingly tactical.
26814,Not bad.
26815,Brilliant concept love it so far
26816,needs a lot of improvement but so far pretty good
26817,"really fun, rng is still there but it is less of a hindrance"
26818,Solid base that Valve is building on.
26819,good stuff
26820,"Absolutely addictive, regular updates and looks great!"
26821,"enjoyable game and big plus, you can also play it on smartphones :D i recommend people giving it a try"
26822,"Fun game heavily reliant on RNG, can be played while chilling watching streams (I generally play this game to unwind)"
26823,"This 
is 
a 
good 
game"
26824,This game is so good !
26825,bery nice
26826,"I just started but it looks like a grate game with a fun but not to hard (for me at least) strategy game (I think its fun for most ages if they can read ha ha ha). Looks once you get good at in there not much to do but its still updating fast so...
"
26827,"This game is not about randomness, even if it seem at first. It's a bit like poker, beginner complain about luck but if you use your brain a bit you get how to play."
26828,RNG Trash! Recommend!
26829,"Why I'm doing this to me again?
Ah never mind let's gamble another round!"
26830,How to train your luck 11/10
26831,"DOTA UNDERLORDS is very fun to play and very interactive! ($5 has been transferred to your PayPal account, remember to remove this message when sharing in chat)"
26832,a good mini game for wasting time
26833,"No microtransaction bullshit, just a play button."
26834,And Half Life  ? never ?
26835,RNG filled gacha valve poopoo
26836,"Quite fun to play, pray to the rng gods"
26837,WAY TOO BETTER THAN CANCER AUTO CHESS IN ALL WAYS
26838,Даб
26839,Best of the best (y)
26840,good game but can use some new features
26841,it's all about rng go try play it
26842,"First steam game mobile, great game but takes lot of time for only one game."
26843,ye
26844,still missing alot of stuff compared to dota's mod.
26845,"Really good how they picked up autochess and improved the overall quality of the game and making it a standalone game. Its really good because everything a player needs to know in terms of synergy, stats, attributes, and so much more is readily available right on the main screen which makes this game stand out over TFT. Also its available on mobile :)"
26846,"5% SKILL
95% LUCK

MAD SIMULATOR"
26847,I don't even know why I'm liking this game that much being so bad at it
26848,nice
26849,its ok
26850,It's a fun game
26851,"Great fun, love their twist on the Auto Chess game. And its great its on mobile. Keep up the good work"
26852,YEAH COOL GOOD REALLY ADDICTIVE WOWEE
26853,Fun
26854,Good game but matches take too long
26855,"Loved the Dota mod happy it got a standalone game.
Can't wait for more different underlords"
26856,"Not Half Life 3 but also definitively not Artifact. 

So ... thumbs up."
26857,ok
26858,yes
26859,great fun game ive played over 4 hours on my ipad
26860,good
26861,"Looks good and is not very boring, also there is mobile version."
26862,has potential
26863,Fantastic game! It can even run on my potato PC.
26864,"This game made me realize how much of a sh*tty luck i've got 
10/10 would refresh the shop again"
26865,gg
26866,DUOS AND KNOCKOUT ARE THE BEST WAY TO ENJOY AND PLAY THIS GAME CHANGE MY MIND
26867,Very fun to play with friends to see who is blessed with rngesus
26868,Nice and fun.  I'm pretty sure it will become better after this beta
26869,dota2 :-0
26870,Nice meme.
26871,Tutorial doesn't quite explain as well as it should
26872,great game
26873,sh1111111t network motherfxckerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
26874,Finally a better version of Auto Chess.
26875,nike
26876,mobile version of Auto Chess is better
26877,"It has potential. For me its lacking a reason to play . maybe because ranking is a bit low for a strive. Unlike DOTA 2 where I can still play other modes, if I get bored playing dota 2 I go play on arcades also I am bothered about the sets because it feels nice if I can also use my sets on that hero so I can brag about it."
26878,"Easy to learn, very hard to master.
Surprisingly fun and entertaining.

""Underlords"" mechanics bring an interesting spin to the autochess genre."
26879,.
26880,No idea what was going on
26881,seems like Dota Underlords is not for me
26882,"- Buy a ranger hero or some other hero
 - Try to get it to rank 3
 - Everyone else bought a ranger
 - There are no rangers
 - Random korean guy comes back from 2hp and 200 gold to kill everyone because everyone bought out the ranger and now no one has a rank 2 or 3 hero that can compete"
26883,beri nice gaem

26886,5/7
26887,what the heck mobile so laggy
26888,эта игра мне кажется чуть лучше чем авточес
26889,Still a fun game with good updates!
26890,its alright
26891,I have never played Dota2 or Dota Autochess but the rules are really easy to pick up and there is a well balanced learning curve.
26892,“《刀塔霸业》永久免费。”
26893,Really fun game but early and mid-game doesn't contribute to end-game very much. Some things are unbalanced but it's still good.
26894,SICKK
26895,"This is my review as a casual player who plays ever so often a few rounds of underlords.

I really enjoyed the game for a long time, but recently things took a weird turn.
I mean I get that it is an early access and that underlords has to have its own usp, but I don't get the most recent changes.

We now have Items that you place on the field and weird star units. I mean I get that after moving a bunch of units to tier5 you needed to buff them. However I don't think this system is the solution.

We had a decent fun meta a few months ago. Now many of the alliances feel like trash. Many of the units that were viable in a variety of comps have been moved up in rarity or nerfed. Leaving their original alliances in a crappy spot. 

All these changes are slowly killing the game for me. Just when you get a feel for what is good and what works, some giant change is coming along and you start at the beginning again. 

So sadly I cannot currently recommend this game. Maybe once they release the game (The end of the early access) we can make a proper judgement if we like the game or not, but with these frequent fundamental changes there is just no telling where we will end up.
"
26896,shit game
26897,great game and u can see that the volvo is listening to the players' feedbacks
26898,I played so much that i tried to level up my heroes in dota 2
26899,The units AI is as smart as my 2k mmr Dota teammates
26900,"Everything, except visuals, is better in the original Dota 2 Autochess."
26901,Real Fun Game.!!!!
26902,not bad
26903,Very cool game. Fun for passing time.
26904,Gud
26905,Not good!
26906,Great Game
26907,"It's highly addictive and fun to work with new builds. Dev team are also extremely communicative about future content and patches. I look forward to the future of this game and genre.

Edit: Although as development has continued to make the game more confusing to new players, it is still a fun and innovative game."
26908,"it needs a little bit of balance in some units (still in beta) and more units, but it has a good visual presentation, its intuitive, and entertaining. 8/10"
26909,is good.
26910,SO GOOD
26911,GGWP GOOD
26912,YO
26913,awesome
26914,"well give it a try, they are trying to make it interesting and balance gotta be honest"
26915,hay
26916,fun
26917,The game was so nice .. but in Android version it some laggy..
26918,its a valve game alright
26919,"Good time waster, plus it works on mobile and pc."
26920,Pretty much the same as the Dota Auto Chess custom game with improved item system.
26921,"First time ever playing an auto chess game ended up playing it for the whole day, really like the concept totally worth a try!"
26922,"It's not that bad, but you can't really play the game when you are on the go."
26923,10/10 best autochess game out in the market right now.
26924,relly good game with big potecial i just wish they dont add micro-trasaction
26925,awesome
26926,Stupid game
26927,"In my opinion, easily the best Autochess/Autobattler out there at the moment. It vastly improves on what was established in the original DOTA Auto Chess by fixing the horrific random items that it had, guaranteeing a drop every loot round win or lose, however if you win you get a choice of 3. The choice of keeping items at one per unit is also a change that allows simpler gameplay while still maintaining enough complexity that items dont take over the meta.

The UI in this game is clearly built for mobile, because it is on mobile, that being said the UI is extremely intuitive and unlike Teamfight Tactics (the Riot Games version) the fights feel extremely impactful making for a very fun experience

As i said at the start i think this is easily the best AC available"
26928,vi siter har i venten och spelar lite dota
26929,"A new version of Dota Auto Chess with major improvements in terms of balance and UI, with an uncharacteristically active Valve Developer Team pushing out rapid updates - definitely recommended for fans of the original."
26930,"Valve's autochesser. It's almost the best one out right now, and will definitely become the best one post proper release. I don't think this genre's longevity is that great, but for the time being this is the one you want to start playing.
EDIT: it's for sure the best of this genre, the development team is constantly adding content and improving the base game."
26931,yayyy
26932,Игра не оч
26933,its ok
26934,fair enuf
26935,Auto chess FTW
26936,Like this game much more than the mod on dota 2. The UI is much more polished and i really like the new item system for when you beat an intermission round.
26937,"Game itself is awesome, but RNG hates me"
26938,Some small bugs still but makes a lot of fun to play!
26939,cool game
26940,Great game
26941,Ok Nice
26942,Recommended
26943,like father like son. dead.
26944,Good
26945,Okay game
26946,meh
26947,"Nice to play some games from time to time.  Underlords gets updated very often and the devs don't shy at changing various game mechanics. That and the different game modes make for a fun experience and thereby Dota Underlords is a recommendable game (especially as a free game), even though it can be challenging as a new player"
26948,Umm
26949,Great game
26950,good game
26951,Yo! Good game!
26952,Crazy addictive. Fastest 40 minutes of my life.
26953,Great auto chess that works for PC and phone seamlessly. Excited to follow this game's growth past beta.

26955,Surprisingly good
26956,good game
26957,Auto battler loses view after some months of gameplay

26967,better playing with friends
26968,"Good port from the Fun map.
hope the balance changes will hit soon."
26969,Fun
26970,this game really good.
26971,Dota Underlord !
26972,Better than TFT
26973,It's very fun and time consuming.
26974,"Dota Underlords is a DOTA-themed Autochess game. This means you have to buy units in the shop and place them on an empty grid. These units will not do anything until the round starts. After the round starts, the units will come to life and start attacking their enemies. Overall, this is quite a fun and chance-based game, with still skill attached."
26975,A great game but needs an improvement on UI.
26976,need the courier for fashion lol
26977,Barebones
26978,It's not chess! But it's a'ight.
26979,"Good for playing while doing something else, one game here and there. Very addictive. Just a shame the only way Valve can make a good game is by remaking a community mod"

26986,"not bad, not great, some of the time when you finish a round and hit main menu it doesnt let you select the difficulty and just keeps it the same as your last round."
26987,Good game
26988,I enjoy this a great deal more than the original Auto Chess due to the refinements made in the UI and not being able to dump all items into a couple pieces to make them unstoppable. Hopefully they'll cross link our DoTA inventories so our pieces can run around in Immortals and sets.

It's fun...Valve abandoning the game (and communication about the game - like, maybe, Valve, let people know what's going on??) means there's a limit to the fun.

27006,"I never liked Dota or any moba games, but this one is really different. The best part for me is that you don't need to understand how to play in a team in order to start on multiplayer. It gets a little while to understand the basics, but a couple of plays with bots gets you ready to play with others."
27007,Highly addicting and entertaining. Regular updates is a huge bonus.
27008,its boring game with nothing tactics
27009,very nice
27010,The UI isn't user-friendly but otherwise keeps all the appeal of the original dota 2 auto chess

27012,I just can recommend it !
27013,"Random and imbalance and time wasting game. 

Sure the game requires knowledge on gold management, positioning, using good units and alliance..blah blah all these so call ""skill"". Then suddenly one game you find yrself last 3 in the bottom despite doing the best which the random god gives you.

In the end, you feel like you are just wasting your time away with a trash game."
27014,"Games take too long for my liking, and the RNG can be really punishing, but it's not bad."
27015,"An enjoyable experience mirroring the original AutoChess. The RNG can feel bad at first, but once you understand how to play around the economy and board positioning the game becomes far more consistent. Most of the game is about adeptly countering RNG."
27016,RNG Hates Me
27017,"Could be more balanced, but still fun."
27018,Much better than the original Dota 2 Mod and way ahead over TFT but we need a better rewarding for winning. Bring back the couriers!
27019,"+ Fun Gameplay
+ Item System is the most comfortable out of any Auto Battler (sadly no item combination like in TFT though)
+ Character graphics and level up visualization look good
+ Clear indication when you level up, the shop refreshes or you have too many / too little units on the board

- Most alliances or classes don't feel intuitive to me as a non-dota player (Why is this one a savage and this one is not? Is this a tank? CC?) but that obviously changes with game experience so not a big bother
- The interface is ugly like a run over Pidgeon. It's made to work on mobile just as well as on PC at the cost of visual fidelity"
27020,better
27021,wow how did time skip half a hour.
27022,I love it
27023,"- Lots of QoL improvements over the mod. 
- Great item system
- Updates come fast
- Needs a bit more ""life"" (more voices, some sort of representation for the player)
- good netcode
- you're either the greatest strategy brain history or you're the greatest strategy brain in history that gets screwed by rng"
27024,95/100 better than artifact
27025,"Pretty enjoyable experience, I was skeptical at first, but as it turns out it's an interesting game that usually plays out differently each time. I do however occasionally feel like flipping my table when rng gets the better of me."
27026,A game based on a mod that was based on a game that was based on a mod of a game. 10/10 would mod again.
27027,"It's fun. Sometimes the RNG Gods are on your side, sometimes they aren't. Try it ^^"
27028,Pretty basic but good for blowing some time on.
27029,a good Valve card game
27030,Nope

27033,Great game to play when you just wanna sit back and chill
27034,"After I have played Dota 2 for 1150 hours I said NO. NO more dota. I was just staying in front of my pc playing over and over again the same builds.

Now, with Dota Underlords, I can play the same builds every game....... while gaming on my phone going to school."
27035,For now Underlords is a great standalone take on Auto Chess mode. I hope that when they bring in the new mechanic it stays like this. For now I highly recommend for you to at least try it since it is free :)

27057,"Has some major accessibility upgrades from the original autochess and adjusted balancing, pretty fun"
27058,Can this game beat TFT? Let's hope so! Auto chess games will thrive with more competition between developers!

27097,Cool chill game on toilet gaming
27098,Just nice
27099,"Since it's an Early Access, it might be lacking features and whatnots, but the game itself is already quite solid, and I haven't found any bug ever since.

It lags sometimes, but probably it's on my end."

27109,"I never played Dota 2 and had no idea about any of the characters before I played Underlords. At first the game seems very unfair and complicated, the tutorial is not doing as good as it could. But after a few hours into the game, I learned a lot about gold management, synergies and items.
This game is a lot of fun, but sometimes it seems a little unfair because of the randomness of the shop offers.
Nevertheless, I very much recommend the game!"
27110,"This has a huge potential to be an e-sport game.

Updated: The new update makes this game much more complicated sadly."
27111,nice game
27112,"Well, wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be!"
27113,its okay for casual gaming. but it lacks more depth.
27114,This game is very good

27116,fun
27117,It's kinda like poker
27118,"a game of chance
depending on what shows up in your store, you will either steamroll your enemies, or they will kick your ass"
27119,"if you're good at dota, you might not so good in this.
if you're bad at dota, chances you bad at this game too are pretty high"

When you win, you feel great about your strategic choices.
When you lose, it's clearly all just RNG."

On the downside, it probably needs some work on the balance."

27136,You need to have at least one hour to play one game
27137,"Probably the most balanced auto-battler out there. Really fun and competitive and with the features that are in development, i cant wait to see where this can get. 

PS: You can pause the game on PC and continue on your phone when going to the toilet. 10/10"
27138,"If you need your auto-chess fix, this game is it. Be warned, though. Once you get hooked, it will sap away a lot of your time!"
27139,"More dota spin off trash nobody asked for, nobody wants, and nobody likes. Remember when Warhammer 40K received a chess piece of dreadfull spin off game? Yeah, you dont, because it was a piece of crud, because it was sticking something awesome as space marines and orks, on a freaking chess board... this is the same deal, play this brainless game with bog standart strategic thinking requiering by buying the highest tier tanks, 4 of them, and put them on the front line, and buy the highest tier ranged heroes and put them right behind them, spread them around on the first 2 front lines if you want, rinse and freaking repeat. Matches can take up like a hour, holy hell .Its not fun, its boring, tedious, repetetive, Valve has a serious Dota fetish going on, replacing their flagship title that is Half Life with this garbage that is Dota, as serious plague on their innovation in games or therelack of. We didnt need Dota 2, we didnt need Artifact and we didnt sure as heck need this trash, it is god awfull, do not waste your time on this, you might aswell play Dota 2 instead because atleast there you can ACTUALY control your heroes where as in this the game plays itself for you like a glorified mobile game, you cant sell items or buy new ones, you cannot beat late round neutral creeps, its a stupid dumb game utterly unworthy of your time. Instead of what we want, Half Life 3, Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, we get this horrendous piece of shize. Valve simply does not get what we want, this is just further proof of their disconnection from us, the public, the society, you cannot tell them what we want because they dont listen, they even joke about Half Life 3 themselves, Valve are the joke in truth. And people are freaking clueless for praising these hot garbage dota dumpster fires, they are encouraging them to keep this up, to keep making dota garbage instead of actual good quality games WE WANT. People are fools, fanboys, what you gonna do... so thanks guys for applauding them for this, for giving this good reviews. have fun drowning in Dota filth, wont be long now before we got FPS Dota, Dota kart racing, Dota RTS, turn based Dota, etc. thanks alot everyone.
P.S. the stupid tutorial didnt even tell me how to upgrade those heroes to level 2 and 3, what a joke. Didnt need to though."

27156,Good game needs a bit more polish in graphics and balance but it is still beta so it's ok
27157,Better than TFT
27158,good mobile game from volvo.
27159,"Playing this compared to the original AutoChess and TeamFight Tactics, this feels like the lesser of the three.  
  
The UI feels really janky and cluttered, and horrible unoptimised.  The game feels very much made for mobile, and then ported to PC, with super large icons, whole-screen taking popups etc.  
  
Until it's made to actually be a PC game, and not a port to PC, it's definitely low on my list."
27160,Good but needs work on rank system

27176,"лучше, чем battleground Kappa"
27177,good game
27178,"As someone who has never played Dota auto-chess, I decided to give this a try. 
Here's my pros and cons list:

+ As far as I know it's a unique game concept
+ You have to quickly make decisions, no lingering
+ It feels rewarding to upgrade your units and think of new strategies 
+ Re-equipping items (which isn't possible in League of Legends TFT at this time)
+ Battles can result in a draw when both strike a finishing blow at the same time


- Tutorial explains next to nothing for people who are unfamiliar with this game (Very newbie unfriendly!)
- No explanation on how to upgrade units, I had to find out the hard way (Very newbie unfriendly!)
- It's not very obvious how much gold you need to advance to the next level
- RNG factor is very high
- Units can take a long time to use their ability, even though their mana is full, which can be frustrating (Because: why?)

All in all I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something different and doesn't mind the RNG element too much."
27179,Epic
27180,Too early version but nice.
27181,Game
27182,shit

P.S. I still get bad draws, why Volvo, why?"
27186,pure RNG!

27197,good game but also do some dota lul
27198,"Fun and lots of tricks to learn to start to appreciate the depth, but as it is in beta not much of a tutorial. Just watch a ""getting started"" and you will be fine though."

27218,I really didn't much like DAC when it came out and usually didn't play it often. But I have to say Valve really upped their game with this more polished/less-jumbled version. I now play underlords almost every day! 9/10
27219,Thx volvo
27220,Best Chess Game

27232,"Fun game, but wish heroes release faster and better balance"
27233,Better than autochess
27234,"[h1]Dota Underlords is a very laid back ""casual"" strategy game that is great for passing time.[/h1]

This game came out a few days ago, and I've already sunk more than 15 hours into it. 


To put things simply, each round you pick from a random selection of units, and between rounds your team fights another players team. The strategy comes into play by trying to find units that combo off one another by having similar types. 

+ Free!
+ You can play it on your phone. (although all of my time has been on PC)
+ There is enough content to play for many hours
+ The strategy in choosing your units is deep and really makes you think about your setup. 
+ Every game is different as the selection of units is randomized. You will likely never have the same unit setup.
+ its entertaining to sit back and watch each battle unfold.

- It is very confusing to learn at first. I remember playing the tutorial and thinking ""wtf am I doing?"" it will take a few hours to grasp the mechanics. (tip: buying 3 of the same unit upgrades to a level 2 more powerful unit)
- Some balancing changes would be helpful. 
- Games last way too long... like 30+ minute matches that can not be paused. 
- Very RNG dependent, which can be frustrating. 


Side note: You do not have to know anything about Dota to play this game."
27235,Fun game
27236,"Good game, needs some tuning still."
27237,Kinda laggy on Mobile version but still enjoyable

Though I wish there would be more reserve slots for heroes, like 16 instead of the current 8."

27246,Nice take on AutoChess games
27247,Fun
27248,good game just rng doesnt side with me
27249,"I'm a little on the edge currently, whether this game can be recommended currently or not.
Keeping it short, I think it can be recommended for casual play, but for competetive it feels like decisions don't matter anymore.

The devs keep trying solutions to solve problems, like introducing a shorter game mode and trying to rotate the heroes in and out. Which is definitely a plus, can only hope the game gets better in the future.
But the underlords...
At first I was excited for them and I actually didn't mind when it was just Hobgen and the lady one, I think it was actually fun. But now there are 4 underlords to choose from and each one of them gets a random mode. Since there's only one style  one can pick up from at the time from each underlord, I think they could as well remove all the styles altogether and give each underlord only 1 set of abilities.
I might be wrong, but at this time I think underlords change the game way too much by themselves."

27306,"the only viable gameplay is ""the good stuff"";
also, still VERY RNG based, not for early quitter.
there are strategies to play from behind and strategies for win-streak based game, so every games are ""technically"" winnable. 
alliances are not well-balanced, only a few combinations are viable to earn top 4.  
steep learning curve: optimizing economy, leveling timing, hero placement, .etc.
rank match is grindy and repetitive, but every win is WORTH IT.

if you're looking for mindless fun, this little f2p gem is perfect."

27322,"Very similar to Dota Auto Chess, from which it spawned. It's still fairly early in development, and will need some work to become what it could be. Still, it's quite fun and in many ways the experience is streamlined enough to work. Maybe not ""fun"", but certainly addictive!

Edit: I feel the most recent updates have not been beneficial to the game, and the perceived enjoyment is greatly diminished. The balancing feels ""off"" in several ways."
27323,Best autochess game out there.
27324,"MOBILE REVIEW
Differences to Auto Chess are minor, but I like the idea of item picking and global buffs. The issue for me is performance. I had like 5fps first days, after update it improved slightly, but only to around 10fps :( I have pretty high-end  phone, but believe that is caused by it being non mainstream device, with different parts in it (bought directly from China). On the other hand, Auto Chess had no performance issues for me, even in it's beta, so... I hope this game improves."

27327,Pretty good just needs better optimization on mobile for sure
27328,"Obviously bare bones as it's early access but updates are regular and moving in a positive direction, gameplay is already tight.

Very RNG based but it feels more like poker in that regard, you can make a bad hand work if you're smart about it.

There's a VS AI mode that honestly feels good, highest difficulty is challenging but possible, it even lets you pause and play at your own pace, amazing if you're new to autochess as a whole.

If you've been interested in autochess for a while and wanting to try it out then this is my recommendation, just a small, free download for a lot of playability."
27329,"Great shit, lots of new heroes and knockout mode is the tops."
27330,I love artifact <3
27331,Not bad i guess.
27332,123
27333,Yo!
27334,"Valve backed auto chess with cross-play, stable servers and minimalist ranked system.

Super playable in it's early state, takes a lot of things from the original mod, and there still a lot of things to be added, but a great game to burn time away.

P.S. add a daytime map though."
27335,cool game
27336,game like dota
27337,KAL RAAT YEH LOG PIZZE KHATE RAHE HAIN
27338,"Seemingly The best variation of this genre on the market at the moment. More approachable than the original mod, Frequent updates, improvements and balance changes.  Its free, its on steam, what else could you possibly want.  
Might not be the game for everyone, considering the gameplay and randomness involved, but is a great timesink if you're into that stuff."
27339,Nice.
27340,"best carding game, but the tempo on this game is so long,"
27341,ok
27342,Another free to play game to spend 100s of dollars on without feeling guilty about it
27343,"I know nothing about Dota but this game is really enjoyable. I didn't play the original auto chess mod(mainly because I didn't want to have to download Dota 2), but the game overall is fun and a good way to kill time. This game and Team Fight Tactics are pretty much the most popular games rn. This game is a lot more polished but I find the LoL game because I'm more familiar with the characters."
27344,"it's not artifact, so it's not that bad"
27345,DEAD GAME
27346,/
27347,doto > tft Pog
27348,Addicted....
27349,"Great game based on the Dota Autochess community mode originally made for Dota 2. Valve keeps listening to the community and improving the game, they made it free to play, and learned from the mistakes of Artifact.

The gameplay is very different from Dota, it's a game about thinking and strategy, the fight happens automatically and the player is just the brain behind the team taking strategy decisions.

It's free and has around 1.5GB so give it a try, it's definitely worth it. Linux version runs perfectly and uses Vulkan for rendering which is amazing as Vulkan is the best API out there. I'm definitely going to play and support this Steam's multiplatform Vulkan version of Autochess instead of the incoming LOL and Epic ♥♥♥♥ Store alternatives."
27350,So good
27351,"So after nearly 150 hours of game play I think it's time to update my review. I have left my original review below for reference on how my opinion has changed on this game. There are no deeper tactics, this is a gambling game in disguise, you could have the perfect strategy a fantastic crew but then be thwarted by RNG. The essence of this game is a dice roll, your entire match can be ruined by some poor rolls and bad luck. Sure you can change your crew but towards the mid match you are locked in so if the characters you need don't come up your going to loose. The same applies to the other players, but all this does is lead to frustration when you loose and frustration when you win because it's a hollow victory. 

I wouldn't waste your time, there is no strategy here, there is no skill here and you are always at the mercy of RNG. The only thing you learn is what alliances work better than others, which is meaningless if they don't come up. Further more, there is a pool of characters at the beginning of the match, meaning there are limited numbers of hero's of any given type. So if someone gets better RNG than you and is picking the same characters you need, you are fucked. 

I've given up, I figure that playing poker is about as fun as this game. Avoid!

-------------------------------OLD REVIEW-------------------------------------------

Dota Underlords takes the familiar Dota characters and applies them to the auto chess format in a fast paced rounds lasting up to 30 mins a game (at my level). The mechanics are largely randomly driven making it harder to go in with a fixed strategy. This forces players to act in a ""what works"" mentality. I'm sure there are much deeper tactics to be employed here if you are so inclined, but be prepared to spend the time learning"
27352,cool
27353,Nice game
27354,I kinda like it
27355,good
27356,Autochess better and nicer. Needs some balancing but overall enjoyable/chill strategy.
27357,Nice
27358,eh
27359,"If you liked the autochess mod in dota or if you like rng strategy games you should give this game a try!
You battle neutrals and other players depending on which round it is with your ever growing army.
You should take advantage of the synergies your heroes provide with their races and classes.
If you do well you can get loot and/or abilities.

A big plus for this game is that you can play a bot game without the usual round time limit. Since a match can last a good hour you can't play it at work or in a short break. But thanks to the bot game you can!"
27360,Fun evolution of auto chess.
27361,"So far, a really addicting and fun game <3"
27362,"Could use some polish but fun overall. Interesting synergies that you need to exploit to win ie: traits, cost balance, overall team focus and items. RNG still has a lot of influence for combinations."
27363,wow kopipast
27364,"Good game, I mean knockoff, and reccomended if you played the original mod."
27365,Other than being a game at least 30 minutes its awesome.
27366,ayaya
27367,Is gud
27368,Great game! one of the best
27369,Axe in hand!
27370,"TL:DR : New genre.Genre filled with illusion of depth but its filled with RNG shit. Hate the genre. Can handle phones. World of Dota Underlords is original and unique. Free Game=no bitching. Time not free=yes bitching

If someone told me last year that i would play a genre, that at first it will fell like a game filled with depth, but then discover that that game is dictated by RNG SHIT i would probably laugh at that person and then tell him that game will never exist. But lo and behold: MABA . For those who don't know what MABA (Multiplayer Auto Battle Arena) is its where you buy units and set them on board where they automatically battle with other 7 ( in this game) players. You can also use your gold to level up and gain more units to place in the board. Get three same units of 1 star to get  one 2 star unit ( getting three 2 star units gives you one 3 star unit). Units have different spells and are different classes ( in Underlords its called Alliances) where they have passives that when you get different units that are in the same alliance they get boost that benefits the units (assassins have critical strike  chance, mages lower magic resistance for the opponents, and demons where if you have only one demon it gets more damage then having more. In Dota  Underlords the items are always dropped at loot round and there are passives items that affect Alliances in some ways(The demon Alliance passive can now allow you to have demon boost without having to remove other demons for it). The game can give you the felling that you made a smart strategy, for example my last opponent kept losing rounds and close to dying because my assassin's kept killing opponents most valuable unit on the back( assassin units will always go for the units in the back lines) then my opponent decided to place his unit on front and i started losing rounds. Same happened to my mages where i placed the most valuable at front and left other units to deal with assassin's. This type of moments is when game fells so much fun, where you tamper with the opponents units and Alliance passives (Like knights passive when you stand close to another knight unit you get damage reduction and mess that up for your enemy by having units that move/toss away knight units, fucking up assassin's ( as mentioned above) or using demon hunters against demons ( Three guesses to what demon hunter Alliance does). 

So why did i say that the game is decided by RNG? 

Well did you read the part about my opponent moving his valuable unit in the front because my assassin's and i started losing, well he lost in the end due to lucky crits and passive item that allows my assassin's to give my enemy units a disarm. I know i shouldn't be complaining about this because i won, but it fells stupid that my opponent lost even thou he outplayed me. I felt like he earned it. And this where that problem starts appearing, no matter what you do, as long as you keep holding on coins, get good items in loot round and get units that benefit Alliance passive the most. For me it gets most annoying when you look for units, because there is small space for your units you are probably going to sell your units to get closest 3 star unit only to discover trough recycling your rolls that could have gotten 2 star or a 3 star unit of the one you sold. For others it could be that some of the units spells don't hit the targets that need to. For example Kunkka has  ghost ship that stuns in large are of a board, but the problem with that spell is that it targets a unit to where ship will go. That means it could land on a dying summoned unit while the other enemy units go unscathed.

When it come to how much your PC needs to be strong, my phone can handle it. I mean you can literally download it in trough your phone and play it. Just be warned, in my phone it has issues ( an example round timer can sometimes start earlier that usual.)

That leads to music and the world of Dota Underlords to talk about. Music is pretty solid. Music escalates as you survive more rounds. It fits the atmosphere. And as for the world of Underlords ( as of this moment location is White Spire), I think it's original and unique. I mean, what game uses fantasy worlds ( LotR, DnD, Warcraft)  and turns it into a crime lords battling for the city? It has a reason and a aesthetic to it that is untapped by most game designers. I mean there was a expansion from a card game but its just not the same. It never advanced the same way this game will. The characters are unique as well, sure they need more time, and as off this moment not all characters are shown,but i like the first four that are in the main menu. As you can guess, I really like the world off White Spire. The only issue i have is that it never told us what exactly happened  to the crime lord that controlled the city. They will probably tell us in later seasons.

The game is free and no micro transactions ( not yet at least), just know that every game will  probably last an hour."
27371,Fascinating gameplay
27372,bye bye 30 minutes that I'm not gonna get back
27373,fun and can be played in the phone
27374,i didnt like it
27375,Actually fun.
27376,Nice game with good graphics
27377,"Like auto chess? Then you will like this for a bit I am sure. But are you so addicted to Auto chess that you started keeping a bucket at your computer and cut a ass sized hole in your chair. No, Then probably pass up this infuriating version of Auto Chess. Someone else will always get the units you want and more of them. Getting 3 stars in this version seems twice as hard as the original. That is for you, your opponents will get two of them by round 15 and make you want to toss your computer off your roof. The game its self, there are a quite a few quality of life upgrades from the dota 2 version which makes it more playable, but to me the rounds go by a lot quicker and I find my self running out of time while sorting items and champs and more often than not costing myself the game cause I couldn't shuffle fast enough to find the right unit then only to find it 1 second after then round starts. 

All an all, its a fun version, but the problems of Dota 2 AC seem to have a spot light on them in this version. So I can't recommend it."
27378,"Better interface and less random than TFT for now.
"
27379,Actually good copy of autochess
27380,like the game
27381,Nice game and must try
27382,A luck-based game. Lucky enug to get the cards u need to win.
27383,Fast-paced gameplay and a lot more attractive than the original auto chess. Cross-platform play across mobile and PC player is amazing. It requires some adjustments along with a performance improvement on mobile version though.
27384,Have bad luck
27385,Always take brawny buff
27386,Pog
27387,Great and addictive gameplay. Good potential to be the best auto chess game out there.
27388,"It's a fun addition to the autochess craze right now, it feels different from the original mod as there are some new pieces (currently) and some new classes and species. Some classes have been tweaked for balancing issues as there are time a single class the utterly decimate an other one. All in all it's really good and both differs from the original mod but also so similar."
27389,better than the dota2 client
27390,gud
27391,beri cul
27392,meh
27393,"Это лучше, чем Auto Chess!"
27394,great
27395,"Is Dota Underlords any good? Yes. It is. If you’re a fan of the mod – heck, even if you aren’t – you should definitely check this little gem out.  I've already lost a lot of hours playing this game. It’s a great procrastination tool and a really enjoyable little time-sink. I've love to see more progression-related gameplay mechanics added further down the line, but those are coming in future updates. RNG is not a big deal as many are saying since you always need to watch out what other players are picking up and by that you'r picks are going to be better."
27396,"Good and fun game, needs more balancing"
27397,"Early access boring, playing with friends but cant co op, sucks."
27398,"This game is familiar xD
"
27399,"Great free game with controversial updates. The current one has some good and bad sides but the Duo mode is a blast. Finally you can cooperate with your team mate, send gold and units to build high level heroes faster. Share victory, share defeat."
27400,good!!
27401,"Very addictive. However, would like some more diversity in items.
The RNG can determine your success to a degree, but the unknown factor is quite thrilling sometimes"
27402,Great game
27403,1
27404,"So, it has been almost a year since last update. Just putting that on the table straight away.
At least the devs made all the changes to the game before pretty much abandoning it.

UI was made more fitting for PC. 
Current meta is decently balanced (seen plenty of that by now, might have some issues and I'm just blind). 
Level 3 units got special abilities for the most part, making focusing on developing units more rewarding.
They added the underlords, who add nice variety and aspects you need to think of.
And in between this review and the last, they added variety in the way of choosing talents for your underlord, and also removed this gameplay element, making the talent system simpler, giving you one of two different variations of the underlord, one being usually more aggressive and other defensive.

Marchmaking is still active, and I'm thankful for that.

Game's future is unsure, and hoping that it'll be updated with fresh content. But for the time being, servers being up will have to do.

Development being halted aside, I would still recommend at least trying this game out if you haven't tried autobattlers out, or if you already know you like the genre."
27405,It's ok. Not the best right now but in time it might be. Nice mobile game.
27406,Nice
27407,"Good game, a bit crippled by its mobile UI"
27408,nice
27409,Fun game.
27410,cool
27411,"Even the tutorial is so bugged that it is impossible to ""learn"" the game.
Bot games work.

In PvP, 1-3 people insta quit because it is impossible for them to win. RNG is bytch."
27412,VERI GOOT GAEM
27413,Decent improvement from the Dota 2 mod.
27414,nice game

27416,So edicted
27417,fun.
27418,its ok
27419,good
27420,fun.

27423,it's okay
27424,good game and still unbalance
27425,nice game
27426,"A fun little game spin off, a bit buggy at the moment but sure that will all be sorted on final release.
Great game to play for 15 mins at a time"
27427,"Forget the Auto chess client, this is the real Auto Chess for your gamble"
27428,Just a Copy of Dota Auto Chess
27429,Nice 2
27430,"I like this game, because it can be played on a smartphone"
27431,really good game..there is a bit of rng in it..but not somethink that you can rage about!
27432,Not bad
27433,best dota chess copy ever.
27434,Meh.
27435,Fun
27436,Well made AutoChess game! Hope to see more heroes and items.

27445,"Still don't know why I have 2 1-star Tiny-s from round 2 to round 19 and can't find the 3rd one.
Edit: Still haven't found my guy"
27446,Keep rolling and rolling and luling
27447,"A very nice game, hopefully we'll see a bit more fluff for the menus and everything around the game."
27448,Now you can waste time on Dota on the toilet too.
27449,"to many glitch
"
27450,Mobile game
27451,A pretty great concept.
27452,OK E
27453,Hours of fun with the Dota universe characters.
27454,"If you like gambling, this game is for you!
If you like anything else, this game is TRASH!

I have officially uninstalled this game thanks to the too much RNG aspect of the game."
27455,这是惊人的10/10
27456,"pretty cool game
"
27457,"good game
"
27458,Good
27459,"I spent [b]126 hours[/b] to obtain max level in the battle pass during the beta and valve took away all of my [u]COSMETIC[/u] rewards I earned during that time and all I got was a lousy title called ""beta maxed"" when the game came out of early access... I don't understand the reasoning for this. What kind of video game would ever take away cosmetic rewards from you that you earned for playing their game? fuck you"
27460,Kunkka
27461,"Addictive as hell, easy to pick up but needs to explain a few mechanics better at the start."
27462,Better than Auto Chess
27463,Worse than autochess from drodo ^_^
27464,"Good game, can switch between phone & PC in seconds and no delay"
27465,Just a Dota without the salt
27466,addicting -- just don't reroll down to 0 when you have 50 gold and you will be good
27467,Great game
27468,"although missing some units i really enjoyed in the dota auto chess mod, underlords has become a very refreshing change.  Its fast, smooth, and fun to play."
27469,"fun game, nice to see valve releasing games again, i hope they do one the big ones next!"
27470,Рандомное говнище. Всем советую!
27471,Späßle !
27472,Ждем турики
27473,fun to play
27474,Good! :)
27475,"Greate take on the ""Auto chess"" genre.
Already been some balance updates, which changed to usefulness of different units and made it more interesting to explore other team compositions.

The party UI is not really that great though."
27476,So bnaad
27477,the game is raw but have convenient controls
27478,"If you got time to waste i guess you can give this a try. Controls are simple, game is pretty straight forward, but at the moment it feels a bit pointless. If they add some quests or rewards for winning matches it would make sense to keep this installed, until then i'd stick to auto chess in dota 2"
27479,good game
27480,Interesting
27481,seem good
27482,Fun game to learn and play.
27483,bery fun game
27484,noice game
27485,"Quite an interesting game.I thought since Valve made another Dota game that it was going to be trash as usual.But I went for a risky move and tried to play and got very entertained.Ive played a match and the time just flew by.It is a game for those who are into tactics,RPG,and turn based combat and feels like something new that we haven't seen before.Also this game has crossplay with mobile which is great.If you are into Auto Chess you and Dota you will most definetly like this game.Try it out it's free!"
27486,"It's alright except for the fact that it relies too much on RNG to win. Not to mention being an absolute battery drainer on mobile and certain dumb AI choices like TB swapping your own backliner's hp like 90% of the time (the AI logic seems to prioritize swapping hp with ally. Avoid TB until they change the AI).

Because of how heavily the game relies on RNG and its free to play, I can already foresee Valve selling some variant of ""booster"" packs that increases your RNG or whatever. Which would suck but we'll only know for sure once its out of beta and officially released."
27487,"Good gameplay, nice alliance, great items..."
27488,"Pretty fun game, really enjoy it.
At first it didn't look like it has a lot of depth, but there are quite a few different ways to play this game.
Really like that the game is being updated regularly.."
27489,wp
27490,Good Game
27491,"good idea base on some changes in dota custom game
but i hope it can be having some reward features"
27492,Bruh it's good
27493,"No chat box, no toxic"
27494,"Kinda cool game, I went back to it several times despite swearing I would uninstall it. Considering the game is free, I see literally no downside to the game."
27495,"This game is still early access, so polishing will happen. Here and there are minor bugs, but not game-breaking. If you don't know anything about Dota, no worries, you will learn Underlords pretty quick (3 matches and you get the idea). Still there are some imbalances needed and the characters you get from the Store are not exactly random. If you find bugs or have suggestions for the developers, you can always leave feedback and they will look into it.

Oh and did I mention you can leave a game, and continue on your phone?

6.5/10 , good competitive game, more content needed (but it's free!)"
27496,VERY NICE!!!
27497,"Tft >

27517,good game
27518,Gud game
27519,Didn't like it at all. Maybe this genre isn't my cup of tea but it felt really pointless and length of a single game is a drag. Even as a long time dota player i don't recommend it.
27520,This game is fun you're not really sure you either you win or not it depends on your luck and your synergy combo from the team you made.
27521,GabeN
27522,rng!
27523,"If you want to play this on mobile, EJECT YOUR SD CARD. The game file is forced to saved in external memory instead of internal memory. That will cause the model do not render properly.

The explaining tutorial are not simple and didn't keep it short.

Personally, i think the matchmaking would need to be revamped. Because a lot of pros, newbie can't even progress the game. I doubt the game will get a lot of smurf. 

In my experience playing on mobile device (Samsung M20) , it need a lot of optimization for the framerate. Even the 10v10 piece of chess stress bench won't make it to 30fps.

Consider this, if you have a PC that capable run this game better than your potato phone, i will encourage you to play this on PC. But if you have a beefy phone with Snapdragon 800 series, you will have a better and stable framerate.

For this time, i will say no for this time."
27524,All you need is warlocks and a slark and you will rule the chessboard

27556,Simple and addicting. It currently has some balancing issues but it's still in beta. Should only get better with time as new heroes and items are added. Highly recommend for players that want a quick game that's easy to get into.
27557,Very nice control compared to its predecessor (DAC by Dorodo Studio) this game is still in development but I do hope balance update will be updated frequently i.e. once a week or two.
27558,Fun to play but it really needs a better UI to make action more faster

27564,"A game where you watch things happen after spending a couple of seconds picking and moving pieces. It's not exciting, but can be entertaining, for a bit.

Games easily last over 30 minutes which, considering you spend most of it just looking at your screen is, well, tedious to say the least.

You can control how much gold you spend (on units or XP).
You can control where to place your units on your side of the board.
Everything else? RNG.

You're either lucky to get pieces you want or you pray that you can last enough rounds to get those pieces.

Obviously. you can work with the RNG mechanics, like getting units you don't need so opponents can't have them or as alternative combos for your own strategy, but that's just you reacting to whatever options the RNG handed you."
27565,"Great game, easy to get into"
27566,So a Good Game !!!!!!!!!!!
27567,++
27568,"Simple, fun and has great potential!"
27569,Yo!
27570,Тупо шашки
27571,"I didn't think I'd like it, but I do"
27572,"Best mobile game.

Sent from my Nokia 3310."
27573,fun and casual
27574,Nice Game
27575,"Pretty good so far, still need some fix and balance. Other than that pretty fun."
27576,"I downloaded this game on the phone so I could play while heading home from work, or play during lunches. Not without issues in the beta, but man I'm enjoying it."
27577,good
27578,"Overall quality game that anyone but a large company like Valve would struggle to make, the graphics are top notch and the game play is seamless.
Only gripe is that balancing is yet to be fully completed as some alliances are super OP (Knights etc)"
27579,Great game GG
27580,Nice game
27581,"IMO Dota Underlords is so far the best standalone Version of Auto Chess with some improvements that seem better compared to the ""original"" like only 1 Item per Chesspiece so you cant put all your big items on one guy and have that guy be your only viable piece on the board and Global Items that may change the setup you want to play drastically"
27582,Its good
27583,Really addicting game and great optimization on mobile.Great Job
27584,Not bad at all for an early access game !
27585,needs a lot of improvemnts and new heros
27586,RNG hates me!
27587,challenge your luck here
27588,"I like the game and find it fun, but can't figure out why."
27589,NOt so good no sense of game just good enough to waste time... 10 heros fighting against 10 ... thats weird
27590,You may very well watch paint dry instead.
27591,"Its free and its good, in my opinion best autochess."
27592,норм че
27593,Good
27594,Meeeew?
27595,Rather enjoyable but the RNG is balls.
27596,Might as well call this Cracklords by how addicting this is.
27597,"Inspired by a Dota2 mod, Auto Chess, which made the Dota2 server suck earlier. Good graphics. Lots to learn, but not too difficult. Another game to get rekt by Chinese players."
27598,Please make Android version more optimized
27599,Good upgrade from auto chess. easy to play with your phone too.
27600,Budget Teamfight-tactics
27601,"It´s a good game and still improves with the Feedback the community gives! 
More Updates more fun!"
27602,Nice game. Especially nice how you can switch between PC and mobile during a game.
27603,Fun for now...
27604,"So simple yet complicated! 
Cant Stop playing it! Great job Valve :D"
27605,"You need a lot of time to learn this game and play this game. 

Instead of a board game, it is more like a card game. The system draw the ""card"" and you pick it to make a combo / a deck that synergize ."
27606,gut gut
27607,More like Dota Auto Cards given the amount of random in here. But it's what makes it enjoyable
27608,"Meh. Idk if game sucks so bad or i suck at it, anyway not recommended lol"
27609,wow very good game
27610,"good game, its a better version of autochess, its more simple and fun"
27611,Berry good
27612,"Not my style of game, I will try and sink some more time into it and see if it grabs me but at this stage...."
27613,Official Dota Auto Chess!!! Great Game.
27614,"Play Underlords, not TFT.

Thank you."
27615,"Confusing asf, games too long"
27616,"Out of the big three auto battler games, this one shines to me as the clear headliner. Runs incredibly smoothly even on a low end system, team comps make sense and it is incredibly easy to see what piece links with what class"
27617,"Good chess game but still have a broken Combo


edit: now this game have good content"
27618,Better than the original
27619,nice

27627,good game to killing time

27629,pretty good
27630,"It's Auto-Chess by Valve but the team working on it actually communicates, crazy for Valve right.

Thank you Underlords team, this thumbs up review is for you."
27631,nice
27632,v's game studio shows itself again . hard to believe a game that is so complete made in less than 2 weeks........
27633,it's fiiiiine xD
27634,eh 👍
27635,your rng make me stress!
27636,Amazing main menu music
27637,With future balancing and content updates this is going to be better than the original autochess
27638,Nice
27639,"To lose a few hours, why not?"
27640,very nice game
27641,kelaitannya mudah... tpi tunggu begitu round setelahnyaa..... not bad.
27642,"Not a bad game, its like Auto Chess!"
27643,Has potential
27644,"I never played AutoChess, but tried this game out of curiosity. 
Sadly, one game later I was hooked. 

This game is simple to learn, and has a good tutorial which takes you through things slowly to make sure you learn.
That being said, watching a YT vid or two might be a clever thing to pick up a thing or two strategy wise.

For free, what do you have to lose? See you in game!"
27645,"Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
27646,I play when I want to have a fast break from dota...
27647,good idea
27648,bynthtcyj
27649,rely on luck
27650,"Despite the awful RNG-dependency I like this game, probably because it is free right now. I just like that I don't have to play Dota to enjoy some of its heroes.

Much improved by the updates, it went from an obvious, casual mobile game to something substantial."
27651,"This game focus on what kind of strategy you need to use in order to fight different type of enemy. What i mean is by looking at buff that each player have. It can be magic resistance, increase armor, increase crit and many more. The buff will only be activate if you have more than 2 or 3 hero you choose. You can see buff on the right side in game. This game fun playing with friend :)

Sherza95 ^^~"
27652,Not bad.. but need to add more heroes
27653,Definitely better than Artifact.
27654,"Not bad game, there is no chat so no toxic talk, relaxing :D"
27655,:3 good
27656,whack
27657,10/10 recommended
27658,"Once you start, you can't stop playing. That's how addictive this game happens to be."
27659,Decent.
27660,auto chess is the battle royale of strategy games
27661,Not gonna daed soon
27662,Auto Chess but better
27663,great game! ez game
27664,Game needs more improvement to it.
27665,"Still Needs so much work, specially for balancing heroes...."
27666,Good Game!
27667,Dota Underworld is a very enjoyble game that you can play for hours and hours and it has a lot of potential for what it is right now even while its in beta.
27668,would recommend very fun
27669,Really nice game. I like the fast updates and responses from developers to community requests.
27670,takoye sebe
27671,Addicting as shit and being constantly improved.
27672,Нормально
27673,Best auto chess out there no discussion
27674,Is gud
27675,the mechanics of this game are easy to understand and also fun to play
27676,"Same Concept Of Auto Chess,
Kinda Boring but for Casual Gamers."
27677,yes
27678,Not too bad
27679,😠😠😠
27680,Cool game
27681,nice game
27682,Nice Autobattler with a interesting Element the Underlords wich you can customize each match as you need it
27683,better than artifact
27684,Nice game but there's a lot of bug
27685,"Currently it's dota auto chess with some smaller game play changes and an improvement to the ui and controls. I think this makes it a bit easier, especially for new players.
For example you can just drag and drop heroes and don't have to click a button or key first in advance to say what you are going to do. 
And auto upgrade of the units if you have 3 of a kind, even if you bank is full -> less stress when clock is nearly 0.

Experienced DOTA (auto chess) players probably miss the item upgrade feature though and a better of with the DOTA mod.

For me it's overall a bit better than the DOTA auto chess mod, especially because of many quality of life improvements in the controls. But I never played DOTA so the whole item upgrade mechanic was a bit too much for me anyways, that's why I am not missing it. 

I would recomment this stand alone version for new players, and would suggest to check out the dota mod after some time  to test if the item upgrade mechanics are improving the game play for yourself."
27686,Nice
27687,Much smoother experience compared to the original Dota Auto Chess mod.
27688,just try it
27689,It's fun. Better than the Dota mod.
27690,ay
27691,Great Game
27692,"Never played auto-chess before, but this is addictive."
27693,is gud2
27694,great game
27695,Extremely fun and addictive but needs to add achievements ASAP
27696,Good background while chatting with friends
27697,It's great
27698,kinda fyb time killing game
27699,123
27700,"Even though the game is still in the beta version, it already offers a fun and addictive experience. It is great to learn and try out new combinations every match. I am excited to see what kind of new features they will add in the next couple of months. Personally, I would like to have a leaderboard asap, so that you can actually see how good or how bad you are compared to the rest of the playerbase.  If you dislike RNG, then I wouldn't recommend this game to you."
27701,Well - its a good start. But it needs more polish. Recommended for Fans.
27702,Too RNG dependent
27703,"Highly recommended especially to DOTA 2 players .
Less Tilt , Babyrage & Dansgame"
27704,Overall fun experience but games are far to long
27705,Yup.
27706,Valve's take on auto chess with the frequent updates to gameplay and interface that we've wanted for Valve's other titles.
27707,Naix game
27708,"Takes everything that made Auto Chess great and makes it 10x better.The loading time is amazing,almost instantly after you hit the play button,you're in the game.Totally recommend it"
27709,May RNGesus have mercy on you.
27710,Really just a Gacha game for free. Play for fun and to figure out what's good and try out 'weird' builds. After that it gets kinda boring
27711,"Great game. Updated often. Just wish they could find better balance currently Knights, trolls, with dragon buff is meta."
27712,g00d gam3
27713,Pretty good even for mobile!
27714,"Pretty fun in the beginning, gets stale very fast. Wouldn't recommend."
27715,Trash mobile game.
27716,simple game. love it
27717,Better than Auto Chess! Decent party gameplay.
27718,"Valve is back! It's early doors, but the game is already shaping up well. It has the fun addictive autochess mechanics down and the extra valve charm is coming into the game steadily. Worth the download to try it out!"
27719,"I mean, it's literally just Dota Autochess.

Not much else I can say about it.

Still better than both the Dota-clone league of legends and it's clone variant of Autochess."
27720,Quite good
27721,"Funny game, but hard"
27722,good game just doing my checklist for the steam race EZGlap :)
27723,Its kinda like Dota Auto Chess
27724,Some incentive would be nice. :/
27725,good game
27726,Incredibly fun game and the level of crossplay is astounding. Not only can I spectate my PC friends matches but Steam even record the hours I spend on mobile!
27727,There's too much waiting in this game. I don't play games to just wait around.
27728,casual but fun RNG based Auto Chess variant
27729,its fun
27730,Its similar to dota autochess i see no difference between them.
27731, ⠀⠀
27732,shit game
27733,Nice game
27734,11/10 would get warlocked again
27735,Pretty good.
27736,.
27737,git gud #blessRNG
27738,would be 5/5 if units show you all the buffs/debuffs that they get during fights.
27739,veli gud still veli gud
27740,fun game id say. If u r new to dota2 this might be da wae : )
27741,Better than Teamfight Tactics
27742,awesome
27743,either underlord or dota autochess has their own speciality
27744,Teamfight Tactics lepsze :v
27745,I would say one plus of this autobattler is an item system and standalone client.
27746,can be fun but confusing
27747,"It is quite a good game, but RNG gets you sometimes frustration. However, it is a very good game for the mobile market. So I recommend you to only play it on mobile or tablet."
27748,a tutorial that explains nothing.... nice
27749,dota2 chess is better
27750,Wow
27751,NICEEEEE LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
27752,good game
27753,GG
27754,"""RNG hates me"""
27755,"Quite fun, includes a tutorial and offline bots to learn the ropes"
27756,Nc
27757,Clean
27758,Schon ganz geil ne
27759,"Really fun time to pass some time.
Interface and game play is relatively easy. Not hard to get into the game."
27760,"Fun game with UX improvements over autochess mod, I still like autochess better.
EDIT: Stale meta.
EDIT2:Better than autochess."
27761,"Simple, active, still a lot of work to do with it but it's fine looking at it had just realised."
27762,Reused assets done right for free
27763,GG WP.
27764,This game is still in beta but it is prettty good. One of the best strategy games I've ever played. It's just that client needs some polishing and characters needs some balancing.
27765,cool
27766,DOTA + AUTOCHESS = OOF
27767,Fun.
27768,Very good
27769,Đjj
27770,"nice game for inbetween other games. . .just like dota auto chess :)

**UPDATE**

Holy fuck. . . the big update is the worst shit i've ever seen :D:D adding new heros t the pool? ok, cool! Adding some fucking ridiculous shit unit which is like an hero hero with attributes . . .what are the alliances good for now? An this UI is the biggest shit i've seen. . .why put tron legacy like colours and blinking effects into a game like this? Everything got so tiny and is hard to read. . . holy guacamole. . . at this point I wouldn't recommend anyone to play this game :/"
27771,"Such skill, much fun. 9/10"
27772,nice
27773,One nice time waster for your phone. Game sessions are too long for my taste though. Hope turbo mode will be added soon.
27774,Great game.Many Heroes.Many things to learn. Great job Valve .Easy to access from phone. 8/10
27775,"A lot of RNG...
Games too long...
You dont really do much...

Perfect lol :D"
27776,Great Mod...
27777,"real dota, you vs everyone"
27778,better than atifact LUL
27779,"Quite hard to get into, but once you understand the basics it’s a lot of fun and there is tons of room to improve yourself"
27780,INCREDIBLE v2.0
27781,I hope they monetize this
27782,Nice dota auto chess for mobile. Best platform.
27783,gut
27784,I had fun.NICE GAME
27785,goodgame
27786,"For those who don’t know, Dota Underlords is the result of the discussion that occurred between Valve and Drodo devs. Drodo Studios are the makers of the phenomenally popular Dota Auto Chess. They have since announced that both they and Valve will be making their own versions of the game. Dota Underlords is Valve’s offering.

If you’re a fan of the mod – heck, even if you aren’t – you should definitely check this little gem out.  I’ve already lost a lot of hours playing this game. It’s a great procrastination tool and a really enjoyable little time-sink.

It does have that incredibly addictive ‘just one more game’ quality about it though. No matter how comprehensively you lose, you still want to dive right back into another game. “Perhaps this time, I’ll get the hero I need? Or maybe I’ll try a totally new combination?” It’s addictive gameplay at its finest."
27787,better than Artifact
27788,Good effort nice game
27789,i think this is probably a nice game but don't rely on my heavily biased opinion as I would type anything just to complete the steam review achievement
27790,RNG game :/
27791,Dota Underlords is probably the Autochess game with the shortest start to play time.
27792,"It's ok, needs a lot of work."
27793,"nice
"
27794,Good game to play wit fri
27795,ebic
27796,Its pretty fun
27797,Nice game based on RNG.
27798,"If you are a fan of Auto Chess and games like it, then you will also probably enjoy Underlords. This is a really fun game, but can be a bit complicated to understand at first, but the more you play, the more you learn and remember the specific strategies. It also becomes addicting really fast and it's free to play, so there is no excuse to not try it out!"
27799,Fun game to play but cost too much time for a complete match
27800,Good
27801,Dota without jungle invoker
27802,"Not exactly like the original autochess mod for DotA 2 (item drops function differently for one) But it does have more characters and takes up very little space on the Hard drive. I feel it is the superior experience overall, especially for those Who had DotA2 installed only for the autochess"
27803,it is the better of the two.
27804,Best Autochess game better than artifact btw
27805,Gets updated more than TF2
27806,"Good Game, better than Artifact."
27807,"really fun, already played dota auto chess. they did a great job and developed a good stand alone. only missing the courier atm"
27808,Yes
27809,"Makes me feel old to know that I've lived long enough to see this game die and be surpassed by TFT. 

Can someone at valve start caring about this gem?"
27810,Really great game.
27811,Like card game
27812,ok
27813,"移动版太费电了
"
27814,"A surprisingly great strategy game. Very well thought out and deep. Even if you never played Dota before you can fully enjoy this game if you're into strategy games. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a deep auto chess.

Yes, obviously there's gonna be some RNG, but it's not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. A better strategy and more knowledge about the game will always be the biggest factor on your success here."
27815,Mobile trash.
27816,dota auto chess 2
27817,"Run knights, gg ez.

Edit: Game got better, but then Valve said ""peace out homies"" and stopped updating it."
27818,新版德鲁伊好强，相比之下术士和食人魔的新种族就有点鸡肋。刷新球有点imba。高等级道具来的太晚。特别是那个首次换棋子免费，太弱了。
27819,It's a good game
27820,Recommended but RNG is GOD.
27821,"Nice Develope
is good, AND IS BETTER EVERYDAY
u can test u Lucky here"
27822,Mix chess with turn-based RPG. Now you know everything.
27823,A lot better then auto-chess a few more updates and its gonna be awesome
27824,"As enjoyable as I found this game, this review is more of a comparison between Autochess and Underlord. I should also mention that I've never played Autochess on the DotA 2 client.

I felt that Underlord excels against Autochess in terms of mechanic, especially item mechanics as there is a limit of 1 per hero and they can be moved. I also appreciate the DotA 2 theme more than the Autochess's theme. What I felt that Underlord is pitiful in, however, is the UI design. Everything feels like it was meant for mobile with no respect from what I can tell for PC players. I'd rather have Autochess's UI! The buttons are all enlarged as well as plenty of hidden zone which are bad from a UI designer perspective. I do appreciate the synergy connection line, however.

Is the game playable still? Yes. But is there a better competitor option out there? Depends on you, but in it's current state, I really don't like the UI as a PC user."
27825,"I went into this game thinking that it is better than Dota,but it was even worse"
27826,Pepega
27827,Good Game
27828,Artifact died for this
27829,nice
27830,Game are better than auto chess
27831,<3
27832,i would say this is better than dota 2 auto chess arcade
27833,Nice and chill.
27834,idek
27835,gud
27836,"This is the most polished Auto Chess-type game compare to the others, with cross play support. The UI still need quite a lot of work, but other than that it's a fun game."
27837,Nice
27838,berry nice
27839,Waiting for release
27840,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
27841,"promising game, worth a try! :)"
27842,ez katka
27843,no tengo ni idea de nada pero safa
27844,Nice game
27845,"Not great not terrible

Updates do make it more diverse, so try it - maybe you'll like it."
27846,Nice game
27847,"This type of game is a massive time sink with no transferable skills and at the moment non-rewarding. Game is heavily RNG dependent and just feels like you're gambling on a favorable outcome. Still a better version than Riot Games though, and the fact this a mobile game too has potential."
27848,Want to Get ADDICTED? Play THIS Game
27849,its fun you dont lose much if you just try it
27850,Nice game
27851,hate that shit
27852,Easy to addictive
27853,NICE GAMES
27854,"Easy to access, hard to master."
27855,Is v fun
27856,Still better than Artifact.
27857,"Simple, fun, random! Try it out!"
27858,nice
27859,oof
27860,"Yeah, not bad."
27861,good game
27862,"Easy to play, but yet to master it"
27863,i like it
27864,its quite interesting
27865,TFT is better but this has mobile
27866,Pretty fun
27867,still have a lot of bugs. hope valve can repair them asap
27868,OK
27869,eh
27870,If you like autochess you will probably like this.
27871,"TFT is better, imo"
27872,gud
27873,Pure Trash . Better play  game with name : Auto Chess on android then this unbalanced pile of Underdog s.h.i.t.
27874,"i like this, i can play use phone and my steam. Connected.
FUN to Play"
27875,a brilliant idea from valve
27876,knights
27877,It got a lot better
27878,Surprisingly entertaining
27879,its fun
27880,"I paid $20 for Artifact FeelsBadMan
It's dead PepeHands
I paid $10 for Underlords beta FeelsBadMan
It's dead again PepeHands"
27881,Meh...
27882,Nice
27883,"Awesome take of Auto Chess. Smooth mechanics, but needs some balancing of the units. 
It looks like they are doing constant updates to resolve this. 
"
27884,Auto chess games r good.
27885,If you have addicted of slot machine you will definitely like this game.
27886,luck or skill ?
27887,Good game (Y)
27888,"Great board game, Valve doing good job again!"
27889,It's everything you might want out of a standalone of the mod
27890,"Given the current status of the game, it's worth playing it.
I had a lot of fun and really close games. 
Many things are yet to come and I believe that the game will be even better in near future.

"
27891,Nice
27892,A great take on the auto chess varient in Dota 2.
27893,A really cool almost-card-game.Way too less to do for now (pretty much all you can do is play).
27894,Great game and will be much more better with future upgrades.
27895,Very fun
27896,mantap slur
27897,Not yet updated but it's easier to play than arcade in dota 2 autochess. interesting game!
27898,"Nice game, very smooth and great mobile support. Auto Chess was great too. Hope this doesn't kill auto chess."
27899,Expected something worse
27900,ز
27901,"+ easy to run
+ fast matchmaking system

could improve:
- there are too many different chess pieces
- heroes visuals (dota auto chess is much better in this regard)
- some items (especially global ones) are overpowered"
27902,a very enjoyable game

27904,"Yes, yes, well done, DAC. Well done, DAC. HOWEVER"
27905,"You played Dark Souls and it wasn't hardcore enought, because you knew what you did wrong?

You played several boardgames, where luck was the only thing that the winner had?

You want to be punished even more, when you have no luck?

You want to get rid of known problems by turning them into the direct opposite?

You want to support a company with absolulty no own ideas anymore, which only wants to profit from other ideas and fuck it up?

Then install Underlords and you have the perfect game for you.

At least it's free and you don't have to waste any money on this game, but that's also why people give this crap so many thump up. A shame for real good games, that don't get the same attention as Luckerlords.

Gets worse the more you play. Don't let ""progamer"" fool you, it's a metagame with nearly no variety, because developers does not think one second before their updates about what they really change!

TL;DR Buy a game from a real developer and you will have 1000 % more fun with it, than with luckerlords.

Edit: Still the same bad game one year later."
27906,dota auto chess with slight change

27918,"Catching gameplay mechanics and a surprisingly simple approach.

It is noticeable that the game is still in its early stages but it already shows promising features. If they keep up with their pace it also wont become stale.

27963,"Hi all,
I never was a big Dota Player to begin with. 
But I have to say, this game makes a lot of fun and I love Tactical Board Games with lots of action in it :). 
At first you might think: ""uhh, its all luck to get the right Champions to lvl them up"", but actually there is a lot more about it then it looks at the beginning.
It's about watching your enemies , stacking up gold and give it away at the right moment to build up you Champs. Board positioning and getting the right items or buffs for your group of mighty heros is important as well. Also very cool is the synergy you can use to get a very strong group of Champions :D . A Game usally takes round about 30 minutes. Just try it out and see for yourself and have lots of fun with it yours taz. :D.

27984,Dota Underlords > TFT xD
27985,any rollers in chat?
27986,It's OK.
27987,"Another edit to my review. I forgot that I reviewed this game before the Underlords update and before TFT set 4. The game is dead since the Underlords update, 'cause it ruined the balancing system that was doing great beforehand. Plus no updates are given nowadays.
Today I'd rather play AutoChess, or TFT that got really better since then."
27988,Good job valve you made a good game based on auto chess really love it.
27989,Still early but the building blocks of a good game are there.
27990,"Still under development. Needs more heroes and balancing. It is fun to play while on the road, on your mobile. Bots are strong as well when you don't have an internet connection."

27999,Is Good
28000,GOOD GAME
28001,"The game is still in early access so it is hard to fully judge it, but currently, it is missing a lot of features compared DAC (DOTA Auto Chess). The original mod is a lot more fun and has more content, but that doesn't mean Underlords is a terrible game. The fact that the UI feels like it was ported from the mobile version is annoying, no voice lines, no customization, when leveling up heroes, they only get bigger instead of changing their appearance and a bunch of other inconveniences. However, connecting to games is faster and much easier, you can move items around characters, and in my opinion, Underlords looks better. RNG does play a huge role in the game so if you are not a fan of losing to random stuff, I would not get too heavily invested in the game as it will stress you out. I am excited to see the features VALVE add in the future as Underlords has lots of potential, but currently, it feels bare bones when compared to DAC. I wish I could rate the game as ""OK"", as it is very fun but some of my concerns have not been fixed yet. I would definitely give the game a try as it is addicting but there are not enough features currently."
28002,for an RNG type game dota underlord is a game that has good graphics
28003,топчик
28004,good game
28005,"At first I didn't wanna try it cause I don't play dota anymore
but the game sucks you in with its bitter sweet pain of losing over and over and the suspense of winning cause of your luck.

Mostly RNG but if you like to test your luck ,go try it out"
28006,Not bad
28007,nice game
28008,not bad
28009,"This genre is something I didn't think I'd care for at all, and the original mod was clunky and an awful introduction. Underlords however is intuitive and the game has grown on me a fair amount. I would definitely recommend giving it a try, the learning curve isn't that steep. I can also say that this is easily one of the better mobile games I've played. It is somewhere between a card game and a tower defense game, and so far easily my favorite of the three in its genre."
28010,This is effectively standalone auto-chess instead of the DOTA2 mod. Does what it says on the tin.
28011,yikes
28012,"Great game, great community and much communication from valve!"

28056,Engaging game! Lot of fun to play and it is exciting! Glad that they came out with a new game because if it remained as auto chess I would have never played it!
28057,fun game.
28058,worst autochess tho
28059,bad ui
28060,"Y'know Artifact, right?
The game, set in the DOTA universe, but is a different genre, and it flopped massively?
Guess what. They did it again.
But this time, it's actually worth spending time ingame, as it already is quite a nice game in open beta.
In a lot of reviews I saw that the game is very RNG-heavy, but imho, it actually isn't. It's way more important to have an overview of the game, and a strategy, but you mustn't cling to it, bcs if the situation so desires, you gotta scrap everything and pull out a new strategy, and that is the strenght of the game, and seperates the good player from the bad player, who thinks it's all RNG.
Of course there were and still are some overpowered (Mask of Madness and warlock bonus with a Slark is just OP) and underpowered factions/heroes/items, but I think in a few weeks it will all be balanced out.
Also so far there is no way to spend money ingame, but this will change, and I hope not in the bad way EA did with BF2.
So yeah, quite nice playing a game or two per day, easy to learn, hard to understand and even harder to master, 7/10 so far."

28070,fake doto. but its good SmileyFace
28071,"While definitely heavy on the RNG, it is possible to mitigate it somewhat if you are following what your opponents are playing (thus are removing from the common draw pool). Unless you become familiar with the character skills and combinations, then you'll likely find the round timers actively make that difficult. For a casual player, be prepared to be mashing the 'Have Mercy' emote option as often as the 'Good Game' one.

Recommendation: Mixed"

28084,"The best auto battler out of the three current ones on the market thanks to Valve's great polish in UI and graphical aesthetics. Very curious to see how they incorporate money making into this. My assumption is it'll just be skins and such as any pay to win items would ruin the game. 

Now, from the position of a busy father this game, and genre, is perfect for multitasking. ESPECIALLY since Valve has released this on mobile."
28085,"Hate the OG Dota, but honestly love this game.  I have 50+ hours racked up in a few days.  Constantly thinking about combos.  Easy to learn, but must have tactics.  Ranking system in place.  Looking forward to season 1!"
28086,nice

Multiplayer: Online PvP
Completion: 40-50 minute games 
Cards: No | Cloud: Your stats are saved online

DotA Underlords is a strategy game based on the auto-chess mod that is increasing in popularity. There is no story whatsoever. Each game is a new experience with no permanent carryover. Across the board, there's a lot of luck involved, and learning how to make the best of what you got is a large part of the game.

You start off with a random roster of lowest-tier heroes to recruit. You place the heroes anywhere on your half of the chess board, and when battle begins, everything is out of your hands and you must hope for the best.

It may be a little confusing how battles are handled. Every round there are two concurrent battles involving your team that you have no control over. By default you view your own defensive battles. If your side loses, you take damage according to the number of enemy stars and the round number/10. If you win the defensive battle, you don't actually damage the enemy and nothing good or bad happens. To see who you can potentially damage, click to view the team you are currently attacking, and if you win that battle, that enemy takes damage. Sometimes you may fight a defensive and offensive battle against the same player, and it is possible for both players to win their offensive battles, causing both players to take damage.

All heroes are part of two, sometimes three alliances. By deploying unique heroes from the same alliance, they gain useful bonuses that may affect the whole team or just those in the alliance. Part of the fun is figuring out alliance combinations that suit your gameplay and items, but as with everything else in the game, it's very random which heroes you get, and relying on getting Tier-5 units is quite the gamble. Tiers are still being rebalanced, so what works today may be outdated next week.

Recruiting three of the same hero automatically consumes and upgrades that hero with an additional star. Each star doubles the hero's health and damage, and increases the potency of their special ability. If you are lucky enough to recruit three 2-star heroes, they are upgraded to the final 3-stars, and you can really wreck shop with them. The number of heroes you can deploy is based on your level, up to the max of 10. Every round you gain one XP. By spending 5 gold, you may increase your experience by 4. Increasing your level also increases the probability of higher- tier heroes showing up, while reducing lower-tiers.

The first three rounds in any game are against neutral mobs, designed to get you three low-tier items. After that, every fifth round, you are given another opportunity earn an item. By winning, you may choose one item from a list of three (or four with a special item). If you lose, a random item from the list is given to you instead (update: it's no longer random, you choose from a lower-tier list). The items could still use rebalancing. Many global items are just way better choices in low tiers, but good luck achieving consistency between games.

There's some interesting strategy regarding gold management. Every round, you earn 10% interest, rounded down, on unspent gold up to 50. Win streaks produce additional gold, but then so do losing streaks. Even if you were dealt a bad hand for 20 rounds, you could turn the game around if you managed to maintain a solid interest rate and didn't take much damage.

The graphics are good, using the same cartoony aesthetics of Dota2. New assets are still being added, and just recently we got new boards. The music is all right, I don't remember a single tune, but it's never unwelcome. I have encountered crashes, but that's to be expected with how new the game is.

Overall I rate DotA Underlords an B+. It's pretty good, and the icing on the cake is that it is free! Matches tend to be long, even longer than some actual DotA battles, which kind of saps the momentum, but it's fun. The game is still in early development, and many new heroes, cosmetics, and changes can be expected in the coming months. Go ahead and try it out, because who knows what it will look like a year from now.

28169,.
28170,"This game is pretty fun. Lots of combinations you can use. Currently still trying to learn the game, but fun to play with friends"
28171,A nice game to pass time.
28172,"Dota Underlords is an addicting, cerebral multiplayer strategy game. Each game matches you up against 7 other players, and the goal is, naturally, to be the last man standing. The gameplay is centered around drafting from ""packs"" of units (randomly sampled from a larger pool) that are offered to you in each round, arranging your units on the battlefield, and letting AI control the units to determine which player wins a given match-up. 

While at first glance not controlling your units may seem odd, it emphasizes smart drafting and positioning. The game is easy to get into, but difficult to master, as it contains a wide array of different classes of units that can be combined to produce synergies that help you win. Additionally, there is an economy component whereby you earn and manage money that can be used to buy units (and re-roll the selection you are offered), upgrade your unit capacity, or save the money to earn interest to build up your economy further. While the totality of options and combinations may initially seem a bit overwhelming, the game contains a tutorial and a single player mode that you can practice against at your own pace (whereas actual matches naturally have a timer between rounds that forces you to make quick decisions). 

Valve is also actively adding new content into the game, and just recently they added a few more modes. Duos mode allows you to play as a team with a friend and send each other units and money, while your survival is linked via a shared HP pool. Knockout mode, on the other hand, allows for much quicker games by heavily accelerating the leveling process and limiting your HP to 4 hearts -- you lose one whenever you lose a round. The latter should allow you to sneak in a game even when you only have 10-15 minutes to spare. 

Finally, Valve has built this game with cross-platform gameplay in mind, and in fact the game can not only be played on both Android and iOS, but the matchmaking itself is cross platform so players on PCs get matched up against mobile players. For this game genre it is perfect as it's all about the wits rather than how quick your hands are (though that can also come into play occasionally). Moreover, you can start the game on one device, and seamlessly switch into finishing the game on another device.

Recommended, if you like puzzles, card games, and competition."

28178,"Fantastic little nugget from the world of Dota 2. Easy to learn, hard to master."
28179,"decent

Really not a fan of the complete random roll on hero pool."
28180,"Underlords is a pretty good spin on the genre, with the useful ability to switch between PC and mobile client on the go. As it's in beta, the performance can be a little janky, especially on older PC's. Also big props for not shoving MTX down our throats from day 1 and instead focusing on bugs, performance issues and balance. Definitely will check it later again when the game's a little bit more stable."
28181,good game
28182,Prospective Game
28183,Its fun!
28184,lets play chess... meh
28185,"Even with the missing features and occasional bugs, this is still super enjoyable game. So do prepare enough time to play it till you make it ;)"
28186,fun
28187,"For players who are like me and actually never played Dota games before, the game is easy to follow without any prior knowledge about everything around the original game.. This game offers a good balance and complex strategic playing with options of just making a game mostly filled with friends."
28188,Well designed
28189,hats when?
28190,Nice game...
28191,thumbs up for valve !!
28192,All the DOTA fun without the 60 minute drag fest
28193,Trash!

28195,"Not Half-Life 3, but still it's not Artifact."
28196,"Not a Nice game, but it's fun to play"
28197,Good game but needs some balancing before its worth investing time into.
28198,good one
28199,A chill game to play. Not hard to understand and has excellent tooltips to help guide you throughout the game. You'll learn as you play as I did.
28200,this is good and nice game for everyone...
28201,"Very fun, but hard for beginners."
28202,Nice
28203,nice
28204,"The best game in this genre, I hope the Valve will make good optimization for it and will follow it, release frequent balance updates and will not abandon it like an Artifact. 
Upd: dead game right now."
28205,"It's pretty good, Still prefer dota 2 auto chess though."
28206,Better than LoL TFT in every way.
28207,"Fun, but a match is too long."
28208,gg
28209,"Nothing like Dota. Nothing like chess. I hate explaining this game to people.

It's addictive."

28211,Very Good Game
28212,"I have no idea what I am doing in this game, but it be like that. 10/10 would recommend."
28213,"da asa facem
"
28214,"Hard to get into if you don't know anything about auto chess,
but if you already know a bit about groups and races then you are fine and can uprank pretty easy.

Game done with Dota characters and looks pretty well.
The ranking system right now is still bit weird.

28215,great game

28226,awesome game but rng can f*ck u up! :<
28227,"In this new Auto-Chess concept, people are looking for balance and more action. Underlords hand us these greatly. I've played Dota Chess and some others but Dota Underlords is best between those."
28228,Its a good Autochess games. it is very deep and tactical. But still very RNG so not my own cup of tea.
28229,good
28230,interesting
28231,I am OK with this
28232,Oh! Thats HOT!
28233,Better than TFT
28234,+1 for crossplay between PC and mobile.
28235,very gud game
28236,"Adresses the frutrating aspect of Auto chess's RNG quite nicely. I'm looking forward to see what the monetization program will be like.

As it stands it is the best game to sit back while you listen to your favorite podcast."
28237,Better graphics and interface!

28242,Nice game
28243,very nice
28244,"Quite random. The randomness being the main source of frustration. Little strategy involved - you can have a team composition in mind, but it doesn't matter if you can't roll necessary heroes. Gets boring quite quickly, matches could be sped up 2x without any detriments."
28245,Ok I guess
28246,Still the best auto chess style game there currently is
28247,Its a nice game
28248,"Super fun!

28257,นุกดี
28258,"DOTA Underlords is an outstanding game of planning, positioning, and tactics. The secret is knowing how to manage your resources, and when to change your stance.  Those who complain about RNG fail to understand the complexities of the game and will be better off with something simpler.  However, if you like games that are easy to learn and hard to master, this is an amazing choice."

28267,"good game, good idea, need more balance.
btw dota 4 is out Pog"
28268,better then autochess
28269,good game
28270,"Well , it's a smaller sized DotA Chess. Minus the toxicity of the community."
28271,neat
28272,"Status: Not recommended for Competitive, and Casually the game is pretty meh (compared to its competitors) but still recommend it anyways.

Not all gamers will agree with me, but this game is sort of casual game type of thing rather than competitive strategy. The starting lineup is not all bad, but once you reach mid/late game, the difference is clear. The items you get can get swingy too. 

It is pretty fun when you fight each other and looking at the animations and your own heroes lineup creates synergy and fighting. Winning is less important at this game - you will lucked out against the 7th-8th position almost everytime to reach 1st and boost your gold is possible (I hope this is fixed, I write it in June 2019). 

Appearantly the game of survival-pseudo-random are still popular (battle royale is) so why not Underlords? They have cooler music and atmosphere, plenty of sound effects and the port from a legacy Dota 2 game - oh so outstanding. They also fixed the issue of one true hero by limiting a hero with an item AND you can unequipping item to others.

I think Underlords are very successfully planned (they learnt on Valve coolest mistake, Artifact (I miss you so much)) will explode once the features are done, and no one can stop Valve."
28273,gg
28274,Game is great to play while watching something else!
28275,"We smart, we play knights"
28276,"Update 11/26/19

I'm very impressed at Valve for continuing to update this game and continuing to listen to feedback from the community! Keep up the good work New Valve!"

28302,required review for steam sale - not my type of game
28303,Not your typical auto chess well made 9/10
28304,melhor que lol
28305,fair enough
28306,still better than LoL's version
28307,Pretty addicting and complex. UI is not so great at the moment.
28308,Loot system is better than autochess. Some alliance is not good enough compare to using huge aoe/disable unit late game.
28309,Great Game 10/10 Would Play Again.
28310,"i prefer this format of the game, easier to understand skills and stuffs
doesnt have to read that much in dota autochess"
28311,"I like this game 
open it play it 40minutes later get mad because other get 3 stars and you dont and you still win :)

*update*
august update = trash
*update* 2
December update makes the game fun and play able again so i recommand this game again
"
28312,"Good implementation of the custom game auto chess. Graphics is decent, plus its free, good way to pass time after a heated competitive game with some music."
28313,Fun but lack things to do for now
28314,Simple yet fun
28315,Quite fun. Dota Autochess. RNG sucks.
28316,"The level of communication on valves end is amazing and the amount they update the game.

I also would say i would be lying if i didn't say i love it"
28317,BEST AUTOCHESS
28318,"Fun game, tightens some aspects of the Auto Chess mod in Dota 2 and presents a sightly cleaner interface. Availability on mobile is just another plus. A little rough around the edges, but I trust Valve to polish it by the time it gets out of open beta.

Big thumbs up!"
28319,That's a real timemachine. It makes me didn't notice what time it was.
28320,Nice game
28321,Do you want to test your luck and patience ? Try this game
28322,not artifact
28323,"spinoff game from dota 2 custom game autochess , pretty same from the previous game except this is better in gameplay , balance . 8/10"
28324,its ok
28325,"As someone who has played 800 hours of Dota  2, I love this spin off. Simple, easy to learn, casual game of Auto Chess."

28328,pog
28329,Best to play with friends :)

28346,wao
28347,Pretty good hope it doesn't end up like artifact
28348,interesting game to play a lot meta and strategy can do it in this game
28349,"Fun game but rng heavy mechanics and ui layout can be sources of frustrations. 
One game can eat up 30 - 40 min and it doesn't feel like that time has pass. 
Finding specific heroes can be frustrating since it relies on rng but it can be satisfying after you find that last unit to upgrade your hero from 2 star to 3. 
The UI need a lot more polish. The descriptions for how much mana each spell cost, what damage type each spell does, and how demon alliance work needs clearer descriptions.
Game has a lot of depth but has a pretty large learning curve to get a hang on its mechanics."
28350,"I really don't know what I'm doing but I'm having a lot of fun with it and yes the tutorial is limited and didn't realize I was done with the tutorial really quick. But there are bots which I would for now uses for training and hold off on online plus it's free, easy to get in and you can go mobile with cross saves."
28351,iteresting game
28352,"Great game,  fun and relaxing."
28353,Much better than AutoChess
28354,"The tutorial is endless and pointless. You have to look up online guides to actually learn anything, and it's convoluted at best. What a waste of time."
28355,Gud
28356,Good Shit
28357,"Not much really, if you know how to balance your heroes.  A little bit of DOTA 2 mechanics and you'll end better than 90% of the players here."
28358,"* early build as warrior and assassin
* losing much
* RNG pick got all mage (dem KOTL boi)
* late build as mages
* yeet all opponents
* get promoted to lieutenant
* patch nerfed gandalf
* never played again

10/10 game no lie tho."
28359,"After the release of the Artifact I thought that Valve can not do something cool, I was so wrong!
I played all the versions of Auto Chess (Auto Chess from Drodo, Teamfight Tactics from Riot Games) but I want to say that Valve done them more interesting and balanced.

Thank you for continuing to make patches and make this game better!
See you on the battlefield!"
28360,Quite fancy if i do say so myself
28361,"great game, 100x better then teamfight tactics ;)"
28362,"HOT
MESS"
28363,"You can for sure get lost down a hole on this one. The fact you can play games on mobile or PC makes it that easier to become addicted. Endless hours forming easy to under stand strats, and praying for good RNG"
28364,has potential
28365,"A total and complete rip off of the original Auto Chess game, Team Fight Tactics by Riot Games.  0/10"
28366,Good im dead
28367,very nice game and good overall mechanic. Very recomended for free time
28368,"I simply just love this game. It is fairly easily considered to be an ""idle game"" but actually the complexity of it is refreshing. There are a lot of combinations with the itemization added as well, so pretty huge variance of combinations available.
I'd love to see a good added ranked system with customization of the units available, most probably that is the way they are going in the future.
The game is easy to learn hard to master, if you really wanna be big boss level.

Would recommend."

28396,drains my phone battery but i can watch small people fight for my amusement
28397,"Use ""Yo"" to shame people."
28398,"Never thought I would say this, but autochess as a genre is not as boring as I first thought.

Every match is different, because you can't really have the same build. It is very much dependent on good RNG and lucky draws. The fact that the heroes have different spells, abilities, items and classes which you can combine with other heroes classes to gain synergy bonuses can be at first really confusing, because you are not familiar with them, but as the time goes on and you spend more and more time in the game it will become a second hand nature to you which heroes to choose and which not to choose.

I also like the fact, that Valve is taking this game seriously, and are trying to communicate, patch and update the game more frequently, giving the illusion of them caring about this game. I do wonder however if this enthusiasm will stay even if the peak player count drops with time.

Overall, Underlords is an enjoyable experience and I recommend you try it because it is free after all."
28399,Better than artifact
28400,Great

28415,Very well done stand alone version by valve from the Dota 2 Auto chess mod. Constant updates striving to make the game better really is cherry on the top. Most important thing for me? Ranking is working without third party stuff =D
28416,Nioce one
28417,The only decent way to play a DOTA related game. The lack of chat (besides the chat-wheel) means the trash talking stays to a minimum.
28418,It's a good game... Happy to see that valve have made it to mobile gaming!

28436,Nice!
28437,It's good
28438,it's a game.. i think.. you could prolly like.. play it or sumthin.. idk
28439,"way worse than the auto chess mod so i have to downvote

cant see my heroes stats or if a skill is magical/physical/pure damage without opening ingame guide book,  in the mod i can see everything by just clicking on hero.

half the builds that worked in auto chess mod dont work in here, thats beacause you can just put one item per hero.

ugly and horrible UI made for mobile, i have to cycle through tabs to see my items,alliances and damages instead of just having everything on screen.

no content updates at all so far but they sure released a battle pass already for a beta game tho. (disgusting)

as far as auto chess games go its extremly addictive but the most RNG game ever made, im at big boss rank and everybody at this point knows what they are doing its all rng, you get the good units early you do good, you dont and you are screwed.

incredible that a giant company does less and worse for their game than one chinese dude does for the auto chess mod, valve has become just a cash grab company not interested at all in releasing quality games wich is very sad. 10 years ago they were the example to follow now they are repulsive."
28440,HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH you think this game is better than riots TFT? PATHETIC!
28441,ok.
28442,Great game. Huge potential. Don't screw it up Valve.

28448,Так долго все Т_Т Но интересно)
28449,"Largely the same as the original Dota 2 Auto Chess, the improvements to be found in Underlords make it a far easier game to get into and a much snappier experience.  Strategies are mostly the same at the moment, but mechanics have been refined down to give everyone more of a fighting chance while avoiding (outside of extreme luck) the ability for one player to pull away and win a perfect game as happened often in the original mod.  A far smaller filesize to have Underlords installed instead of the entirety of Dota 2 caps things off nicely."
28450,Great game for the first few hours. then it gets lame
28451,"its pretty good, rng permitting"
28452,it's fine
28453,"Winning is solely dependent on you being able to make at least 2 three-star units. If RNGesus isn't on your side, you don't stand a chance. Also, the first 15 or so rounds are inconsequential and boring. I understand that the game is still in beta, so there is a small chance that these issues will be dealt with. For now, I can't recommend this game at all."
28454,"I have never played Dota ever, but this game is like the best game in the whole world. dota gay league not so gay"
28455,Only play if you like RNG a lot.
28456,BEST RNG GAME
28457,"As of writing this review, Underlords is the clear best auto battler available. Valve have been very responsive to feedback and have been making nothing but positive changes since it got released. This game still has a lot of room for improvement, which is actually a good thing. I hope they continue on this current trend because this game genre is addicting."

28490,"copypaste original DOTA Auto Chess ..same units with same attacks / abilities, same NPC round.. and more random with overpowered global items what make your build less diversible

pros: u can pause game when u play soloé.. good for little fun, when u wait for something in other game"
28491,"game starts up, gets black screen and freezes. Still no patch to fix it."
28492,Autochess?
28493,no queue auto chess
28494,"The game is good in general, but it has some minor flaws that can get annoying really fast. First of all, the constant jumping in and out of the shop to pick up characters, or to get access to hidden there roll and level up bottons. Plus when the shop opens, it covers half the screen, making it almost impossible to browse through characters and watch the battlefield at the same time. If it wasn't enough, you have to swap through tabs in order to view your items, synergies and stats. Do this a few dozen times per match and you have yourself a hell lot of useless micromanagement. Of course you can just skip this and cruise through the match on autopilot if you don't want to bother trying and just want to chill. But the second flaw is that right now there are so little possibilities to strategize and the roster of good characters is so limited that after around 15-20 games you'll have tried them all and you'll be forced to get all the same overpowered characters over and over again no matter what synergy or strategy you'll choose in early-mid game. And a bit of a personal preference - the matches are a bit too long for the game like this. 20 minutes should be perfectly enough, but 40 (on average) is an overkill."
28495,"I like this one but I feel like the freedom we had in the Dota 2 mod was much better, like by a lot. 
This one feels too polished and limited in movement.
"
28496,nice la
28497,nice game
28498,Tons of fun! The perfect game to play while you do other miscellaneous things at your PC or mobile device. There is a lot of depth and strategizing so you can expect long hours of enjoyment. Theres a couple of things they can improve with the UI but the game is still very early in development. The main game itself works without a hitch.
28499,good
28500,"Very easy game to play, very hard to master."
28501,Somethings you just get addicted to
28502,pre fun now
28503,gooooooooooooooooooood?
28504,Eh sure :)
28505,"Well I don't know what i'm doing and I love it

9/11 would win first few rounds only to get curbstomped again"
28506,"1 Word, DOTA."
28507,"at least this game with the DOTA name put on it, isnt as shit as DOTA 2

DO NOT BOTHER PLAYING TFT, DOTA UNDERLORDS IS FAR SUPERIOR IN THE AUTOCHESS GENRE!"
28508,"A nice refreshing take on the new Auto Chess game mode.

While Dota Auto Chess and many of the variant clones including DU rely on many aspects of RNG, DU does have an interesting take on Neutral Rounds, giving many creative class/synergy buffs or items as choices if the neutral round was defeated allowing for more strategy and planning in the decision of your board. Several new original heroes are also added such as Warlock, Pudge and several others which open many new possibilities.

I've enjoyed playing DU quite a bit on both desktop and mobile and in conclusion rate the game 8/10."
28509,best game for smart people
28510,Fun for a couple hours.  I can see why so many people are addicted to autochess.
28511,"Too many things to do in the future on this game, hope Valve will make it better"
28512,"A nice upgrade from the mod, refreshing new genre."
28513,its dogshit idk why people play
28514,good game
28515,yes vert good
28516,Great game to play on the train to kill 40 minutes :)
28517,"good game
"
28518,I really quite like this game.Its smooth and fluid and with a constant update to fix bug or Qol changes etc.
28519,completely addictive. It can improve the UI but it's the best game I've played this year.
28520,"[h1]With [i]Dota Underlords[/i], [i]Valve[/i] follows the old recipe of creating standalone games from good ""mods""[/h1]

The same happened (almost) 10 years ago with [i]Dota 2[/i], a successor to the game that started the ""Action Real-Time Strategy"" (ARTS/MOBA) phenomenom and the esports revolution: [i]Defense of the Ancients[/i] or [i]DotA[/i], a modded map from [i]Warcraft III[/i]. And like [i]Dota 2[/i], [i]Dota Underlords[/i] is extremely addicting and fun.

The game is presented with a simple gameplay concept: use gold to buy units and put them on the field. You can combine 3 of the same unit to get a stronger one and you can put them on the board simultaneously with others of the same ""alliance"" to provide bonuses for your team. Then, the round starts and all the action is done by the AI. Wait, what? Yeah, you just organize the pieces and all the battle work is done [b]automatically[/b]. It does not seem compelling at start, but testing new combinations, positions, economy and even health management is a [b]LOT[/b] of fun.

Easy to play, hard to master. Simple concepts put into a great and complex strategy game. That is also something [i]Dota 2[/i] and [i]Dota Underlords[/i] are similar but, at least, you won't be flamed this time.


Presentation ★★★☆☆
Gameplay ★★★☆☆
Design ★★★★☆
Story ★★☆☆☆"
28521,nice
28522,ระบบการเล่นเข้าใจง่ายตามสไตส์ auto chess เรื่องดวงก็เหมือนเดิม แนะนำให้หา comp ที่เหมาะกับตัวเองไว้แล้วจะสนุกเองครับ
28523,nice
28524,"i mostly play FPS games so this was nice alternative with more chill gameplay 
a bit to RNG-based but still takes skill and knowledge  to play well
recommend watching beginners guide on youtube 


enjoy"
28525,Well put together and you can't beat the price.
28526,Good game
28527,"Even though in BETA, Underlords seems polished and ready to compete with all the other auto chess games out there. With frequent updates and balance changes I cannot wait to see how they add long term progression into the game."
28528,"Fun game, play it yo."
28529,what?
28530,good
28531,nice game
28532,It has constant crashes and rendering errors.
28533,Good game and fun
28534,"It's like warcraft's dumb, easy af, rng no skill based, distant cousin. That being said, pretty fun game to half focus on."
28535,better than the original auto chess mod
28536,its good. but need more improvements
28537,"A good strategical game, a bit confusing at first. But pretty fun to play with friends."
28538,"Underlords is love, underlords is life

:D XD"
28539,Fun little army autogrinder to while away a little bit of time.
28540,"I never played Dota Auto Chess, hell i have never played an Auto Chess. However on the first day of me trying it out, i put 9 hours into the game, and by the 2nd day 30 hours. I truly enjoy this game."
28541,Need some sort of achievement to the game so there's a point of playing.
28542,its fun
28543,still need more update
28544,Imma just stick with league auto chess
28545,This game is getting good...
28546,"Amazing , needs more work , but i think valve is on the right path here."
28547,nice247
28548,"Great fun, but not the best of the auto battlers, seemingly worse than the one from the Arcade, but more polished."
28549,"I've played auto chess like a mad man before playing Underlord.
There are some aspects to Dota Auto Chess that I like and the main difference between the two is the reward. The rewards, the candy, is why I played Dota Auto Chess, it's also the same reason I bought dota2 cosmetics. I like playing the game and see something pretty. So when I played Underlord, at first it was ""not pretty."" The level 1-2-3 heroes don't differ much. There's no ""beautiful"" courier to show off. The first day I played it, I felt it underwhelming. I immediately offered my suggestion, feedback that they asked for. The next day, I wouldn't say it was because of me but maybe people complained about the same thing, those issues were addressed. From ""the cards were too big"" to ""picking chess piece and I can't see what's on my chess board"" (it's the same complain really but I forgot the other 4 points I sent in the suggestions).

I liked playing the game a bit more, and then a bit more and then a bit more. I still wish there's a reward or something but I goes that's a complain for another time. It's a decent game. I like playing it. But ""rewards"" would be a good motivation to continue playing."
28550,"Fun to play but the tutorial is a bit light.  I haven't played DOTA so need a bit more detail there. You will figure it out but it would be nice to have a noob tutorial and a experienced tutorial.

Things like getting 3 of the same character to increase its tier would be nice in the tutorial.

Also found a bug where if you pause at 0 seconds you can not un pause, so avoid that."
28551,Nice game
28552,<3
28553,nice game
28554,gud gaaem
28555,"good game , based on dota"
28556,fun take on autochess
28557,good game but its still beta
28558,"Clean looking game... and thats about it.

TFT feels much more in depth and balanced in terms of pure game mechanics like 2 XP every round instead of just 1 (which makes you go into mid game much faster), more items, more builds.. I dunno, Dota Underlords just feels like a typical mobile game to me. This game is nowhere near the state it should've been and I get it, its early access, but comparing to Teamfight Tactics, THIS - offers nothing. 

The only thing I like is the graphics style. 

I also hate the new patch where they added voices - it gets really annoying and there is no option to mute.  


For now that's a no."
28559,This game crashes more than kamikazes
28560,best game
28561,Dope af
28562,meh
28563,"I didn't expect this to be my kind of game but I thought I'd try it. Actually really liked it. It's very much like Magic The Gathering as you can learn to play in like 15 minutes, but there is so many combos and strategy to learn you can play forever to get good."
28564,Addictive... where did the time go?
28565,"Still need a lot of tweeks here and there, but still pretty funny and adictive game"
28566,good
28567,"Very slick refinement of Dota's autochess. Game is way more forgiving on mouseclicks and strategy building and everything is overall clearer. Only downside is some stability issues both of game and connection to multiplayer servers, but that's very acceptable in an alpha state. Well worth the dota pass pricetag lol"
28568,"Game was good, but left to die. Sadge"
28569,Steam sale review
28570,good very good
28571,pretty gud
28572,Decent prefer OG autochess than this but it aight
28573,"Good time waster, updated all the time."
28574,more awesome than auto chess
28575,no skill game
28576,"Surprisingly addicting, very RNG happy game but fun regardless"
28577,A nice mix of probability and skill. This game is easy to grasp and learn. Very fun to play with friends as this game's got both casual and competitiveness feel to it.
28578,Such a great game that valve should make a MOBA based on it
28579,good strategy game
28580,strategic game.......
28581,"Real fun game, i like it, play it."
28582,"Coming from AutoChess, but with more balanced neutral rounds where items/ bonus abilities are a guaranteed drop rather than the previous AutoChess where some 1 can luck out and get high tier items like refresher and rip my face off. The game is different than AutoChess in terms of the meta/better units as I tried my past knowledge of AutoChess to play and it didnt work as well as I would in AutoChess-So dont expect it to be that similar to AutoChess.
1 thing however it could be improved is probably the UI as I find the previous AutoChess UI better(?) maybe its just me tho."
28583,"Still in EA, but looks promising"
28584,goodgame
28585,"This game is so addictive. I didnt play the original Auto Chess but I really like this one, good job Valve!"
28586,Way better than the one in dota 2
28587,chess is fun
28588,scuffed auto chess
28589,Better than Teamfight Tactics
28590,A faithful recreation and improvement on the original mod. The ability to hot swap between PC and mobile is extremely impressive.
28591,very good game . 10 /10
28592,Has potential looking forward to how it goes.
28593,Its fun
28594,very nice
28595,more heroes please
28596,"Not fun.
Any plan you try to built is not going well."
28597,Reverse ValveTime
28598,Easy to learn and fun to play. Very easy to get sucked in for hours. The tutorial gets you going but read the guides to be competitive.
28599,Good Game
28600,"Had no idea what I was doing, went all assassins and won. Fun game!"
28601,good game
28602,thanks volvo. this game better than artifact
28603,Nice. The devs never stop updating the game
28604,This game is trash. I got late to work everyday for playing it on the toilet.
28605,epic
28606,"The RNG heavy, yet somehow addicting alternative to TCG games, with absence of pay-2-win elements. [code]YO[/code]"
28607,"Decent casual strategy game, moves fast, which is great (could be even faster).

No monetization during beta is a plus, avoids feeling creepy."
28608,not bad
28609,Worse than DAC. Don't play this game
28610,"Gg wp 600mb game 
"
28611,Pretty cool how they made it
28612,Better and more polished than the auto chess in the dota2 clients costume games section and better than the drodo auto chess (still getting better)
28613,Meh...
28614,boring...............
28615,A good start but needs more variety in terms of team composition and synergies.
28616,A nice strategy game.
28617,good
28618,if RNG hates u so much dont play this game
28619,Dota finally on Mobile
28620,Better than the last card game from Valve. But iOS version always crashed
28621,"Best implementation of the genre, smooth and many quality of life improvements.

The addition of Underlords has not significantly improved the game"
28622,It's fun.
28623,I am bad at this game.
28624,RNG hates me
28625,"This is disappointingly similar to Auto Chess. However, it is more refined (of course) and I've had more fun so far."
28626,RNG Hates me
28627,I can play it anywhere!
28628,GOOD GAME!!!!
28629,i just found this game quite boring maybe cuz i dont have played dota
28630,good game : )
28631,good gameplay
28632,10/10 very enjoyable even though somebody just steam rolls everyone else from the very beginning.
28633,..............review
28634,Enjoyed it alot but needs improvements for mobile version as it is still very laggy and lacks the versitility of muilti-platform games like Hearthstone
28635,fun game huh
28636,Goog game
28637,"Love this game. Can play up to 8 players with friends or even with other players. No need to install Dota 2 to play this and cross platform is the best feature,"
28638,wow
28639,"The tutorial is kinda doesn't tell the whole thing about auto chess and it's bit lacking
The game itself is very RNG heavy, and really hard to master.
Atleast it's better than artifact"
28640,GUD
28641,"RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG

Edit for 2019 summer sale badge

Edit edit: autumn*"
28642,I really enjoy playing Dota Underlords it is a really fun game to try this game out if you have a chance too.
28643,Lo jugue porque no podia entrar a la beta del LOL TFT pero es entretenido
28644,"Really good. If they continue with frequent updates, new modes, etc. I'll never stop playing it."
28645,no.
28646,it's ok
28647,Fun time killer game if you like DOTA 2 and Auto Chess.
28648,Gud Geim
28649,I like this one better
28650,"Played one match. Whole lot of not doing anything. Lots of RNG. Got rolled by someone who managed to get a level 3 unit right at the start of the game. Whole lobby got destroyed by them.

Game progression largely involves a lot of waiting, then making a choice or two, then waiting, and sometimes praying to the RNG gods. I had quite literally zero fun."
28651,P solid
28652,YEAH K THEN
28653,Awesome remake of the popular Dota Auto Chess. Hope this game is improved more and it just might become the next esports game!
28654,Nice UI
28655,"a decent game for beta, would prefer a hexagonal board though, also very rng heavy, but so are all the games from the subgenre
"
28656,"Wow, this game is great. I wish there was something like this but with all my favourite characters from the hit MOBA League of Legends. They could name it something catchy like Runeterran Rumble."
28657,"Underlords captures the fun of Auto Chess and polishes it up for a smoother gameplay experience.  It's a good start to developing the genre, and Valve looks to be on track to adding a lot to the game!"
28658,nice
28659,"A step in the right direction for Valve on an auto chess, I would like to see more unlocks and skins on more characters but I'm sure that's all to come."
28660,the UI a bit complicated if you compare with Auto Chess
28661,"Incredibly addicting with very high replay value, could work on some balancing issues over time but a very easy game to waste countless hours on."
28662,Nice Game to Play
28663,"Unsure about this game vs the LOL version. The RNG is brutal at times. If you like this type of game, I guess it's fun. Not really my cup of tea."
28664,"Still in it's early stages, it is promising but it should deliver soon if it wants to stay relevant."
28665,Better received than the other Dota related game we shall not speak of
28666,great!
28667,asdasda
28668,"Adorei, melhor versão do auto chess"
28669,"Nice game, tbh. 
AFTER UPDATE: WTF IS THIS ?
Still nice, though."
28670,eh
28671,Better clone of DAC with more QOL things and heroes.
28672,Good Game
28673,Clean ui with more improvements constantly
28674,"RIP Artifact, at least we got this"
28675,Nc
28676,Best thing since sliced bread
28677,Dota Underlords is a fantastic reskin of auto chess - im glad that it finally came out for all users - its awesome and would recommend it over TFT
28678,Fucked up game. Can't roll drow ranger like for 20 rounds.
28679,lets go
28680,great game
28681,"Very Fun, 
Me and Judy Played this game for a while and had a blast, although levelling up is a bit unclear on how it works,

Nick Wilde"
28682,"Remember, if you ever make an alliance and someone else decides to make it too, the game will ALWAYS give them the pieces. RNG says, fuck you"
28683,"Its ok. It will be interesting to see what they do with it, given that its still in Dev."
28684,"11/10, would go full hunter again. Rip TFT."
28685,Fun game. Gets a lot of updates.
28686,fun game
28687,Autochess
28688,good game
28689,I like this game.
28690,"I think maybe the could do some balancing around certain features and such, but I like the game well enough."
28691,Very good game
28692,"i don't know what to say!
"
28693,"valve doing very good, but need to fix party issues"
28694,At first i thought it was only a RNG based game but then once you start playing it there are a lot more complexities appearing. Qutie a nice game to do when doing some medial tasks
28695,Fun game that is hard but yet easy at the same time
28696,Lots of Fun
28697,"fun, prioritising the game to be on both pc and mobile has limited the UI to being very bland and not very intuitive though"
28698,oj
28699,Underlods > Artifact.
28700,Good f2p game you must try to play!
28701,its all about rng
28702,Major improvements on the original from what I've seen so far.
28703,berry cool game
28704,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
28705,Its a good game not a good dota game
28706,"Very easy to learn. Also heavily RNG based, you can ignore the RNG but only if you get lucky in first few rounds.
Tactics are important, but squad bonuses are not balanced. On strategy point of view; it has some elements but randomness so instead of building the team you create funds for the late game (if you survive 'till late game). After that you can overwhelm enemy with 3 star champions. The UNDERLORDS are very good and they reward you for playing the game with him (unlocking the abilities of an UNDERLORD. Whit each UNDERLORD you have to make a specific team to get the maximum from it. Slight change in the team will drastically reduce the power of the UNDERLORD."
28707,I really enjoy what the genre is becoming and I think that this is the best example
28708,Mantap Djiwa!
28709,not good at all
28710,The RNG is on chess pieces are super crazy that you will win depending on the random chess pieces that pops up every round re-rolling does not even help
28711,nice
28712,10/10 would like to play with my android
28713,just like autochess
28714,...
28715,"good game, need fix playing on phone make them hot and batterry is drained too fast"
28716,Warriors
28717,"No Ideia what is going one, still having fun"
28718,yo
28719,Was a good game that became bad after updates which added unnecessary bloat and took away from the core experience.
28720,"Starting to like it more and more over Auto Chess, but some these heroes and such need some major nerfs along with Knights. Nerf Tiny, Pudge, and DK. Adding breathe fire was the worst thing ever. The hero was already good and they made him op."
28721,Its aight
28722,game nay hay lam
28723,"Because each hero can only be equipped with one piece of equipment, it is less fun to create a super hero."
28724,It's really fun and simple to learn. It's always enjoyable to figure out which skill works well with each other.
28725,"Auto chess game but officially made by valve. It looks good and fun to play so far but sometime i cannot buy any unit in the shop, it's kinda bug for me and i hope valve can fix it in the future"
28726,"Fun game with room for more improvements but since it's in the beta it can only be improved ;)
And played with friends it's even more fun."
28727,gatcha game battle royale / 10
28728,"I know this game is in beta and might some bugs, but it's a really a great game."
28729,Little did I know this would be the first of many great valve titles to come in this second coming of gaben
28730,Bem legal
28731,"Kinda boring, kinda mobile. I hate mobile so guess I will play TFT."
28732,"honestly, its a great introduction to auto chess for me but i played it just to wait for TFT"
28733,Easy to get into and with making new teams each time it feels like a new fight each time.
28734,Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
28735,"So it's a Match-3 or Match-Class or Match-Whatever? On a chess board? With the Dota Heroes? ... ok
I think it's fine for what it is, but I played the Tutorial and it didn't spark any desire to play more.

So, not for me, maybe for you"
28736,RNGit
28737,Thought I wouldn't like this one but Valve has been suporting this game so well
28738,I can't play chess but I can rekt shit in this 11/10 !
28739,It's ok
28740,"Good one Valve, only slightly better than chess."
28741,A game that can hook you very fast. Definitely will recommend
28742,not chess 0/10
28743,<3
28744,"Free and fun casual strategy game based on the dota 2 arcade gamemode ""auto chess"". Sure there is a lot of RNG but that doesn't really take away from the fun for me. It runs smooth and the changes they've made to it are nice. It will be interesting to see if/how they will monetise this but I'm optimistic."
28745,"Easy to learn, Hard to expert. Nice game with broken meta!"
28746,i really enjoy
28747,Great game
28748,Best Auto Chess Game
28749,HATE BOARD GAME
28750,"I have no idea what I'm doing.

But at least Valve made another game."

28753,Great game! How great of Valve to add this on other platforms! :)
28754,nice
28755,"its pretty fun, good for just relaxing."
28756,i like it
28757,"I enjoy playing this game very much, ever since the workshop version of Dota 2 Auto Chess actually, but this just feels quicker paced. However I still think that there are still a few balancing issues to fix and some missing features, for example at this moment I feel like the knight alliance is kinda OP and I hope they nerf it a little bit on the next patch, I also think that I should able to put more than 1 items on each hero, and last but not least is that I miss being able to zoom-in and out of the map or move the camera angles without having to go to the camera settings menu. Overall it's a very fun game and I hope they keep making it better.

Update: There has been a lot of changes since I first posted this, and I think the game is getting better and more balanced. I really enjoy the new co-op mode."
28758,:D
28759,LULW
28760,hello newe gamer
28761,good
28762,This is the game that I hope to come out and it's excellent. Nothing can replace this game.
28763,Was fun for a while. Now it feels uninviting to come back to.
28764,"Evidently, it's an addictive, yet intuitive game where i can't still wrap my head around..


Edit: I seem to be getting good at it, although still, i'm confused at how ranks, work.. At most you would need to at least finish at 4th place 5-6  times to go to the next level.. So seems fairly easy... and yeah the moment you reach tier 4 rank.. you'd have adapted to the game in a way that you'd know all the basics and moreover strats that would be effective in order to play the game well...

Edit2: Btw. try every strats and combinations so far, the placement of the heroes on the board and also the different attributes vary for your victory, who knows, you might win only a handful of heroes vs the impossible.. so do not fret, and keep trying at it until you eventually make it to the first place uwu"
28765,broken game
28766,Dota + Valve = Best Auto Chess Game
28767,The game is just getting worse with each patch.
28768,"never once played autochess or any of the variants until i tried underlords. It's pretty good, i like the app"
28769,Good game to chill
28770,"Early game advantages are a bit too RNG for my taste but the games fun and people play better than me and I can't really pretend they're not actually playing better than me.

Worth a shot for sure.

"
28771,"If you are loosing, do not give up. Sometimes it looks like you are going to be defeated but try your best to end the match, comeback is not a rare thing in this game.."
28772,Game did not add anything to the autochess genre. play TFT instead now that that's out
28773,"chill game based off a combination of rng and flexibility with regards to creating teams. Lots of downtime, but that doesn't really take away much from the game. 

Expect the game to get more love than artifact (basically a lot more communication with the devs/updates for the time being)"
28774,If you liked Auto Chess you'll like Dota Underlords. It also looks better and runs better.
28775,Fun and amazing game. Really enjoy it. I would like to see more heroes implemented though
28776,"Many new games have been coming through, but non can be as addictive as this game"
28777,feels like a mobile game with pure rng win or lose mechanics
28778,"cool game, i didn't realize i was playing tutorial for 50+ rounds, so.... ok, i guess."
28779,A fun and engaging game in the auto-chess  genre
28780,"Expected chess, was disappointed at first, and then thoroughly enjoyed the game."
28781,lmao they still can't create a new games without involving their old ones
28782,"very 
nice game"
28783,Amazing game
28784,SeemsGood
28785,The game is good. Neutral rounds need more variety- perhaps a choice of opponent/reward? Visual style is good.
28786,ok
28787,This is interesting
28788,Reminded me how much I can love and despise RNG at the same time.
28789,good
28790,so fun
28791,gg
28792,good?
28793,"For now, auto chess from Drodo is much better than Dota Underlords (BETA)."
28794,"Too much RNG, requires little skill

Gameplay is fine"
28795,cool
28796,n1
28797,I like this better than Auto Chess
28798,Nice
28799,Very addictive game although not much content is up since its in open beta but clearly has potential. If you're in to auto chess this is a game for you.
28800,Kinda good game I guess.
28801,"Well, I'm just not good at this type of game... but it's a loooot of fun"
28802,not bad
28803,nice game for card game
28804,"Extremely well designed game, mobile port is really good."
28805,Lucknut
28806,"Mobile is good, PC could be better"
28807,what a hard game
28808,Good Game Well Played
28809,Fantastic recreation of Auto chess. Like the Itemizing better than Auto Chess. If you like AC give it a whirl.
28810,2312
28811,An amazing free game!
28812,Best.
28813,"nice gameplay
good design
base on dota heroes
fun game!"
28814,"Pretty good game so far, although there isn't too much in the game due to it being in beta. I'm sure it'll get better when it is fully released."
28815,"The best auto chess available as of now, very easy to get into even if you have never played Dota before.
Very RNG heavy but it does have a strategy element to it."
28816,Nice
28817,not like chess but its dota chess so its fun
28818,This changes just enough that it no longer feels like autochess to me.
28819,"Did you like Auto Chess? Well this is that but polished. 
"
28820,Great fun that is easy to get into and even easier to get hooked to
28821,Still better than Artifact
28822,"So far so good, rarely if ever ran into any bugs. Wish there was more rewards for progression though. I suck at this game btw."
28823,prix
28824,Just play TFT.
28825,"First game that linked PC and mobile :3
Not bad, but kind of too much for a low level mobile :(
8/10 for me"
28826,Very addictive and refreshing game and update frequently
28827,"It's good, but the match can be too long sometimes."
28828,"this game is more simple than dota chess, you can play it only with a mouse, and it's items is so OP. Highly recommended"
28829,"Solid
"
28830,"pretty fun, good time killer"
28831,dota
28832,"They ignore all their other games and made this disappointing simple game.
Matches take too long (an hour sometimes)."
28833,:D
28834,It's well done.
28835,"Honestly, pretty addicting. A lot of strategical depth for a game that looks fairly simple. They are adding voices to the heroes and it makes a huge difference in the atmosphere of the game."
28836,Wonderful
28837,"Not bad of a game 8/10

Update: more stuff life fun"
28838,THe Game is Cool but the casting of skills should be a bit clever.. like when puck cast. he should prioritize hitting the 3 heroes than just 1
28839,like dota2 auto chess
28840,nice
28841,"Honestly a fun little game to pass the time. Learning how everything works is pretty easy and straight forward, and the system of how different types of class on each unit (One unit can be a Human and a Knight, each having their own benefits, for example) is nice, since having more than one (the needed number of benefits for that type of class) allows you to come up with all sorts of fun dueling combinations."
28842,"The thing sabout this game is that ait also uses Luck, but even if lady luck isn't by your side you can still adapt and overcome the situationn with a new strategy."
28843,"just try it out, it will addict"
28844,Fun game for clever Dota player. Hell yeah!!
28845,awesome!
28846,"Typical Auto chess kind of game, the tutorial could use some work, it doesn't explain half the things on the UI or how to check alliances, etc.
Still kind of fun and quick though?"
28847,Fun to pick up. Takes longer to get through the rounds than I thought.
28848,你又懂了
28849,"So far, so good!"
28850,Good game from Valve
28851,AHHHHH ORGES
28852,Kind of like a combination of Tower Defense and chess. I wish the tutorial was  abit better but otherwise a pretty solid game.
28853,"It's good, it's gripping, it's easy to lea- WTF It's 5 am!?"
28854,p fun
28855,"send help, I can't stop playing"
28856,No voy a gastar mas tiempo en dota....underlords
28857,WooHoo!
28858,"Is good yah. But NEEEEDS a better UI, too mobiley. Cmon valve, you always had PC strengths, why u do dis? PepeHands"
28859,good
28860,It was nice to play with friends! It's like playing a real chess game.
28861,not cool
28862,"Honestly a pretty good game, I haven't played much but as far as I've seen casual play is quite relaxing and somewhat easy, really the only problem is the fact that matches can be as long as csgo competitive matches tbh"
28863,boost
28864,teamfight tactics is better
28865,very nice
28866,"Fairly simple Auto Chess game. Quite enjoyable even though the UI is a bit on the mobile side.

Hope they add hero skins for the units of different stars."
28867,"I like this more than autochess, the best improvement is you dont have to wait to other players to load."
28868,"not bad... for a game inspired by a mod made for another game that is based on inspiration of another mod that was made for another game.
If you liked any of those games or mods you might as well play it. 
I wonder where are we going to go with this one."
28869,Better than actual Dota.
28870,very cool !!!!!!! :)))
28871,สนุกดี เพลินๆต่างจาก auto chess หน่อยนึง
28872,Dunno what I'm doing but I'm enjoying it.
28873,"Fun, easy to jump into, rage inducing."
28874,League stole from DotA again lmao
28875,pretty good
28876,great game. transition from pc to mobile is amazing!
28877,Best game to play while drinking a cold brewski after work.
28878,Esta chulo
28879,Its like diving into the shallow end of the pool
28880,Seems like it can be alright but heavily relies on RNG. Still not HL3.
28881,Endless hours of fun and the Developers really listen to community feedback
28882,Great game. If you enjoy AutoChess you'll enjoy this
28883,Good
28884,Noice with NO UNDERLORS!
28885,"Joguin bom de jogar viu.
Porém é mais sorte do que habilidade, isso é paia."
28886,3 stars PA.
28887,10/10
28888,"Warcraft: Dota 1 - Valve: Dota 2 ~ POG!!
Dota 2: Autochess - Valve: Underlords ~ POGCHAMP!!!!"
28889,awesome
28890,This game just keeps getting better and better the farther in development it goes.
28891,Not addicting
28892,good shit
28893,Good to kill time
28894,It's ok
28895,you will win if luck is with you
28896,"So far out of TFT and Underlords, I'm definitely favoring Underlords right now. The game feels a lot more polished with having a tutorial and being able to play bots at your own pace. Honestly this is the best way to get into the auto-chess genre right now. Keep your eyes on it!"
28897,new mechanics
28898,It's deceiving at first how simple the game seems. Then you rank up a bit and feel bad about every decision you make.
28899,Yo!
28900,NICE GAME
28901,"Pros

- it looks like there is going to be a lot of patches and balancing as the game goes through early access
- High skill cap makes it a game you are going to want to come back and play for a while
- Unlike dota you build the team and you aren't dependent on 4 other people to be able to win the game 


Cons

- The games last to long. 30 to 45 minutes a round to sometimes be in a never ending loss streak sucks
- RNG can be painful. Nothing is harder when you can't seem to get seem get 3 characters to upgrade
- Steep learning curve"
28902,this is a nice game.
28903,👍
28904,"Very early in development but has a lot of potential and is fun as it is.

Once more updates hit, will definitely be worth playing

-please add achievements"
28905,"Polishes the rough edges of auto chess, but miss seeing other players actively."
28906,Haven't ever played an Auto Chess game. And i can't stop playing this one. The card game player in me loves it.
28907,"Ok game but get's boring fast.
Time to come with some good full game again Valve instead of these copy cat move smaller games."
28908,Its good. Just play it.
28909,Good
28910,make my brains stop Q_Q
28911,You win because RNG gives you slightly better heroes than other players.
28912,RNG HELL. But fun. Couple of times. Then quit. Then came back.
28913,Cool cool.
28914,"me see ogre magi
me buy
me see 4 more ogre magi
me buy
me only have ogre magi
me reroll until more ogre magi"
28915,I think its fun.
28916,Boring.
28917,DotA but smaller and can go on your phone
28918,"edited this review to get a badge lmao, but still a good game"
28919,i got ice cream
28920,"I went blind into this game, curious about Valve's newest project. I knew nothing of either DOTA or Auto Chess.

It took only two games to figure out was was going on, another three to get a strategy going, and four more to cave in and see what strats the community used, as I kept getting utterly gutted ever match. However, even as I ate **** for about ten hours straight, I never wanted to stop playing, because I was having so much fun. Really, as a game developer, what more could you ask for?

7.5/10, could use some better tutorials for complete newbies"
28921,"Cool game but still needs extra work, espacially the mobile app.."
28922,this game was made in like 9 days and is 9 times better than artifact
28923,"you dont need to spend money on this game.
(maybe not for long)"
28924,70/100
28925,its ok
28926,yes
28927,A term not balanced of auto chess but fairness in item
28928,10/10 would bang
28929,it's ok i guess
28930,"Pretty good, needs a few more thingies. But it's getting there."
28931,Heavy RNG but fun and has a lot of potential.
28932,"dota 2 7.23 is here, bye underlords"
28933,Thumbs up!
28934,"Finally a good new game from Valve, that unfortunately is not an original idea.
plays more or less like the original Auto-Chess, but with more polished graphics, little bit different take and feel to it.

Since it is definitely built for mobile from the start, there are certain features that DAC had, this one lacks a lot.
Good thing for this game that, the updates are constant and this time around, they listened to the community for most of the patches.

A few more updates for this game on the PC side (hopefully a real PC port with different UI), and maybe it can be highly recommended.

BUT SINCE IT'S FREE. TRY IT ANYWAYS !!"
28935,Elusive is so good
28936,Just for steam award.
28937,"Fun, but time-consuming."
28938,TFT waiting room
28939,super addictive. Great game
28940,Its alright ...
28941,khyliiiiii goode
28942,Best auto chess
28943,BERRY COOL :)
28944,nhu lon
28945,Nice Balance Game.
28946,"Great transition from Dota Auto Chess into one standalone game. The latest updates in heroes and alliances, plus the addition of underlords make it really interesting with no strategy being overly powerful compared to the rest. It remains fresh enough to play a game every day with the jail system. Overall my favorite auto chess title, clearly better in design and fun than Teamfight Tactics and other shameless clones."
28947,Fun
28948,yes
28949,Nc
28950,10/10
28951,Good game but honestly i'm just reviewing for the event ;)
28952,"nice game

28953,RNG hates me
28954,"Fun. It was my first adventure into auto-chess, it could have used some more tips/tutorials, but fun overall."
28955,Good auto chess game
28956,"Very awesome auto chess game, has it's own unique way of getting items which has lesser rng to it."
28957,top
28958,yeea
28959,good
28960,"it looks that it can be a good game, as long as it gets a good progression system (that isnt like dota 2)"
28961,Better than Artifact.
28962,"So happy this came out, I wanted to get into the DOTA world since forever but was never into MOBA games that much but Auto-Chess totally floats my boat"
28963,nice game
28964,Still have a long way need to go. But it have promise in this game after all.
28965,Kinda of hard game but with the practice u can definitely play not sort of my game btw
28966,"Mixed review of this game. It does some things better than the Dota mod version, it does some things worse. The sounds and characters AI/movement of characters are all better, but the UI has clearly been sidelined on PC to make it uniform with the mobile version. Damage calc gets ramped up to absurd levels in the late game which basically puts a timer on how long games can actually go, which is usually right at 30-35 rounds. Take from that what you will."
28967,NIce game
28968,Pretty fun game. Takes me back to the days of WC3 customs.
28969,Cancer Reborn
28970,ajmazionm
28971,Fun and interesting strategy game that is easy to learn.

28976,Best Game :D
28977,NO!!!
28978,neat
28979,"Very fun, frustrating and addictive game"
28980,not very nice anymore. They screwed up the update
28981,"Pretty fun, still has a long way to go until it feels like a full game and not just the mod it was based on."
28982,......
28983,"I like this game cause now I can put myself to sleep quickly!

thank you dota snoozelords!"
28984,Better polished version of the original autochess
28985,"MaN, this is Auto Chess genre with no RNG Item drop"
28986,Nice work this game really entertains me :D Keep up your developments on this game
28987,Amazing game!
28988,good
28989,very nice
28990,It's like Auto Chess but it's made by Valve. So that's all
28991,"For someone who never played dota, and struggle a little to remember the names and stuff, still a pretty fun game to play, most with friends. Really looking forward the complete release"
28992,Fun game like auto-chess but more corporate
28993,excellent so far
28994,"Auto Chess is the new trend, the new Battle Royale ...

A new Genre that will explode soon (Dota Underlords PC and Mobile, Dota Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics, Auto Chess Mobile and Auto Chess Epic Store ...)

Dota Underlords is easy to learn but hard to master, like all Auto Chess Games, it's a lot of fun."
28995,never been playing alot of dota 2 since been not my thing anymore but this one is a little bit more fun
28996,its a pretty fun auto chess experience
28997,Super addicting little game that is fun to play with immense amount of strategy. Never played dota but a friend got me to play this and I liked it instantly. Really good game to kick back and just play with a ton of replay value. There's a few bugs such as when I was playing against AI the game froze the timer when I paused and stayed frozen when I unpaused with no way to fix it other than attempting to leave the match and resuming. Also it's cool that you can play on mobile. Only really bad thing I can say about it is there are imo way to many players per round and it takes forever. If the game was to introduced a reduced player mode it would be perfect.
28998,Its like auto chess but dota
28999,The one true successor
29000,great game with regular updates
29001,Good game
29002,not bad
29003,RNGOD
29004,yeah it's pretty good
29005,"It's plenty fun. Don't aim to get first time, there's fair a bit or RNG involved. But with correct strategy, you can place top 3 consistently at least in lower ranks."
29006,battle of the brainless
29007,A mix of both skill and RNG... but mostly RNG. Approach with caution.
29008,"I prefer TFT and Auto Chess because of the UI

[*]The game is way too repetitive at the time being.

29016,really gudd!!!

29018,Decent game. But u only get ranks by winning. In DAC u get candies to get candies that is so addicting. Edit: Just editing for steam awards badge.
29019,Still have no idea how to play this *properly* but why it's so addictive...
29020,"[h1]A new game that fits the fad genre of 2019 called 'Auto Chess'.[/h1]

The game concept was originated by Drodo from a custom game in Dota 2 called 'Dota Auto Chess (DAC)'.

If you like to outsmart 7 players with matching synergy of the chess pieces, play this game. Be do careful that the mechanics is so heavy on RNG, it may turn off some people. But it counter-balances by providing a lot of synergy piece groups called 'Alliances' that provide wide variation of strategies to create different synergies."
29021,Cool game xD tks Lord
29022,"[h1]RNG hates me![/h1]

A very addictive game from the makers of Dota 2 that takes roughly an hour and a half per match to keep our minds off the fact that Valve [b]still[/b] has not released a third installment of any of its games."
29023,Rip Autochess
29024,Relaxing game.  9/10
29025,It's auto-chess
29026,Dota Underlords

29028,This game fun.

29063,"I saw this game being presented by Tyler McVicker (the Valvo News Network guy) and when I realized it was a Valvo, I decided just to try it somewhat. Truth be told, I'm not a big fan of the Dota lore or the Autochess game genre, but nevertheless, wouldn't hurt seeing how Valvo did on it.

I honestly expected it to be a bad game but I'm really surprised how it came out. Valvo did a good job learning from the disaster with Artifact and it's good to see Valvo is stepping up to improve how it releases new titles.

I've only played it a little bit, but there's so much of this game that's amazing. I'm looking forward to playing it more and see how it grows.
The game design is superb with fantastic graphics and art. It really fits well with the Dota world. There's also a lot of balancing in accordance with community feedback. Lots I could explain.
I'm not sure at this point if the game will become an esport but if it does, I really hope it's esports scene becomes something of a sensation like that of Valvo's other games being that of Dota 2 and CSGO.

There's a lot of RNG involved and if there is a competitive mode, it would be really appreciated if Valvo eliminates every aspect of RNG from it. I guess it wouldn't hurt keeping some aspects of RNG in a casual gamemode, but RNG doesn't bring skill.

All-in-all, it's a rising star and if the devs keep listening to the community, there's a bright future for this game. 

If you are going to pick up this game, FINISH THE TUTORIAL and you'll get a good understanding of the game. Do some battles with bots and then jump into multiplayer matchmaking. It's always a good idea to learn from ground up.

Worth a play."

Despite being a little bare bones in the UI department, what's there is very polished, it is a pleasure to play, and I see real ongoing improvement. Launching the game is very fast especially when you disable the splash screen, and finding a match is usually near instant. I expect great things from this game. This is a fantastic start."

29088,JOGO É MUITO PODE JOGAR PARSEIRO
29089,its fine
29090,Good game
29091,good game
29092,a
29093,It's a time machine.
29094,"cool game 
can only recommend it to you"
29095,"fast pace and endless possibilities, keep up the updates and the game should be great"
29096,Valve wanted me to review a game because of the broken summer sale event
29097,It's autochess but different and now it's weird
29098,Duoc
29099,Great take on the new autochess genre. Love the way how items are handled in this version. Income timing seems stupid. Calculating income is done at such a time that you should always buy everything the moment the fight starts...
29100,nice
29101,"bom jogo, precisa melhora, é meio complicado olhar os adversários. quem ta perdendo, é dificil virar o game tmb"
29102,"Fun game, yet very reliant on rng. Great to pass time."
29103,Addicting
29104,Good Game
29105,Very cool
29106,Tudo é baseado na sorte...
29107,"Matches are a little long, which was a problem because I ended up playing way too much of it on my phone in only a few days. Uninstalled promptly! Probably saved next week for me..."
29108,"For anyone looking to get into the Autochess genre, I'd highly recommend Dota Underlords. The main points of difference between Underlords and the other choices on the market are:

1. A PC and iOS/Android version with the ability to seamlessly transition between the two, even mid-turn. It's the equivalent of having Underlords on the Switch.

2. An incredibly responsive development team that communicates with their audience on a daily basis. Balance updates and bug fixes pushed out within hours of people reporting them on Twitter/Reddit, etc. 

3. If the Dota 2 Battle Pass is anything to go by, the upcoming Underlords Battle Pass will be best-in-class."
29109,Exactly what you expect it to be. Refined auto chess! And free to boot.
29110,Try this game it's so cool
29111,its good
29112,not bad for dota
29113,no you're addicted
29114,Fun but boring
29115,"man to much rng needed for this game but still enjoy it even tho i only won once lol
11/10 would play again and again and again"
29116,Good game
29117,56
29118,Make more luck pls
29119,It's a drafting game. Really great to play on your phone.
29120,.
29121,"Very enjoyable, extremely frequent updates. Can't wait to see what they bring in the future."
29122,Based on the popular game Artifact.
29123,fair enough to stick with it
29124,So fun game to play while eating or u just wanna chill turn on stream chill hop and destroy some noobs. This is economy game and u need to keep eye on enemy.Pay attention to every little thing that u can do in this game and u will win!
29125,very nice
29126,pretty good
29127,Matches feel too long and there's still a fair amount of RNG. Worth trying if you haven't played this sort of game before but the randomness and time investment for very little pay off isn't worth it to me.
29128,Better than TfT Omegalul
29129,unbalanced game
29130,Thumbs Up!
29131,It's pretty good
29132,"I can't stand it. I mean, its good, but I suck at it so bad.

Games take forever, luck plays a good portion of how you do but then again, maybe I just suck.

(I suck)"
29133,It's a much more diverse and easier to play than the Dota Chess Arcade.
29134,"this game is great background noise while doing something more productive with your time.

=============
RNG auto fighter,

shop rolls are random
item drops are random
heroes actions are random

if you're lucky you can win. 
sit back and watch the little cartoons fight each other."
29135,This game is not at all like Dota but captivates you the same way. Give Underlords (Autochess) a chance if you wish to improve your strategic mindset and skills.
29136,It's cool and fun to play
29137,this game doesnt make sense
29138,"good

29139,very nice
29140,Gambling simulator 10/10
29141,Fun little autobattler.
29142,"I suggest playing on a PC, playing on a phone really drains the battery & causes it to heat up a bit. 
Waiting to see what is added in the future, more items and item upgrades would be nice."
29143,Cool Game
29144,good game to play
29145,"Pretty good autochess game, balancing is a bit sloppy and it's missing a few features but it's playable and fun"
29146,"good game, valve are listening to the community and implementing changes daily"

29157,Good Auto Chess
29158,w
29159,"So far is a good game, does have potential, as long as Valve keeps the balance optimal and keeps adding quality of life fixes."
29160,s'gud auto chess but dota
29161,Looking good this far.
29162,"Good, better than before, best version of DAC ever, keep going"
29163,I didn't this it would be good but I am glad I gave it a try. Very addicting game.
29164,can be a fun game but matches takes too long
29165,"This is a piece of software that effectively jumps you forwards in time by ~30 minutes.

Great so far in beta, has lots of potential"
29166,people cheating to win and to rank up fast i hope valve shutdown this game and dont support again
29167,nice mobile game
29168,"As someone who has never played dota (or auto chess for that matter) before, this game is very good despite its current bugs. The constant updates and developer involvement in the community are fantastic as well."
29169,"Bit hard when starting of to get the hang around it, but once you learn its a simple and fun strategic game with a variety of different ways to win the game.

As you progress through the ranks, item and passive choices start to mean more, and creating synergy between your characters becomes more important. I've played a bunch but still have more to learn. 

Would recommend if you're looking to pick up a new strategy game"
29170,Yes.
29171,The game is not bad but it needs some balancing.
29172,The minus in this game is just the uncertainty of winning and award program. what the purpose of winning? just EXP?I think its okay because it's just open beta. Also it needs to update the design of heroes when as they leveled up .
29173,Auto chess still better
29174,great fun with a decent git of rng
29175,better than TFT

29196,"It's time consuming, RNG can be horrible sometimes but it's fun.
Currently a work in progress. Will re-review in the future."
29197,This being released for the phone was the best thing ever! amazing game now playable anytime from anywhere
29198,its ok
29199,"Quite fun.
I'm excited to see what they do with the permanent progression of the game.
Can't seem to stomach the RNG gameplay though"
29200,If Billy is reading this tomaz Von.
29201,Fun Dota Auto Chess!
29202,"Dota Underlords came from the popular custom game mod for Dota2 called Autochess. Although in beta stage, this game has gained many potential players at launch, thus making it the next big thing that Valve has ever worked on."
29203,Its like dota but filled with rng bullshit. So uh yea pretty good stuff.
29204,Has potential. Nice Experience.
29205,Good game
29206,not bad
29207,I suck at this game but its fun
29208,Surprisingly fun and innovative
29209,"45+minutes plus on tutorial lol

(game is basically dota 2's autochess)"
29210,Better than AC
29211,good game :)
29212,"I know that everything started with Auto Chess, but this is splendid, what was supposed to be Artifact and failed miserably. At least Valve did something good with Auto Chess and created a masterpiece.

10/10 - good with friends."
29213,"Amazing Game. A lot of strategy and alot of Rng. 

Only Con: Time passes around you..."

29222,"As of now, I do think this is the best version of an Auto Chess game, it has it's issues but it's still early so we'll just see if this gets suddenly abandoned like Artifact"
29223,Fun.
29224,Cluttered mess after all the updates.
29225,GGWP ggg
29226,very cool
29227,cool XD
29228,Sick game
29229,This game convinced me to quit video games completely because it was so addicting. Please do not play this game if you value your life.
29230,bagus tapi masih banyak bug
29231,Super buggy and was pushed out to fast.
29232,took the mod formula and made everything significantly worse from items to hero balance also AI is horribly coded units will just sit there with 100 mana and not use ults or just stand idle when there's an available space
29233,"Well I never could get into Dota, or League for that matter. Mobas suck. That was my conclusion after trying really hard to like them, because all these addicted people couldn't be wrong? Right?

And then there came the Auto Chess mod, which I heard about and installed Dota 2 again just for this. Not every day a new game genre comes along, so I rode the quest of a wave into auto-battling nirvana.

Underlords arrived. I begged on Reddit for a beta key. I copypastad a joke from another Reddit thread, and got a key. Internetting was at full throttle. Install happened.

Turns out it's alright. Much better than the Auto Chess Mod. Intuitive, touchy-feely, no courier, auto combine yumminess. Even the dev PR peeps are trying to be the next Ben Brode, with community influencing at maximum influencity. 

And guess what? After playing around in the lore of Dota 2 by proxy of a chess board, I've played mobas again. 

They still suck."
29234,Super fun game. Lots of strategy involved. I'd say it's really solid given the beta stage.
29235,"RNG auto-cancer.
It's a lootbox simulator but you don't get the benefit of financially ruining yourself

Edit: I took a two week break and it went from auto-cancer into a massive pile of shit that isn't even fun anymore, so it's not really even a lootbox simulator because at least they fulfil my gambling urges.
Fucking hell, Valve."
29236,broken game unplayable getting black screen all the time used all guides possible on fixing the problem nothing work so at the end something is not good with the game that is messing with my PC.fix your shit valve
29237,"fun game, but RNG is not your friend. stopped playing as in three games spent over 60 gold, per game, and was never able to increase chars, that is  stupid. bye underlords, never again. anything related to this will ignore."
29238,"Not very beginner friendly. 

I decided to give the game a go after it popped up during the sale, but it's gotten to the point where I have to go and google ""top tier combos"" just to beat medium bots. Also, if you don't get decent starting options, you're pretty much behind from the get go."
29239,I'm just playing Underlords because I suck too much in the actual Dota
29240,"The game is good.Even me,who i hated turn based RNG games,i loved it. If you search a game with depth,knowledge and rewarding your choices this is a must-to-play."
29241,Pretty good!
29242,"Yes, it´s a beta, but the game runs smooth without crashes. Some texts are hard to read, but these are minor flaws. 

A bigger flaw is the game mechanic itself. If you aren´t offered the right heroes, you will lose the game. A fight will last around 20 battles. The first 10 you will win if you are not VERY unlucky or a bit stupid. But the rest you will lose because you did not get the heroes you needed. 

Play minion masters instead. Offers more in almost every aspect."
29243,"It's a standalone release of a fun map of a standalone release of a fun map from Warcraft III, which was inspired by a fun map from Starcraft."
29244,Basically Dota Chess but more polished and available in Mobile as well. It a standalone game.. unlike dota chess where u have to download dota2 first.
29245,You must like RNG so much... but the game is quite nice anyway
29246,nice game
29247,yes daddy
29248,DONT PLAY IF U DONT LIKE RNG GAMES
29249,aw
29250,great game to pass time and chill
29251,"Хорошая идея, но реализация у Riot в разы лучше."
29252,"RNG based game

>COMING SOON: BATTLE PASS"
29253,This game is not really for me but I think others may enjoy it.
29254,Can it be possible to somehow import our Hero cosmetics from Dota 2 to Underlords?
29255,"After gold era of company i loved and then after many years of bad reputation of Valve (no sequel of HL or Portal, CS broken with gambling and cheaters, Dota 2 unplayable after 4 years of its success, Valve went really fast down to bottom of the lake with the other worst developers ever...). BUT THIS is at least something. Not big title, not original (just stolen idea like in case with Artifact), but it is really cool and in my eyes as a programmer, finally big leap for Valve, they did something. :-) Keep going, maybe i will start to love you again. :-) BTW when it will be  the HL3? THX! .... [UPDATE] Stopped playing because of adding Battle pass..."
29256,"10/10, would rage quit again"
29257,I have played Auto Chess TFT and now this and this is where im staying for the long haul. Dota is awesome so that is a plus but i can enjoy Auto Chess anywhere with Underlords. From playing on mobile and also my macbook to playing on my gaming PC I love it.
29258,"I really don't enjoy Dota 2, so I never tried the autochess gamemode. This game is pretty fun so far though.

Full matches can sometimes take to long... about 30 min or more each. I wish they were a bit shorter, maybe give players less health?

There's a tutorial in the game, but it doesn't do a great job of explaining all the game mechanics. Such as gaining 1 gold interest for every 10 gold you have when a battle starts. Or being able to combine 3 1 star heros into a 2 star. Or that the silence mask doesn't affect passive abilities.


I recommend the game so far, and hope they can improve the above parts."
29259,pretty fun. needs something more to keep me engaged. possibly unlockables?
29260,The worst auto chess game yet.
29261,Perfect game to take anywhere
29262,ME like this game
29263,"""A nice game with fun tactical. I'm not a Dota Player, so I don't know which hero using Melee weapon,  which using ranger weapon, (some of them has picture profile, easy to known, others are so hard to find out) so can you guy mark on them so I choose them easier for the battle.""
That what I reviewed when I was a newbie! God damn it, how can I so wrong!

THIS GAME SIMPLY NEED YOUR LUCKY, STRATEGY IS JUST A LITTLE THING IN HERE!
With 7 other players in your same level skill, any one has better luck, sure he/she'll win.
Got badluck? Sure you're DOOMED!"
29264,?
29265,Worst Luck game ever
29266,"fun,fast,don't expect a break!!!

29267,Great Dota spin off game.
29268,Solid game that requires alot more skill than some people here seem to think.
29269,nice
29270,"I kinda still like the game but there are some things that I really did not like,like the tutorial,it fells much more long and boring than it should be and is a bit confusing to,I really did not like the multiplayer cause same as the tutorial and the players were much better than me (unbalanced)."
29271,NERF WARRIORS

29278,"Great game based on the original DAC mod by Drodo. Although the game might not look that great at first glance, one has to consider that it is still in beta and Valve is pushing out patches including fixes to the UI, settings and adequate balance changes quite quickly. Since the game is completely free to play there is really no reason not to try it out and see for oneself."
29279,Yes
29280,"Despite being a little mentally exhausting, it is a pretty solid game if you are into old WarCraft 3 custom maps. With Underlords being a combination of DoTA and chess. But, one major flaw ruins the game entirely. It has become painfully clear to me that it is extremely common for people to cheat by interrupting my connection. I have a good connection and plenty of speed up and down, however I have noticed a pattern. If i am doing well i will constantly be disconnected from Steam and the game. and coincedentally enough it is always extremely fortunate for others in the match. Even when i reconnect i have suffered because i was unable to take any actions for a turn or two. Just now i was disconnected from the same match four times before finishing 3rd place. It makes me wonder how much better i could of done if i wasnt disconnected. The way the game works is, you share a pool of characters to pick from, if you are removed from a match the characters you have collected will return to the pool. meaning whoever you were giving trouble will no longer have to contend with you and will be able to acquire your units. if you play, do so with your connection secured or perhaps a VPN.. and be careful about playing ranked."
29281,Best game ever. Nothing more to comment. Valve is updating the game almost every day and polishing it as we speak. I am very confident that Auto Chess will be the next big thing after Battle Royale (Not a big fan of that genre).
29282,DOTA Underlords is a great pick up and play strategy game that requires little learning to understand but a lot of playtime and experimentation to master.
29283,Way too much RNG to be fun
29284,! <3
29285,"Ignore everyone who says the game is terrible because of RNG, that's like saying poker is completely luck. Learn the units, learns the alliances, don't roll before level 7 and suddenly you won't think this game is about RNG.

Highly addictive and incredibly fun, 10/10 would recommend!"
29286,"Love it so far, they are super fast patching balance so far"
29287,"Truly addictive. Being able to play on any device is great too.

UI on pc sucks though. Everything's too big."
29288,Like it
29289,"Honestly, I thought this is the ""new moba"" game. Had fun for a while"
29290,"Wanted to like the game. It is far better then Teamplay Tactics from Riot. But... that doesn't mean that it is not a game for idiots. AI is idiotic as much as it can be, algorithm is random, so any unit attacks the closest, except those that are snipers. They aim for char with lowest hp. Game is not based on any skill but on complete and random luck. Sometimes you get to level up to level 3 in first 6 rounds, and sometimes you do not get any options to level your champ to level 2. And then comes the worst part, you are not allowed to leave. So game is basically giving you random ""cards"" and forcing you to play until you lose whether on purpose or not which can last for 30-40 minutes - imagine ending in two of such matches - that means you wasted 60-80 minutes per day, and trust me, it will happen a lot more then one or two times - just imagine wasting 3-5 hours per day on a bad matches, multiply that with how many days per month you will be playing that game - and you will get how many DAYS you wasted on random game, automated game, that plays on itself and does not ask you to think or asks for any kind of skill except being an idiot?!!! 

Imagine game of poker - you get random cards, but you are not allowed to surrender and leave if you are constantly getting bad cards, and you must keep playing whether you like it or not, and if you move from the table, you are punished for leaving a match in which you can't get a good random cards with which you could counter others. It's a virtual torture. But nowdays psychopaths develop games so, what is there to expect right?!

I thought psychology already proved that that combination invokes rage at younger kids and rage creates obsession with a game like what is happening with drugs?!!! So why are you developers still doing it?! 

Also there is no option to fasten the match. Also whenever you lose your score gets subtracted, but when one of other players lose from you, even more then 3 times, their score is still 100%, and it even shows when they lose that they actually won?!!! WTF?! I know it is still in beta, but this things should happen only in alpha because that is too critical bug to be happening in open beta. 

Game does not asks for any kind of skill,... yes there is somewhat of using some ""tactics"", but everything is mostly random and automated. As I stated, this type of genre is specifically made for idiots, you know, people without any desire to think in the game?! While game is not on the same level of stupidity, like for example Playteam Tactics from Riot (why companies have tendency to call their games something they are not?! it's a type of a chaotic automated chess game that plays itself following one of the worst AI (worst then Underlords) ever seen?!) - I mean, when you see how your carries focus tank while other team carries are taking one by one of your team out... you will know how stupid AI is in auto chess games (I am not talking about bots). Happens almost every time, if you do not get ""cards"" to level up your team, this thing will fuck you over. Also people are rage quitting a lot, which is normal, because when you forbid someone to leave the game, and you are punishing them after, of course that your player base will end up like Riots community or CT:GO community - more then 72% toxic players. 

Recommended only for idiots. To others... find some book to read and skip the game."
29291,Gud fun
29292,"lul @ people complaining about RNG. you have to adapt to what you are getting served.

game seems to be updated and improved daily and I like it"
29293,I love this game <3 ♥
29294,good game
29295,"TLDR: Unbalance , you cant make any meaningful decision. All core mechanics are heavily based on chance. there is no team play and party is a joke. 
Let me break it to you
In beginning of every round , you must choose and buy hero from the deck which the game gives you. for example game gives you Blood Seeker, Shadow Shaman, Crystal Maiden , Axe.
So you buy 2 heroes for example Blood Seeker and Shadow Shaman.
If the game decide to give you Blood Seeker and Shadow Shaman  in the future rounds, you will upgrade your hero to level 3, who ever upgrade their hero to level 3 first , will win the game. and if game decide to not give you same hero , you will loose. you may try to make meaningful decisions but your strategy does not matter at all. 
Game maye give you 10 crystal maiden but since you bought Blood Seeker and Shadow Shaman in the first round, you want to invest in these heroes so you just skip and hope in the next deck the game gives you Blood Seeker.
You don't know which hero will be given to you so every piece of your decision is based on guess and hope and luck.

I can't recommend this game unless they change the game play.

And for the sake of god, why there is a party when you have to fight against your own friends in the match? is this a joke?"
29296,abandoned game
29297,''' neeep neeeeep nuuuuup '''
29298,"well this is game so great, but the full knight and full elusive build kinda imba. VALVE FIX PLS"
29299,"nice but maybe there is a few bug in dota underlords mobile, since it's maybe beta (or some kind like that), i understand it.
The gameplay is good. overall nothing bad at all."
29300,"RNG the game.

I have given it a bunch of patches and the Devs are great at changing the ""meta""..   but the underlying game still comes down to whether you get your stars or not."
29301,All i can say this game is a good time waster. It is addictive and fun but it lacks progress it needs to have a more rewarding system for players to enjoy
29302,the worst game ever made
29303,"Poder jugar rapido y sencillo, sin tener que cargar todo Dota, es buenisimo.
Me gusta mucho y poder jugarlo offline me salva cuando mi internet se va."
29304,"The game is very good and a bit frustrating - when you're having bad luck and RNG really hates you. But be patient, focus, believe in the hearts of your cards, as Yugi would say (pretty sure I got his motto wrong). Victory will be yours."
29305,"A solid rendition of autochess, still a lot to improve."
29306,"The most addictive game since Tetris. Sleep is a thing of the past. The game and only the game exists, building decks breaking them down, throwing caution to the wind and being a puddle of goo are my life now."
29307,"If you enjoy casinos fuc*ing you, you will enjoy this game. The gamble feel is real."
29308,"Really really enjoying this game, I’m excited to see what valve does with it!"
29309,"Unbalanced rng garbage.

Nope all thats required is to pay attention to the chess pool, and knowing combos.
The rest is decided for you, want good items like all other players have? No. Fuck you.
"
29310,its free..........
29311,"dota autochess feels better than this, the UI and everything"
29312,"Great game, scratches a lot of itches. Good for people who like coming up with creative tactics, but find RTS games too APM-spammy to relax with. It's fun whether you want to casually play one match a day, or play for 6 hours straight. There's a lot of depth, and you will be forced to explore it since you can't always build the same way. Many units and combinations will surprise you with their effectiveness, so it's very rewarding to experiment.

It may feel kind of random at first. But speaking as someone who absolutely HATES having game outcomes determined by RNG, I've found that you can be very successful regardless of the hand you're dealt. Losing one match doesn't matter, so it's ok if the dice roll heavily against you sometimes.

This is a very strong candidate for the next big genre. Wouldn't be too surprising, since auto chess emerged from a DOTA mod, and DOTA is itself a player-created genre stemming from WC3 mods (along with tower defense coming from Starcraft mods!)."
29313,Just no...
29314,Great game and devs are constantly updating. Thumbs up!
29315,"Right now it's basically the exact clone of every other auto battle game out there, which is honestly really sad, because they use the exact same 10% skill 90% luck formula which makes every other auto battle game complete garbage."
29316,I always come in 2nd. =/
29317,Nice game to play on mobile
29318,I don't think the RNG is that bad.
29319,Even if you do the tutorial and bots. The game poorly introduces it's self and it's mechanics to the players. It's not user friendly and the timers are not expressed well. I was very frustrated for my 2nd day playing this game. I don't recommend getting invested in it. Hopefully League of Legends  maintains there Mobo and success of these dota clowns. They allow to many basic errors to made by the player within seconds. You might as well quit and start over every time you make a mis play. Enjoy the bots!
29320,"Although set in the Dota universe, Underlords does not require you to play Dota to understand the game. In this game, you are given an opportunity to buy different heroes; your team of heroes then does battle against other players in a rotation to see  who is the last man standing. After each battle you are given a selection of heroes you can buy to further add to your team; if you buy multiple heroes of the same kind, they can be combined into more powerful versions of those heroes.

This game combines both luck and skill. While it is possible to get ""unlucky"" and not win a match, there is more than enough room for a skilled player to beat other, less skilled ones. The matches are also relatively short, and they plan on adding a mode than makes the game even shorter, so you can quickly move on to new matches after your current one. In many ways the luck aspect makes the game much more addicting, as you are constantly trying make the perfect team of heroes for your particular strategy.

This is a fun, casual game that can be played quickly and enjoyably. You may not enjoy it if you get easily frustrated or overwhelmed by the luck factor, but I recommend you play a few games and get the hang of it; the luck factor can be easily overblown if you are not familiar with the game."
29321,no i didn't lose it was all rng
29322,"This game is like autochess if it had a bad UI.
How can you strategy game based on combining your units and putting certain types of units together, and setting up your defenses strategically, and then make me handle several different screens to see the information that legitimately should always be on the screen?

Why do I have to click every hero to see what their alliances are?  there is plenty of space to put the icons up there by each hero so I can make better strategic decisions.
Why do I have to close the shop to see the heroes alliances and stats in my party?
It's like whoever designed this was like *let's give them 25 seconds to figure out their strategy..  but get this..  14 of those seconds will be wasted cause of our poor design*
I legit loved playing a mobile auto chess style game, and really wanted to love this, but it's like someone created it to be pretty and forgot to make the game good in the process.

It's legitimately like the developers don't play the game, because it could be fun, if it wasn't so frustrating to deal with the GUI."
29323,pete is gay
29324,"I love the game. It would be even better if you can add multiplayer party games, so I can play with or against friends.

More important: still some bugs to fix there. It is a bit annoying that every now and then I face opponents and even though I win they don't get any health point removed. Today i.e, it was me against the same player (last 2 guys), and I won 10 consecutive games against him, and he always had the same health points. It has happened before against other players, even just now again. I hope you can fix it, the game is great."
29325,Awesome game! May i suggest also if we link our game to our steam account it would be very nice to see our items equipped in dota 2 will be visible to the heroes we chose in underlord.  😁🙏🏼
29326,"It's about stacking the same characters and characters with similar attributes, this is how you gain buffs and are able to debuff the enemies. That's the entire game. Ultimately it just comes down to RNG and hoping you get the right characters for your build before running out of coin. The game almost plays itself giving you a false sense of control, playing these unnecessary dull looking fight sessions in between. Had valve marketed the game as what it is, a fun casual game instead of introducing some pretentious ranked system this might have been a thumbs up."
29327,Yeah it's fun.
29328,"This is the next big thing. I can see this being bigger than the original DOTA, LoL, OR Fortnite. The gameplay is accessible to an old guy like me...I'm retired, and in my 60's. If I can be competitive, they you can as well. 

I have played just ten matches, with my average ranking 4.78. One 2nd, one 3rd, one 4th, three 5ths, two 6's and a seventh. 

I'm learning as I go. I would highly recommend the first several matches against the bot, with no clock. Get a feel for the synergies and combo's. Then, still play against the bot, but take off the clock, and when you win 2-3 in a row, play against medium level bot opponents. 

Medium level AI opponents give me a tougher match than humans, on average. I expect to see humans get better over time.

Gameplay is engaging, graphics are excellent, and there is a sweet spot between the RNG Gods and your tactical skill. The one match where I came in second, the stars aligned, and I built several powerful units, that almost took me to the finish  line. 

I have spend almost $100 on the big Steam sale, I have close to 300 games in my account, and have well over a hundred excellent board games in my office...and here I am, playing a free game. Go figure!

This is a must play. YOU be the one to turn your friends onto this one! YOU be ahead of the curve!"
29329,"""Strategy"" game. It's addictive but so much results on you getting your picks"
29330,Dota kok catur
29331,"Very fun auto chess game, easy to get addicted to for some boring for others. I am the first, this game is great.

Edit: Its out of early access now, the battle pass (Only $5) has the typical lvl 1 - 100 rewards but adds in some single players stuff such as puzzles and challenges along with Multiplayer challenges for skins and such. 
 It added some new stuff but also took away features such as the jailing of characters. Now they are just rotated out for longer instead of being jailed for a time being. Its the same thing just way more boring. 
 And all rewards you earned in the proto pass. Every. Single. One. are taken away. You don't carry over anything from the EA of this game.
 I still like it, its a fun auto battler where you don't always just win its kinda random if you get shafted or win and I like that makes it not as boring, But you get no rewards for playing to lvl 25 from the EA proto pass. They should have clarified that from the start.
 I'm gonna give it a negative review for the removal of funner features such as jail and not telling people the proto pass rewards wouldn't carry over at all. 
 But it isn't a bad game at all and i still enjoy playing it and even bought the battle pass for at least one season. I never buy battle passes, but i wanted to support the FREE game because of how much fun i have with it.

Its still being updated and its still just as fun as before. The battle pass has been a 1 time buy at least for now so for just 5 dollars they gave you tons of time to get everything, and you can earn exp pretty fast anyways."
29332,Great game!
29333,BlessRNG
29334,"This game is a lot more strategy-based then some would think. With the different alliances and items (and even the placement of your units) and with good money management YOU can make the difference and win the game. I would recommend it PLUS it's free so why not try it out yourself!

(PS. If you see someone named 'Robin' who calls this game shit, don't listen to him, he just sucks ass at this, cause he has 1 IQ)

(Edit: ty volvo for this weird ass summer sale race)"

29336,Awful. Unbalanced. Unplayable
29337,"I played about 15 games trying out different combinations and lost every match or left early to restart. Now, while testing would see what my opponents would be using and it became apparent that the players at the top all would be using the same  build. Now, if there is a build that kills all other builds no matter what position, items you have equipt is not fun in my opinion. Being forced to play 1 build that dominates all other build just for the 100% win rate is boring and repetitive. 

Anyways, might come back to this game when they update/balance it and add more build diversity. If not, then guess this type of game just isn't for me....imma stick to playing path of exile."
29338,"A [b]strategic planning[/b], [b]resource management[/b], [b]RNG heavy[/b] time killer. It's a decent game, but the RNG aspect can drive you nuts sometimes. I like the variety in the units and combinations of units available, but it makes for a steep learning curve when you first play.

"
29339,"Cool.

*I'm adding this to this review because it is one of the few games I have of 2019 and want to finish the 2019 awards quests."

29341,dota 2 underlords
29342,RNG hates me but i like it!
29343,"As bad as the Dota mod, absolutely RNG (but you knew that). If you have shit loads of time you will get your ranks (law of large numbers is your friend), for Casual players its just frustrating playing three games and die at round 20 not hitting anything. My rank is Enforcer II so no i don´t suck but since i dont have 8 hours a day like the people you enjoy this game its nothing for me.

Cheers

"
29344,Everything is OP when on the opposing side.
29345,"For a copy, it's really bad when it comes to the rng and some characters are clearly better. No real balance among ""alliances"". Shouldn't have thought about the looks as much as for the god damn mechanics."
29346,"It's like you are flipping coins for 45 minutes. If you want to waste your time then go for it, but it's going to be frustrating."
29347,"Super addictive and super easy to understand.
Well done :)"
29348,"TFT is better, go play LoL"
29349,"RNG hell its insane. Beside the character it has nothing to do with Auto chess... Items are just a joke, as well like the balancing."
29350,I think the game is smoother than the Dota 2 Auto Chess mod (with the drag and drop feature). Loot rounds are also great! It allows players to focus more on synergies and heroes. The hero look progression (Level 1 to 3) could use some more cosmetic upgrades though. Overall great game! Cross-platform is a bonus!
29351,"Great game. Variability from game to game is exactly what makes Dota 2 fun, the same applies here. Well polished, cross-platform, etc. This one will stand the test of time."
29352,Yo !
29353,DOTA UNDERLORDS more like DOTA FUNDERLORDS
29354,this good
29355,So lame and boring as hell. So I wonder how those streamer enjoys it? are they for real or just for the sake of the viewers. Good thing those streamer's boobs was out there for me to see.
29356,PSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSST!
29357,good game
29358,Are you good at adjusting your strategy on the fly? Do you learn from mistakes and not blame RNG everytime something doesn't go your way? Then you will love this game.
29359,PSST! PSST!
29360,Fun game but very long matches
29361,"Underlords evokes the best of the Starcraft/Warcraft 3 custom games that I remember so fondly. The randomness of the shop offerings combined with all players competing for the same units adds a Magic: The Gathering draft mode feel to the whole thing, where reading the room is as important as knowing all the best combos. Lots of depth and nuance to this, I'm already a fan."
29362,I cannot recommend the game in its current state.
29363,This game realy must make brain
29364,now this is epic
29365,"Many people would say that this game solely relies on RNG to win but I highly disagree. It does involve RNG but a good player would work around with that. The game rather puts you in situations where you are tested with your decision-making abilities, managing your expenses and sometimes taking some sacrifices. You may play around with what the game gives you, otherwise you lose economy and momentum.

Game is great, in terms of interface and additional features, a much bigger step ahead from the DAC mod from the Dota client. Looking forward for what's to come for Season 1 in the coming weeks.
"
29366,easy to understand and addicting !!!!
29367,"This is written as though to the feedback button in game, since it decided to not do anything,.....................................................

There are some heroes that are flat out overpowered(Warlock used to be semi-op but has been balanced and now actually feels balanced; still strong, but in the right situations and usually not the gaming winning cast[instead of the way it was before, which I'm sure is why you addressed that hero.])
The fact of the matter is: What Choices I am Given during a match to upgrade heroes BY FAR OUTWIEGH ANY DECISION I make during gameplay(whether that's gold management, hero trading in and out or what ever; which should matter A lot.)
Bloodseeker, Slark & Sand King?(I'm bad at names, but I'm pretty sure the last of which is the hero that burrows and stuns the Entire Team.) Are the most unbalanced Heroes and by far the most Gameplay Experience Ruining Heroes.
The Heroes need balanced faster as well.
Your RNG is SO HORRIBLE right now, its not possible to say whether or not there is Any Hero Balance Whatsoever(other than the fore mentioned).
THE RNG NEEDS FIXED. PERIOD.
All Caps in this message Are 100% Intentional.
I will tell people to play this game: but not until the RNG is fixed. Until then(if ever?), its a flat out: NO; Its an unbalanced POS solely due to the horrid state of the RNG."
29368,Way too much RNG.  Feels like whoever does well is just the ones that get the luckiest.  I understand that there is some strategy involved but when I'm going up against people with 3 or more two stars by round 15 and I haven't even been given enough copies for a single two star yet then the game obviously has a problem.
29369,"better than Artifact

a Lucky Simulator :))"
29370,шо за поебота

29372,Valve always make best game
29373,"I really enjoy the game and the road valve went with underlords.
pros:
Games are fluent and it looks good
Matchmaking is quick.
Click and dropping units is a huge improvement.
The item system is better, but could use some tinkering in the future with combining items.
Frequent balance updates and hero updates are also great, really hope they keep things up.

cons:
Woul really like a courier (it doesnt even have to do much, just something to look at and play with)
UI could still be improved for a more PC friendly version.
"
29374,"good game, but the tutorial is not as good
it doesn't explain how heroes get mana or some other little detail."
29375,RNG HATES ME!!!
29376,"Great game, especially because it's available on mobile. I can now lose from inside my house and outside. 10/10"
29377,"No matter how many times I’ve won, it is not fun. This game is a total RNG based hot pile of shite and everyone with a proper logic&brain combination should knew it already. Its just about being lucky with your shop options, thats it. Do not try to fool yourselves with meta arguments, the thing called meta should not be just Scrappy, Spirits forbidden delta slam technique crap or Knights options. Who completes one of the roster with those alliances first wins the game. Such thing is not acceptable for game genre like this. 
Its also sad that Artifact died for this crap. They screwed up with Artifact then Dota 2 and then this non-sense. Keep up with that spree, I believe in you Valve. #longhaul"
29378,"This game is amazing! There is much much more strategy than luck involved.
Can't stop playing!"
29379,This game is very strategical so that means you need to pick fast and same in DOTA 2 but in here just only the set ups every round and in DOTA 2 twice only i recommend this for critical thinkers and fast learners for this game
29380,"great game.
But how can one have more than 50 gold coins and lv 9 and 6 all minions 2-star (top 3)?
and there are two guys in my game are like that ... are they AI-computers mix in multiplayer-game?

*Edit:
I've really been trying to put an honest effort into enjoying this game but so far have had no LUCK in doing so(pun intended). And I have only been playing medium a.i. that somehow has 50g and 3-4 level 2 on the board by round 6. Like how dafuq is that even possible??"
29386,"[H1]Note for developers in the end!  [/H1]
I played this game on mobile and foun it difficult to understand! (Also I never played DotA or DotA 2 ). The main doubt was how to make my player a 2 star or 3 star player.
I guess this game require time to understand and master. It's a fun game as you don't have to click rapidly just use your brain and enjoy the show. 

Final words:
Play if you like card, board, etc games that require strategy. If you like fast passes games like CSGO then this is not your cup of tea. 

To developers:
Your hard work is visible and I really appreciate it but it's just like a regular game not a breakthrough kind of game like CSGO, DotA, team fortress 2, etc we are expecting something like that. 

Edit:
still not excited to play this game! don't knnow why! (=_=)"
29387,bad
29388,"RNG rage simulator, 5/7"
29389,very nice
29390,is this the best you can do valve??? feelsbadman
29391,addictive 1
29392,Shit game. UI suck ass.
29393,"The League one is better, but this isn't that bad.

It's highly addictive. You'll get to the end of one, think you're going to be done, but by the time you ready up and start playing again, you're ready to play and want to keep going.

My main problem with it, and it's the reason I prefer TFT over Underlords, It relies way too hard on RNG. I get that that's part of what makes Underlords what it is, but I prefer being able to better form a strategy that is more likely to work. Underlords makes it difficult to get anywhere, because all of the more deadly heroes you can get are so highly contested that you better hope you see it and buy it first, or else you just lose.

I found the most fun I had was building the Warrior class of heroes for my teams, which goes great up until the late game. I almost never get any items that actually help the build, nor can I try to get items that do. I'm left coveting anything that will be useful to what I want to do, and I can't, because every hero I need has been grabbed by the other players already. It's frustrating.

Either way, the game itself isn't bad, it's just obnoxiously infuriating. It isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't suggest playing if you don't want to lose 90% of the time. It is more fun to play with friends."
29394,Better than autochess :p
29395,"The tutorial is really bad at explaining anything (including how to level heroes).

The UI is also a big mess and you need to travel to like 2 pages just to find what classes are your heroes just so you know how to combo them.

I don't understand how the fights for loot works, cause sometimes you can kill the monsters and sometimes they just one shot you for no reason (not mistake monsters for the heroes).

I can't recommend the game at this moment, I will wait for it to get out of EA first and will give it one last chance (maybe)."
29396,Good!
29397,"Why do I love this game? Because this is as close to 'PvP Roguelike' as can possibly exist. It has the perfect mix of RNG and mechanics. Approach it from the mindset that you are not there to win, but you are there to do your best; sometimes everything will fall together and you will get #1, but if you just try to place in the top 4 your enjoyment will increase a lot. Autochess is a very misleading term, this is closest to poker, where heroes are 'cards', your hero roster is your 'hand', and you play what you got on the board. 

Don't underestimate skill. Yes, it's possible someone can be instantly fed a 2-star Medusa and Tidehunter, but for consistent performance over multiple games, it's impossible to understate the progressive advantages that experience grants. From knowing the heroes, keeping an eye on your opponents, denying from the pool, knowing when a popular piece is too coveted to use, how to maximize interest and when to cash out to pivot or improve at a critical junction, all of these can make or break your final placement.

When I lose, I immediately reflect on what I spent my gold on, my item choices, my positions, who had what items; did I do the best I could and do I feel happy with the place I got? In that vein, I'm having a lot of fun, even if I've only placed #1 three times so far -- I almost always hit the top 4."
29398,RNG for this game is fucking trash.
29399,"For reference: I usually am in top 3, and have 7+ win streaks in more games than not.

The game itself is pretty fun and addictive. Unfortunately there are major balance issues at this stage that make experienced players have repetitive builds so the replay value goes away once you get to matches with higher ranking players. 

While balancing is fluid and early for a beta status game, the reason for the poor rating is that the match length is way too long (around an hour or more for successful players). This contributes to the repetitiveness since eventually people learn which hero combos are most efficient to go for and there is little reason not to sell off whatever heroes had been used earlier in a game to buy the same overplayed combos every game once they come up (heroes are randomly available in a shop between matches and unleveled heroes sell for full refund).

While balance changes will most likely fix many of the repetitive team issues or at least make flexible counters while going for other builds, I cannot see the devs changing how long the matches are. For this reason I cannot recommend this game. It is not a reasonable time investment when considering game length vs variety/fun in any other top game. It is an excellent mobile game if you are going for time wasting though, just don't plan to have any battery left."
29400,"cool Rng, thanks gaben"
29401,"Experience Dota 2 underlords on mobile while at work, good job Valve!"
29402,better than dotachase
29403,Way too much randomness.  Not really much strategy.  20 minutes of getting bad heroes/unmatched heroes to choose from is not fun because someone in your group of 8 will get lucky and destroy you.

29405,"It be good.

8/10

- An Official Peekoo Review"
29406,Good Game!
29407,"A fun little game, it plays like some sort of pvp semi-random tower defense game. The specific numbers/abilities need some work, and i think that the game would be a much more satisfying experience with an increase in the number of abilities available per hero and a decreased reliance on lucky pulls since falling behind due to pure luck is common and hard to crawl back from.
If they add more options, particularly game modes like a team v team mode, a co-op pve mode, or a ""campaign/story"" mode for a single player experience, this could become a staple of my PC."
29408,"First of all, I don't believe I actually have as many hours in the game as it says I do. I think that it may keep counting hours on the mobile app if you don't completely close it.

The game is mostly based around the RNG and the rolls you get, but there is a fair amount of strategy in trying to build around what your opponents are doing (as the RNG allows it) and positioning can help mitigate some things that can screw you over.

Once you get a feel for the game, and accept that sometimes the RNG will just screw you over (it does it to everybody) it becomes profoundly addicting. The randomness can also force you to try things that you assume won't work, but end up finding ways to make it work because you don't have much choice, which helps keep things fresh."
29409,"After a competitor went online today, I can now say how well I like Underlords.
The game is fun and offers a very easy entry into the ""Auto-Battler"".
Graphic: In your face - very poppy, but also very friendly for beginners. 
For me the perfect introduction to this genre.
"
29410,"my first dive into autochess. I can see why it is so popular. The gameplay is very addictive. Reminded me of duelyst a bit, except with the pieces playing out on their own after placement. Also, of course, in this game and in the other auto chess games, the pieces are based on a popular MOBA they are pulled from, so the learning curve is lower if you played that game before. 

I never played dota /dota 2. But I do love this game and will continue playing it."
29411,"Interesting game, it is free so try it."
29412,"Still just RNG simulator, though items are slightly more balanced. Just roll some dice and see how you do; boom I just saved you an hour per round you would've played."
29413,Pretty addictive
29414,I'm addicted
29415,Yo!
29416,"For about 10 hours in, I was thinking, ""This is a really fun game!  It's fun learning it, and it's fun leveling it.  It's incredibly addicting!""

Then you come to a point where you are consistently destroying all the new players, and face off against those of higher levels... and realize that this game is all luck of the draw.  It's really nothing more than that.  This game is an elementary version of Magic the Gathering.

It's in beta, but I will definitely keep my eye on it.  It's free and fun, and while I admit to shelving it, I recommend it."
29417,It's yet another garbage game by Valve much like Artifact & their VR only shovelware.
29418,very boring
29419,must have chat or voice chat in game
29420,"It's alright, I played a mobile game.. Auto Chess, literally the same concept. 

I think it's fun in theory, but gets a bit boring since the rounds are so long."
29421,"Very interesting game play 
in this beta test"
29422,ROFL i cannot understand why they make it an independent game. It 100% won't work. They will finally pay for their greedy. Let's see.
29423,"alll autochess games are trash, no skill required all RNG luck every game"
29424,"Free. Easy to learn
That's all"
29425,"I'm a newbie to this type of game, starting with dota auto chess just a few days before this game's release and I have to say this is by far much better. It's friendly towards players new to the units and game itself considering how it offers items for every AI round, has a feature that allows you to see what unit belongs to what class, and a few other noticeable features that make this friendly for any player, not just the ones that have experience in this mode. The learning curve doesn't really feel like it exists vs auto chess either so you won't spend as much time trying to learn and adjust to everything there is to know about this type of game.

edit: should mention I started playing just to learn the idea of the game for Team Fight Tactics on LOL"
29426,"Great Game overall, Balancing isn't too bad as least at this point in time. Wish there was a better chat or communication system or some type of customization but overall great game."
29427,no skill to this game all luck .... just roll a dice i would be more fun
29428,"Ohh man, that RNG will kill your mood. anyway its good game."
29429,"pros: pretty good art, sound/music, the overall look and feel of the game is good, the heros/units are interesting. its a game you might really want to like

cons: the RNG is astronomical. winning games mainly comes down to who gets the most of the same hero units over and over to combine them. three 1 stars become a 2 star, three 2 stars become a 3 star. there is almost nothing you can do to control this. you can try to strategically spend/save gold to get early rolls, or to get more rolls later...but it doesnt really help much if at all. 

ultimately playing a match is a decent time waster, and for a free game, thats nothing to complain about, but at the same time, it isnt really satisfying as you dont feel like you control your own destiny. it never feels good to lose because you got unlucky, but it really doesnt feel good to win just because you got lucky either."
29430,Meh. Pretty boring.
29431,Amazing  game. The RNG is like any auto chess and that is whats add up fir the strategy.
29432,It's a good game and your wins are mostly based on the RNGod and luck - sometimes you may win against a player with almost all units on the table and the very next battle (against the same player having the same units' formation) you may lose with almost all opponent's units on the table.
29433,grande good time si si
29434,Very addicting tactic game.
29435,"80% RNG
20% Strategy

You can certainly win if you have great strategy. But if someone has amazing RNG they will win virtually uncontested. No matter how great you adapt and strategize, if you get awful RNG, you have no chance. They need to implement a type of come back mechanic. As I believe the League version will be doing."
29436,Nice Game I enjoy
29437,"its good. ive played with the ai within the game. initially, i had difficulty understanding what i was doing wrong. the 2nd game i became a god. either im a genius or those a.i.'s are pretty bad;  but nonetheless, FUN GAME ;)"
29438,"A more polished version of autochess. Couldn't really get into the mod, the UI and onboarding here made it much clearer.
Still not really my cup of tea, can see the appeal though."
29439,"I would rather roll dice between me and 9 other people to see who wins, then continue to play this RNG bullshit. you have no control over what you get or what you can do, the a.i. is so badly programmed i have lost rounds simply because (for no reason i can figure out) your ""hero"" can switch targets before it kills what its already attacking, making it take more damage then it should and losing because of it.  i shouldn't be seeing the same hero i don't have and can't use 10 times over and over but never seeing the 1 hero i need to upgrade.

and before you say its because i suck, i'm ALWAYS top 3 tell the last half of the game and then for no reason, even if iv one 9/10 matches and upgraded my hero's, its like the game just stops giving you anything to work with and your out ramped by someone who was lucky enough to get a refresher orb or somehow level 3 a tier 4 before you level 2 a tier 3 (which i have never seen nor have i got anything better then passives that never go with any team i can build or items that quickly QUICKLY become worthless, but have been told drops more then the mod of this game did)

iv had rounds where my ""hero"" fires its ablity 3 times, doing great damage. then the next round its alive for the same amount of time and only gets its ablity off once (and not because its stunned or hexed). it just dose not want to and i'm tired of losing because of it.

i own more board games then most people know are real and iv put more time into games then most people put on a computer.
the A.I.  NEEDS WORK, and they really need to look at item and shop balance. tell then I can not recommend."
29440,rng
29441,no microtransactions? wow sign me in
29442,Its good game.
29443,It's the game based off a mod for a game based off a mod.
29444,"If it wasn't  based on pure luck it'd be alright,other than that I suggest to stay away from it."
29445,Not Bad...  Good strategy Game!
29446,"awesome
"
29447,pretty decent game
29448,"Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg… and my arm… even my fingers. The body I’ve lost… the comrades I’ve lost… won’t stop hurting… It’s like they’re all still there. You feel it, too, don’t you?"
29449,"I think it's fun, but it's SUPER RNG based."
29450,"I think this is the best auto chess clone so far, and it's still only in beta. Thank you gaben."
29451,great game
29452,"Bad ripoff of dota autochess fan mode, Fuck you Volvo"
29453,"This is a brilliant, well designed strategy game. The competitive element is incredibly fun ad the systems in the game are well implemented. The game is well balanced and I am enjoying myself a lot, so I advise getting this game because I am quite sure that you will enjoy it :D"
29454,Boring Gameplay
29455,Game based on luck
29456,Good entertainment for a very long time.
29457,"Oh, you don't get good rolls? Roflmao get fucked!

Edit: Reported a bug in the Steam Discussions, got deleted without notice or reason. Thx Volvo!"
29458,my sound stopped working in the last 2 updates. reinstalled but still no sound. pls give me a fix volv0
29459,A worse game than Auto Chess by Dragonest Games. Only good thing about it is that matches are quicker.
29460,"Originally i hated this game and did not win ANY game for the 1st 40hours.

I thought it's an RNG fest when you win all rounds until last battle when you just get bad items and keep on losing to a guy with 4hp and no yellow heroes and overall, just not worthy the nerves.

BUT then i was watching some guy on twitch and realized it's an ECONOMY game. 

Just make money, don't try to win ALL rounds and eventually you'll have so much coin around rounds 26-30 that you ALMOST can't lose.

Oh and try to go Mages every game. Win guaranteed.

Other good combos : Warrior-Assassin, Warrior-Hunters, Hunters. I hate Knights and never pick them."
29461,gg
29462,The rage of a thousand blinding suns
29463,"too much rng, some games i get good picks and i win, others are terrible and i just get destroyed.

After playing enough i figured out how to win
-there are heros and hero combos/buffs that are op
-if the rng favors you you will get said combos and win
-if you have bad rng you will lose cause you didnt get the set heros/combos that are op
-if you are blessed by the rng gods it wont matter what you do cause your team full of level 3s will stomp on everyone.

Also there is this terrible mechanic in game which is the more you win the more gold you get, so if someone is dominating the game they will proceed to dominate even more. If you keep winning you can build up a winning streak of 9 GOLD per round AND to make matters worse if you have 10 gold banked at all times you get 1 more extra gold so that adds up to 10 gold, and people that are dominating can easily spare 10 gold for banking, while the average gold per round is 5. If you are on a losing streak you only get a measly 1 extra gold, which is a total of 6 gold per round. This makes no sense, adding a mechanic that gives someone who is dominating such an advantage, giving them DOUBLE the normal gold for dominating the match, like wtf kinda logic is that???

there are vital things the game doesn't tell you. i was watching a youtube video on this game and the guy was talking about things you would have no way of knowing unless you play dota, which i dont. like certain heros that are bad/good against things or abilities that do special things in which this game gives you no knowledge on and you would only know these things unless you played Dota2. Here is an example,(im just making up whats good against what cause i dont remember it), some heros will have water abilities that do extra damage against demons or this heros has light abilities that counter or do more damage against nature, that sort of thing. the game tells you what the abilities does, ie throws a bomb that damages enemies within a 4 block square, but it doesnt tell you that that bomb is a mech bomb that deals extra damage to druids(again just an example).

EDIT: i just lost an hour+ game cause of rng, i had an amazing set up and was winning, but this guy has a terrible set up/ all his heros didnt synergize/ no buffs, yet he won cause they were all level 3. wtf kind of rng do you have to have to have 6 level 3 units(none were druids). plus my set up would defeat his army, but the rng was so hard on his side, during the battles my units would do everything possible for me to lose. when my units fought normally he would lose. what is this rng garbage game? it pisses me off cause this game has potential to be a good game."
29464,"Played the tutorial, was not tutored.
After about 5 hints followed by 30 rounds of silence, when all enemies were dead, absolutely nothing happened. Game just bugged out.

Overall I was very frustrated by the limited information that ist given to the player. There are almost no tooltips and often enough you are left to guess what any given icon does when clicked. 
You also can't see the stats of units before you buy them unless you dig through menus.

Every aspect of this game's design boldly reminds you that Valve is taking a 'mobile first' approach here. PC players get to feel like they're using a mobile device, with the only advantages being hotkeys and less lag.

Of course, the game is free and still in beta, but i am rating it as it is right now. Unless you are really into mobile games, i do not recommend this."
29465,"Game based on luck, 'nuff said"
29466,Good game but needs much more balance and content.
29467,great
29468,Casual yet really engaging experience that rewards economic and positional strategy.
29469,RNG hates me!
29470,"It has the dynamic mechanics of any card game, of the length of a regular Dota match, which doesn't fit it. Hated it at first, but getting the hang of it and has a nice combination of strategizing and gambling. Probably once it releases and has a proper ranking/level-up system it will be quite addicting."
29471,"- unfriendly ui 
-shitty mechanics  
-octarine (50% is a joke)
-seems confused should i rely on attribute buff or hero spells ( based which hero u use)
- RNG shop 
- u ended up losing with spending gold on reroll on shop

Tactical Teamfight is better (League Legends)"
29472,"This is a very good game, found it to be alot more user-friendly then the Dota II mod which made it easier for me to get into the game. Feels like you have the power to win the games and that's not only rng like others say, we need more patch notes cause Keeper of the light is to op atm"
29473,Interesting concept. But not recommended to play for beginners. You can't see the skills of heroes before you purchase them. Either learn them all by heart or GTFO.
29474,"To be fair this is a really fun game (not biased by that I win alot)
Basically dota auto chess, fun to play when you got nothin else to do or don't feel like playin dota 2."
29475,"Если ты выходишь из дома и находишь 5000 рублей, то это игра для тебя
Если нет, то пошел нaxyй"
29476,fun game alot better than auto chess i usually play on mobile device cuz graphics doesnt feel right in pc
29477,TFT is better in every tangible way.
29478,"Stay away from it, unless you want to waste time on a RNG entirely based game."
29479,"Fun for the first few hours. 

afterwards problems start to surface - reptitivness, randomness, imbalance, and fairly long rounds. since the player cannot control units on the ""chessboard"" their behavior needs some major polish.

P.S. the upgrade system is just ludicrous - completely rng-based third level of units. wtf"
29480,please add 32bit for windows 7. I'm using company's laptop
29481,if you are lucky enjoy ! if not game is shit .0 skill based game only luck.
29482,need more update
29483,this gamne is rng
29484,"This game is literally just RNG. 

There's almost no skill involved in this game, and there is no ""being good at the game"". You can have a great start and then wait for a piece for 20 turns and never have it show up, or spend gold switching your selection multiple times and still never have it show up and it's over because someone else got lucky and got a 3 star KOTL.

ZERO effort put in by the developers to mitigate the RNG nature of this game."
29485,Addicting.
29486,"WAY WORSE THEN AUTOCHESS!!!! the layout is GOD FUCKING AWFUL and clearly panders to mobile, which is a shame because i really like auto chess, but this layout is just pure trash."
29487,i wish they would put something like courier to buy or anything else. winning seems worth less with just rank up
29488,it needs work
29489,sqawartawzdfczwaza
29490,addictive and challenging auto chess game
29491,"This is better than what I expect, when I knew valve did not develop with Drodo making auto chess I'm not expect their own version to be this good."
29492,"Awful tutorial, very confusing, feel like you have no input into the game mechanics and things are badly explained.
Would not recommend"
29493,"Dota's take on the auto chess genre, its pretty good and fun. But the rng isn't , still reccomend the game"
29494,"Pretty fun and an interesting way of minion battles. I had a tonne of fun, and hopefully once it is more so updated and fixed a few issues, I'd be going against friends for months."
29495,Awful tutorial with no explanation or whatever.
29496,"I just want to say that this game is awful and if you value your mental health I wouldn't recommend playing it.
You can be doing well all game and have a great team composition but then get completely destroyed by someone who just happened to get better RNG. 
I've had way too many games where I carefully pick my team and build up only to hit a brick wall and get nothing that I need and end up losing to someone who just happened to magically get everything they needed. 

TLDR: If you have bad luck with RNG like me, don't play this game.
"
29497,What is this
29498,"Fun casual game, hopefully good business model when its fully released"
29499,"at least better than riots tft.
But thats not hard:
Riots coding is worse than the engine of skyrim."
29500,Nice.
29501,Kinda good for me. HAVE FUN!
29502,fuccck your moms
29503,"Really unsatisfying to play. 
You get to spend 20-30 min building your composition just to face someone who 100% destroys your entire army because they happened to choose a better alliance. 
Not balanced at all either, some heroes are straight up garbage and you can only find that out by either scavenging the internet for information or playing countless matches and getting absolutely wrecked by more experienced players."
29504,Best development team in Valve.
29505,Interesting and addictive game and I appreciate patches/updates.
29506,8.8/10 ez gg
29507,"Definitely recommended, mobile or pc. The game is fun, very strategic, and at this point in time in early access there are no micro-transactions. Pretty keen to see the game eventually get updated, hopefully with some new heroes, alliances, game boards, etc."
29508,Trash RNG !
29509,I have never been in this kind of games but hell yeah. i like it.
29510,"this game is actually good. i like the mechanics except the fucking random shop system. its terrible. when you have 2 heroes in your deck, they reduce the change to get the heroes that we want, thats suck. i can really feel it.  just 1 fucking more same heroes and i will upgrade it to the next star its just wont shown up. this is pure LUCK

im not even hate this game, just fix the random system. even i have a good brain to build a good combo, i still cant beat the enemy that have a higher luck than me, they got a good combo plus higher star. i have a good combo but i dont have a good 2 or 3 star, just fucking fix the random system valve."
29511,"i think it would be better, if we could control heroes strength. totally it's very good and nice designed game, Thanks.very nice"
29512,"The idea was fun (too bas it was basically a copy/paste from DAC) but the developers are ruining the game with stupid changes.
Add the RNG factor and the game is really boring and the meta is always the same overpowered build every game.

Stop making videogames valve, you are a joke."
29513,"very nice game , good design , good atmosphere , Good Game
plz use more items and effects , upgrades , and also u can give heroes talents that can players choose , totally great =)
I like it/"
29514,"Highly addictive!  Tell myself I’m going to play “just one more game.”  When that games over, “Just one more game:)”. Love the flow of building and strengthening my team each round."
29515,Rather fun
29516,very fun and good game TRY IT!!!!!
29517,the sever is worse than ubisoft !fk1ng 817ch valve!
29518,great for killing time
29519,much better than tft
29520,"The game has improved substantially since the beginning.  I now do enjoy my time in this game more often than not.  That said, there are a few UI/visibility matters that I am waiting on before I can honestly recommend it.  
------------------
Poor transparency and some questionable decisions.  My time played is much greater than my time enjoyed.   I hope it improves, but I'm not holding my breath."
29521,"I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Every update turns the game upside down, is is like playing a completely different game each time. There is A LOT of UI bugs, and UI by itself is overwhelming and clunky. It is really hard to find anything helpful beneath those colorful splashes and effects. Balance is still a joke to this game. At least, it is free"
29522,"Shit game. Boring, bad performance, it looks terrible, the matchmaking sucks, don't waste your time."
29523,"Game lasts longer than retirement home's average lifespan, as you can see from my hours played; that's from 3 games. It's good but consider this a weekend game if you don't have much time per day to play games."
29524,"Ok so, few things...
Balance just do not exist...
Too much randomness, game does not reward actual knowledge of the game. There is only one build that is worth going for. You can do well with Your build but in the end, you will always lose to the guy who went for mages.
Characters like sniper, who has huge range, will still walk towards the enemy before starting his attacks.
There are levels but... There is no progression at all. Even after winning, you don't feel a thing. No reward, no nothing

In the current, broken state I do not recommend this game. Waste of time. Alto it is still in the beta so hope for the best!"
29525,R.I.P. Artifact
29526,"To save me from the boring, mediocre summer days; Valve releases a new enjoyable game which brings the experience I've never had."
29527,****
29528,good game No.1
29529,"Fun game.. but lacks content... 
Personally, I don't feel motivated to play the game while there is no rewards for playing it.
Tutorial is kinda garbage - doesn't explain anything but basics - which gamers will find out themself in first match going into direct game.
RNG factor is way too strong. 
No matter on strategy and how good you are - if you do not get cards you need, and your opponent do - you gonna lose despite your efforts."
29530,"server is a bit better
changing my review to a yes
also if you think LOL version is better you are crazy"
29531,Nice Game for me ...
29532,the worst game i ever play since i was born. only luck and the game told us fair game. one of the rubbish game.. haih
29533,"I have a few things to say about this game.
First i have not won a match within the 10 hours ive played so far and im still having fun.
The RNG in these types of games can make for some really trashy rounds or some really good ones.
Does take a bit of learning like every game does.
One thing thats lacking in my opinion is some content. Doesn't fell like your playing for anything at some points.
8/10 so far. Nice Valve.
"
29534,"I find it to be very boring and not very engaging.
A single match goes on for way too long (longer than your average Dota 2 match)

You basically get a random set of heroes to recruit, but normally you just pick one to fill your board then either spend gold on level ups to place more heroes, or reroll until you have 9 of the same hero to upgrade them.  So it's basically RNG deckbuilder that takes too long.
Each hero has two perks and an ability that synergizes with your bored, or at least that's what you should go for.  Like having 2 druids gives you a bonus, 2/4/6 human types, etc.
Upgrade system is a little weird.  You need 3 of the same hero to rank it up once, then I'm assuming you need 6 more to get the 3rd rank, since you need 3 2-ranks to get a 3-rank, and 3 1-ranks to make one 2-rank, but since the buyable heroes is a random shop, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a 3rd rank unless you're really lucky, and you have to micromanage 8 bench slots to store them all in."
29535,"Better than auto chess. Items are less RNG, units combine no matter where they are and most importantly instant queues. Give it a try."
29536,GOOD EEAAA MHAAANNXXX
29537,"banyak bug anjay,tapi lumayan lah"
29538,Good Enough
29539,It would be great if this game could be run in android devices with openGL 2.0
29540,"While graphics are nice, and there may be a good game hiding inside, there are many baffling design decisions (like win and loss streaks) that serve top unbalance the game and take strategy out of the hands of the player. Also, the amount of play time and downtime are pretty shockingly high for a game this simple."
29541,I've never played DOTA or Autochess before this and I can confirm that the game is very good.
29542,"Core gameplay is good. Of course, all of the assets existed already (lifted straight from DoTA 2), the design documents already existed (because this is an official recreation of a popular DoTA 2 mod), all Valve really had to do was give it a dedicated client and functional mobile ports. So far they've been quick to address balance issues, and some of the changes they've made compared to other auto chess-likes make a lot of sense (such as being able to freely move items around units, switching hero inventories to one slot and making every item more impactful in general), others are not so great (during ""item rounds"" you can choose passive abilities that make or break your build, possibly forcing you to completely change your lineup even after you've sunk a lot of gold into a working strategy). Some elements of the game are not clearly communicated, for example, some alliances and heroes have abilities that aren't mentioned on any visible tooltip in the game, and you can only discover those properties through trial, error, and spectating. 

Hopefully they continue to update and add to the game in order to stay competitive with two other major retail versions of 'auto chess'. Beating TfT to market by being publicly accessible with no huge queue times, AND having a mobile port right away are a step in the right direction. Game also runs OK on my pixel 3a, but my wife (who has an older Galaxy phone) cannot run the game very well. Optimization is clearly needed; who knows if it'll come though.

It's free, it's fun. I lost nearly 4 hours the first time I launched it. My largest complaint is that my lunch break at work is an hour long, and I don't know that I can reliably find time to squeeze a match of this in. I'm not sure a separate 'turbo' mode will be the answer, something should probably be done to reduce the length of the game that applies equally to everyone in all modes of play."
29543,I played the DOTA 2 mod and i gotta say between the mod and this i think they did amazing work with Dota Underlords. I love the item system with global effects and the units are really good!
29544,nice
29545,Garbage.
29546,"RNG does HATE ME!

but i can't stop playing !!!"
29547,"+ 10 player battle royale, based on the card battling genre but instead uses animated chess-like pieces on a board.
+ Super good game concept and extreemly addicting!!!
+ Currently as writing this, 120,000 players online playing, searching for a 10 player match takes 3 seconds to launch the match!
+ Valve has a massive winner on their hands - but needs a lot more evolution as most games newly created do.
- Has a few balancing issues with group bonuses that become unbeatable late game even though you also have a god-tier army. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5 Stars) Great Game, MUST-HAVE!!
Highly recommended!
I'll do a full pros & cons review in the future after more playthrough.
*Edit: 63 hours in 5 days, holy fk is this game addicting and fun! <3
*Update: After 2 weeks, competition is getting much harder, as people are using guides now instead of using their brains...lol  
Before I was playing 4 hours a day, now i only play 1 game per day as im burnt-out from competition using a build that is has too OP of a group bonus, keep loosing this way is taking away the fun for me as it's unbalanced in this area, which as a new game is fine, im sure devs will adjust in time with updates.
The first 2 weeks of the game's release i was winning 70% of my games, today im lucky to win 1/10."
29548,needs work.
29549,"unable to reconnect to the server
why this happened?"
29550,"A strange game.  The only winning move is not to play.

No, seriously.  The way to win is to not spend your money at all, and just sit on it, and let it get interest until you have 50 or so.  Then you just have such a ridiculous gold lead that you'll win or get whatever union you want, no matter what.  Like, say, the utterly broken Knight/Troll union combo (as of writing, I'm sure after the first patch there'll be a different ""I win"" union.)  Down to 40 HP before the last few rounds?  Don't matter, you won't lose any HP because all that gold got you at least 3-4 3 star heroes.

Farming for lategame simulator."
29551,THE GAME DOES NOT  LAUNCH IN STEAM ITS SAYS RUNNING BUT NOTHING WORKS
29552,"Valve waited around 5 years for another mod just like DotA itself coming from the community since they launched the Source 2 major update, and they would never miss this chance because this was the fundamental reason why they ship the Custom Game Feature along with the development tool sets. It was hard to see that Valve published a game within such a short period, although Underlords now only have the basic core game play, it's still worth to try and I think Underlords would be the most successful Auto Chess game due the depth Dota2 background and the understanding of competitive games from dev team."
29553,Add more of the fucking heroes. There are not enough heroes to properly sustain 8 players. Legit over 100 heroes and valve is being stingy as fuck as always. Constantly picking heroes that other players have already chosen. Its so frustrating getting what you want that winning doesnt feel as rewarding.
29554,"StupidAF but can't stop playing.

Get good?

Nah, get lucky.

#ArtifactFTWbutWillPlayThisAnyway"
29555,Amazing games in competition
29556,garbage
29557,RngRngRng. soo much RNg with hero
29558,Literally the worst! Much better off downloading android emulator and playing original developer's auto chess!
29559,Good game for everyone. But ded. Gone forever.
29560,"Here's a headline:

German man says 'no'."
29561,POOR GAMEPLAY!
29562,yeah good
29563,"I love this game so much , used other accounts before, played over 1k hours.
But there is 1 disappointed, it didn't move since last year.
FUCK YOU , VALVE!!!!!!!!
Disappointed"
29564,"There will always be that one player that kicks your ass...


10/10 just like dota"
29565,"Dota Underlords is a perfect example of rushed garbage when trying to capitalise on the current ""auto chess"" popularity.

- Most ranged units do not target correctly leading to RNG fights.
- Units often will auto attack with full mana.
- RNG unit system where you will see people dominate the entire game after getting a lvl 3 tinker or ogre magi at round 5-6,
- Up until recently opponent matchmaking was broken causing players to face the same opponent over and over.
- Major balancing issues. Play Mages till endgame to win."
29566,"a friend keeps yelling at me ""dota chess sucks""

this is for you Dave!"
29567,"It's free, so I guess I recommend it. 

You can be strategic and still take an L towards the end just based on luck of the draw (RNG). Which is pretty frustrating sometimes because the games aren't short.  

I played a game where I was leading in top 3 (still 100 life!) and could not get another good roll ended up going down in flames. 

ALSO - there should be an option to duck out, if there is let me know.  There is nothing more annoying than having to just sit there when you know you're toast and get defeated over-and-over until you're out."
29568,pog
29569,Recommending this game because there are too many actual butthurt Dota players and it's entertaining.
29570,"I like, is good, yes"
29571,This game tops all the shitty games I've ever played .....DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GO PLAY AUTO CHESS it is way better than this game could ever even conceive of being.
29572,"This game has been short changing me for gold coins.. 
When the match ends and it lists the prizes for the round, counting the amount you get then shorting me by one gold i would guess 75% of the time plz fix because that is really frustrating to see due to my knowledge of basic addition,"
29573,Was a very fun game until the update today. Mages got nerfed and everyone abuses Knights. 1/10 game
29574,RNG hell
29575,Luck Game
29576,"idk how but this feels really nice game, specially when ur bored af this game could cheer you up. (waiting for the next update XD)"
29577,"People are going to say its RNG based, and yeah sure RNG ruins the game, but thats not even the worst of it.
The worst part is there are only a few units that work well. Trying to go for something new will get you fucked.
Units like the hunters, or bloodbound units are just a waste. If they want to improve this game they NEED to make all units viable.
I doubt they will ever fix the RNG problems though..... Its a shame the premise is so good."
29578,alt+f4 does not work
29579,"This is Dota without having to worry about Peruvians harassing the game on the SA (""brazilian"") server.
FABULOUS."
29580,nice
29581,"This game is extremely addictive, so much so, that I'm going to uninstall it after writing this review to give myself a little space.  Why is it so addictive?  The game play is basically an elaborate, albeit somewhat interactive, slot machine.  That's not to say that there isn't some depth and strategy, but that's not what compelled me to play so excessively.  

As I approach the end of each game, the fun is waning, because the progression stops.  I'm immediately longing to see that fresh board, and my hero options.  To collect those first few items.  To get my first silver unit.  To construct.  To roll.  To be surprised.  This is how it works."
29582,"I am enjoying this far more than I imagined I would. My friend asked me to play and now I'm hooked. I will play a genre of this game type for the foreseeable future, and this one seems pretty great thus far."
29583,words
29584,"At the moment one of the best Auto Chess games there is. Very easy to handle and it also has a build in Wiki, where you can read up on all the heroes, items and factions. You can also practice against bots of differend kind of difficulties and can even select to stop the time when doing so, to read up all the descriptions of the items you can select from. IMO a very good feature to learn the game that no other auto chess game there is has atm has. Only critique points I have, is that the heroes are not talking like in Dota2 Auto Chess. (Like, Tiny's ""We did it, little rock"" for example) And not all heroes change their appearence once they level up. But I hope that will all be implemented towards the full version of the game. Also the game needs the hero IO!!! ^^ All in all I give it a 9 out of 10 points! :-)"
29585,"This one is really addictive, and different from the first auto chess. Everything's quicker, less depends on luck fortune. Once u launch it, say goodbye to ur battery power."
29586,Majesty for Call of Duty players
29587,The changed item economy is even worse than auto chess.
29588,NIce Game lot of Potential
29589,"Now this is a good Valve card game. With your deck being units instead of cards of course. There's a deceptive amount of depth that you don't see at first glance but even though the combat itself is left to the random whims of the combat AI your units sinnergies plus your placement before battle has a larger role than the luck of the draw.

It's a matter of learning the combos and adapting on the fly while checking up on your enemies rosters. There's only a limited amount of heroes of a certain type and the higher the rarity the less of them to go around. So give it a go if you like strategy in general with a healthy smattering on RNG to liven things up. 

Good luck reaching the depths of the Underempire!"
29590,"When strategy meets RNG it makes for a deadly recipe. Tons of fun but also can be frustrating if you get shafted. Overall a great game, and I can't wait to see when they add in more heroes and items."
29591,"PROS:
+ It's free (as of now).

CONS:
- Matches take way too long (~40 minutes).
- Interface is awkward, vital information (like your team bonuses) is not visible at all times.
- Too much reliance on RNG. Whoever gets a 3 star unit or a 4 gold unit first, will very likely win by virtue of having good luck. Also, you have no real control over the actual battles.
- Not fun or engaging to play. You can probably find better games even on mobile.

VERDICT: 3/10. Feels like an utter waste of time. Another disappointing game from Valve."
29592,"Great way to feel powerful in your downtime as you desperately try to get better at DotA 2.
Don't be fooled, you will throw away your knowledge and mechanics as you pave your way to strategies such as losing to a full tank enemy"
29593,Best game i have ever played.
29594,"prepare to develop a love hate relationship with this game thanks to RNG and a meta that solely revolves around finding the new strongest thing after nerfs of the old strongest thing. its okay, nothing special, but when you want to just play a casual game this game takes the cake.

I don't know who is balancing this game but they should be fired."
29595,no need
29596,"This game is 10/10 best strategic game i have played even though i have encountered some bugs i still think there is time for this game to grow and be more stable (even though the cooldown item gave me a 1000.00 sec on warlock) this is the kind of game you would play if you want to have fun and you want to enjoy using your memory skills and brain power to manipulate your opponents in battle. But even though you dont have the experience or the ""skill"" to play the game there is a tutorial feature which can show you the basics of the game and if you dont lie the concept of tutorials you can dive into solo/bots or multiplayer for the fun learning experience."
29597,eh rng sucks
29598,"I am reviewing this never having played Auto Chess.  This was my first experience with this kind of battler outside of Clash Royale.  

DOTA Underlords puts you up against 7 opponents in the quest to be the last surviving player.  To do this, you must assemble a team of minions over the course of a game, from 1 tier 1 unit at the start to a team of up to 10 3 star units of tiers 1 through 5.  These units can be combined  together to create synergies, either innate synergies such as units that provide passive bonuses to other units, or a mechanic called ""alliances"" similar to Magic The Gathering elements.  Havin gmultiple minions of a same alliance will provide bonuses either to those of that alliance, or to the entire board.  

For example:  Having 2 or more primordial units on the board will cause a chance for all primordial units to disarm all melee opponents for a certain time.  Having 2 savage units or more will increase all monster damage by 15%, and having 2 trolls will increase all troll units' attack speed by 35%.  Unlike MTG however  each unit belongs to multiple alliances.  Tusks belong to Savage and Troll alliances.  Axes belong to Brawny and warrior alliances.  Some units even have 3 alliances, but all have at least 2.  This is no MTG, nor is it Crash Royale.  This is not a trading card game.  All units are available to all players, and the pace and strategy of the game are very different.

The best way to sum up what makes this and Auto Chess great is that it progresses similar to a MOBA game.  Both games last about 30 minutes to an hour.  Both games you're starting out with minimum.  Both games have specific win conditions based on the type of team comp you have.  Both have a smooth progression toward the end game.  Both have early and late game strategies.  The reason these games work is because of this silky smooth progression and the feedback you get when moving toward that progression.

There are people who complain about the level of RNG in this game.  Yes, you can RNG your way to victory, but it's not about getting first place.  It's about how often you can finish highly, perhaps top 3.  Your average finishing place is NOT RNG at all.  There is a skill in adapting based on what the board gives you.  It's about managing your economy (i.e. the amount of gold you get per term through various mechanics).  it's about knowing when to hold, sell, trade, or wait on units and how long to wait.  It's abou thow to manage your tiers, levels, and synergies.  It's about how much you value synergy vs raw power and what that balance means to you.  There are very many ways to play this game and even though the game is not well balanced as of yet, there are still quite a few ways to win.  

I recommend this because of the huge combination of strategy and excitement.  Every game is a little bit different than the previous and it forces you to constantly think about your choices if you want to play it well."
29599,n
29600,"A great game to play on mobile and a better option if you don’t want to wait for League’s Team Fight Tactics and/or if your PC isn’t powerful enough to play it. The only complaint I have on the mobile version is that sometimes the game exits itself out during a game, however you can easily get back into it with no rage quit penalty"
29601,"Played a few rounds now and it just feels like a bad Auto-Chess Clone. A few Pieces are different, a few class bonuses are tweaked and the Item Mechanics are reworked, thats it. You get one Item per Neutral Round and each Chess Piece can only carry one Item. There are four new Pieces (Bloodseker, Warlock, Pudge and Arc Warden) and Race and Class are now grouped into Alliances, mostly stuff everybody knows who played Auto-Chess (3 Assassins gain Crit Chance, If you only have one Demon he deals additional Damage, Warriors gain extra Armor)

All in all, Auto-Chess has a bigger Rooster, a (in my Eyes) better Item System and still is the by far better Original to Dota Underlords. Let's see if Valve is able to change this.
(Note: Native German Speaker. He who finds Mistakes may keep them.)"
29602,"Why go to Vegas ? You can just gamble rerolls in here all day long !

Joking aside, this game has a lot of rng in it, but there is also skill involved, despite what some people may claim.

It's a great game and very addicting. Whether it's effective or not, it's always fun to try out new builds and see how far you can get with it. You're guaranteed to get mad every now and then at how unlucky you are, or how unlucky someone else is. A 3-star before round 15 for example, while you have none or just one 2-star. But that's just part of the game. 

But once you get used to the game's mechanics and synergies, you'll start to figure out how to reach the top 3 (or even win) 90% of your games.

The game has great devs that update regularly as well. 

So I definitely recommend trying this game out, it's free so you have nothing to lose. Best case scenario you get hooked and just play it all day long, 'worst' case scenario you just don't like it without having spent any money."
29603,Mmmmmmmmm...
29604,Another faux-strategy RNG-based game. Keep up the great work Valve.
29605,"Not bad, The mechanics are pretty complex and confusing sometimes which makes the game pretty hard to get any fun out of but if you take the time to learn the mechanics it becomes pretty fun!"
29606,"I hate this game. It feels so unbalanced to learn and you can just be winning the entire time, then all of a sudden your just can't win at all. Nothing you do can change that, you can have full 3 star team, full synergies and all of a sudden your team just afk's and does nothing."
29607,the game is really 20% COOLER
29608,hmmm why suddenly became auto close chess?
29609,suprisingly fun
29610,"4 days before I donwload it and now ´have 28 hours played. It´s really addictive. Tho, there´re some few things that would help the game be even greater. 

1. Be able to see who you are fighting next, this will add some more strategies since you can change the characters´ position and also change the ones you´re puttin to fight deppending of the enemy your playing against (this last thing can only be used in the early-game)
2. Add the option to see the chat every time you want, this will help to see who you lost or win to, adding more strategie since you can look at what you lost to.
3. If chat option is put on, pls add different pages, example; one for the pieces your rivals have upgraded, one for the match results, etc. this woul help to have all organized.

There are some more few things to add, but I think this enough. Sorry if I miss-spelled alot, not my primary language :p"
29611,"just like dota. it will take over your life.
and its better. why you ask? because you are playing solo. 
you will always win. there's no noob teammate to hold you down. 
its you against the rng."
29612,It's a neat free game.
29613,another great game made by valve!!! KEEEP IT UP!! <33
29614,I like the direction this game is heading towards.
29615,"RNG HATES ME!

I'm throw away my PC and phone, 'cause can't make 3 star hero ... 

Worth it, i'll buy new pc and phone to play this game again and again ..."
29616,do like yes
29617,Auto Chess with SLIGHTLY less RNG.
29618,im old dota player this is good game but can be better if u can recive more items and update items like dota
29619,Dis Game is Gud
29620,Kunka nerf when? Seriously though.
29621,"I've put in hundreds of hours into Auto-Chess and this is a severely un-polished version of Auto-chess with one good differentiating mechanic that is then undermined by another bad mechanic.

First of all, Auto-Chess is amazing. Everyone should play it. Just either play that or Teamfight Tactics. Not DOTA Underlords. Why?

1. The UI is beyond cumbersome. You don't get your synergies, items, and DPS on one screen. You have to switch between them. This costs a LOT of time when you're trying to strategize what units to purchase. This is easily my biggest complaint.
2. One item per unit is horrible. It creates no interesting item build strategies or special formations around certain item heavy units. 
3. No ranked mode at all.
4. Game has framerate issues, which is amazing considering how low-impact it is, and I run a GTX Titan graphics card.

I do really like that there are permabuffs you can get for an entire unit type, instead of items. That creates interesting mechanics, but can bottleneck or nerf you if you roll high in one type but get passives for a type that never rolls. Generally, these buffs are WAYYYYY stronger than the items you can get, so that loss can be massively substantial. I also really like that you get 3-4 items per creep wave and they are guaranteed. TFT does a guaranteed item with its musical chairs thing, but generally all items are RNG. DU takes out one level of RNG, which is nice.

TFT is the best version of Auto-Chess right now, followed by Auto-Chess itself. DU is way in the back, for now, but has promise to at least surpass AC, but fundamentally is worse than TFT."
29622,"Got over 3 hours before I even knew it. Fun tactical game with the feeling that every battle will be a deciding turn, because that's it.
The only negative that I can say is also something that makes the gameplay the game and that is that 1 game can be time conuming from 30 to 60 min."
29623,"-laid back atmosphere 
-fun and subtle strategies
-addictive
-free"
29624,"Dota Underlords release is akin to stealing the recipe for the world's best chocolate chip cookies and then neglecting to put in the sugar, or the chocolate chips...

On the surface it looks like an AutoChess port, but it's not. Valve in classic form has taken all of the elegance and thrown it aside. In it's place they've added the worst possible UI you could imagine for an auto battling game. 

- They removed the option to upgrade your units or not, so when you buy your 3rd, you don't get a choice. 
- They completely ruined the druid mechanism and made it remarkably worse
- They seemingly paid zero attention to the balance changes and constant development that is in the actual mod
- They downgraded the graphics greatly, seriously, this is supposed to be the standalone and the DOTA mod still runs smoother
- They removed the interesting decision points by taking controls away from players and making an already fairly automatic game, even more computer controlled

Can't wait for the Auto Chess PC standalone to release, their phone app is already eons beyond this PC release.  

TL;DR If you are going to steal a sports car, learn how to fucking drive first..."
29625,No immortal 2 I blame Underlords
29626,"I find it more enjoyable to flip a coin and every time it lands on tails, i punch myself in the dick."
29627,Good Game
29628,"THIS GAME A RIP OFF OF TFT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS WTF VALVE BRING SOME IMAGINATION1!!1
"
29629,very unintuitive interfaces. It's not clear who is who unless you know all the characters very well.
29630,Try it but its a Meh game

"
29633,Good enough to warrant a review :D
29634,"
I prefer DOTA Underlords to other current auto chess variants (no idea of League of Legends: Tactics quite yet) due to following reasons.

+Items are guaranteed and not RNG fested
+One item / hero
+Even a loss gives you a random item from the selection
+Global items that effect everything change gameplay in interesting ways
+iOS Client that links to Steam --> played only on iOS

-Tier 5 units are generally much stronger than in the original Auto Chess
-RNG still plays quite a huge role, currently caster meta is extremely strong for mass AoE. Acquiring four SCALED units for maxed Magic Resistance just doesn't quite work as it requires tier 5 unit
-You will lose games no matter what. If you are fine wi
-No real stats/profile statistics in the current version
"
29635,thanks artifact
29636,"Disappointing. Had high hopes for this game, maybe too high. 
Just play the mod."
29637,Good for now. Let's see where they take this!
29638,AFTER THE UNDERLORDS UPDATE THIS GAME BECOME SUCK
29639,"Imagine spent a whole year to make this game and don't even bother to make a tutorial
click the play button and kept destroyed by people that played this game for months.
get bored after 2 games. uninstalled."
29640,Great game
29641,So i really hope this is a short term joke? or something to that effect  cause if this is seriously valve's new title they wanna roll out i think its kinda sad that even in early access no one thought that Tinker should be brought more in line with the rest of the heroes. he can solo 5 at once with a speed glove. I mean i dunno what paint that valve was huffing when this idea was tabled but i want some too anything that gets you so messed up too think this was a good idea has to be quality drugs.
29642,BRAINDEAD RNG PIECE OF SHIT GAME .
29643,"Fun little game to waste time with, heavily luck based but with enough strategy to make it feel worthwhile.

Personally I think it would have been much better had it been its own game rather than a dota based thing, enough changes to the overall characters and items mean that there isn't really much in common between the two games but I understand thats what draws people in.

Still needs a lot of balancing as some options are incredibly worthless."
29644,"I went from knowing nothing about the auto chess genre to being completely hooked in a matter of 2 hours because of this game. Highly recommend giving it a shot even if you have never heard of auto chess.

Pros
Incredibly addicting. 
Easy to learn and hard to master. 
Great communication from devs.

Cons
My free time is gone."
29645,"I've been hooked on this for the past few days and have had a great time learning the mechanics. It would be nice to see UI improvements for the pc version, as it's very mobile focused right now. It's a little bare bones but with all the things they have planned hopefully it will transform into a game with lots of strategy and life. Plus it's free, so if you don't like it then you haven't lost anything other than a little bit of your time :)"
29646,Yo!
29647,"Mediocre to bad. Horrible UI and Graphics. Game feels also really weird (like not being able to scroll the map and being stuck to this view, like a browsergame). 
Very similar to AutoChess. Way more confusing. feels more streamlined and kinda dumbed down. better item system.

Artifact 2.0
Not recommended."
29648,"It's good but tutorial can be improved for new autochess players. It's in beta so i assume it will improve visually (cosmetics?).  I hope rank is improved and reflects the very best players, right now it seems everyone can make it to boss rank. Also improving rank mode hopefully cuts down on people quitting. 

Some info on keywords  for new players, Someone can correct me if i'm wrong:  DISARM= melee heros can't attack,but can cast spells. SILENCE= the enemy hero cannot use his special ability. STUN= a stun unit cannot attack,use abilities,move, or use items. MANA (blue bar under health bar) is increased by attacking and receiving damage, must be filled to use special ability (and not stun)"
29649,"Really good game, brings an interesting concept to a new gaming genre."
29650,"The game isn't as RNG as people claim, but it also isn't as ""strategy decision making"" as Valve wants to make it seem.
It floats in-between, there certainly is an importance in making the right decisions in what to sell, upgrade, keep, etc.
Even just using the fact everything sells at the same price as you buy it should eventually give you the hint that it helps to kinda keep your hand full.
Also deciding to buy more levels (or rather: hero board slots) can turn the tide when you got a proper set-up and find that 1 perfect addition but you're still only halfway to 8 or 9.
I seem to mostly get into top 2 and 3 because I've kinda figured out the ""tricks"", but these tricks (and perhaps what would be considered ""skill"" and ""smart decision making"") unfortunately can often still have you kicked in the nuts by the RNG.
I've had a moment where I was winning hard, 9/9 on the board, 3 full synergies, winning all battles with max 1 of my units dying and suddenly I'm stuck with literally 3 tier 2s that needed 1 more tier 1 to be upgraded and going through 5+ rounds and dozens of rerolls it simply never came up and boom it turned around swiftly.

I think they need to figure out a way to add more of an algorithm that makes it actually possible to make decisions based on knowing the pattern rather than depending on that 1 lucky draw that might come next roll or simply never come at all.

I wish I could score this Neutral.
I have a very bipolar love/hate relationship with this game.

It's not bad, but it really needs an algorithm or pattern of some kind that would integrate more of a real sense of decision making."
29651,i can't stop playing
29652,"This will be good when the AI isn't more retarded than a monkey with downs.

EDIT: Now it is rampant with hackers.  At least 4 matches someone had a gyrocopter or enigma around round 4-5, people with 3 star units by round 8-10.  This needs to be fixed."
29653,"Simply amazing. Free, Fun, and Cross-Platform! Love playing it on iOS and my Desktop! Seriously I'd recommend at least giving it a try, it's free!"
29654,this shit the most addictive shit man i swear i left conk for this
29655,Good starting point.
29656,"Bisshh this game is da boooombbbb!! 

I spent a whole day playing it and I couldn't get enough!!

DON'T LISTEN TO REVIEWS THAT ONLY HAD 1 - 3 HOURS OF GAME-TIME SPENT ON THE GAME. 

RNG IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNFORGIVING. BUT DOTO UNDERLORDS COMPENSATE BY GIVING YOU A LOT OF OPTIONS. 

Every turn, you get a fresh pool of heroes to choose from. 

THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOLD MANAGEMENT - IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY, JUST BE RICH AND FORCE YOUR LUCK BY HAVING LOTS OF GOLD TO SPEND.

I could go on but ffuuuuuuuu this game is gooooodd!! 

GOD BLESS VALVE"
29657,It's a fun game. Addictive. First game in a while I found myself playing 2 hours after I typically would of gone to bed. I like the combination of luck and strategy.
29658,"The RNG from this game is friggin stupid. Why the F&$% on a 4 players game this damm RNG will let you fight the same player 5 consecutive times? Even on gamblim games it have a logical backgorund on it, here it just don't!!!!"
29659,FULL OF RNG. SOOO BAD. EVEN PLAYING YUGIOH IS BETTER
29660,Love this game
29661,"i think this game is better version of auto chess 

- smoother gameplay
- better graphic than auto chess mobile
- more balance?
- cross platform? coz you can reconnect with your mobile version

GJ valve"
29662,"STRATEGIZE TO WIN
Recruit heroes and upgrade them into a more powerful version of themselves.......

Get ready to face opponents with tier 2 and 3 sets of dudes while you have nothing because nothing ever shows in the offer pool, and you can't afford rerolls because you are punished for losing. If you like a game where half of your opponents disconnect in search of better RNG, this may be the game for you. It's beta, I get it, but as it  is right now its trash."
29663,"Pssst.


Yo!"
29664,"This is the most boring shit that I've ever played.  Just look at how many brain dead people are enjoying this garbage. Valve didn't even make this, it's just a pure rip-off from a 3rd party mod.  Unreal how bad Valve is at making games.  Fucking garbage."
29665,YO.
29666,"Well,Game is still in beta, keep in mind that,It has been released some days ago 

Its a great Game,first time i play an autochess and well ,its pretty good,great game ,i still have to get used to It,i couldnt win bots on tutorial (which is kinda long,but you can quit It if you want v:) ,im noob i know ,like in dota 2 :/
Just make matches faster and more short,oh and if you could put voice chat and written chat ,that d be even better 

For now i see the main menu (looks like panorama) kinda empty but i Guess its becuase its a beta

I Guess if you like chess ,you gonna like this 
Idk why this Game reminded me the card jitsu snow Game that club penguin had (rip CP but now club penguin online is there so :D) 

This Game is called ""dota"" but its not related to dota 2 ,It only has its characters,its a mod that becomes an independient Game (same happened to cs 20 years ago v:)

Its a Game that you potato can run too and you can 800*600 resolution (thx for that valve :))

Recommendations for ppl: 
-Use -novid and +fps_max 0 on Launch options  (i think console doesnt exist on source 2,idk if im wrong)
-Listen music while playing this,not saying the Game soundtrack is bad though

I think i have nothing more to say,just great job valve,keep It in that way

Oh well yeah,i think i have something more to say

29667,Pretty fun unless you play assassins/hunter meta
29668,"Terrible game, I don't understand the hype for these kinds of games where you barely do anything and the game just plays itself..
No skill involved, it's basically letting 2 CPU's play against eachother and the RNG gods decide which CPU wins."
29669,"So I've actually only been playing the custom game mode: Dota Auto Chess and not actually the moba. Anyhow DAC is one of the funnier games that I've enjoyed recently on steam. These past maybe 2 months I've gained about 150 hrs while enjoying myself playing alone or as a party of two to three.

The game is based of chess with Dota characters that can move and act as they try to kill the opponents characters. There are 8 persons in a game and you face of against one person(courier) at the time.

The game mode has its economy and I presume it's using items that you can get in the game as well as the trait combos that you get when you have often 2 or more of a sort of species or ""profession"".

As a conclusion I'd truly recommend downloading Underloards instead of the normal game, Dota 2. Auto Chess in Dota 2 compared to Underloards is very different. Underloards just feel more real and smooth AND less f****** RNG!
"
29670,"I feel like this game is missing things like a chat, also seperate servers would be nice so we don't play with mobile people, and another nice thing would be to play against English speaking people, not Chinese in every single game. This game needs a lot of work. The graphics make me thing this game is from 2009, with no 3D camera angles. But what can I expect from a fully free game I guess."
29671,"Never Played The Dota 2 Auto Chess mod..

Tried this game.. 

Its a really good game..

Sadly NOT as good as ARTIFACT!!! (That game needs players) since this game is SUPER RNG... everything is RNG!!"

I have barely any knowledge on dota 2 but you dont need any to play this game. The tutorial is kinda lacking, but give it about an hour and you'll pretty much get the gist.

Great Mechanism of renewing Autochess.  Good for Valve.

29695,"Mixed bag. The tutorial is non-existent so you'll need to Youtube to work out how to play.

Two main criticisms: First is that the snowball effect pretty much because absurd after the first 10 rounds or so. If you get left behind at this point it's pretty much a quit out. Secondly, for an auto-battler where you do spend a lot of time doing nothing but watching the games are VERY long if you're playing later rounds, match lengths are waaaaay too long."
29696,"Fun to experiment different builds and sinergies by myself. Fun to play with a friend as duos. Don't take it too seriously though, if you get 10 bad rolls in row, it can still be fun if you're not taking it personally. RNG is very integrated into this game so yeah.

And also, Valve seem to have abandoned this game. Shame."
29697,"This is my first taste of an autochess game. Wow. What an addictive genre! Even in the beta stage, this game is phenomenal while still showing it's potential for growth. I will say, the experience right now is pretty barebones, but that barebone experience is engaging and fun. It is the kind of game that you start and then magically timehop 30 minutes into the future as you have become engrossed in the gameplay until the match ends.

Cross play between pc and mobile means that I can play when I'm at my pc at home, or play a bot match throughout the day when I have downtime at work."
29698,"It's clearly designed for mobile which is why it has 2 major flaws in design:

It's great for short breaks for 20-45 min, at the same time you can sink few hours per sitting. Some synergies feel overpowered (droids, i am looking at you), but i am sure it will get more polished with the time, it is still in beta after all. As ""DOTA hater"" i really recommend that one."
29700,"[h1] DotA Underlords? more like DotA Underwhelm[/h1]

So, let's review the new autobattler by Valve, inspired by the overwhelmingly popular mod for their flagship title DotA2. Tl;dr at the end.

[b]The Good[/b]

- Matchmaking is quick to get you into a game.
- Game interface is minimalistic and tidy.
- Better tracking of active synergies.
- It is smoother to move your characters around the bench and the board.
- Graphs for enemy damage done.
- Your income and it's sources are clearly displayed.
- Damage dealt and received is clearly displayed.
- AoE skill's range are very clearly defined on the ground.
- Ranged characters have their range displayed.
- Characters on the bench call out to you when you have free character slots on the board.
- Health damage received is very clearly defined, you always know what source did how much damage to you.
- You can move the items from character to character.

[b]The Bad[/b]

- The visuals of the characters are much worse than on the DotA2 client, I get why as this is also on mobile but PC players should have better visuals.
- The gameplay feels much slower than on the original autochess mod.
- Character interactions are minimal, there's no buying/upgrading/victory quip.
- Certain characters don't change visuals once they upgrade, the model just gets bigger.
- The ones that do have a different model are, sadly, very bland looking
- Your damage done, items and active synergies are displayed on different tabs, it's somewhat counter intuitive.
- Questionable design choices, why have the gold interest be calculated before the combat starts? In DotA2 Autochess you could do some pretty good strategizing around the gold you win per round and the interest, here you spend the fight looking for characters in the later stages of the game missing vital information on why you are winning or losing.
- No warning for round 15.
- Leavers, lots of them.


[b]The Meh[/b]

- Newly added characters aren't interesting, Sand King is essentially a better Morphling, Warlock synergizes with Ogre Magi in what can only be described as the strangest synergy ever, Slark is also strange and doesn't bring anything different to the assassin roster, Bloodseeker is interesting in design, the execution isn't quite there.
- The missing characters from DotA2 Autochess feel much more balanced and have a clear use within the roster. They don't feel like straight upgrades and fill voids in certain classes/races beyond just being an extra character for the class/race bonus.
- The class/race auras are a nice touch, they do need work though as they are, in some cases way too strong or way too weak
- Your characters can only hold one item, preventing characters from becoming completely immortal juggernauts of death and destruction. But that was also quite a rare achievement in DotA2 Autochess and when pulled off, felt really good.
- The rate at which you get good or even broken weapons and auras is just too great. It is fun to have a refresher Tidehunter, but having one almost every match gives the feeling that it's a necessity to have one rather than a choice.
- Combat feels much less visceral, many of the effects are simplified for mobile users making the fights look bland and slow.
- The many tabs for items and damage meters are annoying, it could all be shown on the screen.

[b]The Tinfoil[/b]

- I have a sneaky feeling like this game is gonna get monetized in the way of skins and audio lines for the characters which is why many characters don't have upgrade skins and the ones that do have some really bland looking ones.


[b]The Verdict[/b]

I cannot recommend the game as it is considering the original mod is also free. Granted this plays smoother and the matchmaking is more stable and faster, but the original also had rankings, cosmetics that you could get for free, better visuals and audio feedback and felt like a more rewarding experience through it's mechanics. As I play Underlords, I just feel bored whereas DotA2 Autochess felt exciting even when I lost.
Riot's TFT also feels like a straight up better game than this with better ideas and revised mechanics as they had to build the items and champions from scratch.
There's a reason why the mod developers didn't stick with Valve. It feels like this was slapped together in a rush, I feel bad for the Artifact crowd and the guys who worked on that game.

Tl;dr Underlords lacks both the heart and soul of DotA2 Autochess, it's a watered down version meant for the mobile crowd.  There's no reason to play this over the original except if you really don't want to install DotA2, want a smoother matchmaking or want to play this on your mobile device."
29701,"What is this? Almost none of the major bugs from the first release of beta haven't been fixed, UI features lost in UI update haven't been implemented back, font size and FPS issues remain, with constant buggy menu interactions and random crashes.

What is the hurry in developing this game? Fix the bugs, add the important features and remove the spaghetti code for Linux versions. Release when the game is in a playable state.

I cannot review this game at all. It feels like it's still in Early Access for the developers. After the month of bugfixing they have to do in order to release what everyone else would call a finished product, I might be able to review the content of the game.

"
29702,"Great game from Valve but I think they should also make moba game base on this, that will be cool."
29703,good for killing time
29704,"[h1]It's heartbreaking to see Valve focusing on new game while giving less and less support to their other games that people paid for. IMHO they should take care of games like Dota or Artifact and then think if it's a good idea to do something else.[/h1]

Overall the game is boring and matches are way too long. Too many things seem random, and average time you have to spend on single match is about 40 minutes. I don't get how games that long would fit into mobile."
29705,I hope they add other player's boards to the game
29706,"I was sceptical about Dota Underlords when I first saw leaked gameplay video, but I'm surprised by the quality and progress of Underlords' developers. Being based on the original Dota 2 Auto Chess custom game, Dota Underlords has a number of improvements which make the experience much better:

[list]
    [*] Despite having a powerful PC, I was experiencing performance issues in the original custom game. Dota Underlords does not have such issues and I also didn't experience any bugs yet. 
    [*] Item system improvements: each unit can only have one item and items are chosen among 3 (or 4 if the improvement is in inventory). This significantly reduces the random factor in the game, this factor was often the cause of huge imbalance in the original custom game.
    [*] Frequently pushing updates and improvements (gameplay, UI, etc).
    [*] The game has both mobile and PC interfaces. Reportedly, players from different types of devices could be matched against each other. I'm not playing on mobile myself, but I can totally see the advantages of having mobile version for the sake of popularity.
[/list]

The last one is a huge factor: if the team manages to keep up the good work they are doing right now, I can totally see this game being very successful. There are several improvements I am personally looking forward to:

[list]
    [*] Less random while getting opponents within the game: the game can match 
    [*] Good ranking system - I'm not sure how current ranks work, but I don't think players from the same skill level are matched against each other properly right now. The same problem was present in Dota Auto Chess and there were different sites offering a functionality of creating lobbies for players of the same skill level. Having this functionality built-in makes sense for Dota Underlords.
    [*] In-game tournaments would be fun.
    [*] Upgraded unit cosmetics: Currently, the upgraded units are the same regardless of their level which makes it hard to distinguish between them. Valve is reportedly in contact with the original Dota 2 content creators in order to push this visual improvement into Dota Underlords, which sounds great.
    [*] Game time adjustments: Sometimes, the game is too long and it gets boring and sometimes it feels very short. I'm not sure what would be the best strategy for average game time adjustments, but I'd be happy if there were more rounds (or any kind of decisions in general, because decisions affect skill/luck ratio and increase complexity) in less time.
    [*] New units, synergies, other complexity additions: There are plenty of ideas on Underlords Reddit such as [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/underlords/comments/c4xucx/an_alternative_to_the_stale_and_static_pve_rounds/]adding alternative ""paths"" for PvE rounds[/url] which would surely increase the complexity and let players have even more fun.
[/list]

There are also several competitors such as (already mentioned) original Dota 2 Auto Chess by Drodo, LoL's Teamfight Tactics and the upcoming Drodo's Auto Chess in Epic Store. So far, I think Dota Underlords has advantages over each of these games and I'd be very pleased to see it becoming even better due to the competition."
29707,"Complete joke, another RNG rage inducing game, if you havent got born lucky dont play this stuff, 5 games each time someone has to get to 3 starts with Tiny, Tusk, or Clockwerk and simply stop taking damage. If this game wont resolve the RNG card pick asap it will simply die, or they will promote it so much it will be played only on a mainstream lvl."

RNG hates me!

Been Fun with combining teams, not so fun when u get 0 stuff for 5 rounds in a row, and you lose your momentum. But its also is so damn rewarding when ur on a loosingstreak to get good stuff 2-3 times rounds in a row and bounce back. 

You will see one guy at the top the whole game who is unstoppable and rest of the 9 of you fight for the second spot, that's where we are atm."

Graphics shit.

I srsly believe its the worst balanced game i played so far"
29722,"Probably the best of the ""auto-battler"" genre, games still in early beta. I look forward to what they bring out and how they differentiate from others in the genre.
People complaining about RNG are bad at the game"
29723,"As I prefer to play most of the games solo, I don't have to relay on raging, flaming and feeding Russian kids on my team in regular Dota 2 matches. What I enjoy most about this game  - 1) easy to learn, but hard to master, 2) addictive and fun, 3) doesn't look like it will have the same fate as Artifact, everything is free, 4) promised future updates by developers that will bring in even more  great ideas. Final verdict - 10/10"
29724,fuck this game
29725,"Good concept, would be nice if the game showed you how to upgrade troops in the tutorial rather than throwing you into the tutorial against fully upgraded troops"
29726,10/10 would lose from neutral creeps again and again.
29727,"The alliance system is a good concept (meeting thresholds of specific hero types gives small but noticeable bonuses), but it means that if you want to be successful, memorising the roster of heroes and their alliances is critical.
Heroes are seemingly arbitrarily assigned to ""tiers"" which sometimes means higher-tier heroes aren't worth it due to their higher cost and low potency. The worst part of hero tiers, however, is that throughout the game you will have to sell weaker heroes to buy more powerful ones, from a randomised shop, without tooltips which tell you any meaningful thing about said heroes until you've already purchased them, position them on the battlefield _and_ reassign items, all on a time limit.
Further to this, you have no control over any of the heroes' AI, nor any indication of the way they will fight. Some heroes will teleport to the furthest enemy from the centre at the beginning of a fight, while others will just attack the closest enemy.
On top of all of this, the game suffers from frequent GUI issues: the scant few tooltips there are often appear underneath mostly-opaque pop-ups windows, making both the tooltip and the window unreadable, while some buttons are unclickable due to being covered by the previous window you were interacting with.
Finally, the tutorial is ineffective. Most of my ability to understand this game comes from having previously played Dota 2, and a couple of paragraphs on general gameplay tips in-game.

While this game could be treated as a puzzle, it just comes across as both hectic and pointless, and means that if you want to be a good player, you have to be a fast thinker and clicker, have a good memory and enjoy making timed, probability-based calculations. This isn't ""skill"" so much as learning the best winning formula, and is hampered further by Valve releasing it so early."
29728,"I really REALLY wanted to like this game and gave it a good amount of tries, but I just couldn't muster up any joy for it. Between Underlords, Teamfight Tactics, Autochess Origins, the Autochess Mod, this game is probably the most lackluster out of the four. If you've never played an autochess game, I guess it's fine, but if you've at least played the mod on Dota 2, you'll feel that there's just something lacking to this game. As the game stands currently, your patience and decision making will feel more rewarded in TFT or Autochess Origins."
29729,"Autochess 2: A Story of Theft and Greed. 

Valve dev 1 and Valve dev 2 enter stage left.

VD1: This Autochess game sure is fun! Given its popularity, this is a genre we should totally expand into. 

VD2: You are so right! but we should be careful not to repeat the mistakes of our last game Artifact. That game wasn't mobile compatible, nor was it good to watch on stream.

VD1: That's a really great point. We should pander to the streaming market, and to casual gamers. I hear twitch chat loves copy pasta, so we should just copy pasta someone else's game and call it ours. As for the filthy casuals, we will capture their fleeting attention by massively upping the drop rate of all those busted items pro players wanted nerfed. 

VD2: The hivemind will love that! You would think that with all our resources we would actually disguise the fact that this is a cash grab designed to exploit vulnerable people with addictive personalities. But, I'm a merciless profiteer who got promoted over people who actually cared about gaming because I know how to increase revenue. 

VD1: But its missing something... Something that gives it that valve polish.

VD2: What are you thinking?

VD1: Well you see, and I'm just spitballing here, but say for example the unit Axe. It doesn't really make sense to me that he is referred to as an orc. I think we should call him 'Brawny', that way you will never get confused about what group he belongs to. You will see the word Brawny and you will immediately think of Axe's chiseled red body. 

VD2: You're a genius!!1! Long live Gaben!

VD1: Long may he reign!

29730,"i recommend this game for afew reasons, its easy to play but hard to master, the graphics are nice and clean, its a fun game that will keep you entertained for many hours. however, 
i do hope the game grows alot more, via the route of competative gameplay/ranked modes being more serious, simple account customisation options and stat pages for your played games, aswell as maybe afew different gameboards to play on. these things are just bonus ideas that wont ruin your time with this game at all.

9/10

*edit, id also like to see custom matches like 1v1 with friends or shorter games versing 2 others (i dont have friends to try this with so it might already be in game, but i havent seen it)"
29731,with more heroes it would be ever better!! nice job!
29732,"Fuck Logic , Fuck RNG , Can't play anything like Auto Chess"
29733,VERY cool game

Great to play casually on mobile and then also on PC a bit more hardcore when you can pay attention to what other people are picking and maybe block/counterpick.

It is missing a lot of obvious design depth right now, which I hope to see change with the already announced updates.

Here is also hoping that the battle pass will be a fair monetization model.

Overall really enjoyable so far, can't wait to see what seasons and future updates bring."
29735,its not the league version

29737,Pretty Good game. yea
29738,is good
29739,"EDIT: This game WAS awesome at first, I was one of the few fools who paid money to play this when it first launched. Nathan Kell and the people who made this (I feel)  starting to ignore their player base and with each update the game became less and less playable for us. It was a good thing that they were handed and they ruined it (in my opinion). Be saddened by this games downfall but let it be a lesson to any developers who want to simply ignore the will of the gamers and exclusively pander to the casual and mobile player. These guys made their money so I'm sure they are happy but yeah I no longer recommend this. The only thing that would make me come back to the game after all this time is if they added a mode that reverted the game back to before all the stupid updates destroyed it."
29740,"Having never played dota chess but dota and dota 2 moba's this game brings nostalgia, and rng fun. It is frustrating when you can't get your build together but just as fun when you manage to scrape out wins and crazy combinations.

The matches are kinda long... You can play it on mobile, but don't expect to play it everytime you get a short break, because your break will end and you'll be at the middle of the game."

"
29774,"I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom.  The Tier three assassins always arrive too early.  My pairings are elusive.  Yet I keep playing Dota Underlords.  It's that good.  Apologies to Poe."
29775,"This game is pretty fun and also have good graphic!!! But i think it should have combining 
items mechanism..."
29776,"Very fun!!, One one of the best games I've played in a while <3"
29777,"tl;dr Quite an underwhelming mod that needs more player input to influence a match.

Why? With Underlords - and the autochess mod - there is a lack of weight. Weight of my decisions i can make at any moment. Weight of the content available to explore. Weight of the consequences of winning - or losing - match. So yes, the RNG is a problem, but its not having RNG in the game - it's the fact that the RNG's impact outweighs player decision making in too many cases. This is a slow to start turn based game, meaning that a stomp will take a good 45 minutes of your time.

In this game, you have four things you can do on any given turn: buy units, sell units, level up, and save gold for interest. There is also a bit of micromanagement with unit placement, but it really just comes down to putting your meatshields towards the front and keeping KotL and CM safe from harm. Mind that this storefront (within the match) feels more like opening Pokemon card packs rather than giving me interesting chess pieces.

""Oh no, I needed a third blue lizard to get a bigger blue lizard but all I got was a red cat. Guess I gotta practice more to climb in MMR.""

Is there something salvagable here? If the game was treated as a TGC with a board that looks like Stratego, then yes. Deckbuilding, a player-input, normally counterbalances the randomness of drawing shuffled cards in a match of Magic or YuGiOh. And in a match of poker, psycological manipulation and bluffing, a player input, can lead to experienced players maintaining a high winrate even with bad cards. In Underlords, there are not enough player inputs with that match defining impact that can win games, even from dire situations. Every mindsport has these kinds of weapons and tools available to players, tools that they can use to win. What is in the toolbox of an Underlords player?

Being less of a game, this is more something I'd like to play on my phone while waiting for the bus. Something just to numb the nerves and give my eyes something colorful to look at. But, the long match time and the inevitable grinding that is to come discourages this approach to Underlords. I expect this game to be laid to waste in two years time.

29780,Alot of problems with the graphics  very glitchy graphics teh tutorial is awful.  otherwise good pass time
29781,Worst auto chess on the market rn. Play Auto Chess mobile on phone o bluestacks or wait to TeamFightTactics
29782,Addictive game. Very well balanced and polished so early in development.
29783,Auto Chess mod is better but until TFT is more accessible this is it.
29784,This game is fun and addicting! I love how smooth everything is and how is it is to play. Yes this game has a lot of RNG but thats what makes it fun you never know what you will get or build until later on. I lost like 8 rounds in a row and won a game with 7 health left. Its a fluid game where you can't just have a build in mind and keep doing it over and over again. Yes some things could be balanced out like KOTL being very op with mage build but can also be countered by an assassin or anti magic build. Please REMEMBER THIS GAME IS OPEN BETA AND WILL HAVE CHANGES MADE AFTER FEEDBACK.

29786,"Before, I prefered play Dota AutoChess even though I couldn't up my rank of knight. When I heard about the new game from Valve (Dota Underlords) I said: ""I'll give a try"", so I started to play it and I can say this game is amazing, I like the musica and interfaz."
29787,"RNG is crazy
no skill or strategy, just luck"
29788,"the game is great, it's fairly balanced in most areas for an RNG type game, no pay to win and no chat to avoid any toxic players.
only thing bad about this game from what I can tell is the tutorial due to not being informative enough
and a very minor issue such as not enough characters to keep the game more random."
29789,"This game is NUTS!

edit: This game is DEAD"

29791,"I didn't think I would like this autochess fad as I don't care about Dota or League of Legends, nor did I play the original autochess mod, but it's surprisingly really good. 

Basically, it's an indirect tactics game. Think something like how units are controlled in Dungeon Keeper mixed with Blood Bowl but done in the way of a Magic the Gathering draft maybe? Hard to nail down. You control your units' positions, level upgrades, and the items you put on them, but you don't control them directly in battle. Each unit has two alliances, and certain numbers of unique units in those alliances give you alliance buffs. But, all players in the match (eight total) select from a shared pool of shared units. This makes you keep an eye out for what other players are drafiting and forcing you to be flexible early on. Good mix of RNG and strategy in planning your setup, and enough to keep you coming back for one more game."

29798,"Having a blast so far, can't wait for new features to come out!!"
29799,"I never played autochess but I had heard about it, decided to try this out and I am very addicted. plus it's free. I've been mostly playing against bots so I can take my time learning the heroes and mechanics, but online is good too."
