My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

If you LOVE Smash then you will probably like this. And since its free, go ahead and give it a try. Unless you somehow don't have 800 mb of storage..."

I have a green connection, in the most populous region and lose games specifically because shitty connections.

175,"Arkadaşlar... İlk önce ben şansılalrdan biriyim. Çünkü artık son limitlerimi erken yaşadım.

[h1]HIKAYEM[/h1]

[b]Oyuna başlama hikayem[/b]

Oyuna başlayan kişilerin genel olarak %4-50'si gibi, bilgisayarımın kötü olmasından başladım. Oyunu ilk olarak benden çok çok daha iyi oynayan bir arkadaşım önerdi. İlk başlarda hiç beğenmemiştim ve geçmiştim. 

Tabii yıl geçtikçe bilgisayarım oyunlara yetmemeye başladı. Bende Brawlhall oyunun indirdim ve başladım.

[b]Gelişme[/b]

5 Gün içinde bütün maçlarda iyi işler çıkarmaya başladım. Adamları tekliyordum. Main olarak hattori ve rayman ortak kullanıyordum (kusura bakamyın), yani oyundaki en toxic karakterlerden birilerini kullanıyordum. Ama oyunu öğrendiğim 5 gün içinde bunlardan biri olmayacağıma kesinlikle söz verdim. Gelişme kısmında genel olarak hattori kullanıyordum. İlk başlarda rayman kullansamda birden kötüleşmeye başladım.

[b]Sonuç[/b]

2 gün önce oyunun asıl kısımlarına gelmeye başladım. Artık spamcılar GG spamlarken, yetersiz karşılaştırma sistemi yüzünden çok alakasız kişiler ile oynamaya başladım. Bunla beraber bayağı Puan kaybettim. En sonunda ise önüme çok fazla spammer çıkmaya başladı.

[b][u]Özel not[/u][/b]

Bu oyunu oynamayın. Ben şanslıydım, içine düştüğüm olayı hızlı kavradım. Eğer başaramasydım aile ve sosyal açıdan problemler yaşayacağım belli idi. 
Bunla beraber brawlhalla serüveninden itibaren ağızımdan geçmiş tüm anne ve babalara özürümü iletiyorum."

222,"A game that I loved at the start of 2018 but has subsequently turned into utter disappointment When you achieve the diamond rank in the ranking system, there is nothing left to accomplish. When you play for just one year, it's simple to collect all the accessories and colors. Some of them are unattainable, but if you reach the top or even the desired rank, the game becomes monotonous and lifeless. This game gives you some time till you get too good for everyone else for any competitive player who wants to play for enjoyment and not for money. Placing higher doesn't have any cool or prestigious benefits above being included on the leaderboard. Shame."

I have witnessed the bottom of the barrel for the human psyche, and my self esteem was hugely improved. If even Brawlhalla players can find the will and confidence to live bravely in this world, I should stand to think higher about myself too."

232,wtf is this its awful
233,The game is really good while playing with friends.
234,Good game
235,Brawlhalla is a really bad game that has so much delay it's crazy. You will never have no delay whatever you do you just have to live with the fact that you can't time your attacks or do a perfect combo

282,"The only players who can have fun in this game are the pro's/above average player's. That's because in low ranks, you can play the meta (lance), and it's hard to lose. Also hitboxes don't work great and people can just spam their heavy attacks..."
283,"I wish I could give this game a good review overall but honestly, I can't. The only way I can is if you're playing casually, with friends, or just for fun. When you wanna get better, play harder and stronger, I can't personally recommend Brawl.
I float around plat, but lately, the game has been incredibly laggy. Frame drops, stuttering, input delay - a ton of things are making the game just generally unplayable. I'm losing easy games because my input is being stopped entirely, not even delayed anymore. I can't move at all or attack - I can't fastfall either when it cuts me out; even if I'm mashing the keys like crazy, I still have no options. 
If there was a fix that could be suggested to help with this, I've probably tried it. I've changed launch options numerous times to numerous different things, I've reinstalled the game, I've checked file integrity, I've manually purged the files, I've checked for malware, I've changed which monitor I play on, I've capped and uncapped my framerate, absolutely nothing changes. I pretty much only play this game to play with friends who occasionally experience the same issues for content. 
Just to add, I play on a high end setup, so all of the issues presented are breaking the game and I can't figure it out. It's the only game I have ever played that has any frame issues. Not even high intensity, particle heavy games with massive lobbies give me these sorts of issues. 
But otherwise, if you're just playing for fun, I do highly recommend the game. It's incredibly entertaining; playing with friends can make it 100* better as well."
284,"The game is alright in other words its mid but if you are an african player do not play the game because there will be no server that will give u low ping especially if you plan on playing competitive you will have a major disadvantage that is ur ping thus increasing ur delay and being hard to play against low ping players as the game does not have african servers, but other than that the game is mid. Do not recommend"
285,nothing
286,it's ok I guess
287,this shit is ass
288,Nice game
289,funny gold rank
290,Better then multiverses by a mile

316,"Recommended.

- High frame rate/Uncapped FPS support
- High resolution support
- Good netcode/crossplay

Solid showing for a smash clone game. 

The uncapped frame rates with the lower input lag and smoother image quality make this game much more pleasant to enjoy :)"
317,It's aight.
318,WAY TOO ADDICTING
319,This is the worst game I've ever played
320,it's a fun game that you cann mess around with your friends cross-platform
321,it  is a basic game and easy to learn
322,good for brawlling. not good for hallaring and friendship
323,this game makes me want to kill myself
324,Shit game

328,poggers
329,This Game is a Salt mine Play at your own risk and enjoy
330,Pretty fun once youlearn some basic moves and combos. I play cutome with my friends. I like how the games are short so if I have time I can sneak a ranked game in. Its not my main game but is a side game to play with friends for fun!
331,GOOD GAME  WITH THE GOOD MUSIC AND THE GOOD LORE
332,where allah (Balwrallah wtf?????!!?1!?)
333,"just a pretty meh game.
theres not a lot to say about it.
really bad at holding my interest.
maybe its just not my type of game."
334,dogshit game. shitty log. no precision at all. garbage. ruins ur fucking life.
335,This game is terrible straight trash dont play you wont get good just stop. Great sword has destroyed this game over the game

340,black people are in the game
341,"very smuf
"
342, good game with friends i would say that if i had any
343,"This game is great and is very highly skilled to play but in my opinion the gloves are a bit broken at the moment espcially the side light and down light as they do so much punishable damage to players and all i see in ranked are petras or mordex who are extremely broken at the moment,other than this the game is great just think they should take care of it more"
344,baD
345,muito sexo e putaria em 2d
346,sddd
347,"Game used to be fun and now it isnt, full of braindead spammers who get rewarded for it because the game doesn't have any counter measures to prevent people from spamming. You could be having the best game and then your opponent (who is likely 8 years old and is playing on xbox) will begin to spam and you will lose as a result. The game isnt fun anymore, updates are boring, battle pass skins are bad, player base is dying and is full of cringe, toxic little kids who will invite you to their lobby after they lose and attempt to pull you into discord.

Bad game, ruins your mental, dont play it."
348,Very fun
349,.
350,after playing it with my friends i literally shit myself.
351,asd
352,walmart smash lol
353,yes
354,"game is fun, i like it. i hope cross progression between platforms happens someday"
355,Yes get this game now its one of the bestest games I've ever played Brawlhalla>Multiversus
356,we love the sycth 1 shots
357,Waaaaaay too sweaty. You will get dunked on for the first 5 to maybe 10 hours of playing and even after that you might just encounter some no life like me that will ruin your day. Keep trying. Just know when to put the controller/keyboard away and take a break. I'm sure something like a level capped casual matchmaking where you can only fight with people that are level 1-5 or something like that would be a great introduction. Something like how siege has newcomer matchmaking. Of course it will have smurfs in there but it would be a great addition for those who are trying to get the hang of the game.
358,pls dont play this alot..not for me but for yourself
359,a very good game
360,this game FULL OF TOXIC COMMUNITY and the hit box seemsly annoying. im done here
361,I didn't know I'm going to hate the game this much when I installed it.
362,"im in eternal hell,may god save me."
363,this game is absolutely cheeks.
364,"SSB knockoff, but it has it's times where it's funny.

I still have destroyed countless houses after raging in this game and i will do it again"
365,its funny to play
366,This game's community is a single tier lower in toxicity then league. Fuck every single person in this game
367,.
368,fuck you trash game
369,horrible
370,"worst game ever fr, game itself is unbalanced also it seem like devs are hungry for money rather than trying to improve game. there are things than needs to be fixed like drops and some moves but yea they dont give a fuck, they are just gonna add some crossovers."
371,Great friendship ruining game.
372,"i just like the game lol
"
373,"This game is good and all BUT the servers are dead here for like 1.5 months bruv, can't even play online."

382,People keep spot dodging on me 10/10
383,Just go play Multiversus its the better game. All other opinions are wrong. I would rather slam my balls in a waffle iron over and over than play this game. Like this game is so Dog water. There are 100 other better free games that arent clown shows like this game. Its a  burning dumpster fire
384,good.
385,I keep getting crapped on nonstop by hammer spammers
386,Nice game to play for a while when you need a break from other things. It is also like a super smash bros for the computer that you can play with others for free
387,gugrl
388,THIS GAME IS REALLY NICE
389,bad gane
390,sooooooo gooood sooooooo fuuuuun
391,"if u want to lose all your savings in skins get brawlhalla, bonus, it will also destroy your mental health"
392,"If you're looking for a game similar to Smash that 1.) is on PC, 2.) is visually clearer, 3.) has a good competitive scene, 4.) has good devs, 5.) is somewhat balanced and 6.) has zero input lag unless you're running on a potato from 1990, then this game is for you.

Just give it a try (if you like these types pf games) - it's for free, after all.

Be warned though, you'll either ragequit and never play it again because some random smurf 3-0'd you whilst dancing and using you as a prop or end up playing it in every free minute of your life since matches are so short."

458,They wrote the inputs with if and else so you cannot properly actuate the inputs. Go play multiversus instead of this poorly made crap.
459,"I do recommend this game, If you just don't want to play ranked or casual. They fucking suck, I only use this to challenge friends to decide what we are doing. No point trying anything else, There is barely new players and everyone sweats their ass off with combo's"

559,"I have a lot to say about this game but I'm going to keep it short.

It is fun yes, but it awakens some deep anger within me that no other game has managed to ever do, I tried revisiting it for the first time in a year today (the 3rd time this has happened), and I remembered why I put it down.

I know I have a lot of hours on the game but I wouldn't recommend anyone play the online part, just sticking to local co-op or a bunch of people over a discord call doesn't urk me, but there's just something about playing online which makes me feel like such an aggressive person."
560,i wish I could have big lizard beat me up that would be so hot
561,"spaming keys,rage and 100% reason to Alt+F4 the game."

571,"This witty 'smash bros - like' game will make you want to punch, kick, and scream your head off. Equally fun as it is utterly frustrating. For a free game, you certainly cant go wrong. Stop reading the reviews and take the 30 seconds to download this free, fantastically irritating game."

584,yip yip
585,good
586,"EXCEPT bitch ass motherfucking tryhards,
the game is good... :) 🤡🤡"
587,"As a player who has +1000 hours of experience and has been hard-stuck in gold and quite frankly, satisfied with that. This game no longer has any fun qualities to offer. The player-base/community in general have all together deteriorated in skill and ability to close distance between their enemies. I loathe the ideal of loving the game, but hating the game because of the player-base. In every mode it's just spam, spam, spammy, spam and passive play which drags any game longer than it should be. As an aggressive player, I know the difference between playing parry and passive play, although it feels the same, the distinct difference between getting punished because you made an honest mistake is one thing, but it's another If my opponent runs away and comes back with a signature. Adding insult to injury, nobody plays with skill anymore, no matter what you're playing: FFA, motherfuckers just wake up and chose spamming.  Strikeout 1v1: Ocasional good player, mainly spamming pussies who can't learn strings.  Friendly 2v2's: Mostly full of ACTUAL good players, but very toxic and pieces of shit for no reason, I get it's a fighting game, but I'd like to not want to kill someone or myself after every game I lose. Experimental: GOOD PLAYERS ONLY (Platinum and Diamonds) Really with I didn't have to learn that the hard way. Ranked 1v1: Once you get gold, you ain't going nowhere because of all the Lance spammers and general spammers. Ranked 2v2's: Mainly good people, but kinda the same with Friendly 2's.  Ranked 3v3: Thats just fucking confusing, need some kind of correlation, or you can just bait enemies into friendly-fire. Custom Online: You're only safe if nobody joins. I can go on, but I just don't think this'll get me anywhere."

625,"The game is basically pay to win, stronger hero wins, it doesn't matter if you are better,
if you have weaker hero you automatically lose unless the enemy is brain dead.
And that not the problem with this game, I don't care if I lose to a better hero I am okay with that, my problem is that they removed the option to contact the enemy in any shape or form. 
Can't talk in game because they removed the chat, can't messaged them on Steam, can't even add them on the friend list. All that because somebody said a bad word online. Grow up people, many years ago you could said any fucking thing on the internet but now you cant ever say fuck because Steam will censor it.
Fuck this game and fuck this society.

654,"good game

655,"After playing for a good while, it gave me high blood pressure, wishing I can uninstall myself, sadness, loneliness, and a newfound hatred for the shift key. Oh, and one broken monitor.

690,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
691,Shitty servers that don't get fixed. Get ready to be hammered because you are lagging like a mofo.
692,"this is one of the WORST games ive ever bought. this game sucks ASS. It has NO SKILL PREVENTION so your first game as level 1 has absolute no life vigins and the tutorial axplains nothing, no combos or anything. 10/10 HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IS DOO DOO AND A WASTE KNOCK OFF OF SMASH AND MULTIVERSUS"
693,it's an aright game
694,its pretty grindy especially on ladder but its really fun and unless you have all the characters theres always something to do. 4.1/5
695,"I used to love this game but the constant issues in the launcher, the issues with gameplay, the dead playerbase, the toxic playerbase just makes me not want to play. This also has the unfortunate side effect of causing my friends I play other fighting games with to play because they cannot stand playing the game long enough to learn combos or attempt to climb to even silver. Sucks. Used to love it. Fuck lance."
696,GOOD GAME IG
697,nothing really beats super smash ofc but for a free game its an alright-ish alternative. i think multiversus is a better free alternative but both are whatever... not great not horrible

There's a weapon and gamemode for everyone, and playing a few rounds will get you hooked! This game is especially fun when you play with your friends, my best advice for you is don't become a player obsessed with rank and trashing others, you'll ruin the game for people."

748,cool smash clone  but Rivals of aether is better thanks to workshop support
749,....
750,Its a great game and incredibly fun and addicting.
751,"This game is so fucking ass. If you play this game or know anyone who plays it, delete it or tell them to. If you've made any purchases on this game, you are as fucking retarded as the mentally disabled dumbasses who developed this hot dumpsterfire of a game. This shit is an unholy mockery of a video game, and it should be treated as such. And to whoever conceptualized this shit sack of a game, fuck you. You'd be more useful as a crash dummy than a human being you useless cunt. Fuck this stupid ass community too. You fat, basement dwelling, chronically online, musty ass, discord-kitten-having cretins can go shove Onyx's rocket launcher up your ass. You tiny little fucking peanut brains will go to your 9 to 5 slave jobs for your minimum wage. Then you'll go back home to your slummy, 1 room, black mold growing on the floor, and roach-infested fridge having apartment to play this shitstain of a game. Go die in a hole you retards. Don't any of you troglodytes say that this game isn't for me, because I've played multiple games of the same type that are better. I would trash this dogass game more, but my eyes fucking hurt from looking at its shitty artstyle anymore."
752,"cool game to play, especially with friends. you can also play alongside other people and have fun that way. you level up and get cool skins and unlock characters with the coins you get, 10/10 game so far"
753,"I love this game, I have almost 100 hours of game play over a spread amount of time. The game is so creative and adds a little touch to just a platform/arena game. I would honestly recommend this to all gamers who like to grind."
754,safvbsraftgdnjhsyrghnb
755,I love this game. Learn to breath and this game will never upset you.
756,One of the best fighting games i've played personally. (This game might make you quit gaming completely or just this game it's self) Anyway It's still really fun and it's better to play with friends.

801,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

813,"Most AWFUL game ever i don't know how people could even think about purchasing something in it. The person who thought that could create fun fighting game should think about what have he done with some people NERVES. The matchmaking skill groups we don't talk about that , the game have the chance to match a starter player  with someone who have 400 hours+ in total of the game. Most of the hitboxes are unreal like for example (artemis ,azoth ,hattori ,vector ,dusk ,zariel and ezio) insane and it's unbelievable how in ranked you can go against dimonts , platz. I consider that the game should be deleted forever from steam!"
814,"Gameplay is relatively straightforward, though much game time is required to memorize and capitalize on ""combos"" (dozens of hours of gameplay) . Skins, cosmetics, crossovers, are only available through in-game microtransactions. In all, there is no paid requirement to excel, but anything other than colors can only be unlocked through buying. Brawlhalla is an incredibly freemium game.  It's quite grindey as well."

1059,"I've met some cool people playing this game, sure some folks are toxic but it's a fun game in general. I would recommend to anyone who wants a game to chill, maybe sweat, and like just have fun in general."
1060,"This game has improved a lot. Easy to play, login bonuses, clean skins and customisation available. It is a very fun and i can confirm it's also not a ''pay to win'' game. You can also enjoy it solo and also very nice to play with a friend, looking forward for more updates, events and new skins and more crossovers."
1061,"I think the biggest problem of this game is how hard it is for new player to like it, also a lot of peaple who didn't played it compare the game to Smash Bros but it feels very different in my opinion.
I like the game for the gameplay, it is free and a 100% of characters can be unloked for free.
The game is technical, fun, looks nice and can be plant on a potato computer so it is really great.
Even if Brawlhalla is not perfect, it is from far one of my favorits games"
1062,Not for losers
1063,laba
1064,is funnn
1065,nice to play between the classes
1066,its a great game need to play :]
1067,"Brawlhalla is a very fun game with some nice features, tho i have one issue. I used to play on my nintendo switch and i grinded a lot, but now i have a pc but i can't use the same account. So if i want to play on my pc, then i have to start over again.

Overall a very nice game."
1068,good game
1069,"Sig spam for days. Terrible hit detection.
The game doesn't even teach you anything about mechanics, movements, combos, nothing. 
Here you go, just remember to sig spam till you win."
1070,"Trash UI, Soundtrack is nothing special, Underwhelming announcer, The game was not engaging to me. And is not User Friendly. Also Easy anti cheat."
1071,"Ako imate drustvo , ovo je igrica za vas"
1072,nic
1073,"I have much more hours on my Playstation account. This game is very well balanced. The style is great. Ranked is fun. And updates are still rolling with new features and characters. I also like to play it whenever im with my cousins, it is even more fun as a party game.

100% would recommend"
1074,..................
1075,"Tons of smurfs. There's barely any new legends, but SO MANY more to add - now that I think of it, there's SO many missing weapon combos. Too focused on crossovers just for the money. No proper stats post-game (Amount of attacks hit and missed, amount of sigs used, like in pro play, match time.) Game history is lacking info about the games you play (Elo gained / lost, match time, score, etc.) Also why the fuck does it keep history about games that are out of date? Diamond is a big fiesta of good to pro players which is depending on luck. Once you reach Diamond (which isn't hard) you start to fight the same players over and over again even at low Diamond - could be due to the lack of players, but it still frustrates me that I have to fight the same Orion literally 5 times in a row. No new rank to tackle previous issue. No browsing of shop or training room during queue (which feels like the simplest thing ever to implement) Horrible server issues, annoying input lag, rubber-banding, etc. Hitbox issues that are still the same. Reporting does not work, but there are tons of toxic players in this game. I feel like even to this day people are complaining about Axe and Lance which is funny because it's been years and it's the same weapons. Signature moves are better on newer characters than the older ones (Bigger hitbox, 2 part sigs, faster sigs, spammable, etc.) Balancing changes are not focused on legends, more on weapons. Since no two legends can have the same weapon, it feels like you're stuck with that character forever which makes balancing legends even more important. Stats are too impactful, but stance changes are only useful on certain legends. Dexterity is too complicated and hasn't been fixed since the start of the game - it only affects Katars, otherwise it's useless. For example, Mordex is one of the best legends due to his weapon combo AND stats, but Queen Nai's stats are too bad that it ruins the weapons too (Katars needing high dex and spear needing high speed.) So much more to complain about this game and it's not improving by the day. BMG is still not listening to their players. Game is slowly coming to an end. GGs."

1125,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

Couch play or prepare to be enraged if you plan on moving up in the ranks. It's frustrating when you put in the time and effort to learn combos and all just to have the majority of the players spam."

1326,"Really cool fighting platformer game. If you like Super Mario Bros, you should definitely try this game out. The biggest plus point is that nothing in Brawlhalla which can/might improve your gameplay is behind a payment wall. So apart from skins this game is pretty F2P. It is also very beginner friendly and easy to pick up (hard to master). That's all and good luck 👍"

1352,"Please devs buy servers that actually not fucking garbage. I have 30 ping, 0 packet loss, 0,5 frame times, still the game feels like i have 20 fps. The fucking input lag is unbearable. Sometimes its better, but most of the time it makes me pull out my hair. It makes no sense to play, because you cant even do a simple combo. It doesnt matter how i try my character doesnt do anything, regardless of me pushing any button. Fast fall = doesnt work 70% of the time, dodge doesnt work most of the time, chase dodge doesnt work 50% of the time. Fix the fucking game or the servers or whatever it makes this game unplayable.

1470,"To anyone who's reading this review and haven't played this game yet, please don't install this game you'll get annoyed and mad from people who can't play this game properly and spam one or two attacks non-stop."
1471,good game with buddys. just dont play ranked.
1472,"Its a great game, the only problem is, the servers lag a lot for no apparent reason
"
1473,Better than smash imo; I don't wanna discuss further. Play it.
1474,shit game
1475,"first game on ranked and i got gangbanged 
best game i 10/10"
1476,"As someone who has played this game ever since 2016, I was able to see the changes the game went through. Upon initial release, it looked very promising especially for a time where smash was the only dominant fighting game. Playing the game, it was fun to have a combo based fighting game but also making combos balanced with the option to dodge. However, in the state it has been in, it's hard to ignore the issues the competitive scene may have. I'm sure if you are a brawlhalla player, you have probably complained about passive players at least once (even with not many hours). The dodge mechanic makes passive play awfully common and rewarding in this game; hardly even worth going in unless against significantly worse players. If you want a good visual of what I am talking about, literally watch ANY tournament not played by sandstorm or any other notoriously good players and the issue with dodge becomes more apparent. BMG has attempted to make dodge more balanced by increasing and reducing the cooldown on dodge dependent on if it's grounded, air, etc. But it still haunts this game. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely still ways to enjoy the competitive scene without playing passive but passive play is just sadly more rewarding in this game. Again, as for someone who has clocked nearly 800 hrs across multiple platforms, it's hard for me to recommend this to newer fighting game players and even a few veterans. I do truly hope this game fixes the issues with passive play but for now, I can not recommend this game in its current state"

1552,"I loved this game so much and spent a lot of money on this. This was one my favorite games to grace this platform, sadly I cannot say the same things as I used to. The servers are absolute garbage. Actual pile of burning rubber, they are so unstable. You can go from 12 ms to 100+ plus for no reason. I thought it was my internet at first, but after playing other games, I've come to realize that mammoth games has not done anything about this problem. It's been over a year since the servers started to become this unplayable. Ggz rip a game I loved to death. Get gapped by freakin' league of legends."

1604,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

1774,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

1780,"In spite of my positive review, there is a massive disclaimer attached to this game. Brawlhalla can be a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously and just play with your friends. Although Brawlhalla has its flaws, once you've gotten good enough to play at a decently high level, you'll find yourself on the subreddit complaining about passive float metas like everyone else, and it will be impossible for you to ignore them. This is something I've been thinking about for a long time, but it seems like all of the reviews, even the negative ones, are ignoring. Because of this, I'll go over my reasoning and give a few reasons why I still think it's worth downloading despite its many flaws.

If you've got a group of friends to play with, Brawlhalla can be a great time. This is an excellent game for those who just want to kill some time.  Regardless of your prior knowledge of fighting games, you'll be able to pick up this game very quickly. In addition to being simple to learn, it is also free to play and only requires the purchase of a few cosmetic items. To keep things fresh, there are a variety of modes for you and your friends to choose from. Playing a lot of the same character can feel somewhat rewarding because you can gain experience and unlock new colors by progressing through the game. The fact that this game can be run by a potato also helps.

Despite the fact that I think this game has enough positives to warrant a download, that's all I have to say about it. Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess, and I can confidently say so as someone who has played and watched this game at a very high level for many hours. Toxic community, netcode, matchmaking, etc. are all things that other reviewers have complained about. My focus is on the gameplay mechanics and why it fails to compete in a meaningful way.

As soon as you use Brawlhalla's dodge mechanic, you're virtually unhittable for the next 30 seconds. A dodger's risk is low because it has only 0.97 seconds of downtime and it's difficult to punish unless your opponent knows exactly where you're going to dodge. When you run, you can dodge twice in succession while moving in all eight directions at once. You can jump or attack almost immediately after the dodge's iframes end, which is one of the primary reasons it's so safe. There are three ways to hop around: jumping in any direction three times, then quickly falling back down to reclaim your jumps and continue hopping. Passive play is encouraged in this meta due to an invincibility cooldown that lasts just one second and an insane amount of aerial freedom that allows players to avoid making any direct approaches. Dodging or floating away is usually safer than attacking first, but it may put you in a better position to punish a whiffed attack. Consequently, it often feels like you're chasing your opponent rather than engaging in a combative exchange with them. The ease with which you can float around and avoid your opponent makes you feel as if you're in outer space while playing this game. You'll die faster than a cripple trapped in a burning building if you keep approaching it. It is very difficult to catch salty players who run away from you in ranked just to troll you. As you point out, this is something that should never have happened in the first place. Dodging is a common occurrence because it is an absurdly simple method of evading stress. Dodge in one of eight directions to restart the match whenever you're hit by a blow. During Brawlhalla's neutral phase, it's as if two kids are playing on a jungle gym for as long as they want until one of them trips and falls and gets hurt (in this case, hurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching).

In addition to dodging and movement, wall camping is also a problem. As long as your opponent is willing to approach, you can wall camp and put them at an advantage. Abusing this strategy has resulted in tournament victories for players. Because of this new mechanism, you can no longer wall camp after you touch the stage too many times, but it is very forgiving and only requires a few frames of stage contact to allow you to resume wall camping once again. After a while, you'll be able to dance around on the wall for as long as you like without getting tired.

A lot of people who don't play Brawlhalla might think that nerfing dodge would solve all of the problems I've outlined thus far. As a result of this terrible mechanic, Brawlhalla has already been designed and balanced in its entirety. With some weapons, precise dodge readings can result in massive damage, while others are better at punishing dodges. These weapons stand to gain significantly from a significant dodge nerf, and as a result, they will quickly become meta. This game's passivity problem can only be solved by a massive rework of dodging, jumping, and most likely every weapon in the game. When it comes to rework, the developers don't know what to do or how to do it. Instead of dealing with Brawlhalla's fundamental passivity issue, they're applying band-aid fixes that will only make things worse in the long run.

As a result, I decided to play ranked with the sole purpose of winning, which meant playing passively and ignoring what other people thought of me in order to do so. I quickly climbed into the world's top 50 with this method. A lot of people in the post-game chat complained about my playstyle, despite the fact that almost no one tagged me. It's true, though, that even though I'm never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't hold anyone responsible for their anger. At the highest level, Brawlhalla is one of the most frustrating fighting games ever made. Think about losing to someone who avoided approaching you, wall-camped or even ran away from you the entire time. So it's no surprise that Brawlhalla's community is a toxic cesspool, emitting foul-smelling salty fumes.

Even though I'd like to give this game a bad review, I can't. The serious passivity issue that this game has will likely go unnoticed by most players who play at a basic, casual level. In spite of this, I'm going to give Brawlhalla an overall positive review. It's best to play this with a group of people you know and not take yourself too seriously. As early as platinum/diamond, the passive float meta is noticeable, so be prepared to deal with it if you plan on playing this game for a long time."

1813,"This game has many issues, such as spam and a very steep skill curve. You need to get good to have fun. The game does not help you do this as the tutorial has some things to be desired. Legends are not all unlocked unless you purchase them with money or in game currency. Thankfully a new player has access to a new set of legends each week, as legends rotate. This game is free to play as advertised, however there is an insane amount of server lag, broken signatures, and wonky hitboxes. While this is still one of if not the most popular platform fighters out there with little to no competition in terms of quality and uniqueness, it is simply too large and old."

1828,"It's a good second to Super Smash Bros, but lacks the character. Unlike Smash Bros most of the characters in Brawlhalla are locked behind a paywall.

If you don't have Smash and want to do some couch co-op it can be fun, not the first choice though. -  It's like if you wanted to watch 'Con Air' starring Nicolas Cage, but you only had 'Ghost Rider' starring Nicolas Cage, you're probably going to watch Ghost Rider wishing you were watching Con Air instead..

1863,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

1867,"after playing this game for as long as i have, i think i should finally review it. so first of all, the gameplay is decent at best. i don't love playing this game all that much, but what i do love is the characters. now i get plenty of girls in real life, but there's something about the brawlhalla girls that just keep me coming back time after time. some of the male characters too are pretty attractive, and i find myself unable to stop myself from masturbating to these characters upon arriving home from work, or even after having intercourse with real women, if i decide to actually see them instead of playing brawlhalla all day. well that's all for today. feel free to message me if you're a member of the LGBTQA+ community, as my DM's are always open. ♡"

besides this the developers fail to innovate the game even slightly and instead resort to adding pointless crossovers with awful art and design.

multiversus should be a wake up call to tell the developers what actually needs to be worked on"

1891,"The game would be fun if just it could fix a couple problems such as, 1: lag which causes input delay or even just moves you or someone else anywhere else on the screen or you/they fall off the edge which can cause i winning game to become a utter lose as you just die. 2 playing against other people online is so fun especially when the game matches you with the same team four times in a row and if this was a one off i wouldn't be adding this but this happens every other game leaving the fun of fighting other people out of the question when you get stuck with either too good or people that are extremely new, though out of this all the main thing that bugs me is i play one game ranked and find someone around my skill level and it's honestly fun. Next game high ranked game after that high ranked all just high ranked even in friendly but don't get me wrong the noobs every four or so rounds just stops me from jumping out of the window ;)"

1967,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2000,"Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realise that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.

And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.

And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.

My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.

This ends for all of us.

2086,very good
2087,"I HATE THIS GAME ITS SO DUMB AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
No but in all seriousness here's an actual review

The gameplay is good. It's pretty fluid, the only time it glitches is if you lag but even then that doesn't matter much. The control options are great because you can use pretty much any controller, keyboard alone, or even keyboard and mouse to play.

The variety is okay. I say this because every character has light (fast but weak) moves and strong (slower but stronger) moves. Every character has different signatures (signatures = strong moves), but all light moves are the same for every character. There's plenty of crossovers with things like assassins creed, street fighter, WWE, and other shit and it's pretty cool.

The difficulty depends. You can get in a match and win in 1 minute or get in a match and lose in 3 seconds, it depends on who you're playing against. But regardless of if you lose, just say GG and move on, spamming rematch or angry emotes won't affect the other player, so just move on.

The grind-ability of this game is a little over the top. Every character costs around 2300 or more coins, so unless you pay 20 bucks to unlock all of the characters instantly (If you're gonna play this game a lot, do that.) you're gonna spend quite a long time grinding. You only get enough gold for 1 character every 15 or so matches, maybe even more. Just buy the all legends pack and support the devs lol.

and finally, in all, I think this game is great. At times the community can be shit, but other than that the game is fine, the controls are good, it's fluid, it can run well on low-end pcs, there's a lot of characters, cool mechanics, and all in all it's a great game.



Unless you hate toxic people, then please stay away from this game and forget it ever existed."

2093,"I really like this game, I really do, but the heavy spammers are annoying. Other than that, it's a good game."
2094,This game is very fun! You need to get used to the controls before you get good thought.
2095,"I haven't played much so far, but I guess it's okay.."
2096,"good game
"
2097,"I've played this game for a good 4 years and I can say that in my opinion this is better then smash. I feel like in smash your too stiff and its not as fast paced as this game. But I would give this game a solid 8.5. Also fix the map voting bug.

This game is a good alternative, if you don't have a 400 dollar nintendo switch and dont have smash."
2098,only fun with friends which i dont have...
2099,fun game
2100,Amazing game for beginners and late game player's i would highly recommend the game.
2101,yeah
2102,this game is salty i love it XD
2103,"Very fun but rough on the edges. There would be lot to improve but very fun game when you get into it and learn a few combos and get used to the weird hitboxes. If you get toxic easily then don't try this, it will be toxic hell to you, would overall recommend tho. (7.5/10)"
2104,"Its a pretty dope game
"
2105,Very nice game to play with friends.
2106,"Smash Bros, But Free"
2107,"I like the characters and  the style of the game overall straight to the animation of the signatures and the game overall is just fun and even if the game was not fun I still find it a little addictive so I would recommend as long as you make sure to take breaks and relax from time to time outside of this game ,definitely a 5 star game in my opinion.
"
2108,ass game
2109,multiversus better lul
2110,"I've been playing Brawlhalla for almost 2 years now and holy, as a free, 2d fighting game, this game is sooo fun. Having over 50+ legends to choose from and each and every legend having unique sigs (signature moves) and so much combo potential. This game can get super competitive at times so if you want a competitive and challenging game, this is definitely the game for you. This game isn't anything like Super Smash Bros. or Multiversus, this game has its own unique theme and classical way of fighting. Highly recommend!!"

2265,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

2303,yes
2304,I just got plat and I am so happy. Overall this game is very good but I have a ton of bad memories with it. Recently I broke my keyboard because of it. Raging is pretty easy especially if you get with a 1000+ hours mordex on ranked. Ranked is like a drug. Once you start playing and you reach gold you cannot stop. I would suggest this game to everyone but I recommend taking little breaks if you've gone too far.
2305,VERY FUNNN
2306,"It's a decent game when you play it with friends, but its matchmaking is horrible, if you play in an online mode you will be getting matched against people with a lot more experience than you, the servers are really bad so you will have constant lag issues, it's just not fun to play alone, the best gamemode is custom game rooms with friends playing free for all, the ranked reward system is really bad and it's not woth it playing it and the balance between legends is also awful."

2364,"COMPLETELY DOGSHIT GAME.  I'm not even joking.  This is not an ironic post.  This game is just geniunely bad.  I have over 190 hours in this game.  It is just awful. 

The constant internet lag that hasn't been addressed or fixed in the 5+ years I've played this game, the random bullshit characters from crossovers they add (I fucking hate steven universe), a dodge that BARELY works, and they decided to do a crossover with Ubisoft right when ubisoft is under fire for removing their entire games library from steam.

Before you starting saying, ""wHy KeeP PLaYiNg the GamE If YoU HaTe IT So MuCh"" I had faith that the devs would fix the lag and various connection issues and bugs.  I just kept thinking ""maybe this will be fixed"" but it never did.

Dumbass developers.  Never playing this game again.  Writing this as I uninstall it.

Go play Multiversus"

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time (all I know)

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (it's so unreal)

You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, to didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go (watch you go)

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard (I tried so hard)

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far (got so far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me (in the end)

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

2398,"Like Netflix, the game keeps getting more awful as years fly by. From removing the ingame chat, to ruining the sounds and destroying all off stage play with wall slip.

The downward trend can be seen from the decreasing playerbase and the dwindling pro scene. But it seems the developers are too busy creating skins for short term income, instead of trying to save their dying game by releasing acceptable updates.

played 4 games since i last played in september 06 2017. all i saw were cringe lancers spamming the stupid joust move 100% of the tame. when i say 100% of the time, i mean it. this game was a horrible experience. it's heavily due to a imbalance of weapon types/ cheese and abilities. i rather deal with a cringe minecraft steve on smash bros than the fkg lancers, the bows are nasty asf too and also the cannon dude was the cringiest character i've ever seen in any fkg game i've ever played.

how the fk do you play 4 games and see orion in all 4 of them... because it's a imbalanced trash game."

Another thing is the meta is not the most fun to play as it requires u to not fight and wait : ("
2423,A great fighting game to play with friends or to make new or to ruin them up to you on how you want to do it but definitely a game i can see myself playing a lot and they have so many characters to choose from it awesome
2424,play teros
2425,"Game is quite fun to play, steep learning curve for all of the weapons (except for lance and bow). That reminds me; if you play lance or bow you need to quit this game and stop ruining the enjoyment for others. 

If i want to queue up a nice cheeky game of brawlhalla, I would prefer to not be Slight>Dlight>Dlight spammed by a bow or nlight>slight>sair spammed by lance. This kind of shit ruins the game for me and gets me seriously tilted to the point where i logoff. 

I then come to my senses and log back in to play some more because the tilt has ended and I have succumb to the addiction.

8/10 game, potentially 9/10 if if get out of platinum and stop versing fucking losers.

It started with 1 lag everyday then 1 whole day of lag and then lag the whole week with only some games not lagging. After some time, every single game was unplayable due to the lag, for 5 months, I checked once and a while to see if it's fixed but no luck and I still lag to this day. I play on the SEA server and it's not because of my internet, I play other multiplayer games and I get decent ping in them, I really hope BMG fixes this because I saw other people also having the same problem. Overall, if we ignore the server problems and base everything on the gameplay, I would rate it a 7/10. I would recommend you to play this but I don't want you to spend 400 hours then stopping because you can't play the fricking game due to a server problem."

2497,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

2540,"(This game is just a crappy version of smash. The hitboxes make zero sense, there's no use for the right analog stick which doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't feel polished in any way. 

Free costs too much for this game. I'd have more fun flipping a quarter for 2 hours and recording the results.
Literally the worst fighting game I've ever played in my life.)

^^That was my initial review. After playing the game for 10 more hours, I've officially decided that this game doesn't even deserve a second chance. Still terrible. I did learn to maneuver around the *****y hitboxes but the lack of polish is still just too obvious. It feels like a mobile game that lets you use a controller.

I uninstalled this game quick after i realized how they took the platform fighter genre and did it absolutely horribly. i would not recommend this game. VERY not fun game."

Very fun to play with a large party."
2679,game is so fucking bad i would never recomend it to anyone i hope all the devs go work on an actual game worth there time and not this piece of absolute filth that remains on this earth
2680,I really enjoy the simplicity of each character with the same type of weapon having the same basic attacks but also having special moves unique to each character.
2681,"This game is so good, but little hard or so hard, but still this is my favorite game"

2688,"Very fun, played with my friends and bonded with them."
2689,"Never liked the game from the get go... But after around 20-30 hours of playtime (Id only spar with a friend just for jokes and fun) I started to get stuff down a little bit and the more I became understanding of the game the more I enjoyed it, its currently damn near the only game I play. [Currently Plat 1] [282 hours]"
2690,The lacks variety besides the specials for very specific characters and feels like league 500+ games later you feel like your on the same skill level as before due to how cancerous this community is they say get good like this game isn't the extreme definition of mid
2691,Down sig into taunt always works ( edit- It is still working for me )
2692,Pretty cool and entertaining game.

"
2698,"yes
"
2699,really fun game with friend
2700,"It is a very fun 2D fighter game that has a good variety of items, characters and fighting moves. I like this game and think it is well-made game that is also free"
2701,You will regret playing this game.
2702,"I want to preface this review by saying that I came from PS4 which is why my hours are low

I've played Brawlhalla since 2017. I started on PS4 and transitioned into PC when I started to play more Valorant (I still play on controller fuck you guys it's a viable way of playing). In my countless hours of playing this game, I've found that I kinda suck at fighting games LMFAOOO. But this game still holds a special place in my heart as the first game that really pulled me in and got me to play more than 100 hours. I can't say I still enjoy playing this game as much as I am much more drawn to shooters, but every once in a while it's good to come back to this game and play around for a bit. For any new players considering playing this game, you should try it! It's not everyone's favorite game, but it is a well made game filled with lots of love from the devs. Just please stop playing Axe and Greatsword..."
2703,"yeah

2724,"Although this game may make you want crawl up into ball and cry sometimes (only when u get competitive really), it can also be insanely, fun you can get addicted so quickly, there's so many awesome character's that all have an equal chance of winning. And no this is not a smash bros rip off its far from it. Oh and just in case u didn't see the price its FREE"

I recommend everyone who reads this to report brawlhalla this game needt to be stopped i hope the creators of this game gets aids by their grandma and i hope that everyone who plays it can understand that nobody likes them and that they should feel how it is to touch a female fucking delusional community. And the creators are really hungry for money

2768,was fun while it lasted
2769,pretty good not for mental health tho
2770,"Its ridiculous how I went crazy about this game... one of the first, and easily, the best of its kind (platform fighting). awesome different modes to play and a lot of free stuff to let you customize your favorite character. you can choose to either play one, or play as all of the 55 available legends (mentioning fantastic crossovers), they all have their own abilities! It might seem frustrating to improve... but don't worry, you'll enjoy the game more than you would imagine."

2787,It's a good game just learn
2788,I hate having to go to Rule34 to find Sex of my favorite brawl characters. The game needs a new sex feature
2789,i have 1.6k hours in the game. its very fun and addictive. it brings out your competitive side and makes you strive to be the best. want to game to chill with friends then brawlhalla is the game for you.

2833,no crossplay and crosssave support yet though. shit developers.

2835,nice casual game
2836,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Those are just my recommended controls. Basically just dont use the mouse in the game, you can use WASD to navigate the menu, C/J to select, Z/L to return, and TAB to access the profile menu.

2936,"I want to say this game is fun and very addicting but if I were to tell you the things I've said playing ranked I would never be able to right a review again, all jokes aside though this game is fun and quite easy to learn WHEN PLAYING WITH FRIENDS if you dare go into the online mode you might as well buy yourself a new monitor because your going to punch a whole in it. If you don't already have friends who are good at the game and can teach you things about it it's almost impossible to get better with all the SIGNATURE SPAMMERS WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME BUT CHOSE TO ANNOY EVERYONE THEY VERSE AND WHEN THE GET A SINGLE KILL THEY THEN DECIDE TO SPAM EMOTES, and the people who will dunk on you with their insane combos, all that being said if you don't have anger issues or have enough money to repeatedly buy a new PC/monitor go for it this game is so worth it and fun in general but will definetley have you crying almost every online match you play."

3060,"Cute lil Smash Brothers Clone. You have small maps, each char is equipped with 2 weapons (there are 13 different ones) and there are several modes to play including coop and fun maps. 
I like the simple comic look. It's easy to get into but very hard to master. So many nuances with moves and possibilities. Played around 90 hours now and I still discover new moves. Don't you underestimate the simple gameplay. The 2 attacks and the 1 dash you've got can be combinated in so many ways with the direction buttons + the rdm drops like bombs and other stuff like that. 
You'll need a thick skin and steadiness if you want to play yourself upwards the leagues though.

It's free so just try it out. Only bitter pill I've detected: the most sweet skins/chars are only available for real cash (dont't get me wrong, each turtle and so on has a free equivalent wich can be unlocked without paying real munnneyyy but I'd love to see the posibility to unlock even those with hard grind like you know it from other games). It's just cosmetics and I'm way to old to be a victim of shit like that but still would be nice to unlock the crazy mako skins lol"

3073,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

3075,HORRIBLE
3076,one with the force
3077,"Has a steeeeeep learning curve almost comparable to TF2. Overall, once you take some time and effort to practice and get used to a brawler you like, you'll be able to have fun.

And a note to all the noobs who are starting out and those who are about to play, there are a lot of smurf accounts in this game, but don't be disheartened! You will get there someday and make use of these unhonorable smurf gamers as practice and learn their combos and strats for you to be a formidable opponent against them. 

P2W? No, it's quite balanced for me."
3078,Fun to play in free time and a based game
3079,"Its honestly a very good game. You can unlock any character for free with just some effort and time, but there are things you can get with only real money, such as skins, taunts, and other visual effects. There can be some toxicity in the community but its still a very well made game that is constantly in development, adding new characters, weapons, skins, battle passes, and just general patches and improvements. This is a game you can only play when you have pretty good internet connection though as I've learned. Any amount of lag makes it basically unwinnable, but that's a lot of multiplayer games to be fair. Anyways, its a very fun game to play if you enjoy free (mostly) games and fighting games."

3146,good
3147,"bom, vamos começar, sou um jogador da época do Closed Beta em 2015, pude aproveitar por anos o Brawlhalla, foram anos de aprimoramento e posso dizer que é um bom jogo, recomendo experimentar ao menos, não há sistemas de P2P apesar de ser um free to play, o que mais conta seria a habilidade, é um jogo deveras viciante e que irá pelo menos arrancar uns gritos de raiva e de felicidade em algumas vitórias."
3148,fun
3149,meh
3150,This is the game that made me break my laptop
3151,the matchup system is absolute bullshit i do not recommend this game(anymore in the past was brilliant)
3152,"its fun and unique,really recommend it"
3153,nice
3154,this is an amazing game all around!!! fun by yourself and even better with your buddies
3155,"I've played this game for a little over three years now and I've racked up 2850 hours, and In my opinion, the game is currently in a bad position. Long time players are leaving the game for good and the overall player base is in decline. BMG doesn't listen enough to the community and has only really prioritized crossovers and cosmetics over actual game content and balance, and you can see it too as these few years the amount of legends coming out has been very low.

The game is also fundamentally different ( See Shwerpy's video titled ""Brawlhalla's Uniqueness is also its flaw"" and Phazon's video ""Brawlhalla's biggest names are quitting"" ) and can lead to the promotion of toxicity and hive-mindsets, especially since weapons are shared ( For example, most golds and plats who hate lance adopt the mindset that lance is a wheelchair weapon and that all lance players and lance legends are cancer and brain-dead )

Brawlhalla also needs certain features that they have ignored for years, such as

Queue-time Training Mode
New Rank
Better Tutorials
Improved Training Room
More balance patches and experimental features
More community involvement
Casual 1v1 and 2v2 with ranked settings but without the stress of losing elo 
Placement Matches

In conclusion, Brawlhalla's productive development as a game has been coming to a grinding halt, and there are too many flaws to ignore now, from legends on release being absolutely busted to stupid weapon changes and more and more. I feel like the devs themselves should play the game more before making changes ( I still remember LTC when they made 1 change to cannon that made it the best weapon in the game , and GS on release, and the fact that hammer and axe were meta for like two years )

A raw sexual attraction with a strong politically incorrect aftertone."

Moreover, this game has a very short waiting time which is beneficial for players which can only play for a short moment. As i've been playing this game for very long and have never gotten bored of it, i feel that everyone should give this game a shot. YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT!!! :)"

"
3272,fuck lance mains
3273,"its free smash bros on pc with microtransactions. i know platform fighters are almost always called clones of smash, but i think thats because of how little you can change a platform fighter. Its hard to come up with a creative idea to change a platform fighter from smash, because theres so little options. like how most street fighter-like fighting games are compared with street fighter games. a good example of a game like that that does have a creative idea along with it is lethal league blaze. Its a creative twist on the average street fighter game, and its impressive how they thought of baseball."
3274,ass game dont let me pick up the fucking sword so dont get this shitty ass game

3281,"game would be fun if the servers werent one of the worst in any game ive played, i teleport so much its unplayable. i had to use a heavy character so the hits i was able to get in would count. speaking of hits, mine clips through the enemy so many times without dealing damage. most of my losses are from walking off the platform from so much lag. if i go to pick up a weapon and get it the next frame shows that i never picked up the weapon and that im getting my butt kicked by my opponent. overall good game with unplayable lag. by the way its not my internet since ive tried getting on another multiplayer game after i get lag in brawlhalla just to see my internet on any other multiplayer game is perfectly fine"

3291,No Sex
3292,Very fun
3293,fun game but takes time to learn
3294,Worst game ever. Feels like there is input lag everywhere and you have to have NASA internet connection to not get any internet lags. If you like getting angry then this is the game for you.

3404,"The game is good and you can have fun. I love hitting reads and just hitting cool clips in the game. The problem with the game is the devs. The meta is so bad right now and it seems like the devs are doing nothing about it. There are also some huge problems with the game such as weapon throws and weapon spawns which have been problems for years now and have not been fixed. The game is fun but if the meta continues to keep going like this it is going to become very stale and boring. I would still recommend this game hopefully the devs care about the problems, maybe they are just extremely slow to fix them."

3445,"Pay to win? No not really.
Fun? mostly yea.
Balanced? No not really.
In most cases you will either fight the exact same characters over and over because of them having super easy free infinite combos or just straight up people using combo scripts. Even better is the fact that this game uses Easy Anti Cheat which means literally any cheat software out there can bypass it undetected! Expect to have some fun for a couple of matches a day and then just getting annoyed at Orion main number 742 doing the same combo over and over as they've never learned anything else. Spears are generally the easiest weapon to win with since they all have practically the same busted combos, next up are a bunch of blaster and cannon users since they can just chain them over and over."

3463,"Brawlhalla is a mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as a cash grab by Ubisoft.   It's a ripoff of Super Smash Bros but with a bunch of various cartoon characters from various properties.  Gameplay consists of jumping around various small platformer arenas and mashing buttons, collecting pickups etc.

PC gamers will be offended by console peasant childrens toy gamepad prompts, but this game being on PC is a real afterthought as the focus from Ubisoft is on mobiles and consoles, this was never designed with PC gamers in mind.  That's also why the default control scheme is garbage, but at least you can change that.  

Resolution is locked and there's not much in the way of graphics tweaks, so this doesn't meet the bare standard minimum expectations for a PC game. 

The game is still inexplicably popular, with 10's of thousands of gamers clocking in every day, but that doesn't make much sense to me given the shallow and unengaging brawler gameplay.  

Combine the technical deficiencies of this mobile app with an eye watering, I'm not joking here, $200+ USD worth of DLC, and you can see why my recommendation is not to bother downloading this one.   If this really is the kind of game you want to play, it's probably a good idea to sell your PC and buy a console.  I certainly didn't spend thousands on a gaming rig so I could pretend it's an iPhone and put mobile apps on it."

3470,"This game is not free, it cost sanity."

~FINAL REVIEW~
This game is 8/10, but I only believe this applies to multiplayer experiences. Without friends(and you know you have none)  this game is less enjoyable. This game is multiplatform, which means you can play with about anyone. Though the game gets funner as more mechanics are discovered/learned."

3517,this game kinda mid
3518,"The Game's really good and all, with characters, weapons, skins, etc. The Only Problem I faced with this game is that sometimes, like in ranked, or any other mode (excluding offline), there's a ""connection error"" issue even when the internet is perfectly fine and in full speed (I have tested multiple times). It is one of the most Goated games otherwise, recommend to play"

3528,"Looking at this game after playing it for so long starting in mid 2016 I could have recommended it from 2016 to 2018, however janky the game was back then. But now it seems the developers are unfocused, leaving the game feeling stagnant and messy.

I'm sure you can still have fun playing this game, but from my POV, it isn't worth investing the time to get super good at the game when the developers would rather add shitty crossovers, rebalance a weapon until its shit, buff it until its broken, and then nerf it until its shit again over and over, than spend the time polishing the game and fixing bugs that have been present since 2016.
"
3529,"Simple fighting game that has fast queue time, downloads, and updates no matter how bad your wifi is. Not to mention the game gets new updates with new skins and crossovers decently fast."

step 1 - open the game
step two - spend 50+ hours learning how to scythe
BONUS step - you find out you are adopted"
3539,"Every fucking man just spam in this game no budy try to use brain and play like normal person.

"
3540,"it aight, not that fun u get maybe 10 hrs of enjoyment max"
3541,"I don't really play this game much anymore. I got a decently high rank though i'm still miles away from the best. High level gameplay is just running away and punishing aggressive moves. However I do think Brawlhalla is worth playing. it's a fantastic party game and casual is really fun. it's just playing ranked really inst worth playing imo and while tournaments are still mostly entertaining the game is getting stale for me. Give it a shot, it's free :)"
3542,"you will genuinely hate this game half the time. the other half is a great floaty fighting game. i have a friend that mains every character with too much range. this game will make you tear out your eardrums because you got edgecamped for the 500th time a match. it's pretty silly

3605,"Normally I should make a review about the game itself and nothing outside it but since this is a multiplayer fighting game I have to say this:

I know when it comes to games the communities are made of a lot of types of players: wholesome, funny, toxic, subhuman, tryhards etc. you get it.
This game has a community... I have never seen before such community full of toxic players, obnoxious little kids who try to make you as mad as possible like they will accomplish something by doing that. Those countless of attempts of those players trying to get me mad is what annoys me because there's no point in doing it.

About fighting... a good majority of the fights I had untill know was against those players who spam the hell out of those signature attacks. Sometimes they are too predictable and that's an easy win, sometimes they get me killed because they know where and when to spam it. Now some of you might say something like ""that's their fighting style why are you complaining, get better and you will have no problems with them in the future"" I'm not complaining about losing or winning but here's the thing.... if you are one of those players who fought me, spammed almost the entire game, sweating using the same move desperately over and over again to kill me... you are boring me like the rest of every single player spamming, I feel like I'm playing against the same player over and over again, it's not fun and that's why I can't recommend this game. I rather have a hell of a fight with someone and losing than winning against a kid spamming the same move or doing edge guard using the same signature attack for like 4 times in less than 10 seconds. I can have fun only playing against my friends but that's about it."

To Finished Everything I Have To Say This Is A Really Fun And Enjoyable Game That I Recommend To Everyone Who Like Anything Similar To Super Smash Bros And Its Also Really Fun For The People Who Like PVP 10/10 Game.

3726,"havent played this game for a whole week cuz of vaca and this game has turned into a sweat fest, gonna die cuz of how fortnite did with this pro stuff, stg 😒"
3727,"the game itself is good but there's a lot of reasons not to play it:

1st of all the community (at least in plat) is full of 5 year old children that emote after every kill and when they lose they invite you into a custom just to say ""fuck you trash kid"" because they're salty.
that's the first thing i dislike

2nd bmg don't care about this game a lot, all they care about now is battlepasses and microtransactions, the balance in this game is ass, the meta's been the same for a really long time by now and bmg does nothing about that.

there's obviously a lot more that i've not talked about but those are what i think are the biggest issues.

overall the game is good but not worth putting a lot of time into as you'll realize how many problems this game has."
3728,"You will constantly have a love hate relationship. Sometimes you'll enjoy the game, other times you'll break your chair's arm off. I don't recommend this, but I'll continue to play.

3729,very fun
3730,fun
3731,bery good game i likey
3732,"I don't even play this game anymore.

It's not as fun to watch.

One second, nothing, the next second it's fireworks everywhere, all the time.

The emotional state will disappear for that split second and never come back.

Really intense things like this just seem to fly in front of my eyes and I have to watch my face like a hawk.

I really like fireworks.

When I was a kid, we lived in New York City.

I went to school on 42nd street in Manhattan.

It was always completely loud and full of noise.

Every day, while walking to school, I could hear kids screaming as they practiced their baseball or football or soccer tricks on the grass near the schools.

It was loud loud and I thought they were all idiots.

It was not until I went to NYC with a friend a few years later that I discovered it was not kids screaming, it was the basketball players practicing for the next day's games.

NYC was never as loud as I remember it from years ago.

There was a great restaurant near my school.

It was loud from the time I arrived in the kitchen until the time I finished my meal.

Then, it would be all quiet and peaceful for a few minutes.

It would begin again with a bang just as I was walking out the door.

It was loud and full of music.

It was awesome.

I always loved it.

I suppose it is the same for every place there are a lot of people, especially when the people are in a big group.

My friend in NYC thought it was really interesting that all these adults were screaming at the top of their lungs.

I still thought they were idiots.

Why would anyone do that?

Why would you make a noise like that when you are trying to have a conversation?

A game?

A meeting?

A business meeting?

A job interview?

Why would anyone scream and make such a loud noise in such a small enclosed space?

What are you looking for?

Someone to laugh at your silly joke?

An answer to your question?

A reason to greet someone when they walk in the door?

A reason to kiss someone?"

3788,The peak of all game play. This game makes you a better person. Game is very positive and the community is really friendly.
3789,Game has a foxgirl (that makes it good)
3790,"This game is everywhere for me, most games I would have positive or neutral thoughts towards but with this game I feel very negatively about. This is due to the game's meta, character balance, and game mechanics. Lets start with the meta, the meta currently is dominated by a 3 characters in singles that being Teros, Rayman, and Bodvar, there are many more characters that consistently make top 5-10 but they struggle severely to place higher than this due to character balance. Character balance has to be the main reason as to why I stopped playing this game as much as I used too, some characters that are perfectly fine for casual ranked or experimental matchmaking struggle in tournament and usually have a better counterpart of themselves that gives the archetype the character was going for a chance in bracket. For instance, Isaiah, his sig kit is built around edge guard and zoning which shows, he has a pretty good dsig and sidesig on both blasters and canon that edge guard very sufficiently, he also has some pretty good out of dodge options with nsig and nlight on blasters. The only issues for him placing consistently in tournament is his mobility, strength, and ending lag on sigs. He is extremely slow and struggles to even put the opponent on the edge so that he can take advantage of his sigs, not only this but he does very little damage and with his weapons that being cannon and blasters which aren't really great to have low strength as they are mainly combo weapons and struggle to build up damage on their own. So you may ask what about his sigs you talked about earlier that can help with neutral, can't you just focus on that and have a decent character? Well, no, his nsig on both blasters and guns have too much knockback to punish someone then follow up with a combo, by the time you nsig they are a mile away from you and you will have to read their air movements to get another punish which may not lead to a combo nor stock end. His sigs also have way to much ending lag as a zoner and edge guarder, now compare this to Diana who has a different sig kit yet same zone and edge guard playstyle and does it infinitely better than Isaiah. If your confused on what I'm trying to say I am saying this game has too much characters that are just worse counterparts of top tiers, unless you like the idea of struggling as a low tier or just like the character there is no reason to play them leaving the low tiers to be less then desirable. Then there is game mechanics, I am going to be focusing on netcode, air dodges, and wall slip but keep in mind there are plenty more mechanics in this game then what I am about to mention. The netcode for this game sucks, I don't even think it's rollback but if it is it sure doesn't feel like it. On my own servers with good ping I still get input delay that doesn't correlate with my own hardware, it just has to be the netcode. Air dodges constantly block aerials and grounded attacks even after the animation has finished or before it even begins to appear on screen which makes it harder than it needs to be to read someones dodges. Wall slip was actually recently changed so a lot of complaints I had about it being not strict enough went away due to these recent patches, but there is still one major flaw with the new wall slip changes, gimping. The new wall slip makes it way too easy to gimp, I was playing Axe and I dair someone off edge then nair then because I needed the chase dodge to get back up on stage, then when they were about to hit the wall I faired them and it gimped, 3 HITS, JUST 3 WAS A GIMP. It feels like cheese the majority of the time with how easy it is to gimp on any weapon now, especially katanas and orb. All in all the game is not good and I couldn't recommend it in it's current state."

3828,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 13 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3859,This game isn't really balanced at all. Sure you can be good with a character but it all goes out the window when characters who can spam (unpunished) show up. The controls are sometimes unresponsive leaving me upset that I couldn't properly get a combo off and sometimes costing me a life. I don't feel like this game is finished.
3860,"Encountered a bug where I look like I'm playing the game but in reality, the real game is going on without me. My duo first realized this when I fall off the screen, frozen, and then I also realize this once everyone started jumping off the edge and it looks like I win with no damage but no victory screen. This game is unfixable and these developers are on their phones thinking of good skin ideas instead of fixing this godforsaken bug. I want to punch one of them."

The ranking system is luck based (Me and my friends are in low gold rank and match regularly against platinum players which a lot of times we absolutely destroy them), the community is toxic, 9/10 players you will play against SPAM but the dev's don't do anything against spamming and finally there are input/connection problems that i ONLY have with this game even after i reinstalling the game.

I would rather play most other platform, or other, fighting games."

Try it out and make your own opinion on it."

4108,"Benefits of watching morbius daily😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Day 1 - You watch morbius. Instantly love it.

Day 5- Improved motivation and productivity.

You feel as a whole a stronger human being

3. Day 30 - Greater confidence and self-esteem. Mental clarity. Youre able to perfectly recite the script

4. Day 60 - Increased muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular capacity. Testosterone through the roof. Women start talking

5. Day 120 - Higher sperm count. Increased erection strength and duration. You've now memorised the choreography of the entire movie, you can execute the stunts and movements performed to a tee

6. Day 365 - Your voice deepens, and your skull becomes more chad-like. Increased erection girth and length.

7. Day 1500- Your ex wants to get back together. You feel tempted but ultimately turn her down. You need more time to watch morbius.

8. Day 3000 - You can't keep up with all your tinder matches. Strange women begin hitting on you in public. You worry about your female boss. Fortunately, she keeps it professional.

9. Day 6000 - Ex shows up at your door crying and begging you to take her back. You don't even make eye contact-just call the police right away. Your female boss quits. She can't take it anymore and fears what she might do to you if she stays.

10. Day 12000-Every swipe on tinder is a match. Even girls you swipe left get matched with you somehow. Romantic messages fill up your inbox every day-all 15gb of it-you upgrade your Gmail account to premium.

11. Day 100,000 - Your IQ increases by several morbillion. You come up with a workable model of quantum gravity in a rainy Sunday afternoon. Elon Musk steps down from SpaceX to work for you. You decide to put space exploration on hold to focus on achieving clean energy through nuclear fusion.

12. Day 200,000 - You've solved the problem of nuclear fusion. You also solved the problems of climate change, poverty, crime, and racism. You have been elected the very first President of the World.

mid game, you should watch morbius instead"

-You can get in matchmaking with someone who has 800 hours in the game when you have 50 (I say from my own

4204,"great game, its fun and works well except for one issue i have. I have just recently got this game on PC, but have been playing on console for like 2 years on and off. I am using a controller and there are several issues, mainly with menu navigation when i use a controller. If i accidently do so much as touch my mouse on accident, i have to reload the game because it thinks im trying to play with mnk as the input for a second player and messes up the menus while also not letting me into a 1v1 game, telling me i have to many people in the party(it wont let me remove the mnk from the party) This is annoying and affects me almost every time i play the game so i hope it will be fixed soon."

4241,"Game is not good towards newer players and doesn't do anything to try to balance this issue out. Their aren't even normal 1v1s and only ranked which forces newer players to be put into ranked with no experience. Only way to actually learn how to play the game is by having a friend who already played this game before. Their is a very obvious ceiling in this game which forces the player to be stuck unless they put in 100s of hours into this game to understand small advantages and difficult moves. This game is not fun or ""casual"". You will never be able to play for fun with a friend and will definitely ruin friendships."
4242,"my favorite pass time, its the best 2D game i can think of involves real skill and concentration colorful and fun"
4243,There is no Matching making you can be  a new account and you get matched with a level 50 veteran. It's stupid. Don't Recommend. I don't think the devs will fix it. Yup this game is still shit
4244,"Game is working fine in windows but crashes after one game in macos 12.4
"
4245,"Doesn't have real matchmaking; you'll end up against people who have been playing the game for years the moment you touch Ranked. You will lose more ELO when you lose against them than you gain in any match that's actually close. Seems fun if you're experienced with Smash clones, if you're at all green or unsure I'd wait for Multiversus."
4246,"Very pog, but prepare to cry"

4248,its really bad
4249,"Keep spamming the same shit and I swear to god im going to send you and your family to a cannibal island, force you to survive and as soon as you get hopes of getting off the island by a boat im going to let one of your family members die so then you cry yourself to sleep every night thinking of the time you nearly got off the island with everyone, your mum will then get eaten by a shark, your grandad will fall off a cliff, your grandma will get eaten alive by a cannibal and you, you will survive until the day your in the bath trying to relax ill throw a toaster (dont worry it will be plugged in) in with you. you bag of shit. good game tho quite fun enjoyed it with mates"

4284,great game with friends
4285,"The downwards spiral of this game is never-ending. I've lost my wife and 16 children over the time I've spent on this game and I'll never see their faces again. I'm 6 trillion dollars in debt and my rent has been left unpaid for many years. I miss the grass outside and I miss the life that I once had before I encountered this game. If I could only see my wife right now I would tell her that I love her, but I can't, because i lost her to a queen nai main. This game has ruined my life beyond belief and I'll never financially and mentally recover from this game. 

Jaeyun's kinda hot though."
4286,very good gam
4287,"This game is so relaxing, but with a flaw. Everything I see in store needs money, except Legends. At least an event that has some good skins might encourage people to play more"

Play it at you're own risk."

4291,"Great game. The the gameplay is nice, the characters are mostly well balanced, and there's are a lot to do in the game. You can definitely enjoy most of the game even without the IAPs or the DLCs.
The only complain I have with this game is that the camera movement sucks. It's rally bad. I tried all the camera settings, each one worse than the previous. I had a hard time getting used to it. But once you get used to it, it's a great game, specially if you are looking for a quick match or two with your friends. It's not a deep game, but it's fun."

4309,no
4310,"Played it on console as well, it makes me want to rip my eyeballs out of my skull"
4311,"This game is filled with so many spammers. So many da*n spammers. You try to learn how to play and you get some of the most predicable attacks possible. Unless you are playing with friends, this game is rigged for any newcomers trying to learn how to get up there because of the trollers you have to out-troll first."
4312,Free version of smash and is an easier game to get into that a traditional two fighter game like mortal combat. Game gets dry overtime so make sure to not only use one character like most no-lifes on this game.
4313,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4314,this is a very interesting game i always like the concept of 2d fighting games like smash bros or mortal kombat another reason i like this is the variety of characters

4408,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It is up to me to show the world what's invisible for them: that a fucking faggot like me could open people's eyes and understand the human sex, and giving to someone an orgasm is to me more than logic can explain.

4464,"I wanna end my life every second of playing this game. The developers put more time into making the background look pretty than balancing the weapons in the game, the sheer lack of skill required to win most of your matches is beyond me and I consistently think about returning myself back to the void each and every minute I play. I'd rather . . . listen to harry styles while getting fucked by a 4 foot 1 midget in a yumiko costume than play this game at all. The only way I could see people playing this game is if it was used as a torture method prior to capital punishment. Which even then i'd much rather be electrified to death and fed to wild dogs than even think to extend my life further by playing this game. Would I recommend this to others? if you, deep down, have a genuine hate for yourself and any positive emotion than yes I would. Otherwise please. . . stay as far as you can from this game and do everything in your power to keep from even seeing it."
4465,It's very entertaining for me and others. I like how the gameplay is and how smooth it is I definitively recomned it
4466,"Training in ranked match is da way. Nice legends and weapons to pick from, and also cool skins. The server connection is quite bad for this game for some reason. The way they handle the server packet loss is so bad I lose lots of ranked match. Fuck you BMG. I hope you all burn in hell forever."

>Game is balanced better than other fighting games and you shouldn't have to be peer pressured to play something because it gets the most wins (you can win with anything just takes enough practice)
>One negative is that this game can seriously piss you off if you take things too seriously and obviously losing never feels nice but it happens and grinding ranked is only for people who can handle toxicity and disappointment

4628,hah funy game with someime bad hitbox lolz xd
4629,"This game needs a tutorial or something. It tells you nothing about how to play the game, hoists the responsibility to learn it through other peoples tutorials on the player, then sets you up to fail with both of its 1v1 modes leaving the player to fail over and over to people who roll you. It has good bones underneath, a read-based platform fighter that has many similarities to Smash Bros even if every brawl player says otherwise. Its gameplay doesn't have any super awful flaws, though some weapons and legends are so unfun to play against that I sometimes get one stock rolled and decide that jumping into the abyss is more favorable than fighting a good lance or scythe. Just like in writing, the hook of a game is what draws people in, and brawlhalla falls on its ass so badly that im sure many potential players have left after entering their first ranked or free for all game."

4636,"Right im going to be honestly review this game, no jokes.
if you have anger issues i would advice against installing this game as you will 100% end up with a broken monitor.
Secondly if you want a game with a good community, again i would say not to install the game is full of little shits (Queen- Nai mains) the games annoying and very shit at times and makes you want to tear your walls down. As the enemies are utter shit and it hurts you 
the game is full of un-skilled children pressing the signature button, they should all uninstall 
i personally play the game not for fun, but to destroy every sig-spammer in existence and will not stop untill they are all gone.
This game is 10% fun and 90% aids, i hate this game in every way shape and form yet still launch the game everyday.
WARNING, you WILL lose brain cells playing this game.
"
4637,"I have put many many hours into this game and unfortunately even after following it for years it is still so frustratingly janky. The hit boxes are absolute jokes sometimes and it is so hard to get good at a game that, unless you have perfect internet, you will periodically drop combos. This game greatly favors whoever has the best ping and unless you are the one with the better ping you will forever be frustrated. I am uninstalling and I hope to god I never have the urge to play this game again."

4643,"I really enjoy this game, for being free to play, it's not bad, and I even think the hitboxes, combat, dodging, etc are really well balanced and made, despite the odd nerf or buff... BUT my main gripe with this game is the ranking system, it's coded super simply and poorly, and is as simple as win, gain elo, lose, lose elo. The problem with this is that past plat, the queue times are through the roof, and as such most people make smurf accounts. SMURFING is the problem with this game, and half of all gold matches are smurfed this is a plague constantly lowering the bar and making gold into platinum, and platinum into diamond. so silver is gold now, and if you aren't super good at this game good luck getting absolutely anywhere."

Yet through all of this the most soul wrenching part of my life is Brawlhalla.

I own good platform fighters like rivals of aether yet i play this far more.
It has warped my emotions into nothing but an empty void.
I have decided i will never spend a second more on this game, for my own good.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not even my worst enemy.

4703,"Here is my honest review of brawlhalla

If you are looking for a fun game to play with a large group of friends then this is probably a pretty good fit, it's free and easy to learn and has a butt load of crossovers. The online multiplayer is my main issue. The game is super unbalanced and spammy, really 1 dimensional and gets boring very quick. The community is incredibly toxic. It's pretty much pay to win,I see the same 6 characters every time I play strike out. The heavy tank characters are always at a disadvantage to the super quick easy to combo characters. You could chalk it all down to skill but this is a review coming from an average player. The maps are boring on the small scale, it's like 2-3 platforms. or literally just a small flat stage, not even wide enough to make interesting gameplay. Once you get knocked in the air you're pretty much set to die. The recovery in this game is terrible, and the whole gameplay style is basically wave dashing and edge guarding. I think with more than 2 players overall the game is fine but honestly there are tons of issues with the 1v1ing."
4704,"A fun alternative, weapon based smash bros. Playing with friends is a blast. Idk about playing with public people tho tbh."
4705,good game do recco solid 9/10
4706,This game will convince you to sell your soul. No matter how much you play you will bump into spammers as well as terrible servers that makes you lag unlike other online games that i play. In my entire life no other game has made me want to wish that for that particular game to kill itself. no other game. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME it will be a waste of your time when you can be playing other great games unlike this trash of a video game. Servers are terrible and players are autistic spammers that do not require strategy unlike other great games. If you wish to play this game then Know that you're getting yourself into...

4753,"Fucking toxic kids with lances and axes, bad community, a lot of toxics and SIEGE SPAMERS (47 chromosomes). Like go and learn how to play you fucking bastard, it is not hard to click more than one key on the keyboard. I wish them all the worst. If you play any of these weapons and you are a siege spamer, go fuck yourself and you deserve to live in a trash can, cuz this is how you play ( like a trash ). This game is based on doing combos and not spaming one key everytime you see someone close to you. 
DEDICATED TO SIEGE SPAMERS:
1. Uninstall this game if you dont know any combo and you just siege spam everywhere.
2. Go and apologize to your parents that you were born.
3. Go and try to find some brain cells, cuz in your case you are deficient in them.

Theres even new weapons that i bet are being worked on right now as you read this, so far there i 12 weapons in brawlhalla, this game is updated at least  1-2 months so you have time to get everythinbg in the battepass or if theres not a batte pass out by now, im sure theres some new weekly games that are out.

4890,"This game is worse than horrible. It should not exist.
From the very first minute you play against tryhards with over 100 hours. TRYHARDS WITH HUNDREDS OF HOURS AGAINST FRESH PLAYER.
Greedy company wants 135€ for DLCs.
New Horde mod is absolute boring and cringe.
Player leaving in loading screen for no reason.
Disgusting."

4898,"The game is really cool and the characters are really awesome since they have taken ideas from other projects and stuff. The thing i dislike that coins are really hard to stock on and so are Characters if you don't buy them, but they change every week."
4899,"dont play teros
"
4900,fantastic game
4901,Yes
4902,"over the 4 yrs i have played this game for.
rank, esports scene and combo system is probably all that i can compliment.
and now we're in a state of just promote skins/crossovers nonstop and do nothing with the game worth noticing only until every battle pass season ends/begins. did you know this game actually has no graphics settings either.
ingame chat was also removed because wahhh this guy called me bad word on the game..
clans haven't got ANYTHING worth even being in the game for the past couple years too..like idk do something with it or just remove it entirely
the netcode also feels like i'm at my uncles' flat in 2009 playing street fighter 4 online. (not great for today)
anyway i would only reccomend this game if youre too broke to afford any better fighting game. thats how i got into the game after all. blah blah blah blah 

"
4903,yes bozza
4904,"You can play as Rayman in this game which makes me quite sad because we could have had in actual Smash Bros, but instead we have him in Not Smash Bros. Apart from that this game is geniunely really good. Plus, best of all, you can punch Steven Universe in the face as The Rock himself."
4905,"TOXIC people everywhere, the game should really get rid of some toxic emotes"

4985,"Here's the short review: If you like punishment then this is the game for you. This game gave me anger issues and yet I keep coming back for more. It's free to play so try it and form your own opinion. Just be prepared to be curb stomped.

Pros:
1. Free to play
2. Characters are likable and all have a backstory that you can read.
3. Tons of random crossover. If you want Negan from walking dead and Stephen from Stephen Universe to face the Undertaker from WWE and Ryu from Street fighter then this is your game.
4. Training mode that teaches you how to play for beginners
5. Devs are active and responsive even after 5 years

Cons:
1. The community has become very toxic over the years to the point they removed game chat and replaced it with emojis instead. (RIP emoji ftw)
2. Matchmaking is horribly unbalanced sometimes even in ranked.
3. Skin and cosmetic MTX can be bothersome sometimes

Bottom line: try the game if you want for the low low price of free. I don't care either way"

The one thing I dislike about this game is the matchmaking, It is so annoying to come against someone that is miles above you in skill in a low league.  Perhaps the developers could not put everyone down low in the season reset or something.  Another thing is the heavy attack spammers, it would be great if the developers could make to where its more difficult to climb ranked with that kind of game play.  Thanks"

5066,"Ok im not even going to try to be even a little polite about this review.
i have over 1650+ hours and in the last 50 hours the game is feeling too laggy and I cant seem to get
any stable fps, my wifi is pretty good in every online game but in brawl servers it seems I need to own
a f*cking a server inside my house. Funny thing is i dont have THAT good of a pc but it runs Genshin impact
better than this game, how is that even possible fix the f*cking game devs start listening to your community
and do some better work or are you just some money eating company now? 
The Anti-cheat sh*t is also useless it stops me from playing making me restart the game like im using any
cheats that DONT EVEN EXIST since this isnt a game you can cheat on except from cosmetics which are totally useless. 
The hitboxes are random sometimes you hit them aka rarely, but most of the time they just go through the attacks because they have a ""better monitor"" which is ok if it WASNT F*CKING 99% OF THE TIME
Devs if you are reading this reply to this or you just dont give a sh*t about us old players that are having
so many problems but never get rewarded with small fixes or anything in general and consider yourselves
lucky im not saying anything worse you *ssholes"

5166,As a casual low silver player it's still very fun. Especially with friends.
5167,Hello yes i am begging for steam points
5168,"Starting with the few upsides to Brawlhalla: the game feels smoother than Smash Brothers, and some skins are cool. After sinking 700+ hours into this game across various accounts and peaking over 1900 elo, I can thoroughly say that this game has many frustrating issues that will never be fixed, primarily hit boxes, sound (which has recently gotten worse) and content. Some of the characters have objectively unfair hitboxes on their signature moves which make little to no sense especially when compared to other signatures of the same type; for example, both of Orion and Bodvar's Neutral Sigs should not hit stacked nor grounded but they do. I have a personal problem with the active frames on the dodges which I believe are too long, and I am too impatient to slow down my reads. And finally, this game releases very little content, roughly 2 battlepasses a year, 2 or 3 characters a year, and some crossover sets now and then, some of which are complete trash subjectively (walking dead)."

5174,best 2D esports game
5175,Good and fun game to play with freinds
5176,Eh its okay
5177,If you looking for a game like super smash bros or a fighter game this is a great choice as match's are short and fun. There's also a lot of game modes which is great too. The only downside to this game is sometimes you can get a bit bored of playing so i don't recommend playing this for hours on end everyday.
5178,This game is full of 50 year old virgins who do nothing all day but sit on there couch and jerk there dick off
5179,"TLDR: Breawlhalla is a great platform fighter that I would recommend to casual and competitive players.

Brawlhalla is a great choice if you want to enter the fighting game scene. I recommend this game for three reasons.

1. It has a very good mix of casual and competitive player base. If you want to play casually you can play game modes such as ffa, and custom game mode that come out when a new bundle is released. Such as street brawl. If you want to play this game competitively then you can play the ranked game modes, and even experimental, which is basically a casual 1v1.

2. It is great if you are dipping your toes in the genre. I make this claim because of 3 reasons. Reason 1, it is free. And reason 2. it is a platform fighter which is a more casual version of the normal fighting games such as Tekken 7, and Street Fighter. 3. It has almost a full row of free character that switch out every week.

3. It has a good twist on the genre. Instead of characters having all different abilities they have a mix of two weapons. The only real difference of character to character is the heavy attacks and the mix of two weapons. All weapons have the same light attacks and heavy attacks when in the air.

But Brawlhalla does have negatives. These negatives include.

1. When you are new you don't know how to punish your opponent for spamming. This tends to drive some new players away from the game. And with some weapons like lance it makes spamming really easy. 

2. It is a very floaty game, this aspect of the game creates a learning curve. It will take some getting used to if you came from other popular fighting games such as Street Fighter, and Tekken 7.

5248,yes
5249,"Brawlhalla is a fun game and it can really get you hooked. I recommend it to almost any person that is looking for a street-fighter-like game but a lot less realistic. This game is all about getting combos on your enemy and eventually hurting them enough for them to be knocked off the platform in which the game takes place. In conclusion, I deffinetly recommend Brawlhalla to all ages."
5250,Fun
5251,"Such a fire game, but don't take it too seriously. The more seriously you take it, the less fun it becomes."

5272,the game is amasing and free as simple as that
5273,"Really not a fan of the new sounds, they didn't go through the experimental phase and the game sounds really clunky now, every move sounds either bass boosted and full of reverb or like slapping a table with an uncooked steak. New dodge changes definitely seem promising, but there's a lack of communication with the player base and too much focus on make customisation items."
5274,ITS ITS
5275,"You can punch people and thats pretty neat, but the game gets really good when you get a gun a can shoot people with said gun."

5288,smashing bro is better :0
5289,"game just stopped working everytime i try to play i get a nani sound and it dont open
"
5290,"Unfortunate doesnt begin to describe my pain. This world rewards blind idiocy and nothing else, I am beyond convinced at this point. After getting completely tooled by my opponent using unskilled garbage on me last minute and refusing to provide confirmation prior to our match as to the type of unbalanced nonsense he would use, losing this way somehow
felt even worse than i had thought possible. My preparation was superior, my play was superior, and I lost, so I don't see a reason to continue engaging in an activity where what is within my control is overwhelmingly outweighed by what is not.

I am DONE with this BRAWLLHALLA on a competitive level, and you will NOT get a fond farewell. This community is INFECTED to its roots with a degenerative disease that grows stronger overtime but stops short of killing its host. Games used to
have a competitive spirit at their heart, this has been transplanted and replaced  with an aritificial organ that feeds on vitriol and mockery from insecure little boys that heckle by the sidelines and tear each other to shreds over scraps of attention. The environment we fostered... has trapped us all like this in a vicious cycle, and escaping it requires acceptance of the harshest reality we all scramble to explain away, that none of the countless straining efforts we put ourselves through here will EVER amount to one single shining glimmer of significance. I would this the end, but many are still counting on me and the competitive scene is still going on. I would NEVER leave so many great friends out to dry, so I'll suffer through a few more games for them

One last thing before I leave you all to react with disdain, ridicule, and self-righteous fervor, before you do EVERYTHING in your power to minimize my words and thoughts, box them up and SHOVE THEM to some cobwebbed corner of your memory, and hope they disappear forever as a stain on your finite time ground to dust. From this moment on, nothing you say matters to me. The FOULEST insults you hurl with intent to would calmly settle at the earth
beneath my feet, and the venom you spit will bring all the pain of a warm summer breeze on my cheeks. This game is less than anything ever conceived causing misery to thousands, while I carry on, brimming with joy

Distilled from detachment."

Matchmaking was broken 4 years ago when I started playing on my ps4 and is as broken, if not more, now. weapons are extremely unbalanced (looking at the axe dmg and scyfe infinite combo) and characters are either op or useless. Weapon starving is all over the place and toxicity is also a major factor here. weapon throws have been receiving some attention but it's still bullshit although less than before."

5321,"Game was peak during 2018-2019. It was great during that time, updates out the ass, new characters, great game-play. The game was well optimized and you didn't need a 360hz monitor and super specs. The game is stupidly choppy for no reason at all and plenty of bugs I can lay out on the table. The game play has just turned to absolute mush and it sucks to see the game I liked so much turn to absolute trash.  It feels like absolute shit to play coming back to it and I would not recommend this. From what I can see the developers only care about releasing skins and rarely drop updates to actually fix shit. The hit boxes turned into absolute mush and you can hit people through walls and the ground. This game feels like cutting yourself and then bathing in rubbing alcohol."

Anywho, would recommend."

5328,"this game is very good, and never gets boring. it is pretty toxic and makes you mad when you play with friends, but it's worth the fun. also it's not pay to win and has tournaments, and is worth putting time into if you are serious about it."

The dev does not even listen to the community. One of the major problems is that you sadly can't play this game for a bit of fun. the game itself is of course ""FINE"" but I would probably rate this a 2,5/10."

5490,"I don't play this game often and when I do, I don't feel satisfied. 

Personally, I just do not like the game design choices that the devs made. From what I heard, the reason why this game is created the way it is because one of the devs just didn't like the game design choices of OTHER fighting/smash games. 

Something I notice with this game is that it feels like every attack you do is a big risk. It's not like tekken or street fighter where you throw out a light attack and you don't get punish for it (unless you keep spamming and get countered.) But in this game, every attack is animated for the sole purpose of making you feel like, ""Oh you missed? Good luck."" This makes it difficult for some people like me who are used to being defensive or like to reset neutral. And with the removal of blocking/parrying/grabbing, it is very hard to stay in neutral in this game and forces you to run around or trick your opponent into dodging until you punish him for it.

It feels alot like tag or playing catch up with your opponent while at the same time making sure you yourself don't get hit. The only good things I will say for this game are:
1.) It's free
2.) Doesn't require a strong computer.
3.) Simple while still being hard to master
4.) Don't have to focus on complicated things such as frame data.

This game is easily one of the best pick-up-and-play type of games but has design choices that I personally do not agree with."

5500,"look up youtube guides you'll be fine. its the only game on pc that is close to smash. it can also be totally free to play if you grind for characters. if your reading reviews on a free game i don't know what to tell you. play it don't play it, its up to you. why are you still reading just play it or not i won't tell you how to live your life. oh my god fine i'll give it a rating 7/5 there are you happy now?"

5503,it was fun
5504,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

5545,"Second best platform fighter, but the best one on PC. More fun to play with friends than it is online by far, and it doesn't have the same frustration that smash bros has when your friend is just better than you as the fast movement makes tons of situations redeemable and there is more comeback potential in that respect. On the other hand, the weapons make many characters feel bland and uninteresting, as if you know how to play one scythe character, you know how to play all of them."

5626,"The Game is fun, not pay to win BUT LACKS CROSS SAVE. Make sure you pick one platform and stick with it. You will be frustrated if you do not.

Brawlhalla is a fun free to play Smash Bros Alternative. This Free to Play game is more then fair with its paid content options.

What's Free
- All Fighters, they can be slowly unlocked with gold, you can also pick which ones you want. Keep in mind the newer ones cost more gold, and the prices for characters are reduced as new ones are added eventually.
- Character Colors unlocked through level up.
- All Game Modes
- There are no restrictions on multiplayer.

What Cost Real Money
- Skins for Cross Overs, EX: The Ninja Turtles, Street Fighter, Steven Universe.
- Emotes
- Battle Passes
- Other Cosmetics
- All Characters at once and in the future for 20 USD (Before Tax) If you don't want to unlock them with coins.

Side Note: This game makes it impossible for me to play Smash Bros with a Xbox shaped controller now XD. I am use to the brawlhalla layout on it."

5823,"Man... brawlhalla recently is conflicting. Here is my honest review.

If u are thinking about getting into the game, go ahead, I mean, I've been able to stay in it for 1000 hours and counting, but understand that the state of the game right now is on a rocky path.

We have 55 legends and 53 crossovers, don't get me wrong, that's awesome, but not everyone has a few dozen bucks to spend on that, and those that play for the actual game play haven't received a huge content update since the current test features, and mind you they are only in experimental.

What we need is not new cosmetics but we need gameplay features, i.e the wall-slip mechanics or dodge improvements across the whole game, new legends more often (we're getting one every six months as of late...), tutorials, story mode, better elo system, a new rank, essentially things that will keep players in the game.

Don't get me wrong, Brawlhalla is not dead but it's about to reach the tipping point where the player base recedes as new games come and does it better than it has. It's been around since 2015, and some mechanics are only being polished now after years of being dodgy. You see more and more casual players leaving the game because it isn't fun anymore or competitive players complaining about the state of the game.

Whether they're leaving because of a stale or unbalanced meta, or because there simply isn't anything to keep them in the game anymore, in the end it results in less and less people being content with the game.

My final verdict is that if you decide to invest into this game, go ahead, it IS fun, especially with your friends, but understand that unless BMG does something about Brawlhalla very soon, it will begin to die. A lack of support from the devs in terms of listening to the community results in less engagement which causes the players who love the game the most to be the most frustrated. This is not a healthy relationship. BMG needs to listen to the community more and although we love the game, we need something different than what we've been getting. Cross overs are cool but they cost money and aren't what we need. As a player whose been om the game for 2 years, it is my most played and loved of all time, but I'm starting to lose hope for it.

Please, BMG, if you see this, listen, listen, and do something about it. I love your game, and it pains me to watch it suffer in the state it is now.

5898,"[b]This game would be nice, if the devs actually knew how to fucking program.[/b]

You can consider yourself lucky if you ever come across someone who is not cheating. They have programmed an anti cheat system called ""easy anti cheat"" but the only thing this makes easy is not getting detected as a cheater.

Almost every fucking round, there is someone with KillAura, meaning that they are using a cheat that allows them to hit you at the exact moment you are in the hit range. Hitting those players is pracitcally impossible and if you do, you will hit them once or twice max before they beat you.

I can not tell you the amount of times I have seen some of my opponents literally fucking flying. I hit them all the way across the map, and they casually quadruple-jumped back on stage.

There are people with AntiKnockback too, that will literally not fly anywhere, even if they have taken so much damage before, that they are basically a living corpse.

[b]Not only is their anti cheat complete garbage, but their game in general.[/b]

Every time I try hitting someone, chances are that my hits go right through the opponent. Everytime my opponent tries to hit me, they will hit me without fail and sometimes it is the other way around.

Want to play offline with your friends? Enjoy the total of 1/2 characters that you can choose from. The rest? You have to either buy them with money or play HOURS of the game to unlock one singular character.

I reccomend getting an emulator and getting smash bros. You will not enjoy this game."

5914,"This game quite literally makes it so you cannot have fun nor play competitively since you get matched into people who are either decent/bad at the game or you get matched into people who are really good at the game.  Another thing is the fact that there is only 2 ways to get out of combo's is ridiculous personally! In every fighting game there is a confirmed way to stay out of combo's for the certain amount of time until the start a new one. In this game you only got two options that basically do the same exact thing basically meaning you'll get sent off stage which getting back to stage is genuinely fun to do. The positives about this game are the fact that if you are not trying at all it is fun but that is said for basically every game. Another positive about this game is that there is a good sized roster but I'd advise staying below 60 which it being at 55 currently means they will not stay below 60 (this is a personal thing for MU's). The weapon system is utter trash since majority of the weapons that are busted are on most of the legends meaning that if you hate a certain weapon that weapon is most likely used by every legend which also goes into why there should be something of a weapon balance when there is not.  Another positive to get away from the bad for now is that the Offense, Defense,  equips and stats are a nice touch and done well. This games online btw is so fucking awful when it lags since SOMEHOW IT IS WORSE THAN SMASH LAG! Either way this game is def not for myself obviously however if you like this game than that is great since you can enjoy something I cannot keep enjoying it."

6016,"Super smash bro's but easier but more annoying at the same time. It's better than it for sure but whats annoying is that its ping sided sometimes. Better on controller but is do-able on keyboard. One of the better free games for sure but be ready to get mad because someones waiting for you to press one wrong button to put you on a combo that you cant get out of because his ping is lower than yours. 


On a small note of recommendation is to play ranked 1v1 because it's where you wont be third-partied every combo and buy all the characters its worth it. (buying all characters gives the gold you spent on other characters back)"

6061,"On Christmas Eve roughly three years ago, my cousins showed me this game. Initially, it was just a fun thing we'd play together every once in a while. But then it escalated, and now I find myself playing game after game, unsure if I'm having fun or genuinely losing my mind. The allure of victory and the promise of total domination is the premise of why almost all of the characters in this game are fighting in-universe, and I'll be damned if it's not why I'm still playing as well. I can run, I can pretend that I'm bored of it, but sooner or later Brawlhalla will drag you back in demanding blood and ELO once more. This inescapable hellscape of a game is possibly simultaneously the most fun and the absolute worst fighting game out there

 10/10"
6062,Good one

6064,pretty fun game
6065,not bad
6066,i love brawlinbg wowq my fav legend is queen nAI I  LOVE HER
6067,"This game is pretty good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next."

6076,I would say stick with the bots/ non pay to wins because this game made the mistake of making the pay to win legends overly op and its unfair to me and other
6077,"very fun

I would definitely recommend :)"
6106,This game is very fun with friends and the updates are so good. The only thing I can't agree with this game is the skill. There are skillful players going against players that know nothing about the game. so the skill based matchmaking can be a bit difficult.

6138,"This game is amazing if you would like to spend hours of your day devoted to making other people annoyed, at least thats how it seems. Smash has a less toxic community. Characters just aren't balanced, pay to win (although technically you can get every legend without paying, they takes about one full week to get one 5400g character. Waste of time and money"

6217,"I can't recommend the online mode. Out of 3-4 matches, I was guaranteed to have 1 match where the opponent suddenly went idle and did a same thing over and over. Finishing the match froze the game and you had to quit to main menu. Decided to quit immediately and rejoin when I noticed the idling and the game actually STILL CONTINUED ON THE OPPONENT'S PERSPECTIVE, with one or two of my stock usually lost because I didn't notice and quit fast enough. If this was because of my opponent or my lag, this should NOT be the way Brawlhalla handles game state. This review will change when this problem doesn't appear anymore on 7 consecutive days of playing."

6241,"I am a 41 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 11 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

6331,This game is absoultey without a doubt one of the most sorry not skilled base games in the enitre genre community and games in general ever made. and take zero skill no matter the rank
6332,"terrible game unless u suck so much cock, it makes you more suicidal than if u were to eat 14 detura seeds in one bite. i feel physically sick to my stomach after experiencing only 3 games that felt like an eternity of endless spamming and relentless bullshit, dodging back and forth like they have epilepsy and decided to go to a local hardstyle concert. Game is full to the brim with mouth drooling monkey casuals that suck their own thumbs and figure the only option to win is to grab whichever input device they have, put a blindfold on, take so much speed to the point of potential death and proceed to violently shake and mash it down to a subatomic level until nothing is left other than the sweaty amino acids dripping off their sharp chubby fingers. As well as this we have the other side of the spectrum, the pseudo-intellectual self proclaimed followers of pavelski that try so hard to tick all the boxes of a sweaty tryhard, and also find it in their heart to carry their extremely heavy ego into silver where they repeatedly exercise their heart to 260 beats per minute and look like they just came out of the sahara desert after suffering through 40 days of drought and severe starvation. Overall if your looking for the fastest way to ego death and lose all sanity then i recommend this game to anyone who wants to be dragged by the balls through hell and back by satan posing as a 14 year old mordex player that is so heavy if he jumped it would cause the tectonic plates to vibrate so much that it would send earth flying into orbit, they believe they are so skilled that they might choke on their own semen and die."

I never dare going back there after my 10 match lose streak.

6445,ZZZzzzzzZzzzzzZzzzzz
6446,"Game requires no skill to play, just wait for the other player to attack first and punish them.
Wait, spam, wait, spam, run, spam, literally the entire gameplay.
I saw that there were skins for  the characters you play as, I thought I do be able to get some of them but nah, most of them are pay 2 get. To be fair there are some combos for the characters, but they ain't even worth using since the player would just run away and punish you till you either get launched off the map or quit yourself, it is really frustrating but this is literally all this game offers. The dodge is nearly useless as it has zero to no i-frames when the attacks has like bs lingering and massive hitboxs, only way to actually avoid it for me was to jump over and get launched upward, or dodge behind them and instantly get hit again. I might be bad at the game and that's true, but the one thing I can't accept is that nearly ALL characters despite having clear different attack speed, at least has like 1 move that has no wind-up but hits like a truck (e.g Heavy Attacks), like wtf I don't get it ?? Not all of them are the same but, most of the new characters I played has at least one and it was annoying both to my friends and me, as they can either camp and punish or just comes in and spam Heavies like no tmrw.
Yes I know I spent like an hour on this game or some shit but I don't fucking care, it's just my first impression and it was total crap for me."
6447,This game is a good alternative to similar games such as super smash bros there are constant game mode updates and crossover events to look forward too not to mention a competitive community to play with and annual tournaments to test your skills against others.
6448,A great 2D game to play either with your friends or new people and its a fun great game.

6563,Game is free and fun! Can not complain.
6564,Multiversus > Brawlhalla
6565,garb
6566,better than smash
6567,oke
6568,its ok
6569,Basically free smash bros. with arguably more versatility
6570,"-cringe-

I guess its ok"
6571,It's a decent game
6572,very good very nicce
6573,greasy people
6574,I really look forward to Multiverses. Cooler characters and no weapon gimmick. Future main of Tom and Jerry.
6575,it is pog.

6577,This game was made by Chaonyx and he is also the creator of Hallow Knight

6588,very fun game but there is some players that can be very annoying so if you have anger issues then not recommended other than that its fun
6589,
6590,Its free. get it
6591,"The console version was so good! They can't mess up the PC version, right?
The game lags for no reason sometimes and there no exit button to quit the game so if you changed you're controls you'd either have to go all the way to settings and change them or just see what it is or type every button on you're keyboard. The controls customization sucks. And the game lags a lot when I quit and when I join and takes a dumb amount of time to play. You also have disadvantages on PC. You literally can't aim down."
6592,good game
6593,"I can't believe how badly optimized this game became. 
Frame dropping makes it impossible to play, even on a 12GB Titan V GPU."
6594,"This game can be very fun multiplayer and single player. There are ranked gamemodes and casual gamemodes. I definitely recommend you and a friend or just you play this game, it's very fun. Brawlhalla also supplies loads of characters to try and so you'll definitely find the right character of your liking. Once you've gone through all the characters and you find out which is your favourite and which one you're the best with, you can then go into the item shop and go buy yourself a skin (they're not free and they're only cosmetic). There is normal brawlhalla skins to choose from, and crossover skins. This game is crossplatform, crossplay, and a whole lot of fun in this free-to-play, platformer fighting game."
6595,game's just kinda bad
6596,Hate it
6597,I love it
6598,"I like this game, very much"
6599,The concept is great but for the whole few years I've been playing there are always lags and also bugs that kick out some of the players when trying to play in a room with friends. Get your stuff together and fix them already!
6600,This game will suck your soul in the early stage's of pure sig spam nothingness. Later stage's you better be ready to make this game your life's purpose if you do not wish to be obsolete after 2 days of not playing.
6601,"genuinely the community is so bad
the game itself is fantastic but the people who play it are so ridiculous that it basically cancels out
bmg i love you and your work but the community for this game is absolutely terrible"
6602,Smash Bro's?
6603,good
6604,This game is very fun with friends and monks.

6610,Best Game
6611,Its cool and fun. But only when you win and myself is pretty good not to brag tho.
6612,Brawlhalla has better black people representation than smash. Smash only had Donkey Kong. 🤨
6613,Very good game (recommended to try)
6614,smashed and got smashed
6615,yes
6616,"As a Smash veteran this game just never felt good or satisfying to play, the Weapons gimmick is terrible too."

6632,brawlhalla is very fun once you get into it. It can take a while to get adapted to how the mechanics work but if you've played other fighting games before then I wouldn't worry too much.
6633,se a of thieves were sailign with tyyteam where heading uop nowt
6634,good game ig umm yeah
6635,it good
6636,the grind dont stop for no one.
6637,Just kinda...Sucks. Just go play smash or rivals
6638,good game nice
6639,its pretty fun but gets confusing if someone's character is the same colour as yours
6640,i hate this game with every fiber of my being. biggest woman reppelant. ive uninstalled this game twice within the last week. I hate brawlhalla. the game is pretty cool tho you should play it
6641,"Alright game except the community is full of players with 2000 hours that just want to smurf in ranked so they can have some sort of validation. If you're a masochist you'll love every part of this game, getting destroyed by someone half your age, losing ranked matches until you want to rip your eyes out and of course getting your ears blasted when the announcer screams ""WELCOME TO BRAWLHALLA"" every time you open the game."
6642,"Worst platform fighter I've played. 

Mobile was this game's intended platform, yet it took forever to come to that of all platforms. At it's core, you'll find jank hitboxes with a huge deadzone surrounding your character (regardless of weapon) where your attacks do not register whatsoever. You could throw an object, but it'll phase through the person in front of you if they're close enough.

Multiplayer, casual or ranked is FILLED with spam of all sorts. People either dodge constantly, or spam signatures. Aside from that, there's also the players that run constantly and only drop in to take kills from others who run if pursued. 

Internet speed seems to play a large role in how quick you're able to attack and how well everything registers compared to others. Thus is astonishing considering how simplistic the game is.

As someone with 300+ hours on record with this game, I can safely say it's a trash heap. A burning sack of shit. 
Don't waste your time with it, go buy a 2nd hand copy of Smash. It's even worth going to the extra length of getting a second hand switch if you don't already own the console."
6643,fite mi
6644,Good Game.
6645,"non ranked gamemodes doesn't have a real matchmaking one match you face new player other match against good player 
smurfing which is when someone makes alt acc and play ranked against low level players a dev did that during a stream
doesn't have actual unranked 1v1 the closest thing to this is experimental but it is used for test features 
very outdated tutorial
no servers for players from middle east and africa"

Great if you have a few friends to play with since it's free and most of the characters are balanced *Cough* Jiro *Cough*. Brawlhalla is very skill-based and quite competitive in Experimental 1v1s and ranked 1v1s so if you like competitive skill-based action I recommend this game. It's also really nice how you still earn money if you're just casually playing with friends so you can unlock Brawlhalla's huge cast of characters. 10/10 game would recommend."

6826,if you dont have a switch to play smash bros this is a good alternative but i wouldnt stay better

6910,"Unlike other games in the brawling genre, this game had crossovers from Cartoon Network, WWE, TMNT, Capcom, etc. But I think the game is most popular based on its' reviews through  the players' feedback. It's the ultimate game to play on Steam!"
6911,"-Bad thingssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
To play this game you need a lot of calm,well you will find tons of bad things in this game ,like some toxic dude on ranked match,a guys who spam Nsig all the time and a SKIN FLEXER, i have no idea why they want to shows off their skin that much(i agree with those guys the skin kinda cool tho,and kinda costly).
-Good things?
Well i can say it totally free and it has a lot of update and event i guess.
-Gameplay
EASY.fight and get the enemy of the stage,45 character you can pick each character has 2 weapons 3ways of attack light heavy and mid air and each ways has another 3 ways on it (If you want to be expert on this game you must learn code so you can  play easier and combo ),you can triple jump on this game to but you wont be able to jump again until you reach the stage floor.
Extra Example movement code-Nsig Nlight Nair Dsig Dlight Dair Ssig Slight Sair Gp Gc Re
-Mode
There will be a lot of mode you can play on this game,but let me take this shorter.
Free for all->a 4 people death match game well simply.You knock them of you get point if they got you,you lose the point.
Strike out ->a 1v1 game you and other guy have 3 stock each stock for on character so in this mode you can take 3 character with you,and who the first go to zero lose .
Friendly 2v2->a 2v2 3 stock game one character andno team dmg.
EXPERIMENTAL 1v1->well same as freindly but 1v1 and more painful
Ranked(2v2and1v1)->2v2 has team dmg that it,1v1 is an actul EXPERIMENTAL but have elo and more more more painful
and that it that is what 140 hours on brawlhalla teach me.
Dont play this game go do something else.And hell yeah welcome to brawlhalla"
6912,Brawlhalla was such a good game until they added orb and greatsword. I still play though :(

7015,"This game has consumed thousands of hours of my life, made me punch things, slashed my tires, fucked my wife, killed my dog, burned down my house, stole my savings, and cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical, legal, and therapy related fees.

 This game will objectively make you worse for having played it, and will take a larger physical toll on your body than a smoking habit. 

You aren't even safe when you close your eyes at night, your dreams will be spent workshopping combos you will then apply in real life.

How to fix Xbox controllers on Linux/Steam Deck:
For at least Xbox controllers:
1. Right click on game in list
2. Properties
3. Controllers
4. Disable Steam Input in drop down menu.
5. Reboot game.

Tested and working with Proton Experimental on Ubuntu 22.04, with the Xbox USB dongle using Xone from Github. (Needed due to RF controllers, not BT)."

7083,"Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only to appeal to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players. Once they’re hooked, it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards. There’s just so much here, and I’ve rarely seen a game with so many enjoyable and replayable ideas in a single package. Playing eight-player matches and classic four-player brawls are only the beginning, and I don’t see a reason to stop playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U for a long time.

7088,"i would recommend this game primarily for its game play for being a free smash bros rip off(with its own unique characters, i would NOT however, recommend this game for the absolute money grab attempts at any and all content within the game. luckily they have an in game currency it just takes far too long to get anywhere. want a new character to play? only 5400 coins. oh whats that you say, win a fight you get 30 coins sometimes less, Lose you get some coins but its so little that playing the round is literally not worth the time. i would NOT recommend this game for the fact that as a new player i have been in endless amounts of fights against absolute tryhards leaving me no chance to even have fun nor am i able to adapt and attempt to increase skill. IF you do decide to play this game, be warned, the bow is absolutely over powered, despite there being like a 50 character selection give or take only like 7 characters are ever used (by the tryhards). i will give the easiest tutorial to this game ever, pick a side and attack it, once the player is off the edge, keep attacking, and spamming while calling out loud ""OH THITH GAME ITH THUPER FUN! I LOVE FIGHTING TRYHARDS MY FIRTHT DAY PLAYING"". this is a positive review, i just do have to extremely express the super negatives of the game along with the extremely toxic gameplay. and it is not the players fault for getting paired up with you, its the shit programming of this game. i personally enjoy this game for about an hour before i absolutely rage out because of how constant all the negatives take place... highly recommend this game as a party game amongst friends, you do still get to earn coins at 30ish a piece in custom games which is a grand concept that i love was added, means players are not forced to play against randoms online. i give this game a 3 out of 5 :)"

7100,v good v yes. i hate sig spammers
7101,This is a good game for people without a switch and/or ssbu. After playing both Brawlhalla and smash I can say that smash is much better in pretty much every way. The only thing that Brawlhalla does better then smash is by having a lag free experience which is the same with 99% of smash games. I would recommend Brawlhalla but at the same time say that smash is worth the price tag and Brawlhalla is more of an alternitive.

7233,"This game is my jam! Don't let the cartoon feel fool you, this game is very skilled and technique based.  The ranking system dose a great job at always providing challenging players. Most player are pretty descend and respectful with only the odd player being a jerk. The game is very accessible for new comers as there is non ranked play. 

All characters are playable if you put in enough time. There is new selection of characters to choose from each week and you can quickly purchase a few of your favourites with in game currency so you can play them all the time. If you want to purchase all the characters with in game currency it will take some time. All other real money purchases are cosmetic only and don’t effect the game play at all. Some of the purchasable crossovers skins are annoying, but once you get used to them it’s not really an issue. 

If you like brawling games this is a great game!"

7241,"Don't waste your time. They only care about skins and give 0 damn about the gameplay. Even the best pro at this game quit it after 3 years because still there are weapon throws and there is 0 reason for someone to be aggressive. If you want to hit diamond? Yeah, never attack first then punish your opponent for attacking first. Easy gameplay. Waste of time literally. And, the worst part is they don't even give a good look for the MS for each frame. The game literally runs bad on a 3070ti with a next-gen CPU. Feels choppy and not smooth. Oh, btw, if you want to go pro, make sure to buy a 360hz monitor or even higher if there is even one because you will be slower in your gameplay due to frame loss with lesser hz monitors. Have fun playing this pay to win on PC and take all my money because I only care about costumes game. Wasted 1820 hours for no reason. Stay away from it."

"
7249,"it's a waste of time but idk why i still end up playing this game just to make myself vexed
"
7250,"Oh man. Brawlhalla. I really thought this game had the potential to be a really fun game back in 2018. I spend at least 200 hours on PC alone with the majority of my almost 1,000 hours going to Playstation, cross play comes along and suddenly, it feels like every attack from every legend in this game do pretty much the same things but in a different a flashy way. 

The mobility options in this game makes it feel like I'm playing cat and mouse simulator because the most optimal way to play this game is to wait for your opponent to make make a mistake and then bash them in the face with your weapon's highest damage combo while their dodge is on cooldown. this is the most tilt inducing game I've ever played in my life and if you have never played a fighting game before, this is not the fighting game for you if you want to get invested into a fighting game. if you have played a fighting game before, the initial skill curve is pretty low, and there are many ways to make the game as unenjoyable as possible to play for your opponent at all levels of play because you can easily create situations for your opponent to be put in a terrible position and waste all of their defensive options, even without knowing any game sense. 

Speaking of defensive options, they are god awful. being able to use attacks mid string after being punished for a bad dodge to deny your opponent of their well deserved string is absolutely absurd and requires no foresight to utilize. there should have been at least 1 other defensive option to create an opportunity to counter attack through deep understanding of defensive mechanics in any fighting but they are not complicated at all. The only defensive options in this game are to use your dodge, perform a wake up attack that has higher priority and lower start up frames than your opponent's attack which is likely to happen with many weapons have a low start up frames, or to avoid your opponent all together which, quiet frankly, is the very reason I am making this review. 

This is by far the worst fighting game I have ever played and is the last thing I ever want to see on my profile, and in my invite inbox. I genuinely regret thinking this game takes brain cells when really you don't need to think too hard to pull of easy strats, especially when they are the most optimal strats in the game. And if you manage to consistently play the easiest way possible in high plat and above and get rewarded for it, there is clearly a problem with the game fundamentally."

Your servers are awful.

Playing matches where your character literally teleports across the screen is unacceptable in a game that tries to take itself seriously with esports, and makes for an intensely unsatisfying experience. Mid-to-high level play has players having to time dodges and combos with literally a couple of frames as a window for your inputs, and now my character has teleported/rubberbanded clear across the map? Are you kidding me?

This is supposed to be an online multiplayer game. Get servers that can make that happen."

"
7385,HELL YEAH. love this game. simplistic but fun as hell :)
7386,"This game is pretty good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next.

7393,"As fun characters as this game has, I honestly cannot recommend it if you're the kind of player who wants to play casual 1v1 matches online with customizable rules. You know, like in Smash. That's literally the only game mode I want to play. 1v1 casual matchmaking. Is it that fucking hard to implement? The closest things to that in this game are just some insanely annoying 4-player timed free-for-all mode, which is definitely not what I want to play, or RANKED 1v1 matchmaking, which (surprise surprise) isn't exactly a place where a first-timer could learn the game and have fun doing it. I was completely destroyed there, yet my rating only went down -15 from the default rating (1500 iirc?). So I'd have to get my ass handed to me like a hundred times before I'd get opponents my level.

I'm sure this game is fun in local couch multiplayer, or maybe even 2v2 online coop multiplayer with a friend. But for people without friends, just nah."

The more hours you put into this game the deeper into the pit of depravity you become, with a grand total of 740 hours that i have wasted into this cesspool of brain-dead monkeys i'm past the point of no return.
My family are becoming increasingly worried as i scream profanities even if i win. There is no worse experience than seeing a Princess Bubblegum pull a woohoo as you watch your character fall to its inevitable death.
You will find an undescribed rage for Teros and those simelar to the point where even those around you that you thought you loved become punching bags as you find yourself having gotten 3 stocked by N-sig.

7424,What an awesome game i've switched from multiple accounts on every platform this game can support spending thousands of hours playing this game. Maybe not as iconic as Smash bros but it makes up for it with its unique system of battle and vast roster of crossovers and weapons that just make me turn my head to run back after a long day. I'm truly astonished looking back at this game and how far its come. A Solid 9/10 in my opinion
7425,"shit game. unbalanced and 99% off the players are nolife tryhards. smashed 1 keyboard playing this. unless you have 1000k hours to use on practise and watching boomie tips and tricks, dont touch this game. save yourself the pain. 8 HOURS LATER ITS STILL FUCKING SHIT.  only played by fucking shitkids at the age off 12. no lifers who use 283y58726y43875623763 hours on this shit ass unbalanced game. go mordax and rape everyone with the fucking schyte and call your friends on dc and bragg off how good you are. 0 skill game. spam and run fast. enemy gets 10 dodges a sek i get 1 maby if im lucky. and my speed???? ass. the enemy has 100% speed boost.  and the dmg they do is also 1000% more effektive. i want my fucking sanity back."

Awesome sound effects, awesome graphics, awesome gameplay experience, awesome mechanics, everything is awesome. This game is a must!!!"
7443,"The game called ""BRAWLHALLA"", is not fun. Why is brawlhalla not fun?:

In brawlhalla, they don't offer you a good matchmaking system, that's said, you'll play against Diamonds, when you're silver etc. This game isn't your time worth playing. 

If you are playing this game, or thinking about playing this game, then re-think.
Brawlhalla, is between (very good players), and (SPAMMERS).

Edit: (I will change my review, if brawlhalla gets a good match making system)."

7511,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Yes, this is an SSB clone, but it's also much more than that. The game's fluid, gorgeous and satisfying. Also, it's free, so why don't at least give it a try? There aren't many different movesets, so it's not as hard to get into this one compared to other fighting games.

[h1]Brawlhalla![/h1]
I don't understand the hate towards this game. Yeah, it's an SSB clone, but it's on PC! Heck, it's even on mobile! Do you see SSB on PC? No? Well here you go!

Look, yeah, this game is not perfect. The networking can be a bit iffy at times and the focus on weapon movesets instead of character movesets makes the game feel a bit more samey. One could argue, however, that this is actually a positive, as learning the moveset of one character can transfer over to multiple other ones, making the learning curve significantly easier and helping new players understand the game.

Also, I don't think anyone will deny that this game is gorgeous - its animations are incredibly slick, its character design is top-notch, and many of the skins are great. During actual matches, fights look a lot like dances, as legends weave and parry each other. Most of the time, hitboxes feel fair and hits feel deserved. Very rarely do I get frustrated with the game (when I do, it's usually due to lag issues) - I mostly get frustrated at myself. It just seems like there's always room to improve with this game. It's great.

So yeah, I do recommend Brawlhalla. It's a polished, simpler version of Super Smash Brothers, available for free on PC, Mobile and consoles. If you like SSB and avoided this game thinking it's just an SSB clone, don't. Yeah, it's a clone. But it's also more than [i]just[/i] that."

7599,the grate sword was the worst thing to happen to this game. The weapon itself is just broken with hitboxes that extend way too far with too much damage and when you get hit once it's nearly impossible not to get hit by the other two stronger hits. And ever since they came out with the weapon and even before the new characters aren't fun to play with but are absolutely awful to go against with them being used to SPAM heavy attacks that have nearly unpunishable hitboxes. Overall Ive put too much time into this game for it to implimenting things that are just less fun to play as/against copies of older characters (Jayun/GreatSword are the best examples that the devs are too busy trying to make new stuff then trying to make that new stuff good)

**DON'T**

the game is completely filled with Pay-to-win people who can just simply combo you to high hell off the edge, and the damage systems between you and your opponent is always ""better/more expensive character wins because haha screw you!"". the ""premium"" characters all have a huge stat boost over the freely available characters and this is why you should not play this stupid game."

Yea, heavy attack can be spammed repeatedly, with minimal to no cooldown whatsoever.
Haha you bad, just dodge and blah blah, so WHY? Why spammers don't have to do anything?
Why would I need to learn how to combo and dodge or whatnot?
This is how discouraging the game is designed around.
And yet you can still see tons of spammers going in ranked, where you thought you'll be playing with others who learned to play the game... NO, you still see 8 out of 10 players ONLY press heavy attack to win.
They don't have to do anything, just press dodge randomly, or you missed one or two attacks, then they hit some heavy attack, you're gone.
Just why would I need to do so much to enjoy or play a game?"

"
7683,"I've lost many games, BUT on the upside, I've lost many friends."
7684,"Since this is a game I care about, I'll give it an honest review...

The first thing people say about Brawlhalla, is that it's basically a ""Free version of Super Smash Bros.""
I mean, it plays similarly to Smash (Given the premise/main goal is the same), but there's a few things that differenciate Brawlhalla from Smash.
For example; Some button inputs are different, combo strings are different, all neutral attacks are the same (depending on weapon type), the characters are more lovable (in my opinion), there's lore (if you care about that), and so much more...

With that out of the way...
It's one of those 'Easy to play, difficult to master' type deals, which severely hampers newcomers who are just starting out and learning the ropes.
If you play with your buddies, cool. You'll enjoy it. It's a fun way to kill a lot of time.
If you play online... you'll be put up against one of the most toxic playerbases known to planet Earth.
They will do anything to win. I'm often put up against spammers, cheaters or near-(if not) Pros.
To put it simply, 'Matchmaking' simply does not exist. (And do not even get me started on Ranked...)

Apart from unlocking Legends, you have to pay for *everything*.
Weapon skins, emojis, taunts, outfits, skins, colours...
I know the devs have to make their money. But the pricing is ridiculous...

Anyway. TL;DR:
Brawlhalla is a lot of fun, and it's easy to pick up and get good at.
On the other hand; The community is *very* toxic, and everything is rather expensive.
I recommend on gameplay alone."
7685,never play this
7686,it's cool game [for bad pc]

7690,its fun takes some getting used to but people do spam sometimes but the graphics are great its smooth and now and the more often i find really nice people and sometimes mid game for fun we have like kindof a dance battles but i think its fun and i am having a great experince.
7691,Shit ass game is full of toxic sweats that like to eat ass all day long and live in their moms basements. :)
7692,this game makes me want to break something
7693,"Just... don't even consider playing this. Just don't. You'll be doing yourself a favour by googling up clips from Brawhalla """"""championships"""""". The opposing players only bait an attack from the other, which they dodge with perfect efficiency, and then throw them into an infinite combo. The game isn't fun at all, and controls have this wierd delay to them, especially when trying to pick up weapons."

7761,"This game is not good. That being said, for a free game, the developers care a lot about it. I respect that a lot. However, as someone who plays competitive Smash, this game is much lower-skill and has a lot of stupid mechanics. Overall, it's fun for those who want to play with friends in Custom Games. The ranked system is frustrating when you get paired against veterans who have played for five years. Overall, would not recommend."

7764,"Memories broken
The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be bloodshed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be bloodshed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity
Wondering have I gone insane
To find the truth in front of me
I must climb this mountain range
Looking downward from this deadly height
And never realizing why I fight"

The gameplay is amazing, I love the fact that people can recover whenever they want and there is not cooldown on sigs! There are so many different characters! What characters, I only know Kor Hattori Wu Shang and Mako? There are so many combos you can pull off with this diverse set of weapons! Combos? I only know sigs. I love that there is two sets of gamemodes so that the experenced players can be seperated from the noobs! Eh fuck it, I know every combo possible and can read people like a book, why not play FREINDLY. The lesson is, dont play online.

7943,"The hit boxes are jank, spamming wins most matches and I despise this game. Just go play Super smash bros instead"
7944,everything
7945,"After playing this game I now know why it's free. A company that over looks so many little details would never make money off of selling a game like this. It's fun, but that's sometimes ruined by bad hit boxes, not knowing what moves will over take what moves (because its entirely random and probably rng based), and huge openings in some of the characters basic attacks. If this game wasn't free it would be dead. Only thing saving it is the fun aspect of having a free 8 player brawl game that I can play on the PC. Overall if i had to choose between this game and Super Smash Bros this game is  pathetic in comparison. Great game for a seemly small company, but way too many small things over looked that shouldn't have been in a fighting game. Edit: I play this only with friends now, and still face the same problems game is only good because it's free."

Every character is viable, there is so much drip available, you can play everything this game has to offer for free and the community is fantastic! I have played so msny fighting games from samurai showdown to mortal kombat and the way this game grows as you get better is unparralleled and best of all you almost never feel overwelmed.

Matches take up to 5-6 minutes - one more game doesn't mean you waste 62 minutes of farming just so your teammate isn't in the mood for winning. It's an amazing couch party game - not only for the people who are playing but for those who are watching as well. And you can play it on different platforms.

8026,"Pay to win with unreasonable in-game currencies. (yes plural) Not to mention, the higher you progress, the more toxic the community gets. But you likely already figured that out. It's just not worth your time or money honestly.

If you're still reading, then it should be noted that they have things like country flags, sexuality flags, and gender identity flags all locked behind an in-game currency wall. Despite claiming to ""support"" said communities. And last time I checked support with conditions isn't actually support, because when you boil it down it just turns out to be a glorified bribe. 
So, if the developers are reading this, make flags and support emotes, flags, etc FREE for all players. THAT would be showing one's support towards a cause, not only is it the right thing to do but it's also just financially smart. Because at the end of the day it boils down to 2 things.
Players shouldn't have to pay to show our support for a cause, especially when they are things we can't change like place of birth or sexuality.
And, letting us show our beliefs or those we support like stated above, increases customer loyalty and purchases over time. 

The game itself CAN be fun, however I can't give a good review on a game that is pay to win and asks for my money just so I can show my queer or non-binary friends that I support them in a game they enjoy. It's that simple. Until this is changed, I can't reccomend this game to people. Sorry devs :/

The straw that broke the camel's back today was the passive players. It's been however long since the last patch and it was supposed to encourage active play. But it seems that everyone I play takes the passive approach once they start losing and it just sucks the fun out of it for me. I was born in the 80s and grew up in an era where fighting games required skill and precision. Brawhalla requires some skill, but it feels like the developers have consistently been pushing the lines toward approachability to the point where anyone can pick up the game, pick an overpowered character, and have at it. Don't mind me. Just an old man yelling at the sky. I gave it an honest college try, but it's just not for me anymore."

The devs are pretty cool and you can get free stuff by watching their twitch channel. Overall its a pretty awesome game. it just gets a lot of hate because people are salty."

8159,"Right off the bat i'm jumping into this cesspool of a game. From the store the game looks like a generic 2d fighting game with various attacks and combos, god was that a fucking decoy for the hell sitting behind it. First off you have 3 jumps a dodge, and the dodge can be used for even more distance depending on what character you pick. By the way practically all the characters are the same they all have basically the same weapons which is the same move set besides the signatures or the smash attacks. you might say oh but the stats of the characters is different so they are not even close the same. The different stats for the characters isn't wide enough for it to be looked at players with a serious eye unlike smash where each character is extremely unique to fit someones play style. This is only the surface of the problems of which Brawlhalla holds. But to someone who has played this game for 400 hours please do not play this god awful smash copy.

8191,"If you're a fan of bad netcode, hitboxes that are nothing like how they look and/or hitboxes that are much larger than they should be, character imbalance, terrible matchmaking, toxic gameplay, unbalanced weapons and cheap play, this game is for you.

If you want to win, pick up Orion. His specials are disgustingly fast and large, and he has little to no end lag on any of them. With the current state of the game being centered around waiting for someone to dodge, or try and get in anywhere, a lot of matches can lead to just standing around or idling away from eachother cross stage. When it comes to fighting Orion, I actually just wait for him to get bored. There's no getting in or out of a good Orion; so your best option is to just not play the game. 

With that in mind, any game where your only option is to not play the game, isn't worth playing alone in the first place. 
Only pick this up to play on a late night with friends. The competitive play of this game is sickening."

5- Meet Mordex, Nix, and Mirage mains that obliterates your soul into oblivion
6- Improve and train
7- Meet Teros, Orion, Val, Rayman, Thatch, Ada, Caspian, Ember, Lord Vraxx, Queen Nai, Hattori, Sir Roland and Wu Shang players spamming like there's no tomorrow.

8272,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

This is like a bad bbq restaraunt.  The base meat is bland, but they hope with so many sauces they'll keep you interested.

These fighters can either be super techical --- and I get that angle.   Or they can be super 'fun'.  This one was neither with almost no power-ups, and not a lot of variety of moves.  The matches with 4 players lasted like 10 minutes on whatever their standard play was.  ...and very little in the way of 'amazing breaks'"

Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray. Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.
Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour (another minute).
Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).

Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly. (OPTIONAL: Top with chocolate chunks or chocolate chips.)
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the pan no longer jiggles and is just set to the touch (the brownies will keep baking in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.

8422,"I remember when this game first came out, it was pretty fun back then when everyone was new and once in a while you run into a sweaty pro.

However nowadays, don't waste your time downloading this game. It has it's own community that's keeping this game alive. From silver rank to the top all you meet are just smurfs and main accounts of the same people.

I gave this game a fair chance but nope without playing this for months or years of honing your skills. You won't even enjoy a casual match without running into smurfs 89% of the time."

8444,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

8453,Honestly this game can be frustrating and annoying but in my opinion it is really fun. One thing I like about this game are the different kind of weapons that are available which can lead to many different play styles. One thing you should know about this game is that it takes time to get good at it. But in the end it is worth it.

8474,"After playing this game for nearly 900 hours, and reaching high platinum for multiple seasons in a row. I can confirm the matchmaking system is still the worst I have seen in any game. I guarantee you that most of the games you will play will be with people ranked higher then you. I've just started playing recently again and I'm having trouble making it out of low gold. This is not because I've gotten rusty at the game but because the players I've been up against are people who have quite literally been ranked diamond in the previous seasons (checked using brawlhalla tracker). The matchmaking system has always been like this and the only guaranteed way to progress through the ranks is either being extremely lucky, or by being as good as the diamond players you are fighting. In Brawlhalla it's either you get 3 stocked or you 3 stock them, this leads to boring game play sessions because you're only playing with players far worse, or far better then you. This game would be a thousand times better playing against people your own skill level."

There's no way to remove crossplay, the plague of this game. Consistently bad connection against those crossplay players (not to mention their toxicity) and no matter what the better connection gets punished.
I tried every conceivable solution and nothing works.

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

Baked Pumpkin Pie From Scratch
Cool the pie on a rack, then serve:
Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours.
Serve with whipped cream."

8605,this game is addicting but their is to much cheese. You can do the most braindead sigs and still come out on top and is very annoying. ranked could be better all i see is lances and axes in those games it would be very nice to see a banning phase for weapons or something like that so players are forced to play out of their comfort zones i think this could help shave the cheese. again i can not say this enough their are to many cheesy players.

8666,"This game is one that I love. It is a platform fighter that you can tell the dev team cares a lot for. However they haven't been making the best choices with update as of late. That is why I have been playing less and less that and internet problems. That being noted I love this game with all my heart and can't get enough of it. I want to see the player base grow see more people love the game like I do so no matter how much you feel like you can't play you must. I think that the most you can do when devs are messing up is hope, and hope I have. 

So if you're thinking of picking Brawlhalla up do. Enjoy every second you can this is the game that even at it's lows keeps giving."

8714,"This game is great and I enjoy playing it. However I think its ridiculous that the European server covers all of Europe, Africa, Russia and some of the middle east. NA have two servers whilst we are stretched over 1/3 of the world. it makes for lots of laggy matches where you teleport about and it makes it so stressful and un-fun to play. If you are from any of the places covered by the Europe server, I would wait to see if they bother to fix this problem before getting too invested."

8863,"This game is the most unfair fighting game i've ever played , it doesn't encourage the player to play the game , it encourage him to run away and just fish for mistakes of his opponent, this is not a fighting game its just people trying to see who will have the less mistakes on attacking which basically translate to trying to play the game and kill your opponent !!! When in real fighting games the high risk leads to high reward in this game its high risk low reword type of situation , the more rank you get the more passively you need to play to climb the ranks and its not fun for a player that actually wants to make plays and have fun ....... the best pro player in esports of this game also quit out cause of this and its so funny actually seeing this opinion expressed by the best player in the game by quiting esports even tho he was making a lot of money ...... i laugh at the devs they are retarted cause they clearly dont try to make the game more balanced ........ play this game only with friends ...... if you play rank your soul will never be found again .... and most importantly if you have anger issues DONT PLAY THIS GAME or if you do please have something to punch that doesnt break and also doesnt break your arm .......

It can be pretty hard to learn every character and how to play the whole game in general, but when you do, it feels great! My favorite character is Rayman, a legend that uses Gauntlets and Axe as his weapons. He's the first of many characters to collaborate with Brawlhalla and it's a great first choice! I HIGHLY recommend this game because it's free and there's a lot of competition and replayability! Even though there's a crap ton of microtransactions, you can still play without them!"

It's easy to learn a characters moves because of only have 2 attack buttons and 2 attacks, if you like Tag Team fighting games there is a Team mode, if you like 1v1s, you can do that too! Also, if you want to practice go to offline mode and play in a ternimate against bots, and learn enemies moves. I recommend this game to players around 9+. At 10 I loved this game and got a hang of it quickly. It isn't to hard, and it isn't to easy. Overall, intristing game!"

8883,"Just play winston from brawl stars, he's more cool and fun!"
8884,Its addictive to know there's always possibilities for Improvements :) the strings the Sigs Omg its literally amazing! the reason why i put this over Smash bros is cause unlike Sb you can String combos together in fluid motion. it also balances the dodging and defensive part of the game so it gives you a chance. i got to admit it takes a lot of Readjusting to get decent at this game But once you get use to the mechanics of the game you're gonna LOVE IT. it took me maybe 45 hours to really get into the game but it is really fun once you get into predicting the movements of players you can easily dominate the servers :) goodluck to you all

9020,"terrible game. hitboxes that don't match visuals at all and the go to answer defenders give you is to check the replay and turn on hitboxes and learn them. great fun to have to do that for 50 characters and their 6 signature moves. if you dont learn them then you will lose to them because most of them have a fast moving active hitbox that follows an unnatural trajectory on top of misleading visuals because fuck you. 

weird that smash bros ultimate has 80 characters with more unique moves but doesnt have this problem because the game is actually polished with good hitboxes, good animations and 99% of moves feel fair, unlike this bad bad game."

I am not a masochist I swear, but seriously some people can get really mad at this game for no reason and yet they still play, it's like they think that they can climb but at the same time they complain about sig spammers, and at that point it's a lost cause because some people just don't try to learn how to surpass those that sig spam. I used to be a sig spam complainer, but then I just got better, and now seeing sig spammers is hella funny. I've literally received death threats after a match back when I played on my PS4, but it just made my day happier because they were so heated over nothing."

9118,"very good game, but i need to warn you, playing against zariel spammer has a high risk of ptsd, severe seizures, cardiac arrest and ejaculating all over your keyboard which is unfortunately what happened to me. I think that Ubisoft should implement an osama bin laden legend to represent the middle east and spread awareness of how good of a fighter he is. His weapons should be rpg and gauntlets because lets be honest, who wouldnt want to get fisted by osama. Furthermore, i find the legend ""kor"" completely offensive to those with erectile dysfunction such as myself, the fact that ""kor"" is a rock and rocks are hard really hurts the ED community as we are unable to display such characteristics. Everytime i see a ""kor"" my penis cries in pain as it is humiliated and ""singled out"" by Ubisofts choice of characters. Overall enjoyable game. Should not be played by under 18s."

In a instinct based fighter game like this any amount of lag will cause your games to feel unfair. I have ~400 MB/s internet speed."
9169,this game feels like someone in their first year of college tried to make a smash clone.
9170,its a good game a first but the once you reach ranked iron and gold its full of spammers and immpossible to get out of combos and its o so very toxic and all the skins are pay and their is a clear unbalenced bralwers one of the most toxic gamer ive ever played take it from me ive played this for almost 150 hours and it doesnt get better

No fun getting destroyed in ranked, experimental, ffa, anything really. even ranked when people are supposed to be at my skill level Im getting destroyed. It may be that I'm just bad, but that's no excuse for the casual game modes. It's like 1v1ing boomy or cosolix in those lobbies. Just really unfun, hope the devs do something about it instead of releasing one of the worst legends in history, seriously Arcadia is ass.

Edit - Wanted to peep Ezio, he's mid. Went to experimental and now people are babys. Dude was literally same stock with orange health but gave up afterwords. Just started jumping around the rest of the 5 mins. Fuck the players and the game."

9179,no
9180,i would recommend this game as it is free and isnt pay to win. The game is fun with a friend or just queue into a public lobby. Get the game if you want a 2d fighter game that takes skill. Its similar to smash bros and other similar games.
9181,Honestly it can be fun for a bit but be careful but about the extremely sweaty players who camp lower ranks.

9189,"play this game only if you have motivated and nice friends
the matchmaking sucks: from one game to another, you may 3-0 someone and just after get 3-0 yourself
it really needs to be fixed
also spam is too powerful (good players may be beaten by lower rank and less skilled players)
I personnaly have over 600 hours in this game and I still get destroyed by spammers when I'm not in my best form
I'm not saying the game is not fun or enjoyable, what I mean is that knowing when to stop is important
please consider these warnings before getting into brawlhalla beacause it's a very frustrating game"
9190,"There is one optimal weapon which is the scythe, using this weapon to deal dmg than signature move to kill your opponent will always be the meta. Dodges are seemingly infinite which is why scythe is so good because even if you dodge they will continue to tic your bar away. Game punishes the attacker so passive play is the optimal play, that is, not playing at all until attacked. EVEN then its about poking and running away so you can be passive and wait for a attack again. Stay away unless you just want to play your friends in a PvP platformer game

Servers are HORRIBLE there will always be lag for players in your lobby or you"

9247,"The game is good but only for beginners/newbies to fighting games. If you came from smash or other such games then you will be disappointed by the lack of depth in the game as the mechanics include dashing but not much more. However, it is a game that is easy to play (kinda like LoL) with the matches being >8 mins long and it is pretty easy to get into a match (usually takes >1 min to get into a match).
My other problem with the game is that the characters are not very unique as in their abilities may be different but the light attacks are all the same (given its the same weapon) and spamming the special abilities is a big issue. Though you may have heard that the character are all 'balanced' some characters are simply broken as they just spam their abilities with obscene reach and double hits(so even if you dodge once you cant dodge the second attack). 

Overall, Its a good game for casual play and the fact that its cross-play and free help."

9325,"If you're a PC gamer who's thirsty for some Super Smash Bros.-style action, direct your parched eyes at Brawlhalla. The platform-based fighting game tasks you with fighting up to three opponents on floating stages, and attempting to knock them off the platform to score points. Directional inputs change your fighter's attacks, but much like Smash, the character movesets are relatively easy to learn.

Brawlhalla has a standardized set of weapons (with signature moves being the only difference) that are assigned to characters permanently, and playable characters are rotated every week, though you can purchase your favorite characters using the in-game currency."

9350,imma be honest nobody would get this game if it cost money
9351,muito estressante
9352,"if I were to give this an in-between of recommended and not recommended I would. the only reason why I lean closer to the positive is that you are least able to beat a bot to death still and get coins out of it in the custom lobby. if they ever remove that, there would be no reason for me to play this game.

otherwise, if I could I would rather play smash bros or even rival of athers if I ever rebuy that game. this game is only fun when your friends either don't hate you because of certain characters or you hate them for certain characters keep that in mind"
9353,"this game will make you want to kill yourself
i have never felt more rage in my entire life"

9356,このゲームをやめられないheh
9357,Dodging is broken
9358,This game is very fun but hard you need to have good movement and i will say as a person with bad memory you need no combos it's just down right click left or right right click and Ariel up and down right click ur left click is just a combo starter or endear
9359,Literally this is that kind of fighting game in which you actually need to have a good aim and godly patience to hit bro its HARD!

9386,"[Female: We're sitting here with Eazy E]
Believe that 
[Female: How are you doing ?]
Allright
[Female: So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?]

Verse One: Eazy-E

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin, I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin up
Makin sure no punks are runnin up
[Eazy E: Because I'm a gangster havin fun]
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
[Female: Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?]
Hell no! Just trippin off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin on my nerves 
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So... you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

[Female: Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?]
Sometimes
[Female: Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?]

Verse Two: Eazy-E

Wait... for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then... all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin
Shht, I think somebody's comin
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall... don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
Gettin ganked by the E is a lesson
So... is there any more questions?

[Female: Yes, as a matter of fact, there is...
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?]
You mean a 211?
[Female: Yeah]

Verse Three: Eazy-E

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
[Female: Were you slick?]
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it"" 
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
[Female: Is all that true ?]
I don't lie
You see... I'm not mister nice guy

[Female: Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?]
Not exactly
[Female: And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?]

Outro: Eazy-E

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N-W-A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
[Female: What's your real name?]
No more questions!"

My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

9655,This game is very  fun to play with friends and I recommend playing if you have a group of 3+. The legends are very fun to mess around with since they get switched around every once in a while unless you buy them. Honestly one of the better internet experiences you can get for free.
9656,bad game dont play
9657,Not balanced at all. Very repetitive various hit box issues and a annoying player base ruin this free Smash Brothers Copy...
9658,awesome game and community
9659,super smash my ass brawlhalla is the best
9660,Smash: Walmart Edition. It's fire. It's a fun game if you're on a budget but still like smash-style fighting games. The game is very basic although the variety of characters and special moves each character has is pretty nice.

9667,played it for more than 2 hours and already loving it
9668,"Side-on fighting game with interesting and equally enjoyable hours, lots of enjoyable moments, competitive plays, and demands you build teamwork and generously rewards you for it!

Easy and simple to grasp, hard to master. Simple enough to hop in for a game or two or with friends and brawl.
Each character has their own abilities and skillsets, each worth learning and trying out!"

9674,"Brawlhalla is a free-to-play fighting game developed by Blue Mammoth Games and published by Ubisoft for macOS, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series S & X, Android and iOS, with full cross-play across all platforms. The game was shown at PAX East in April 2014, and went into alpha later that month. An open beta became available in November 2015, followed by the game's release in October 2017. As of March 2022, the game features 55 playable characters called ""Legends"", each with their own unique stats, loadout, and available cosmetic skins."
9675,If you dont want to die at an early age dont download this game. Never in my life played with a more aggrevating game. It's whole design is based around players annoying each other in all the ways possible

9683,"I am a Virgin, otherwise great game."
9684,10/10 you suck the fun out of the enemy
9685,"Hello, casual player here. The game itself is well done, lots of different characters, while having simple mechanics and, from my limited experience, a good online community, at least out of the game. 

The in-game interactions though, oh boy. Sometimes people will curse you, sometimes they will be wholesome, and to accept an invitation to a custom game room (where there is the possibility to converse freely) feels like a game of russian roulette, especially after 1v1 games. You'll never know what they'll write to you, and there is a concrete possibility that some people will insult you on the basis of every little information they can gather from your profile, avatar picture, or even play-style (come on, guys, play-style?); among the not-so-few bad apples I met xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, and a whole range of verbally violent people.
Every time I accept to talk to somebody, I really hope it's not one of those cases: it's not like that over half of those times, and it feels good to have a proper conversation or to play another couple of games in all tranquility, but when the worst case scenario happens... I feel awful.
Regrettably this strikes close to my heart, and I prefer to keep this type of negative interactions to a minimum, so my advice for myself would be to not install this game, I'm better off without all the drama that comes with it.

My review stays positive because the game is good, the developers are fantastic, super fun to play with friends, and it's probably for people who have a thicker skin than I do, but I hope that in the future players will change for the better."

9721,"This game honestly has just gone so downhill. When I used to play it back in late 2018-2019, I was enjoying myself. The game was fast-paced, diversity in weapons and characters in queue, all of it. But now the devs don't seem to know how to balance their game without causing another problem. Sure, balancing fighting games is not an easy task but in this game, some weapons are just straight up better than others and the gameplay has just slowed down so much. I wish I could love this game the way I used to but unfortunately, it's not the game it once was."

9784,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family."

9847,"Very fun and addicting game, but obviously there are areas of improvement. 
1. The rocket lance is simply stupid. Yes, I know the weapon isn't frequently used in high tier, but the weapon statistically has the highest win rate out of all weapons (51.91% win rate according to brawlmance.com), meaning at least in silver, gold and maybe low platinum, where most of the player base is in, the weapon is frequently used and drawing out high win rates. While there maybe debates on whether the lance is overpowered or not, it is undeniable that it is a weapon that ruins the experience of the game due to its ridiculous weapon mechanism and hitbox that counters almost every weapon in silver ~ gold. Many of my friends that have started the game with me also have expressed complaints about the lance ruining their experience with brawlhalla. I believe the rocket lance needs a rework (especially in terms of hitbox) so it is more balanced both in low and high tiers. 
2. There are a lot of passive players that simply earn so much from waiting out the entire game and playing like a total pu$$y. This issue also has to be addressed asap. 
3. If the rocket lance is not suitable for a rework, deleting the weapon as a whole and making a new weapon for previous rocket lance legends also may be a good idea because the weapon is beyond the limits of being stupid. 

Very fun and high quality for a free game though, I recommend people to give it a try :)"

9873,"I a good game
"
9874,"Buen juego, entretenido para pasar el rato, buena variabilidad de armas y movimientos, buena diversidad de modos de juego. 

COSAS A MEJORAR:

-Deberían sacar leyendas más frecuentemente. Estaría muy bueno que saquen una leyenda por mes o cada dos meses. Obviamente supone trabajo el hecho de crear un personaje nuevo, pero creo que podrían llegar.

-Lamentablemente no hay maneras de conseguir skins que no sean con dinero real, por lo que estaría muy bueno que se puedan desbloquear skins aleatorias de algún modo. Lo que a mí se me ocurrió fue lo siguiente: Si ganas un juego sin morir ni una sola vez, consigues un fragmento de cofre de skin. Con cierta cantidad de fragmentos (5 por ejemplo), puedes abrir un cofre que te da una skin aleatoria. Y que solo se pueda conseguir un fragmento por leyenda por season. Es decir, si yo conseguí un fragmento con Nix, no puedo conseguir otro fragmento con esa misma leyenda hasta la siguiente season.

-Que se puedan conseguir colores de pases de batalla anteriores. Que durante un pase de batalla se agregue un cofre que cuesta una buena cantidad de oro (15.000 o más) que al abrirlo de un color dé un pase de batalla anterior para una leyenda aleatoria."

Now that is off of my chest, about the game. Do you enjoy getting utterly brutalized every other game? Do you enjoy being taunted as they do? Do you like your keyboard in multiple pieces and your monitor with an added center window for seeing the wall beyond? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions then Brawlhalla is surely the game for you. Its enraging, but once you get one of those sweet KO's and know you're making an 11 year old in Kansas cry himself softly to sleep you'll find yourself more addicted then a junkie in Portland.

10053,"Brawlhalla is a free fighting game with interesting characters. It is a fairly fun game when with other people, however I was not a fan of the gameplay. It could have been much more improved and gave the player a fighting sense as when I play it I feel like I am just running around tossing my enemies around. All characters are relatively similar as the weapon choice is quite limited. However it was still fun enough for me to enjoy.

I am giving this game a 7/10, since it is free and fun to play with friends, but there are other fighting games I would prefer over Brawlhalla."

There's truly not too much to say about Brawlhalla, but that's not a bad thing! Its a free, simple stage-fighting game similar in a way to Smash Brothers. Fun characters, albeit many locked through loot/pay mechanics, but enough that you get some hours of variety. A great free game for someone with a group of friends looking for a game to waste a few hours on."

10088,"Just don't start playing it, Shittiest fighting game i ever played. Clunky as fuck, stupid hitboxes who make no sense. If you want to play a good fighting game go play Super Smash bros or tekken. A million times better than this trash game."

10093,"this is a bad game that never makes you feel like you earned anything, it's super addicting for I don't know why. basically, you don't want to play this game because it doesn't give you any satisfaction.
the only good thing about this game is the fact it's a good party game, but it get's ruined by the fact that if someone is way better than the other players, no one will have fun, and if someone is worse, he won't have fun"

10341,"This game has so much content to offer for a free PvP fighting game. Not only is it an outstanding party game but it has such great communities worldwide and even paid tournaments! A vast variety of heroes to choose from to brawl with and different weapon types to make every game different and interesting. I paid $15 for ALL of the heroes but I regret doing so now seeing that ill be dumping an immense amount of my time into this incredibly well developed game. The best comparison is PC Super Smash Brothers, although it may not be Smash Bros it does have a lot of crossovers like Street Fighter, Adventure Time and The Walking Dead. In my opinion, this game is 9/10. Only thing that can make it better is the constant addition of content, its thriving communities to thrive harder and for the devs to keep doing their thing! Great game."

10361,This game is extremely sweaty with many audio and gameplay glitches which overall negatively affect the experience. I originally started out trying to reach diamond rank but gave up due to the annoying audio bugs and a bug allowing to gravity-cancel twice in a row. This is very unfortunate as the game used to be good imo but has now become terrible. I dont recommend this game to anyone who wants to keep their sanity.
10362,"Great game, loving it really."
10363,its pretty good
10364,yes
10365,"I was told about this game by a co-worker. Great game to get some Super Smash Brothers nostalgia. After a good chunk of hours you realize it is it's own game and more competitive and strategic.

 I like the cross-overs and the legends they have. The art style and play-ability is extremely smooth on keyboard. After 25 hours I started doing ranked with my friend and we are getting stuck around high silver. There are some sweaty players so be ready for some pain and misery. By your next game you end up dominating and it boosts your moral. All in all I highly recommend this game. You can't go wrong with a free game that takes up only 1gb of disk space that gives you hours of fun. Casual or Hardcore this game is for everyone."

10375,This isn't a bad game but playing alone is so stressful. You always have someone that's been playing since beta in their mom's basement. Playing alone is not fun unless you have no life. Playing with friends is fun if you're just messing around and having a good time. The hit reg is like sea of thieves but a little more polished than that. Over all I absolutely hate this game. 10/10 would consider playing again.

10391,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

I repeat, I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone who wants to keep even a sliver of their mental capacity. If you would like a waste of time and brain cells then this game is the way to go. It eats at your soul until there's nothing left of you, until you just become another one of them... a blue Mordex, stuck in silver, who has become nothing more than a brain dead waste of space who has lost his meaning in life. Overall great smooth gameplay and mechanics. There are a variety of legends and playstyles to choose from, which makes the experience somewhat more refreshing. Just remember, If you make the choice to commit to this game, don't say I didn't warn you."
10451,"I consider this game as a waste of time, only play it if you want to compete with your friends, otherwise be prepared to spend a lot of time on this game to improve yourself or spam as many do... And playing this game what will it bring you ? Surely not fun except against friends
 
for those who played this game before, I have the impression that the attacks become slower and slower with each patch, it was much more intense previously.

10453,"Started as a game I played with friends only and the more i am playing it the more I enjoy it,yes there are sometimes the game feels boring but 99 percent of the time I have great fun.Not an easy game to play so there is definitely always something new to learn,also it is free to play which is amazing and its is not pay to win,there are also awesome cosmetics which can be purchased,although I think they might be a little overpriced,but for the game being free it makes sense.   9/10 game"
10454,"Great Game,competitive and so much more."
10455,its not good it doesnt even input your moves right with a controller. Theres no deadzone settings. The controls are fucking stupid. I stop dodge and i go flying in a random direction. The game is bad and should just die.

10472,"It's a good free game to spend around trying to master it or, overall, just having fun with friends in it fighting the world or each other. The game is a smash like fighting so it's a given that the learning curve is pretty steep but satisfying to climb. the game is being constantly updated and even watching the E-sport side of it can be a blast. The community can be a little bit on the toxic side ( as any fighting game ) but the game offers you options to either mute or overall ignore such comments and focus on the growth of skills in game.

Personally, the relationship with the game is a love / hate one but i'm really glad i stumbled into this game. lots of fun, frustration and satisfation. 

I'ts all part of the journey overall. hmu if you wanna game :)"
10473,"is good
"
10474,"This game is living proof of what happens when you give people in Atlanta any form of agency or access to a computer. Let it be a warning to everyone else. (Also the devs ban anyone who complains about the games in the forums from voting on reviews, just to give you an image of what these losers are like)"
10475,"High skill cap 2d fighter, resembles smash but its cross plat so you can play with anyone!"
10476,"there are too many people who steal their parents credit card and no life this game plus there are a ton of hackers
"
10477,"pretty fun game, although I hope you have a few friends, otherwise it gets boring quick for me at least. But great graphics, good gameplay, and overall a fun game."
10478,"nice mechanics, cool game yes coolio haha funny"
10479,this game is boring when you first start. But I swear to god once you start playing you can't stop... it's to the point where I don't know where my dick begins and ends. My dick hasn't been in a 20 mile radius of a female organism since I started playing. I have -1000 earnings (I lost all my 1v1's) and I had to turn to allah. Wallah this game is ass don't play it therefore it's a good game so just don't play it but you should okay.
10480,i can't take it anymore. i can't. it's not worth it. please. save yourself.

10488,"How the f*ck can you remove the chat function in a fighting game??
If I'm completely shitting on some kid, I want to see him insult me using every single word in the f*cking dictionary, it makes me feel amazing and he is letting out his rage instead of breaking his keyboard in half. Do you understand this fucking basic function?

Also, who the f*ck is the 2 iq - 1 chromosome idi*t that coded the match making system? If some fat goblin that hasn't touched grass since birth, is winning 20 matches in a row, he should be INSTANTLY ranked higher so he doesn't ruin matches for other people. Also, how the f*ck can you create a 3v3 mode, that plays like a 1v1, and NOT use the players rank from SOLO ranks? You do realize some diamond monkey that starts playing 3v3s is placed in silver? 

F*ck the devs of this game, they deserve to choke on their mothers lips"

10566,"I have a decent amount of time on the game. Used to be fun, now the devs just put lazy band-aid fixes on major issues. They do whatever they can to put the least effort, non changing updates/fixes that usually tend to either break the game or do absolutely nothing to the game play. I'd say wait for them to actual start fixing key issues. (weapon throws, hitbox changes, anti-cheat performance issues, recycling balance changes, etc...)  I see why Sandstorm left...hope they do what they can to bring players back."
10567,"the game is really good, and i love the legends in this game, but one thing is that it takes a lot of coins to buy new stuff, like different legends or different skins, and the mammoth coins are really expensive too, who wants to spend like $5 on a new weapon skin. i just think that the pricing feels a bit off. but other than that it is really fun, 8.5/10"

10756,Its a really fun game especially when playing with friends and can be played alone online as well. I love how competitive the game can be in ranked and also how relaxed it can be. Its a really easy game to pick up and play but there are very niche mechanics that you can learn to up your game. The devs care alot about the game and deliver frequent updates and keep content flowing and fresh. Definitely a must play game.
10757,"Great Game to grind and to try get better at and constantly the devs are adding new skins and fixing bugs,Is quite challenging though as there as many mechanics that aren't taught in the tutorial"

10791,"This game is similar to Super Smash Bros but it's more for phones and computers, and you have a different range of characters. It's also free, which I really appreciate. There are in game purchases for skins and looks but the actual gameplay is fully skill based, not pay to win. It also runs easily so you can play it on a mac or a PC, and you can play different modes, and you can play with multiple different friends. It's overall just a great game and I especially like playing it with my brother who's in college."
10792,puebes
10793,good
10794,"With every update the game becomes more and more unbalanced and broken.
For the longest time the menu would not pop up in game when I wanted it to. I had to press esc 10 times or more for the game to register I was trying to pause.
For almost a year I cannot join my friend's game through the friend list, so we resorted to joining through the clan tab.
And with the newest update saved replays don't work that were made on the same day, even though the update is compatible with the replays.

I wish I never bought the newest batllepass. Not everyone can play the game non-stop to complete some of the most outlandish missions. With that being said, even the understandable missions don't give enough points, it's easy to see that the battlepass was made to satisfy the tryhards who spend their entire savings on the game instead of the average player."

aha let me rephrase that, wether with friends or sane people who don't know how to play this game.
I absolutely despise people who fucking are ""toxic"" and literally sig spam. And yes I am quite pissed while typing this out but having 250 hours in this game and realising that you only grow when you have opponents that know how to think is the only way you'll grow and quick tip. FUCK LANCE AND EVERY MOTHER FUCKING AXE LEGEND GOODBYE<3 
but in all reality brawlhalla is one of the most addictive games i've ever played and definitely recommend.

10986,"'Yumburger' -Ghandi

Jolliebee's Yum Burger with Cheese features a beef patty with cheese and their ""special burger dressing"" on a soft burger bun.

Jolliebee's Yum Burger with Cheese features a beef patty with cheese and their ""special burger dressing"" on a soft burger bun. Jolliebee's is a fast food chain from the Philippines so you can consider it a Filipino take on American fast food.

While the Yum burger seems pretty familiar on paper and in appearance, it's definitely different from American burgers.

First off the patty itself is heavily seasoned compared to say McDonald's or Wendy's and had a nicely charred crust. While the Jollibee website doesn't list the ingredients of the beef patty, copycat recipes suggest that it's seasoned with onion powder and MSG in addition to the typical salt and pepper. It didn't taste like any seasoned burger I've had. It wasn't bad though, just different.

The cheese was weird. It didn't quite melt into a goo so much as a goo with granules in it. The taste was a bit bland but okay.

Rather than ketchup or mustard, Jolliebee's special sauce seems to be a sweeter, creamy mayo and they do not skimp on it. I get the feeling that their home market must really like the mayo. It was a lot too much for me though.

The bun was the most familiar component and was squishy soft and airy.

Overall, eating Jolliebee's Yum burger with cheese was an interesting experience and worth a try if you're curious, but I wouldn't get it again (mostly due to the weird cheese and excessive mayo although I suppose you can ask for less)."

They did however- give us tons of half baked characters from various franchises, countless brand deals and merch deals, many art style changes, trailers over the years and complete cancer like steven universe and calarts.

It's become the wal-mart of fighting games."

11130,"     This game is really fun. People think it's a Super Smash ripoff, and it may have started as one, but it has blossomed into a great game.

     There are over 50 different characters to play as, and they all have their unique signature moves. The game is very movement heavy, with proper positioning being incredibly important, especially at high ranks.

     The only issues are the balancing and some aspects of the gameplay; the meta changes a lot and that can impact your performance a lot. Because of an overpowered dodge system, it's easy to run away, which can get stale fast.

Other than those points, the game is engaging and kind of addicting. 9/10"

11174,"This is a wonderful brawling game with very engaging gameplay. While I have not played it in a while, I've been going through my profile and looking through my games with hopes to review some of the ones I thoroughly enjoyed in the past, this being one of them.

The graphics look really nice and the gameplay is very fluid. A great example of a smash brothers-like game done right, with it's own take on the genre."
11175,Nah

11179,ดหกด
11180,"trash, horrible gameplay. the dodge mechanic ""is not a bug, it's a feature"", which you are forced to use every time but it makes no sense. you just become invincible for a split second. you have to use it to escape combos, and so does your opponent. but it doesn't work every single time, under the influence of the exact same factors: it works based on your ping. the faster your internet connection, the more combos you'll dodge. questionable design.
in this game you have to be a coward to climb the ranks. you have to take all the weapons from the ground even if you don't need them so that your opponent doesn't get any and you don't have to have a fair fight. also camping weapons and spamming your sig for the same reasons is another viable mechanic. and the worst part? you MUST do all of those things, or your opponent will win no questions asked. look at pro tournaments if you have any doubts.
definitely would not recommend under any circumstances. play smash instead."

11215,"If you're used to classic fighter games, don't play this dog water game. Please save yourself the time, the game is super inconsistent when it comes to the hit registration. You'll hear the move hit but the opponents health won't change, and no it's not my internet. I've played on mic with multiple other people and they've all experienced the same situation. Also the clash in this game is wonky, you'll be doing a heavy move to their light move and the light move will go through. It happens all the time in all kinds of attacks and scenarios. Blocking/Dodging... don't get me started. 4/10 does it work. Very wonky game, go play something else. Trust me."

11232,"Pros: 
-Lightweight
-Runs on everything
-fast paced
-tons of game modes to play
-you can be casual or sweat
-mods (for pc)
-really nice people and easy way to make friends
-tons of characters and playstyles for you to play and master.

Cons:
-in recent years the meta has gotten stale and boring and as of 03/13/2022 axe has needed a serious nerf, and it hasn't gotten one. That has bled into competitive play where gods of this game are being destroyed by day 1 axe true combos. please bmg do something. lol
-the anti cheat makes the game run like poopy
-i'd say toxic community but i have participated myself so i'd be a hypocrite complaining about it. be nice to each other!!
-not ALL crossover skins, but some have animations that need updating because as of right now they have a leg up on the actual character they represent (ie. Val -> stevonnie/akuma, thatch - storm shadow)

overall this is one of my favorite fighters of all time and favorite games. I recommend it to everybody, but none of my friends play it. LOL"

Where it gets kind of annoying is when you start taking the game more seriously and starting to play ranked. I guarantee you, at least one of the times playing this game you will be filled with rage that you didn't know was possible.

11449,"Things i will be covering for u in this fucking pragraph to change ur mind of playing this game

How shit the game is
how bad the dev team is (except the comentaters)
How the meta changes in 1 update
and how bad the gameplay and matchmaking is in this game


How shit the game is
11/10 shithole. if u havent played this game before 2019 dont even try giving this game a chance. its fucking rightclicking simulator for 100 hours in the game (if ur not fucking autistic as shit) and thats fine like ur having fun ur not playing serious or anything ur trying to have a good time but u decide that u want to try to get good at the game u know u learn about combos zero to deaths and thats fine (it isnt) and u try to get to gold or something. thats ur second mistake ur first is even finding about it or now that im thinking about it its ur 5th mistake. the 1st one as i said was finding it intentionally or not. ur second mistake is even thinkink thats its good or something. ur 3rd is considering downloading it. ur 4th is downloading it and getting into a game. then theres the 5th as i said trying to get good at the game (thats when ur world crashes down). now why the game is shit to actaully answer that keep reading cause its gonna become a very exciting :D

how bad the dev team is (except the comentaters)
the game devs think about nothing but money money and ummmmmm money yeah thats it. in the last couple of updates
the only updates are season events with a crossover cause we cant forget ABOUT THE FUCKING CROSSOVERS. the game devs or as i should say rats fucking decided to not add legends and new weapons for more choice NAHHHHH the rats decided its a great idea to do collabs with the most shit possible and what im talking about is that theres nearly as much crossovers as fucking legend in the game and im not overexagerating im pretty sure theres 54/56 crossover legends in the game cause making a new legend is somehow harder than adding a new legend atleast like per month or something but there coming out slower than a fucking grandpa in his car driving at 7:00 AM while ur driving to school. the rats leader doesnt listen to his comunity cause hes retarded as shit and how do i know that? there was a dev stream on the brawlhalla twitch channel and the rat leader was there. everything the comunnity was saying in the twitch chat like ''add more legends'' ''add a new weapon'' '' NERF THE FUCKING WEAPONS THAT SHOULD BE NERFED AND LEAVE THE WEAPONS THATS ARE JUST NOT OP BUT NOT SHIT'' but he was not listening he was gaslighting and trying to act like everything is ok and like not every big famous pro leaving the scenes for multiversus like ETHAN sandstorm boomie pavelski. now we will talk about why they left the game is very unbalanced aswell

How the meta changes in 1 update
the meta in brawlhalla is like on drugs at this point cause 1 frame changes somehow the weapons that arent included in the game and from axe being meta to katars or something else. thats the 1st reason why pros left the game for a better life like the comunnity saw a massive loss because sandstorm left the game for multiversus and its understandable at this point cause i wouldve done the same but im not a pro and im saying i wouldve cause some controls in the game dont work for anyways thats not important because after the we lost sandsorm we lost other big players too like ethan pavelski boomie and mabye more of i havent heard and i think anyone could understand why cause the game rats just dont function properly and the probably the best thing in the game is comentaters for tourneys and stuff. we saw sandstorm dominating anyone consistently being the best player without a doubt to leaving the game? now thats how shit game updates and meta changes are.

how bad the gameplay and matchmaking is in this game 
the gameplay is pretty good............. if u have atleast a 144 Hz monitor cause the input lag and shit that just causes u to not dodge or hit the enemy cause if ur playing with a 60Hz monitor u will be expiriencing unput lag without realizing it at first but when u start getting at like high gold u will realise that ALOT OF FUCKING PEOPLE ARE SOMEHOW FASTER WITH THERE INPUTS DODGE WHILE EMOTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. thats 1 MAJOR reason why i left this game and the only thing i will play this game for is to just finish the battle pass anyways im not important in this little paragraph of mine. now let me start with the matchmaking. the matchmaking in this game is worst that apex or valorant. imagine ur high gold in 2s or 1ns and ur about to 1 ur game into plat BOOM ur up againt a player atleast 50 ELO above ur and in 2s its much worst cause u will be consistently getting diamonds and high plats with there braindead gold friend wich just spams with queen nai or teros and works cause why not and at first u will be like oh cool a diamond ive never seen 1 before but then u will not want to see 1 again after god know how much games u play with dropped diamonds to play with an autistic kid and i know im repeating myself buy i cant get over it and getting plat in 2s is as hard as getting diamond in 1s.
and im finaly glad to be over with this dumb essay to discourage u if u even see are read this before getting good are even downloading it cause its not a good path ur gonna go down. bye bye :)

I'm the preacher
A done decision
Another creature
Has lost its vision
Let it go
Reel it in
For the creature
On television
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
I'm a fixture
A split decision
A pretty picture
A superstition
Let it go
Cash it in
For the creature
On television
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree"

11485,It's a great experience when you want to play with your friends.

11487,"This game is a curse and a blessing. If you are thinking about getting the game, be prepared for rage, and depression but at the same time, you can become happier than using any drug. This game is a bio-nuclear weapon that can be used to ruin anyone's mental in simply 3 or 4 matches. And don't even get me started on the ranked mode in this game. 

Summarized, get this game if you are mentally unstable and want to experience trauma like never before.

Heading into its seventh year, Brawlhalla Esports boasts the world's largest fighting game prize pool—totalling $1.32 million across all regions.

With the reveal of the Brawlhalla Esports 2022 season’s full roadmap, Ubisoft and Blue Mammoth Games confirmed the game would feature four Seasonal Championships and several other events, including the first Japan Invitational. Each Seasonal Championship will feature a larger prize pool than the previous year, with all four events set with a total of $100,000."

11491,"best game out here
"
11492,"Although this game is fun, there is a point in the ranked stage where you are too good for gold players, but not good enough for plat players. No matter how much you practice you can never use those tricks you learned in a offline play in a game because the person you are going against will just not allow you to move"

11524,yeah I like fighting people and stuff I think it's a good game. most creative platform fighter
11525,"I mean it's a game ig, its defo not for everyone, even for some diehard smash fans. even if you really like the fgc its a gamble to play this game, weather ur gonna like it or ur just going to be wasting ur time playing a game you don't enjoy. 
But when you actually enjoy it, its pretty good, I recommend spending some time on it, but just no and the answer for every question for this game is ""get good"" have fun ;)

11636,"I downloaded this game expecting a sweaty, crushing environment with no mercy or breaks. I was absolutely wrong.

I was put in a random matchup and there was another Mordex player, and judging by the cosmetics (solid white color with black accents) they had, they were a veteran player. I just picked up this game, I'm a noob at playing Mordex. They chilled in the corner and slapped people away, but when I got KO'ed, I was dropped next to them.

This monochrome oversized dog man used a campfire emote and i just turned and emoted with them. We had our nice 3 seconds of funny dog friends, then the other two players came over.

At the end of the match.. They got dunked last minute and we tied. They emoted a thumbs up, I emoted a wave goodbye. We both jumped off our ends of the platform.

Vunderblood, if you somehow see this, thanks for proving me wrong. Go have fun, you incredible dog fellow."

11663,"This game is really good for what I use it for. I play the game to have fun in customs with my friends. That being said, the meta and the current state of the game is abysmal. Hammer and Axe are meant to be heavy, but are fast and do twice as much damage. On top of that, you lose if you engage so games go forever and 2 players are left sitting on either side of the stage waiting to engage. You can win by sig spamming lord vraxx at a much higher level than just gold, and everything is countered by teros. This game is really fun for casual players, but don't think about playing a competitive level because it's stale and boring."

11717,"Edit: Yes I have logged a few more hours on this game since my review but it's only to finish out the battle pass missions since I purchased it when it came out

Honestly, this game used to be a love/hate relationship. It was an addiction for a long time, however the last 4 months. I've felt no desire to play this game anymore. I absolutely cannot stand the devs/ community. They don't care about this game nor their player base in any sort of way. They just release new skins every month to grab more of your money. I've spent a lot of money on this game and put a lot of my time into it. I'm finally quitting because no matter how many people speak up about the balance issues, things that need to be changed/ introduced. They do nothing and just release new skins. They nerf the wrong weapons, buff the weapons that were balanced. Change things that didn't need to be changed. The devs just rotate the meta around for each tournament to spice up the game play. There are so many things wrong about this game that could be improved/ fixed if they would just listen to their player-base. Like for example, the weapon throws/ reward for playing super passive ( and by passive, I don't mean playing smart and adapting to your opponents play style. I mean literally just running and waiting the entire game), etc. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way either. Would I have recommended this game in the past? Absolutely, it was different from other platform fighting games and a lot of fun. Would I recommend this game currently? no, I personally have gotten everything I wanted out of this game a long time ago and I only see it going down hill from here. It's just a big money grab. Maybe i'll revisit it in the future if things change. I doubt that will ever happen though. GG shit game"

""do NOT play  this game, 834 hours caused nothing but pain and suffering and as far as i know, it only gets worse.""

""why does free for all exist its filled with a bunch of googoogagas who haven't heard of light attack playing ranked diagnoses you with cripiling depresion 99.99999% of the playerbase are level 100 furry mordex mains who want to be the next sandstorm and havent touch grass in 3 centuries and for the love of god why do characters with 4 dexterity atack faster than my friends leaving me after i 1v1 them besides that cool gam""

""Super spam bros""

""throwing a gun gives more range than actually firing it""
 
""Non-visible form of self harm""

""The game is actual pain""
 
""i got a lot of positive emotions from the game only after i removed it from my pc""

""Rules of brawlhalla:

11916,My friend gave this game a bad review because it's free to play and he doesn't like Super Smash Bros but we convinced him to play it anyway and he secretly had a great time.
11917,"la gente me rulea y me jode. 10/10 no lo volveria jugar
"
11918,ok
11919,"I wish this game wasn't free to play so that my friends would pick another game for us to play since I don't like super smash bros or clones like this one

so now I have to play it with them"
11920,low budget smash bros
11921,Ember best girl
11922,When you first open the game i guarantee you that you will be hella confused. The game simply consits of random spamming but still- it's fun.
11923,"Brawlhalla is a fun fighting game with lots and lots of crossovers. i like this game because its fastpased yet also slow at the same time while fighting, its a bit hard to explain. its a great game and i recommend it."
11924,Good game but when i do ranked matches im new so im fighting other new players but when i do it its  A COMPLETE LIE YOUR SUPPOSED TO FIGHT NEWBIES LIKE YOU AND THEN BOOM FORCED TO FIGHT A NEW PLAYER BUT HAS EXPERIENCE IN OTHER GAMES INEVITABLY MAKING THEM A PRO F I X Y O U R G A M E IM NOT PLAYING RANKED IF IM FORCED TO FIGHT PROS AT RANK 1

11937,"
the hit boxes for the characters are compleatly broken, Cross needs fixing."
11938,"It's a little bare bones looking and lacks the ""Pizzaz"" of smash bros, but stick with it and you'll find a fighting game more balanced and freeing than its overly flashy counterpart."
11939,This game can be fun.. until you run into a queen nai or Yumiko
11940,"omg best game ever
"
11941,"really fun game to play with friends
"
11942,"I’ll start off this review by saying 2 things. If you want a game to waste time on or just something to mindlessly play, this game is for you. If you have a short temper or take games too seriously, this game is most certaintly not for you. 
You should definitely at least give the game a try, because it free. But the reason im leaving a negative review is because im using the terms of “would you recommend this game?” I wouldn’t. The community is god awful, and the balancing in this game is almost as bad. Don’t play this, play another fighting game. If you’re looking at the reviews of a free game, and are reading this negative review, then something inside you is saying that the game isn’t worth your time. Listen to that voice."

You get so much areal freedom that you can make right angle in mid air! 

It's potentially really fun... too bad the community doesn't realize this freedom and all stick to repetitive boring strategies like attack spamming, pacing back and forth, and hitting you from behind. 

And every single taunt is either confusing, why would I even buy that? Or just straight up annoying!

After waaay too many hours of these monotonous attack strategies and taunt spamming it gets pretty old and soul sucking, BUT MAN! When you find someone that believes there is no spoon you'll never feel so alive! It's the most amazing thing you'll ever experience!"

When you destroy your friend and his will to live with a certain map or weapon it takes the fun out of the game and it very competitive. Super Smash Bros is better even though its not on PC. This game kills me sanity and i want to delete this but its funny when everyone is brain ded.

12156,"Just when you think you have found a good smash bros style game you're wrong. You make it into gold and it begins. Smurf city. All the miscreants that make plat/diamond will sit here and beat you up until you literally quit and never play again. Just when you think it cant get any worse, you get knocked into silver and it continues. Its absolutely insane the amount of people who will ruin everyone else rank experience just to smurf for a couple weeks until reset. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. JUST BUY SMASH BROS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD."

12182,"It's a generic free to play fighting game with lazy developers. Ranked is full of toxic players who either should't be in that rank (weather it's because they suck more than you or you suck a lot more than them), no one plays 4p free for all except for total beginners, and experimental is just ranked without numbers indicating your rank.

Now I wouldn't mind all of that. Toxic players exist, bad rank mechanics exist. It's nothing unusual, but at the same time, the game uses an adobe animation program as a game engine (almost). Most of the animations are made by draging and reshaping predrawn limbs. Only signature attacks are hand drawn, and even they are only partially hand drawn. This is called lazy as you can just redraw every limb and done, you have a new character.

New characters for some reason tend to be unbalanced for the first month of existence (probably to boost their popularity), skins aren't worth the money (Considering anyone can just redraw the limbs and done, new skin is made)

Rankings are bad, the game's netcode is bad, multiplayer is bad, it's free to play so the annoying toxic kids without money have full access to it. Bmg is literally owned by Ubisoft. Why don't they give them budget to make a solid game with good mechanics and actually fully hand drawn animations?

Make the characters unique. So unique that starting a new character would feel like starting the game from scratch. This is a lazy free to play project that isn't finished. I'm off to play SkullGirls."

12273,"There are three types of men in this world. Men with standards. Men who can't afford Smash + Nintendo's internet tax. Lastly, men that play Brawlhalla voluntarily. Don't trust men that play Brawlhalla voluntarily. Don't even look them in the eye.

This game has grotesque art direction which exudes the esthetic essence of a cheap Newgrounds Flash game, but with none of the charm. Legends are mass produced through a tragic template consisting of ugly thick forearms, sausage fingers, Chernobylian shins, and oversized heads. They all look simply terrible. Except for a rock golem called Kor. God bless Kor. The fighting stages are unamusing, ranging from non-descript cultural landmark to generic location from ambiguous point in time. This monotonous selection hinders replayability.

The game plays with the floatiness of a helium-filled balloon. It discourages aggressive play and encourages passive, tedious fights. Encourages spam. Takes a [i]quantity over quality[/i] approach to characters, with all characters sharing the same basic size and moves.

All earnable content is a tedious grind. Nearly all earnable cosmetics are pathetic. Nearly all
 worth-while cosmetics are locked behind microtransations.

The premise takes place in Valhalla, where a tournament pits legends from history against each other. Despite having a serviceable, hard-to-fuck-up premise, it is very well wasted in it's execution. In an attempt to compete with the 72-count arsenal of characters Smash has to offer, the game creates a bloated cast of generic, one-dimensional stereotypes and increasingly monotone expositions of origin that no one cares about. Further crippled with desperate promotional bloat; advertisements for all matters of good and terrible cartoons, movies, and shows. With great characters such as ordinary fit guy from fight show, and random bloke (from show that lost relevance 5-10 years ago and as a result is mass-licensing to maintain some level of relevance) along side the likes of Thor, God of Thunder and the Legendary Warrior Orion. You know, characters with historical precedence and mythological importance.

This game is made to sell stuff to you, not to be enjoyed as a game."

12309,"My personal experience with Brawl is 95% private lobbies with friends or family. So I cannot speak for online play as I've only experienced it in very short bursts. But overall, Brawlhalla is a good little Smash Brothers-esque fighting game. A huge collection of unique characters and crossover characters give you no shortage of niches to choose from and experiment with. I'm personally an Orion/Brynn/Asuri/Zariel player.

I should definitely warn you that you have to individually purchase these ""Legends"" (the Brawlhalla term for characters) with ingame coin, though. Not too bad. But the game does offer you the option to buy access to every legend. Both present and future releases, will always be open to you. Otherwise, the game does rotations to let you try out 9 random legends, every week.

The gameplay is quite fun and action packed. Your weapon type highly effects your moveset and hitboxes, so you'll have to learn your character's moveset and weapons very well in order to be accurate as splash damage and other types of damage besides pinpoint accuracy (it's not quite that bad but still) are not a factor and you will miss repeatedly if you don't aim and time your moves correctly. Each character is also equipped with different stats. So you have tanky, slower builds and faster, lightweigh builds. Despite this, the game does a very good job at keeping things balanced and for the most part, it all comes down to player skill and experience at least 98% of the time.
Definitely a fun time, especially with a group of friends playing in couch mode!"
12310,this game stinks

THEN REALIZE YOUR WHOLE LIFE SUCKED AND NOW YOURE A PATHETIC TRASH PLATINUM BRAWLHALLA PLAYER but It's cool though its just a game.

12478,I played this for 7 hours is not much but i really enjoy the game its chill and if you have friends you can play with them very fun P.S best legend is hattori in my opinion
12479,"Ive never felt so conflicted about a game. Like, as a game its top notch. Ive had fun doing literally everything the game has to offer. The game play is tight, the game runs well, you can tell the game is made with real care and detail. There are things in this game ive never seen in an mmorpg and just a general level of creativeness that genuinely impressed me. The boss fights are an absolute blast and, again, had some basic but creative mechanics that surprised me in the best way.

Then...the elephant in the room. Lets cut the ♥♥♥♥. The games progression pathway is designed to suck you in. Resources are plentiful. Upgrades fire off without failing. Your personal damage grows MASSIVELY fast after hitting 50 it feels so damn good. However, the farther you get the more you can see plain as day that the systems are designed to frustrate you enough to get you to pay. You run out of readily available resources and have to farm it out but your upgrades are failing now. You put all that work into farming up a pile of resources you might just lose all of if you are unlucky. This game is designed to take all of your time to play optimally and then spit it back in your face to try and get you to pay. The entire loot cycle is just time consuming and the game has no respect for your time. Their only interest is your wallet. They get you hooked early on with how easy it is, how much power you gain, then they stick it to you hard and its honestly predatory.

So do I recommend this game? Its a great game. I loved every minute of my time here, even the story (I dont think its as bad as some would lead you to believe) BUT this is an MMO. A game genera designed to get you invested and keep you their long term. With how loot upgrades works...I just cant bring myself to recommend the game. Its good, ill always play it casually but this will never be a ""Main MMO"" just simply because I dislike wasting my time and this game will ♥♥♥♥ all over your time and kick you in the ass until your credit card falls out."

12510,"Decent Game, Most trash and toxic community you could ever find. Join a public custom game lobby and 100% of the time the host will kick you immediately if you have anything other than default podiums and skins. If by some miracle you do not get kicked from lobby and are allowed to play a match, DONT WIN (you will be kicked from the lobby) and  get ready to play with only two types of players. The first being the player who literally has no life and spends their time practicing like its a full time job. You'll know your playing with someone like this when their hitting you with combos input too quickly for any chance of a dodge or wakeup or any input by you. You could set the controller down or disconnect your keyboard and get the same results, which is not fun. The second type is the person who literally just presses the signature button and nothing else. These players are the lowest of the low and lack any skill in anything they do in life. Their trash. These players only tactics are to run and sig spam. I quit the match every time I encounter one.which nowadays is pretty much every match. If you insist on downloading this trash just know you will find no joy here. Just beat downs from no lifes, or frustration from low lifes(sig spammers). They might as well limit the controls to movement and signatures, seems all my opponents only know how to press one button. Uninstalled and never looked back. F*** this game and its players.

People that aren't good can use the same move over an over and win. People that are good.. will use the same move over and over again and win.. so.. just take that into account.."
12678,"I hate you all, worst game ever. Go play smash. Look at my playtime."
12679,"Definitely a fun game that would suit a variety of players.

You can have casual fun for a while, but where you're gonna put in 100s of hours is when you start playing competitively. The roster and playstyles are diverse and challenging enough to keep you motivated. 

However, once you start getting close as a high tier player, things start becoming monotonous. You've got just about every character and weapon combo down, but now playing casually is frustrating because winning either becomes a routine or a frustrating hassle as the game is filled with more casuals that use an annoying play style. The competitive scene is frustrating as well because of toxic players or simply not enough enticement to continue in ranked. Unless you start going to tournaments, a completionist/perfectionist, or someone with a god complex that likes to curb stomp on noobs, there is no reason to attempt reaching diamond. Gold is about where most casual, somewhat competitive players end up and it is a frustrating middle ground in casual 2v2 lobbies: you either get paired up with complete noobs and lose or get matched against a team of hardcore competitive players and get dominated."

12686,"Would you like to play a game where all your skill becomes insignificant? Then Brawlhalla is the game for you! Seriously, this is the only game where actual good players are easier to beat than noobs. 
Someone flexing their Diamond border? Most likely gonna be the easiest game of your life, might just full on three stock some of them.
Someone with a gold border? Pray to every god you ever heard of cause theyre most likely a passive player or a spammer, because who needs to get good at a game where you can throw random attacks all over the arena or just run away and wait for the opportunity to get a free hit...seriously this game has the worst meta ever, you are rewarded for not fighitng in a fighting game! And dont get me started on all those wannabe Sandstorms Mordex players who think that playing scythe makes them actually good at the game.

Tbh the game used to be fun before they decided to make BS weapons that require no skill like scythe and orb.

But hey, if you wanna play a game where you can go into a 1v1 with your friend and beat the shit out of eachother for a couple hours then Brawl is your game! In that case 10/10"

12720,"I clearly have a lot of hours on this game so if you are trying to see what this is all about with all the multiversus hype let me clue you in. The balance team is god-awful and constantly needx hotfixes but rarely does anything to solve the problems within the game. For example when you first start out if you can get through the first 50 hours of learning the game and learning to get past the spammers or just becoming a spammer yourself(that's another problem by the way, the playerbase) then you will need to actually learn the game. And that consists of one mechanic. Dodging. Learn how to dodge at a beginner stage beat the game. Now you get past that and you are immediately slapped in the face by the development team who cares about nothing besides artwork(the artwork is fantastic) and will make the most broken, pay to win, crossovers that will either have completely silent moves or moves that are just straight up faster than what they normally are with different visuals. I truly would not recommend this game to new players just play multiversus."

If these things are nerfed this game would be way better but I highly recommend playing this because I love this game and I think a lot more people should play this game because this game is very under rated and should be more popular. but these are just my opinion on the game and I just think that nerfing these would make it more fun and less rage inducing."

12819,"The hit boxes are way off. Most people have a poor connection, so that benefits them not you. They end up landing attacks faster, and you have very little time to respond. The game developers add characters and weapons without balancing the ones previously created. Some of the original characters are far worse than the newer characters."

12829,"Brawl, Brawl is a fun game with friends. I have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of memories of me and my friends playing this game, we would do all the different game modes and have a blast. Me and my friends started doing rank and let me tell you something it was fun, it was a blast and I enjoyed it. 2v2 rank was great, it lead to many funny moments and inside jokes. Sadly I can't recommend this game anymore. It was nice back before scythe was added, after that the characters started to become less fun and feel like they were running out of ideas. they even made 1 character so Identical to another that when I first say someone play I thought it was a skin. Its sad because this game has so much potential but instead of adding on to the simple moves and combos they started making them way more complex, and complexity isnt always good. Don't even get me started on the community, its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toxic and I don't know if it was me but the game also made me toxic. It was unfun at times because of its Bs moves like the scythe. People either spammed moves and you either kept getting hit or dodged and just win with no challenge. I feel like this game was going to the right direction but after they started to add characters and weapons that didn't fit the style of the game then thats when everything started going down, I started to have less fun and started to get more toxic. this game is nice the moves are simple to learn, the combos are easy to do but they are all hard to master. Learning spacing and all that comes with a fighting game but brawlhalla was fun because its simplicity really did make it go the extra mile. Ill give you an example, I played brawl and at first I was really bad at it, like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage. my friends would demolish me but I still had fun. ONLY a few months went by and I was already better then most of my friends. now lets take a different game, csgo one that I put around the same hours into (300+) and when I first started I sucked ass, a few months later I still sucked ass, I still can't beat my friends in a 1v1. Brawl was simplistic and it was fun, now the game has tried to become more complex but instead made it more toxic and cancer with unfun combos and unfun weapons."

12890,"By far the worst game i have ever played. It is unbalanced af and most problems like balancing and bugs will never get fixed because the developers don't give a damn about the community and the things they are complaining about.
They managed to remove the post gamechat, which should tell you enough that these people just like to take the lazy route instead of adding a much requested toggle option.
The battlpasses are just a quick cash grab and made in such a way that completing the missions is just not fun at all. These missions basically just tell you to spam the signature button a lot to get kills.
Half of the payed track is filled with cosmetic colours. You will always unlock a colour for one legend only, but you don't get to choose which one because it is random. so when you're lucky, you will have to complete the obligatory battlepass mission that tells you to play or win games with a legend that has this new colour equipped, with a legend you don't even like. The games you have to play can range up to an insufferable amont of games.
To top it all off, at the end of the pass you will unlock the colours for every legend and future legend to come. In conclusion, half of the battlepass is just air.
Some missions even tell you to go play ranked and just expect you to win. Because playing ranked is a fun experience for everybody.
To get the full value out of the battle pass, you will have to complete every mission.
Matchmaking in this game is ass.It will either pair you with someone who is much better or much worse. Basically either you get 3 stocked or your opponent gets 3 stocked but nothing in between.
Some weapons or legends in this game just translate into an instant win. 
Passive behaviour gets rewarded by the game.
servers are trash.
And finally i would like to know why starting up a 2D 200Mb game takes so fricking long???

I despise this game and every aspect of it.

12933,no
12934,Fun combat mechanics that feel a little like Super Smash Bros Ultimate but has a more indie feel to it. The varying combat styles that each character has between use of 2 different weapons is a nice way to change things up and if you really want to show off you can go toe-to-toe with opponents unarmed as a challenge. Plus the ranked system is fun. Best to find a friend you can play with and rank up. Or you can go solo in One-to-One fights.

13088,"cant get gold this game suxxx!

Jokes aside, I've been overdo on reviewing all the games I own.

I admit I like the various and different character designs, you can tell they put work into designing every legend to be as unique as possible from each other: 
But at the same time that's my major gripe with the game: Is unlocking the gold blocked content. It's insidiously hard to grind for every legend you want or luck out and buy them when they drop in price. 
Over all the game is entirely solid but it's not a game I'd ever want to play competitively because it feels, well, too simple? I play with people in plat and gold, and it's pretty obvious just learning strings and your fundamentals is absolutely key to being any good. Also have you seen some of the things nerds type in ranked chat? More toxic than plutonium. 

Regardless, I still enjoy the game for the social element and meme potential, plus I admit I've had fun stream sniping lobbies"

13350,Good
13351,"One of the best games on Steam, with its graphics, tons of legends and easy-to-use controls. Easily one of the best games I played!"
13352,"This game gives you many mixed feelings.  It's like a toxic relationship that you need to let go of but you just never can.  And that's the lightest way I can put it.   Here's some pro's and con's

Pros: 
- Comic/animated Graphics
- Smooth move transitions and game-play (Provided you have good internet)
- A multitude of characters to choose from, with about 6+ different weapons and moves for each character
- Great sound effects with a decent soundtrack as well
- Tons of skins and a battle pass ( If you think that's a con I would understand, But they need the money)

Cons:
- The hit-boxes can be weird at times
- A lot of the player base is veterans, so even if you just started the game, you may get dogged on by people whom have lowered their rank for easier play
- Skilled based match making so prepare to sweat
- A pretty intense grind for characters and basic colors/ skins (unless you buy the full character pack or your own skins)

Overall I love this toxic experience.  One moment you go from absolutely destroying someone.  To being absolute dog water, and wanting to break your keyboard in half.  Yes i have thrown my mouse several times.  Yes it has the same idea as super smash, NO IT IS NOT THE SAME.   You have so many jumps and opportunities to get back on the platform, it is insane.  Definitely check the game out though, you will not be disappointed.   Some moments you'll love this game, and most of the time you will scream at the screen and curse the other player while they use the laugh emoji a bunch of times.   Yes, you can either do a couch party with your friends or through online/LAN.  They also have a ""Ranked mode"" and many other fun game modes.  Like I said, you win, get hyped, then lose a bunch, then quit.  But hey, you eventually come back and try again.  Because after all, this game just has a whole different and amazing feel to winning.     Hopefully this helps, leave a like if it did.

13384,"I would like to preface this by saying two important things: Firstly, that I often prefer singleplayer games over battle royale/multiplayer battle games like this. Secondly, I do enjoy this game. Brawlhalla is a wonderful game that simulates the tense gameplay of the better-known Super Smash Bros. series, and does it for free. Additionally. In my experience, the game is far more balanced than Super smash bros. I mean this in the sense that any character can often have an advantage over another with enough technique, and combo-attacks that are impossible to dodge or avoid are incredibly sparse. Brawlhalla achieves this equilibrium by creating uniform weapons that every character must use, as well as reducing the strength of individual attacks to encourage the use of many attacks in quick succession. I do enjoy these mechanics, and I would even go so far as to say it is a better play experience than the Super Smash Bros. games. That said, I'm assuming you're wondering why I labeled this review as negative. This is because an incredibly important issue with not only the game but the entire genre it belongs to. Brawlhalla is by far the best multiplayer battler I have ever played, Far surpassing multiplayer modes of games like Destiny 2, For example, playing Brawlhalla for long amounts of time will earn you coins which you can spend for different colors to a character. This is a way of showing off how much you've grown throughout your Brawlhalla experience, with black/goldforged being the highest prestige colors available. However, you can never truly reach a peak of ability as there are thousands of people far more experienced in this game. This is most certainly not a negative thing, as all multiplayer battlers have this caveat. However, the onslaught of salt-spewing kids and 'disrespecters' who attempt to defeat a player in the most humiliating way possible can feel really defeating. I would say that this can be cured by playing more and gaining a better understanding of the characters, but this gameplay isn't what I would call 'fun.' Learning the characters, or 'grinding,' as I would call it, is often comprised of the dishonerable fellows mentioned earlier, and that means that even training can be a challenge to your mental health. I will finish this review by saying that, with everything mentioned here, I will still play Brawlhalla with friends from time to time. The main factor in my decision to give a negative review is this: I feel that the past 200 hours of brawlhalla have well and truly been a waste of my time. after 200 hours, I am still bullied by the dishonerable fellows and it is simply not something that uplifts me. Would I reccommend someone to try out this game, to see how cool its mechanics are? probably yes! However, I cannot in good conscience encourage it as a 'fun game,' as gameplay can feel pretty cold and heartless the more you play. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to play a singleplayer game. Best of luck to future brawlers, and remember that you're awesome no matter what anyone says online!"

13402,"Over the span of my 40 hours of playing this game I've managed to break

2 mice
Snapped the armrest off my chair
punched a hole in the wall
given myself countless beatings to the leg, head and cheeks
killed my pillow at least 4 times
snapped the other armrest off my chair
scared the fuck out of my poor poor cat
and managed to punch a mug of coffee off my desk...

I very rarely rage, but this game is has unparalleled amounts of bullshit in every fucking creek and crevasse. I want my money back


this used to be a negative review. But shortly after posting this, i started getting matched with smurfs and honestly way too good players in ranked. Just yesterday i dropped 150 ELO. Currently trying to climb back up."

13407,"not a smash rip off like some people say, its its own game with a very unique style.

13414,"Hey, you!
Yes, you!
Are you sick of only winning in Call of Duty?
Is the same smash bros character every time you play strategy starting to get boring?
Do you think your life lacks the little bit of sadness the average human requires?
Well, I got the game just for you!

Welcome to Brawlhalla!
Where after years of playing this bullshit of a game you still won't know how to properly play it!
Where it all feels good and fun on the tutorial until you play 5 ranked matches and realize your life is not fucking worth it!

Be 0 to death'ed by every single scythe player you encounter until the 9mm pistol on you dad's locker starts to look like a good meal!
Spend precious time of your day trying to complete the daily missions you've been ignoring the past week just so you can buy that legend you felt really good playing with on training just to be reminded you absolutely suck in this game the second you enter a ranked match!
Lose all of your hope as the weeks pass and the battlepass gets closer and closer to the end while you didn't even get the cool taunt you wanted!
Get GG'ed by some stupid fucking piece of shit of a human being commonly called spammer and break your monitor as coping mechanism!
Realize there is more beauty in your life than this game and uninstall it!

Until you decide to play it again with your friends and feel happyness you never felt before in this game and the cycle continues.

In conclusion: Get fucked, decide to only play experiment from here on now because you got ADHD and reading an attack is harder than helping a honey badger give birth in an alligator lake.

10/10, GG EZ, worth it."

13419,"As a person who is nearing 1000 hours in this game, I need to format my review in this way. I have had a fun time playing this game, and I have spent over 700 hours trying to hit gold rank. Unfortunately, I have not had any luck on that end. Regardless, this game is for anyone who likes to play platform fighters. The game is free and is on pretty much every device imaginable (current gen and previous gen). This game is able to be played casually as well as competitively, as I really enjoy relaxing and playing with my friends in a custom room. You can play more than 20 different game modes and the roster is always expanding, continuously giving you new ways to play. Unfortunately you only start out with 7 characters from the roster, but worry not as you do not have to spend real money on most of the cast. You can unlock the characters just by playing the game, which is a rewarding task in and of itself. Please consider trying out the experience that is Brawlhalla! 


My father helped me write this paragraph."
13420,omg its cracked
13421,"sexy game, very nice
"
13422,yes.
13423,"I like the game, but it has a major problem with the smurfs and ranking system. It will also be a Triple A if it had a story mode or something like that. Personally, I didn't read all of the lores of the playable characters and if someone who just started in the game would be interested in this. Some people play games only to cry at the end, and others play just for the gameplay. Also it would be better if you could ban one character to play against in ranked 1v1 or ranked 2v2. It is a game for skills. And last, they need to make a one better and more efficient trailer, because if you don't know something about the game it would be redicioulsly boring and stupid.
"
13424,"I think it was a decade ago when I played dungeon blitz on facebook and found out that it was taken down.
I followed the creators of the game till they released brawlhalla, which at time I thought was bad, simply because I kept falling off the platform and dying without being able to do much on laptop, hitting all the keys out of rage and uninstalling the game, hating the developers for taking down dungeon blitz, a game that I really loved for a stupid fighting game. Now after all those years I downloaded the game again and started 
playing it and guess what. I really like it, it's definitely one of the best casual games that are not heavy on specs, not p2w and possesses well thought out system, if there was problem then it's the learning curve and poor matchmaking, don't get me wrong it's fun destroying people 1v2 but really the treatment of new players is just poor in this game and that's why the overall score of this game is 9/10. 
Honestly I still prefer dungeon blitz, I loved summoning my purple minotaur to fight for me and
upgrading it to golden one touched my heart and made me so happy that I still have clear image of how it looked after all those years.
I recommend you to casually play this, do daily quests, join a clan, participate in events sometime and play ranked if you wanna take things a step further.
Good luck, adventurers.
This is beautiful adventure that won't waste your time."

13460,"ive played this game for far too long and admittedly it does need a few changes 
the current meta (the time im writing this review) is kinda trash
the game overall is pretty fun to play
the ""combat"" and mechanics behind it really gives it a new experience
and for anyone who says this is exactly like smash bros
i t s n o t

if you are into competitive or casual games
you should give this a try
there are many legends/characters to choose from
each one having their own unique moves and stats

9/10

13473,"I'll get right to the point. I used to love this game. I used to try to get better at this game, I looked forward to new characters I looked forward to balance changes, I looked forward to playing this game even over Super Smash Brothers. I have just broke down completely with this game. I feel as if the developers care about pushing out skins and battlepasses more than anything else. There are serious problems with balance even from a ""just having fun"" perspective. I got tired of the ranked climb so I started having fun and just playing the game to play it and even that is stale. They removed the chat function and gave the reason that they wanted to protect the feelings of their community then they release emojis that make it even easier to be toxic than when chat was in the game. It's just really disappointing and it becomes harder and harder to play this game every day. It's unfortunate"
13474,Playing this game was the bigguest mistake ive ever made. When i get combo spam and cant get a weapon it just makes me want to never play the game again. I've wasted so many hours of my life playing this piece of garbage .At least it supports multiplayer with friends

13768,Good
13769,"It's evident that certain weapon types/characters are severely unbalanced due to the fact that you'll see most people picking only 5-6 out of the 54 characters available. (And also cause I have played with all weapons and characters to know enough)
I don't blame the players for preferring some characters/weapons because some weapons are just too easy to spam with (like the lance)
It's just sad that after playing hours worth of this I simply cannot enjoy this game due to the fact that it is not balanced and some players will abuse the same move and keep spamming you with it because their ""weapon"" just easily counters most of your moves and unless you try hard all the time, you will keep losing.

TDLR: All I'll say is play it if you want but know it's broken and don't beat yourself up for it.

Definitely do not recommend if you want to remain sane."

13815,Hello
13816,some people just do not touch grass
13817,"This is great game to play with friends because of the offline modes and ""couch party"" play option that's great for when you just want to play with friends. This game is a bit different from SSBU, as it has different game mechanics and isn't just a blatant rip off of SSBU (which many people think). The real difference that sets this game apart from the rest is that it has a variety of online modes, a number of different skins for your characters, and just better multiplayer in general. 
The Pros;
- Great Multiplayer Game Modes 
- The Cool Skins
- Easy to pick up combat system
- Its variety of offline modes 
- Its ability to cross-play with other platforms
Cons; 
- Its Simplicity
- The fact that you have to buy skins and can't just earn them
The fact that this game is free is crazy. Anyone who is reading this should pick this game up. It's fun, easy to learn, and rewarding to master."
13818,Brawlhalla is a fun action packed fighting game that has enough moves for causal players as well as comp players but i will add that the fan base as well as the players in the game to come with a bit of toxicity.

if you dont come out of the womb playing this game youre gonna uninstall it on week two guaranteed. not only that but the people who are REALLY good, make sure you know that they are by pulling out a salt emote or break dancing on your corpse.

EDIT: its been a month... 

The Tryhards are here. Sooner than expected. Skyne- i mean Brawlhalla has stopped human evolution. they brought in a new emote... Its a UFO. And you guessed it, everyones using it. prepare to miss every visible hit because they will dodge them. Yeah i might be bad at the game or biased. But atleast im right. 3/21/22."

13970,"0/10 This game honestly sucks, and let me explain why. first of all, just buy smash bros. second of all trash game with people who just spam their fucking keyboard and hope to get a fucking kill this game is trash and i honestly hope that i can somehow delete it from my memory cause its so boring repetitive and fucking trash. i hope anyone that ever hopes to buy something in this game or even play it remember this review because you will hate this game and hate yourself even more.

For those who want more specifics:

-Many characters
-Frequently updated
-Competitive game
-Fun to play with friends
-Buying items isn't shamed
-Not P2W

But there is a glitch were EAC doesnt load constantly, and i dont believe reinstalling helps so.... rip.

14016,"Awful game that nobody should ever touch simply because if they do they will instantly gain around 70 pounds or if you're not from the U.S around 100Kg, I have this one friend that played this game for a period of a few weeks and they later died of a heart disease (not a real story), you wanna no why? because they gained nearly 100 pounds in that time. Simply put it doesn't matter if the combat is decent or if the character designs are good if you literally can not play the game because you are dead. However if you are willing to die in a few weeks I would totally recommend that you pick up this game, but you also have to make sure that you have friends that are also willing to die, because if you only play public games you will want to put your tongue in a blender before the weight starts to affect you in any major ways. 9/10 will probably continue to play."

Now don't get me wrong, there is some skin that can be bought by just gold/credits that u get from every fight which is pretty basic to me, due to the fact that it just changes the color of the character and thats it. Other than that, the game is pretty great!

14033,"You might have come for a Brawlhalla review, but here's a brownie recipe
You will need - two eggs + a bit of water, powdered sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, oil, flour, slat, and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
First, combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, (If you want them) chocolate chips, and salt into a medium sized bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.
Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick.
Then, pour the batter into an 8x8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick - that's OK.
Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!

14180,"Yes this is a fun game to play casually and ranked ,but there are some players you have to look out for. The main players you have to look out for are Meta-Hoppers which only play the characters that are Meta and Spammers you should know what those are if you play fighting games. The main two meta characters that you have to watch out for are Teros a bull and Mordex a Werewolf other than that the ranked is fun. The Developers do release battle-passes the battle-passes you buy for real cash and finish with real cash changed into in game currency called Mammoth Coins, and skins you can buy with real money that is transferred into in Mammoth Coins but not an essential part of the game they just make you standout more. There are a lot of thing you can buy with the other in game currency called gold which you earn by playing matches of Casual or ranked. This allows you to buy legends that are not on the weakly legend rotation. Playing ranked and winning gives you Elo which and the end of the Ranked season will be changed to glory which you can use to buy things in the ranked shop. Before you label it as a Super Smash bros clone try this game out ,but hey I can't make your opinion for you. Just try it out and see if you like it. Have fun. At the time of typing this it is currently ranked season 22 and Battle-Pass season 5.
P.S. Don't be ass in game."

14398,"Indian Style Butter Chicken :)

(1) Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli in a wet grinder and blend to a smooth paste. Mix the yoghurt with the gram flour in a bowl to get rid of any lumps to form a thick paste like consistency. Add the ginger, garlic chilli paste, paprika, chilli powder, garam masala (which is a hot spice mixture, usually of ground coriander, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and pepper) . Also mix in the ground cinnamon, saffron and salt. Stir well and tip in the chicken pieces and mix well making sure to coat them in the thick marinade. Leave to marinate for a few hours or even overnight if you prefer. This can even be done a few hours in advance. 

(2) Once the chicken is cooked set aside and proceed to make the makhani sauce below. Heat a heavy bottom sauce pan and add the butter. Add green cardamom, cinnamon stick and cloves. Fry for 20 seconds, add the onions and sauté for 5-7 mins on medium heat until they take on a light brown colour.

(2) Add the grated ginger and slit green chillies. Fry for a further minute and add the chilli powder, garam masala powder along with the tomato puree. Stir well and cook for a couple of minutes. Now gradually add the double cream stirring continuously to mix all the spices with the cream. Simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes.

(3) At this stage add a splash of water if the curry is too thick. Stir in the honey and the fenugreek powder. Season to taste. Now add the cooked chicken pieces and simmer the curry on a low heat for 8-10 minutes. Garnish with coriander and serve with Indian style bread roti or parantha."

The rage I emit after playing a single game is unmatched by any other being, unless of course they are playing this game as well.

14493,"This game will ruin you, I have lots of hours in this on different platforms. All this game did for me was cause more rage from players emoting after every stupid kill that they earn. This game isnt anything about skill its just people spamming and doing unskill things, even in rank. There is nothing this game can do for you but cause pain. Unless your playing with friends then its a good game, but if your going to play online in rank or anything in general. I highly suggest you learn some anti rage methods cause this game will cause you to break your keyboard.

Over all this game is a fun game, I enjoy it. But this game will ruin you so please just be carefully when your playing this game. Learn the game first before spamming and all of that stuff, your just gonna ruin the fun for others. And please dont emote after getting a kill your not cool. Your just being a d***."

 The Ups:
Mechanics are easy but also hard depending on what your learning.
Fun with with friends.
Many characters form shows and has many crossovers that will make the game more engaging.
Although the game can be very frustrating that is the main source of fun especially when its your friends being mad and not you.
 The Downs:
Too many ""Spammy"" characters
Some audio bugs like hitmarker sounds when you didnt hit anyone.
When you're the one malding while your friends laugh."

(atleast ranked, like seriously i cant get 2 games without seeing an axe player or 10 attack xull or even worse the biggest wheelchair teros) fix your game bmg. but besides axe its a great game :)"

I do love the weapon choices that are available in the game, i also like all the legends in the game, with every legend having different signatures. The game thankfully don't have any pay2win stuff, they do sell cosmetic that are optional for players.

14700,"biggest shit show of a game, devs need mental help"
14701,bussin
14702,"This project is not a game. It's an insult to GAMES, just don't play it. Peace.
Issues : 
1) Lag as hell, usually i can watch 10 streams while playing other online games but this struggles often while not using anything else that needs an internet connection.
2) Spam??? Sure thing beginners just spam heavies all day but you can dodge them, right? And then you might play against someone that knows the game but they know combos with their weapons which even if you dodge they just continue to ""spam"" their combos and you don't have not just a change to win but a change to PLAY the game.
3) Lag input or what they call it. Simply put you press button and it delays to perform the action. Usually with the dodge mechanic, ie you try to dodge their combo but well it fails to dodge, what can you do.

Tips on how to have FUN :
1) I  guess you can have fun if you know how to do against the spam and the combos and also how to do combos as well. So you have to spend HOURS aside from gameplay to become better to PLAY a game. Well if you need to work on it and you think it is interesting by all means feel free to have fun. As for the internet issues i believe there's something happening with the game/servers although it doesn't happen that often usually 3/15 games or something.

So my opinion is that brawlhalla is a way to get tilted , of course i had fun playing with friends and on my own but at the end of the day the only feeling that remains is that of annoyance."

But In All Seriousness, Brawlhalla Is Great Like I Wish I Found This Game Sooner, Yes I'm Still Trying To Get Better At Brawlhalla And Yes That Will Take Time But I Don't Really Care How Long It Takes Because I'm Having Fun While Playing, I Would Recommend Playing Brawlhalla If You Get Bored Or If You Just Feel Like Playing Go For It Mate Trust Me You Won't Regret It.

Graphics-Wise It's A 2D Fighting Game With Really Smooth Animations And You Don't Need A RTX 3090 To Play Brawlhalla it Will Run Just Fine On Just About Any Graphics Card Integrated Too Maybe I Have Not Tried But You Will Need At least 8GB's Of Ram/Memory.

If You Have The Time To Play I Would Definitely Recommend That You Try Brawlhalla It Will Take Some Getting Used To With The Control But That's Some Of The Fun, Getting Better And Destroying You Opponents."
14894,good gaem
14895,I liked the action and that you can choose legends that have unique abilities that come with their weapons.  Its also sometimes a campy game because you can really just keep throwing your weapons and keep getting them back and do the same thing over and over. So in conclusion I give this game a solid 9.5 outta 10.

14954,well well well
14955,"Looks like smash - definetly not smash.
Basic moves based off weapon types which helps dub down the massive roster they have.
That's not to say character play the same. Each has their own signature moves with each weapon and different base stats making lets say one characters having the ability to do the russian mafia combo or whatever with the gloves while a different character may not. However further more, you level these characters up and you can give them different stances with sacrifice a point in 1 stat for another. So now homie who couldn't do the russian mafia, sacrifices 1 point strength to gain 1 point dexterity and boom - now he is fast enough to pull the combo off. 

This shit is deep. And a good kind of deep. Lots of great community support via youtube breaking down how to do all these amazing things.
It is competative, so be prepared to get handled online ranked. Semi-toxic with emotes sometimes but get over it. You(I) clearly lost. 
Cross over skins are way too good. Empty your wallet.
Cross play and all that.

My only gripe with it is, wishing my skins carried across from platform to platform. WWE roster on pc, TMNT on playstation, Street Fighter on switch... Wish I had'm all on whatever I played on.

15010,"This game when you start it wont let you play cause of the anti cheat, And doesnt even give you the choice to install it. I unistalled and redownloaded and it still didnt work. This game is also horrible to play if you rage easily people are to bad so they just camp the wall or use the easiest champion to use. Bad game would not recommend."

15047,This game sucks ballz no one likes it my friend says he could box it like a flopper dear epic games remove this game or i will pull out some 90s on you
15048,"First of all, this game is a lot of fun, but it's also really bad to the point of being frustrating. It feels like it's stuck in 2016. The hurt boxes can be extremely jank, and interactions can get really awkward. Sometimes you're just stuck in neutral praying to just hit something even though you're right next to your opponent. Another thing about this game is that it's extremely easy. There is very little depth and I was able to pick it up right away, which is a bit nice. The issue that arises with this is that people with very little skill can win. Since heavy attacks have huge hurt boxes and a lot of active frames, they are very difficult to punish, which encourages heavy spam. I can normally deal with it, but when someone has good fundies and heavy spams, there's not much that can be done in mid level game play.  This leads me to my next point; ranked is all over the place. I will three stock a gold player then get three stocked by a silver player. Most of the time, the hardest players to beat are the defaults. People with skins typically are pretty bad at the game. Another issue I have with the game is how poorly designed some of the weapons are. A lot of them (sword, katars, rocket lance, greatsword, axe) you literally just mash and beat those who actually labbed out their weapon combos and strings. Other weapons (spear and bow) have only one combo that you constantly fish for, resulting in repetitive game play. 

Over all, I do think this is one of the best platform fighters out there, though the game play is too linear and repetitive. It feels nice to be able to pickup and play a game like this, because some of the strings are really nice to hit, though there's not much else to learn, it's all just refining fundies once you learn all the weapons.

Edit: Ok... this game is sick... I feel like a lot of issues that the game has could easily be fixed with a sequel (Poor graphic design/ poor move design) but the strong suits that the game does have are excellent. You feel really cool doing just about everything. The game play relies on the reading of movement and dodges rather than focusing on whiff punishment which can lead to some awkward neutral, especially when the hurtboxes of the weapons have massive dead zones. Mid level play still feels a bit shabby with how little skill some weapons take along with the many bs ways you can take a stock, but when a match is hard fought, it feels so good win or lose. 

The only reason I'm keeping a negative review is due to Brawlhalla still feeling like a really good game from 2016 and I'm a prick. Still a good game, I wouldn't really recommend it to someone who is trying fighting games for the first time as there are much better platform fighting games out there. *cough cough* smash *cough*"

One minute you might be fighting with a big, heavy hammer, and the next you might be fighting with a small, agile sword. It's great. Plus combo moves are really easy to memorise. One complaint though, some characters are very easy to spam with."
15126,"The games is quite fun if your looking for a competitive or even fun game to play with friends. It might be 2d but the range of legends/characters along with the vast comboes and maps makes up for it. However, I find the 2d dimension of the game quite nice."

15129,"I actually have over 1,000 hours on this game, and as such, I recommend this game to everyone. Don't listen to people that call it a Smash clone. It is extremely unique.

I have spent an unhealthy amount of time and money to this game. I regret everything.
Ranked is the easiest way known to man to give you suicidal thoughts.

15222,"The game is very much alive 8 years after release, which is always a good sign. It's fun for playing around with friends, and can also be taken more seriously if you want to get competitive. Overall incredibly fun and frustrating at the same time"

15289,"This game is very unbalanced. The second a new character comes out it is so broken they have to nerf it into the ground. Most recently Ezio. Weapons in this game are very unbalanced, from heavy attacks that do too much damage to weapons that are impossible to block. I wouldn't recommend downloading this game but I have and it kinda is what it is. Overall its a very bad experience every time ive played this game. 3/10 I would recommend going spend your time on a game developers care about."

GIVE MY YOUR POINT LOOOOOOOL"
15355,good
15356,"TL;DR: easily salty? Stay away. If you're extra-chill though, do try your luck and give the game a shot, it can be fun.

I genuinely think this game is good. I love the gameplay, I like the characters and their little bits of lore, the insane combos and strings, etc,,,
But.
The community is the most sweaty, toxic and frankly childishly competitive one I've seen in a while.
54 legends? That's great, too bad you'll only be seeing the same 10 that have had an edge over every other legend for months if not years and the devs seem to have done close to nothing to level the playing field.

The game itself aside, the amount of smurfs and people willingly deranking because it's funny to massacre lower level players for easy gains is frankly quite fascinating and stunting for many, It's the reason the 5 friends I used to play this game with quit.

If you have friends to play with and you're all either depressed or immune to salt, then go ahead and play this game.
If none of your friends play this game and/or you're prone to rage on games, stay as far away from the steaming pile of matchmaking salt that is this game."
15357,this game is trash but i still play it

15478,I find this game kinda boring. Don't get me wrong it's a good game but I find myself not having a reason to play it. Maybe it's because I don't know a lot of the characters. Or the fact that i have Smash bros on my switch. At least the multiplayer works better than smash.

15538,"Great concept and game, terrible players. Over 80 percent of players spam the same moves. It blows my mind how bad this game has gotten. Like, just buy a certain character and spam a move or two for the whole flipping game. The developers need to fix this problem asap. I'e played this game for about 2 years now, and would probably be the equivalent of a mid platinum player if my internet was good enough. And never have I even seen an attempt to fix the spamming problems. Why are so many players quitting this game? Because of spammers. Spammers are the core of the problem. Remove their ability to spam, or severely weaken it at least, and this game would rise up. Everything else is great, graphics, basic mechanics, controls, customisation, everything. So once the spamming problem is cleared, I'll give this an amazing review. Until then, this game is slowly dying, the fragments inherited by people who ultimately want to make you delete the game."

15591,"Crossover characters too pricey, I know that the game is free and they need to make money, but $12 for one character?? That's way too much for one playable character. Something like $5 or something would make for sense, and I see a lot of others complaining about prices, we cant play our favorite people because we think its a steal. This was not written to be rude or mean, all it is is the prices, If the brawlhalla team reads this, please lower the prices for mammoth coins a bit, Thank you :)   P.S: Love your game 9.6/10"

15633,"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.""2

This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.

15656,I'm addicted to this game. I hate it when I play it yet I play all day and all night. Nearly broke a keyboard playing. The game is full of spamming virgins who get no pussy. I'd rather get dogged by tfue and boxed by ninja for the rest of my life. I have spent an unhealthy amount of money on cosmetics. It's bad for your mental health. Wish I never played. Makes me suicidal.

15693,"Would be great if it had the followings :
-Better servers
-Better fps stability
-Better input responsiveness
-Less random crashes

Seriously, the PC version feels unoptimised. It runs better on my smartphone with no lag, no frame drops and (bad on touchscreen but) snappy controls. I can't understand how does that work. Anyway, it's fun with friends and similar to Smash Bros and i'd rate it 6.5/10 because of the lack of playability on PC."

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I've never touched a cigarette but i must say, i feel a slight sense of regret since this game gave me cancer anyways. 11/10, beautiful experience"

Game design is terrible , lots of bugs , shit playstyle.
Fanbase? even worse.
what else , spent like 100$ on the game and got like 10 skins and nothing else, so in conclusion no refunds just steal ur money like gypsies in the back of the street.

15761,"Brawlhalla is an entertaining fighter with fun, punchy combat that just about manages to capture that “one more match” feeling. While it isn't quite as tightly designed as the seminal Super Smash Bros., the large roster, wide range of modes, and a reasonable level of depth help it achieve a similar balance of accessibility and challenge - you can play as casually or as competitively as you like. With pay-to-win nowhere to be seen and exceedingly good online play, this is one free-to-play title that's well worth a try."

15771,Spammers just ruins the game tbh great game though
15772,after playing this game for a while I want everyone that plays this to die and I wanna die myself :) :) :) :)        Meh/10

15775,good
15776,good
15777,this is my alt account it's a cool game
15778,"The truth is that brawllhalla is a very good game and has a very marked smash style and I love that, the number of crossovers ,now I will give my points why I recommend it:

Graphics:
🔲 Beautiful
🔲 Excellent
🔲 Very good
✅ Good
🔲 Meh

Difficulty:
✅ Spammers are going to make you suffer
🔲 Dark Souls
🔲 Hard
🔲 Easy
🔲 Very Easy

Gameplay:
🔲 Excellent
🔲 Very Good
✅ Good
🔲 Meh
🔲 Horrible

Those are my points of pq I recommend brawlhalla to the public since it is a free to play game but I wanted to make this review if you were interested you could download it and try it on your own.

Pd: PS: Beware of spammers"
15779,definitely one of the best brawlers out there.

15781,smash bros but if you remove the fun parts of smash bros
15782,if you listen hard enough you can hear the sound of sigs being spammed
15783,"Overall an ideal game for those who seek fast-paced competitive games (especially 1v1) with a large learning curve, or if you'd like a chill game with friends with its unique set of party-themed game modes. The most appealing aspect of the game is probably landing long combos on opponents and wiping their stock after they just spawned B). Although the in-game tutorial barely teaches you about what to do in a match, youtube is a great source for 'proper' tutorials into the game and provides information to help you develop your gameplay no matter what level you're at.

Gameplay: There are a large scope of movement and attack options ranging in complexity which allows you to play at any skill level. At low level, most players spam heavy attacks due to the convenience of their large hitboxes, but they eventually hit a road block where they actually need to learn how to use movement and attacks to progress towards beating more skilled players. In mid level players develop more on these things as well as learning combos for weapons (there are a lot). There is a training mode to practice these in. At high level, players know how to play neutral, which is the state where both players are on stage and are trying to damage their opponent whilst avoiding damage. A large mix of different movement options to throw your opponent off-guard is vital to thrive against high level opponents. Overall, gameplay can be very fast paced (especially if both players aggro often). Although matches can be boring/frustrating when playing against passive players, there is a feature to help reduce passive play (you can't cling on the walls for very long or you fall off the map). Additionally there is 2v2 as a main game mode where you can set up team combos with your teammate and completely kill off a stock of your opponent... satisfying as hell but very difficult.

Variety/Customisation: Over 50 characters to play with 6 unique heavy attacks each. Each character uses 2 weapons (out of the 13) where each weapon has a large variety of moves and combos. There are a plethora of skins and crossovers with an insane amount of different themes.

Party: Up to 8 people can play in a custom lobby where you are able to play a variety of game modes like soccer, capture the flag, basketball with bombs, tag etc. Very fun to f**k around in."

15797,"More than 300 hours experience and to be honest i am little tired of this game...

I thought for a while what I would write about this game and in the end I wouldn't even recommend it.
Yes the game is completely free, there are many characters and add-ons in the game, the developers organize streams where you can get involved and get a lot of things, but even that somehow doesn't fill me enough to enjoy playing this game.

What annoys me the most is the movement in this game, despite the relatively large training, the characters make me different movements or attacks than I would like at the moment, and one such movement can affect the whole match.

From now on, I stop participating in tournaments, ranked games and other challenges that the game offers."

All they do is listen to the new players of the community that no nothing about the game rather than the experienced players. Dont waste your time with this game cause when people say BMG listen to the community, its false, and the people that say that are dumb cause of countless examples on BMG not listening to its community, they dont even listen to pros until they get annoyed which is what somewhat happened to Sandstorm and why he left brawl.

15914,"Brawlhalla is an innovative and wonderfully built platform fighter. It uses movement to emphasize creative play, and has a low enough skill floor to get started, and a good enough ranked progression system to keep anyone entertained as they attempt to reach the impossibly high skill ceiling. Reaching a road block as you attempt to learn is natural, but when you break through that block, it is incredibly satisfying.

TLDR; whether you want a competitive platform fighter with a fun and interesting play cycle, or just want a casual Smash clone to play with your friends cross-platform, Brawlhalla is free for everyone and is worth trying out."

Also the point of a matchmaking system is to place players of the same skill level on both teams. And if that's not possible, atleast have the courtesy to make it LESS NOTICABLE. If for any reason you think your winning the majority of your matches by pure skill. I hate to break it to you but there is more RNG in this game than any game i've seen ever in my life. Shameful!"

16011,"I have almost 800 hours on this game already, starting levels are fun tin,silver,gold etc... but in the later levels people really try their hardest to win meaning spammers and people that throw their weapons are not so rare anymore (which I don't blame the developers for!) everything in the game is really expensive so I can see that the developers are pretty money hungry, The graphics are 2D so making a new map is literally drawing a image in ms paint, nothing more nothing less yet still you are playing the same few maps that are avabile. People say the game is balanced and the legends and weapons are equal... yes they are equally garbage. Hitboxes are all over the place, if you are supposed to hit it doesn't hit, if you aren't supposed to hit it hits. bugs with wallgrabs, attacks that don't hit even tho the animation is playing or the hit sound plays but there is no animation making me very confused if in case you play with the sounds too not just by paying attention to animations because I think it's kinda inportant to hear a wallgrab, weapon pickup/throw or hit,  the NONSTOP connectivity issues, this game has made hundreds of thousands (if not milions) of dollars yet they still can't upgrade their servers, servers are laggy and the input lag is just unbearable at this point. (if you even connect) and they are investing 90% of their time and resources into making crossovers (there are more crossovers than champions at this point). BMG is not a small company with very little popularity and no esport anymore. Game is played by tons of people daily and there are very little ammount of things you can do wrong making such a simple game like this but BMG is still a champ at it. In conclusion, the game is fun when you are a newbie, until you start noticing stuff that actually matter and are a big part of the game/gameplay. The recent news about BMG not giving a F*** about the game and community anymore is just gutwrenching, banning pros for their opinions and everyone leaving including most of the biggest names is just sad. That is what the devs deserve tho, make a trash product,treat us like trash-get trash reviews. I think that is fair."

16072,"The game is fun but I can't recommend for the simple fact that the servers are DOG SHIT. They are horrible. It is constant lag, dropping to one bar, randomly sprinting off the edge and dying. It's unplayable. And before any of that ""your internet sucks"", you can do a ping test for their US East and West servers and see that it is in fact the SERVER THAT TIMES OUT. This issue has been prevalant forever, and the devs just sit back with their thumbs up their asses."

16144,"This game is horrible do not get it unless your with friends the games hitboxes are crap most of the heavy weapons like lance, hammer, etc are busted and can take away a life in just a few hits they need to be redone. Also the player base is toxic emotes are horribly annoying and i wish i could turn them off everytime someone does them in a gamemode. Bottom line is don't get this game unless your trying to get a free rip off of smash bros cause i guarantee you would have more fun on smash bros than this game.

PS- just don't get addicted"

I have never been more cababel of murder then after playing this game and I am generly worried for the people playing this game and its beyond me how this piece of ^^cking cow ^^it of a game has grown to become a game with a such large player base.

16172,"Great game for experience competitiveness

But I have a huge BUT... they removed the ingame/match chat so you no longer can text to your opponent after a match, thinking it because if they people can't text they cant be toxic... Problem is that the toxic chatting and so on was part of the game it was a part of the experience of competitive gameplay by removing the chat feature I now feel like I am playing against no one... there's isn't a human on the other end and it removes from the experience.

Honestly was a great game before and they just made it unsatisfying by removing core mechanics of the competitive experience... f**k investors and being kid-friendly I want the raw experience back.. or at least a toggle button for chat.

TLDR: Fun to play with friends, was satisfying to play competitive but now not as much.
if ya got buds to play with, then yes this is a good game
If ya lookin for something to invest time and energy in for something competitive, it will be a grind with lots of unsatisfying moments (precedingyou win lots)"

You will meet four types of players in ranked which is 1, The Average player which just plays like any other player around your rank. 2, The absolute monster Sandstorm mode good player which immediately beats you up into a 3-0. 3, The Sig-Spammer which... do i even have to explain this? They just spam signatures... and last but not least, the afks. The rank system in this game is kindof unfair too cause you will meet people around your rank and then the next game you meet a esports player on the next. Now time to wrap up this review, this game is a really fun game to play if your just chilling with your friends because its just simple. You dont need to do those cool 0 to death combos to actually play the game. Just play this game with friends and chill, do a couple sig spams, laugh around, and if you dont have some friends to play this game with then... unlucky."

16366,"I cant feel emotions anymore
10/10 would recommend"
16367,its tastes liike cheese
16368,"good game
"
16369,"really fun game, especially with friends. the one thing i dont like about the game is the friend system. if you want to play with friends you need to share a game room code but it would be alot easier to be able to add them as friends on the game and invite them. it would be alot easier to play with friends"
16370,great and emerging game

16492,devs wont balance the game and wont update the ps4 version to fix missing textures. crossplay is garbage for console players

16501,It's very good to play if you have a squad to play with since it can hold up to 8 people in one game. Also it has a lot of characters to play so you can try them all out once you get enough coins

16509,fun game play and really quick to get into matches! Would easily recommend to anyone and its free!
16510,Ass game

16594,"Not really better than before, still trash meta. But I have an idea how to stop guys that'll really just win because of side signature spamming, or guys that spam in general. Just make them lose a stock after spamming one single attack for 5-7 times or what ever. And I dont think it'll break the game in any way, it'll just improve everything and make it more fun for beginners. And I know I have way to much playtime to count as a beginner but, I've never played it continously. And had a complete reset some months ago, because of a car crash."

16619,"Bad game, Sig spamming/spamming heavy attacks is way to strong. Requieres no skill and if you aren't good oyu cannot win agauinst them. No fun at this game except with friends, trash game. Trash performance, the game is locked at 60 fps, this isnt a ps4. Dont INstall complete trash."
16620,yes
16621,"Fun brawler. Pretty easy to pick up but don't expect much in the way of tutorials. Crossover characters are behind paywalls which is understandable for f2p, but they all mirror characters that already exist so it's cosmetic only. If you like games like smash you will have fun."
16622,good game
16623,this game ass yo

16637,"Brawlhalla is  the steam version of Super Smash. It has a lot of different characters which you can use to battle different opponents. Much like smash your goal is to knock out your opponent as much as you can until they lose their lives. It's pretty fun! What's new is that each character has  2-3 different playstyles based on the weapon you pick up. This adds variety to the game. OOh another awesome thing about this game is that its cross platform, so you can play with friends whatever they play on!"

16657,such a poorly designed game this applies to casual and competitive play it makes my blood boil when i have to press a button 5 times for it to actually go through my computer is way above whats needed for this as well as being on ethernet and only passive play is ever rewarded and innovation is constantly discouraged by every patch and update uninstalling and never playing again i tried for years to see a light at the end of the tunnel for this game but to no avail don't waste your time like i did.
16658,This fucking game sucks i want to respectfully throw my controller out the window and hit a old lady.

16688,"I'm having a lot of fun on this game, but the server has been having issues mid battle. I'm not sure if there'll be a penalty that might accuse me of rage quitting in battle, but I hope this server issue can be solved so that I can get back to my gaming, because in all honesty, this is really fun to play; and i like the fact that win or lose, you still get gold that you can save up to unlock new fighters."
16689,Sure
16690,poo
16691,"good
"
16692,just yes
16693,"My favorite fighting game. No screaming characters and legends have personalities, rather than being generic muscled/breasted fantasies for male players. The community is toxic, unfortunately, and the developers facilitate that with, I guess good selling, toxic emotes. But some players are really cool! I understand that some players might be going through hard time in their lives and that's why must be toxic, but it is better to stay cool and the developers should be more involved. Easy to start playing, hard to master. It's free to play with totally cosmetic purchases. Watch out, you might be spending big bucks on this. So, I really like this game!"

16720,very bad game
16721,So challenging
16722,Fun AF
16723,I LOVE THIS GAME I DEFO RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WANTING TO PLAY
16724,"ey preety good . High ass skill celling . Lots of universal stuff so only 1-2 characters are bad. Great charcter variety . Weapons feel different . 
BUT
preety steep learning curve imo . Movement in this game is the trick for any win and its hard to learn such a system that rewards long term and not short term. Not a bad thing.  
Its more about adaptation than long combos and reaction timing cuz many , many interactions happen in any said game.
The best thing by far is that i always think when i lose , damn i didnt utilize all my kit correctly , i am gold mind you, which is a preety good thing the game has taught me . I understand why i lost always upon second inspection
Transitioning from playing a character you like to another is also easy because some combos are universal and characters can share light attack kits due to having the same weapon
Stats are a bit unbalanced , with dex being by far the worst , but its not as bad as you might think for 90% of the cast
Last but not least FREQUENT UPDATES. If something is rly broken it gets patched asap"
16725,This game makes me want to die lmao good game
16726,"it is bad if you play it for alot of time dont pls just dont
"
16727,The brawlshalla bhery good game. i play everyday i like. you play you wear the suit.
16728,"Solid fighting game by design, very VERY high skill ceiling and several weapons to learn (playing them sensibly is another story), topped off by many mechanics to master. Wrong to compare it to Smash or its clones.

9.5/10 (clan support/features are lacking)"
16729,Imagine Smash bros but all the characters movesets are copy and pasted
16730,"yes, but no, but yes"
16731,very poggers do you like my pfp tho
16732,"This type of fun from a free game? Don't think twice if you should play it or not, just play the damn game.
Tip: Get high with your friends and due a 4 party match, the most fun you'll have in a while.

16736,"Hello, names Sketchy.
I have played brawlhalla for quite some time and I must say that this game is really sweaty. Like really.
But.
Despite all the sweat it is still pretty fun to combo noobs and learn different strats.
I give this game a 8/10.
Nah its actually an okay game. Please get it. If you want to waste time."
16737,one more game
16738,fun lol but sweaty

16750,"for those thinking its a smash clone.... i not but it is.... its complicated, two weapons, 8 different heavies, multiple lights, chains are super fluid and fast, dont you hate the smash has so much imput lag?? nah man, i want quicker reflexes, intense matches, its interesting at first but then you get the hang of it and hitting some mind blowing chains..... oh and theres like game modes that you play with up to 8 people that ranges from soccer, to snowball fights, some Ben10 switch supper trippy fights, WWE style,   ohh and yo, theres like 11 weapons all completelly different in strings and power, so every one of the like.... 40? 50? idk bunch of legends that are all completelly unique in how they play.... this games is crazy, like its actually much better, im leaving out a bunch of other mini games n whatever, just try it out its actually real good trust"

16769,Very very good online fighter would suggest.
16770,i broke my finger cuz this game
16771,Better than SSB. Awesome with friends. Cross-play if you need. Online Multi-player is very sweaty.
16772,fun gam
16773,recommend if you want to mentally drain yourself
16774,I hate life
16775,this game makes me so angry that i cant stop playing it
16776,This game is similar to people who play super smash bros with alot of combos you can learn and have rank to win amazing rewards.
16777,"You like combos, Legandary finishes, 2d? get this my guy"
16778,epic
16779,"Great Fighting game. excellent value 
"
16780,Good Game
16781,"You've got to have a single digit IQ to enjoy this game, unless you're with friends. The matchmaking is definitely full of impaired children. At the very least, adults with identical mentalities. Every single player I've encountered on matchmaking has 0 coherence and 0 thought behind their blank dull eyes. To all who play this game and fill it with their absent minded tomfoolery, spamming moves, running off edges, or not knowing which player to target in a free-for-all, I genuinely hope you all burn and boil in absolute agony deep deep down in the dark depths of hell where your dull-minded dumb cur belongs."
16782,ytse
16783,Brawl.
16784,dogshit game
16785,Great!
16786,"Good things:
- It's very fun, especially with friends.
- You can be a casual player, a try hard, or a pro player.
- Arguably one of the easiest fighting games to learn (very hard to master tho)
- Very low waiting time and quick game-play (I love quick game-play).
Bad things:
- I couldn't come up with many bad things about the game other than the fact that the concept isn't new and has been used before (that isn't necessarily bad but yk can't just be positive).

Would I recommend this to the average player? Absolutely 110%
Would I recommend this to a try hard? Absolutely 100%
Would I recommend this to an old person? Not really 

Overall: 9.2/10 

Don't be fooled by my play time I play it a lot of ps4 I just switched to PC."

16788,"This game surely gets me mad alot mostly because I lose but I just find myself just keep on going back to the game,overall these nothing I would change about this except for me losing."

16867,cool and quirky
16868,"really fun game
"
16869,"The honest truth for me at least about this game is its the one you randomly see scrolling through youtube seeing pros do god like combos like its easy so you download it and realize they've worked so hard to get where they are. You decide to give up and go back to whatever you were playing before forgetting all about it. Years go by until you see it again and you realized as bad as you were at it, it was pretty fun. You re-download it and slowly play more and more day by day, making new friends along the way slowly improving and climbing the ranks, more years go by and you have more friends then you know what to do with you realize you love the game, not because its intense not because its easy but because you enjoy throwing on some music and hopping into a call or playing alone and just having fun.

I love this game and i recommend it to anyone that wants something to play with their friends or alone anytime anyday. Its great.
(I know my grammer and spelling is bad but you all know what i mean)"
16870,Brawhalla is fun and cool
16871,NO
16872,"Brawhalla is a awesome game to get good at. Maybe the cartoonish characters give you the impression is a kids game or a simple one... far from it. As a fighting game you have the ""intuitive"" fast learning curve but if you play long enough you see the deeper fighting techniques unravelling. Its a great game to play with non gamer friends, kids etc. I really like it"

16957,"It is a really fun game! It's similar to Super Smash Bros, where you fight other players, there are weapons, combination moves, and all that fun stuff. You can play off line against friends, online, you can can quickly join an online game or join a server. You get coins, buy characters, and there's even a practice mode! Ever since I stared playing, I have loved it!"

How we do Free to Play

Brawlhalla will always be 100% free to play with no pay-to-win advantages and no in-game purchases to keep you from the action. Everything you can buy with real money is cosmetic (such as character skins, podiums, and KO effects) and none of them effect gameplay.

The Legend Rotation of nine free to play characters changes every week, and you can earn gold to unlock more Legends by playing any online game mode.

You can also check out our “All Legends Pack” that immediately unlocks every character we’ve ever made, and ever will make. Forever. Everything in the “Legends” tab in the in-game store would be yours to have. Note that this doesn’t unlock Crossovers.

Here's what you can expect from Brawlhalla

Weekly patches and updates.
Online, custom, ranked, and local play modes.
Over 50 Legends (and counting) to chose from and a free 9 character weekly rotation, unlockable with gold earned through playing the game.
Loads of stages to fight on.
Unique signature moves, weapon combinations and stats for each character.
Ranked seasons every three months with seasonal rewards for playing ranked.
A constant stream of new features, balance tweaks and Legends to make the game better and better.
Excited Devs active everywhere eagerly listening to what you think!
Our eternal thanks (you're our favorite).

We’re always listening to community feedback and value what players are telling us. Throughout Early Access the Brawlhalla community helped steer the direction of development multiple times to make Brawlhalla the best it can be. That will remain the same as we continue to improve, expand, and adjust Brawlhalla based on community feedback post-launch."

17133,"enjoyable for the most part, but very abusable sigs and skill-less champions are rather tilting :)"
17134,"Brawlhalla. 

Visually it looks like a mobile game (it is), the production quality is very very low. The design of everything around you is essentially just a still image. The menu looks and feels very clunky, making it annoying to navigate. The in-game purchase monetization is HEAVY, but also extremely inconsistent. Characters have different stats that make them better in different ways, and you can buy every single character (50+) for about 15$, or you could buy them all one at a time for 6$ each, or you could play for countless hours to grind each of them out. I would say please give me an explanation but it’s blatantly clear that it is pay to win. Beyond that every single cosmetic costs real world money and is overpriced largely. The pricing of everything in the game does not change by region, so depending on where you live you could be paying much less or much much more for everything. Oh and I almost forgot, there’s a battle pass too. Everything I just said is what is wrong with current day video games, and it is all in Brawlhalla. But now I’ll talk about the actual gameplay.

The mechanics are surprisingly deep and very fun. It’s addicting to land huge combos on people and watch them fly out view and light speed. With the amount of characters that there are, you can master and learn MANY different techniques, so the game has a wide variety in characters and skill. The controls are also great! Normally I would never even dare to play a fighting game on a mouse and keyboard but it is genuinely very good in this game. Everything is bindable and changeable. Very accessible to people who want to play their own way. HOWEVER, the game can be hard to play sometimes because of its own faults. The servers are complete dick ass, very often lagging and ruining competitive matches (especially in third world countries). The hitboxes are inconsistent and make less sense the more you play. More often than not I'm having a great time in matches but the fact that it can go this badly during a ranked game is not good at all.

SO, with all that information taken in and absorbed, I can heartfully say fuck this game. There are so many different fighting games you could be spending your time on that are 100% absolutely better than Brawlhalla. This game is competent in it’s controls and mechanics but other than that, Brawlhalla is a scummy cash grab of a video game.

And yet I cannot stop playing."

17202,"as a somewhat experienced player i can say this game is not worth playing and is way dying at a slow pace. The game feels very polished and has good cosmetics. However, this game is really hard to approach for new players and also has a very toxic community. The gameplay is generally fun but when you make it past a certain point you notice a passive meta. This game has a very obvious passive meta where you often just have a match of 2 people waiting for the other person to make a move. The passive meta is very important though as you cannot win a high elo match without passive. This causes 3 minute games to take double the time. Passive meta subjectively (for most people) isn't fun because you can't actually go for anything."

17234,"I play Super Smash on console when the friends come over, but when were all at home on our PC's Brawlhalla is our fighting game. We will play for hours, changing characters, trying different weapons, different fighting modes and maps. Its a blast. I'm even having fun in ranked play. You can easily have hours of fun if your playing for free, but eventually if you decide you like the game, its totally worth it to get the ""All Legends Pack"". It gives you all past, current, and future legends for $14.99 USD (On sale right now).  There are other sites that sell it cheaper *waggles eyebrows*, but I payed through the game to make sure the creators get paid for the amazing job they have done and continue to do. Because I forgot to mention that despite the game being released in 2015, the creators are STILL putting out new champions, weapons, maps, amazing skins, you name it! Also, nothing you can buy in the store effects stats, keeping it out of the pay to win category. It's pretty much everything my group has been looking for in a fighting game."

17406,Review for Brawlhalla
17407,"it is ok for a free game, but I just advise you to buy another platform fighter
There is close to zero variety in characters, the only things that change are design, stats and special attacks, everything else is the same
There are no fun mechanics, fights feel too floaty, they're boring to watch, too simple to be competitive so on so on

With that said, considering all the minigames and how accessible it is, it is a great game to occasionally play with your friends. It certainly is fair, funny, fun, etc, but more of a casual voice call game than a game you'd spend 95.7 hours on"

17522,really good game! it helped me become a better person and helped me gain new friends. when playing dis game with friends it helped us get closer with each other and helped us become friendly addicting game u guys should checkout.
17523,"the game isnt built to give people with skill the advantage if you spam the same ability you can get to a high rank.That shouldnt be how it is. people with the skill they have gain through time and training should be able to climb but instead all you have to do is learn when to press the same move over and over and over again please make it that people with no skill other than spamming cant climb as easy. make it worse some weapon types can one shot you like scythes, cannons, and rocket spears. they can chain a combo that pushes you off the map with no effort. make it worse this game is filled with try hards that choose to smurf to lower ranks and make it harder for lower ranked players to have fun and climb the ranks. i have won two matches just to lose the next 5 because someone that is clearly a smurf chose to play in lower ranks even tho they are much higher rank in reality. honestly most people that play this game need to go outside and touch grass"

But once downloaded and before you can play, they force you to agree to it.  In fact you can not even exit their game without agreeing, unless you circumnavigate and force close the whole thing.  Free or not, I uninstalled.  Not worth the headache."

17536,"This rip off of smash bros is a annoying game with cool cosmetics that makes you spend hundreds of dollars to try and get a cool mordex skin. However when you do get the skin for mordex within the next 10 minutes of playing ranked 1v1s you will be disappointed in yourself for buying the skin after loosing to the diamond bryn or teros when you only just hit plat. I have uninstalled this game 10 times but it is more addictive then drugs. 

IN OTHER WORDS DO NOT BUY IT














I love this fucking game."

17615,father where have you gone
17616,It's a good game.
17617,"If you want a review from a non fighter game player then here you go.
Brawlhalla is a game I enjoyed for about 2ish years from 2017. I met a lot of my friends through the after game chat and its actually my most played game (which I'm oddly proud of).But as of 2020 I've noticed a lot has changed within the player mental. It's very spammy and taunty. From what I gather is there's no hidden mmr within the normal games because I'm always matched with spammers and even though I'm bad I can still beat them with real combos instead of just pressing Queen Nai sigs. I'm not queued with gamers that are neutral at the game. After they sig they taunt. Imagine being new and sding and they do the read u taunt.I do believe it's a fun game for friends. I play ranked 2v2 with friends when I do play. The fact one of us could 1v2 is soo funny to see when we're yelling in call saying "" DON'T THROW"".The controls are very easy, all the characters have the same unarmed moves,characters have fun skins (crossovers) ,podiums look pretty and the game modes from time to time are interesting to say the least. 
I've spent so many hours in this game I can't possibly say it's bad but it's not better then other fighting games."
17618,the first 100 hours when you didn't know how to play properly was pretty fun. after that it get boring . i wouldn't recommend this game unless to have a group of friends to play with.
17619,game hoi rac' ti'
17620,So many updates and not once they thought of fixing the server issues for middle eastern players. I reached out to the support about the input lag issues multiple times and not once they have responded and looked into the matter. The game used to run much smoother previously now it takes your character 1 hour to attack after clicking. (offline works perfectly fine so its definately not my computer)
17621,fun multiplayer fighting game would def reccomend this

17647,"Never before have I experienced such a god-awful catastrophe; let me explain.

About one and a half years ago, I was laying peacefully asleep in the comfort of my home, until the clock struck twelve. From under my door arose The Wicked Spirit of Foda (the undead phantasm of a Brawlhalla developer), as it strangled me and possessed my body.

Sadly, the spirit had not entirely taken over my conscious, ergo I was still involuntarily experiencing the actions of Foda. For over one thousand hours, I struggled to flee the spirit from my body, but it was to no avail. 

Fast-forward to present day, when the evil demon had dropped out of plat for the eighth time in one season  because of a dog water, piss-gurgling, 8 year old, brainlet, blunderbuss sig-spammer using teros as an absolute wheelchair for all three stocks. The spirit was so enraged at the stupendously goofy shabbaroon while playing this game, that it committed suicide on the spot, freeing me from its wrath.

Countless hours I spent under the influence of the wicked spirit, awaiting the day I was free from playing and watching this utter chuckle head of a video game. I shall never get those one and a half years of pain back, so to show my displeasure, I leave this warning sign to any other - even those who have the thought of playing this repulsive game cross their mind."

17881,"Some background on the game.

The game is a fighting platformer game where the goal is to flip the enemies off the map. The game is available on all platforms, and can be played by up to 4 players

At the same time. Familiar game is free, and can run on any computer. The game is reminiscent of Nintendo's super smash bros game.
The gameplay

The gameplay of the game will never bore you. At every moment in the game you will do something. The gameplay is fast and each game takes about 5 minutes.

The game has several game modes:
Free for all:

The game has 4 players. The length of the game is 4 minutes and the goal is to be the player with the highest number of points.

If you kill a person, you will get 2 points and for a person you kill, you will get one point.

If you just fall, you will lose 3 points.

StrikeOut 1v1:
One-on-one battle, in which each player has 3 lives. At the beginning of the game you will choose 3 characters, with whom you will play during the game. Every time you die,

You will get the next character you choose in order until someone dies completely.

2v2s:
In the game there are 2 game modes where 2 players will play against 2 players, one competitive and one not. Each player has 3 lives and the difference between the game modes is

That in competition it is possible to hurt team members and usually not.

1v1 & experimental:
Here too, Yahweh 2 players with 3 lives will have to fight until one dies completely. In Experimental there are things that are examined like maps and moves,

Which will probably add to the game. In a standard one-on-one there are no such things (1 on 1 competitive).

 

The characters + the weapons

There are currently 45 characters in the game, and more are always being added. Each week Yahweh has 8 free characters that you can play this week, and always

You can buy characters with the money you get in the game. If you buy a character that is free, after the week it is free it will always stay with you.
The exclamation mark indicates whether the character is free.

Each character has different stats and 2 different weapons.
Game keys:

The game has several ways to play the game: the WASD and J K L keys

Arrow keys and X C V

WASD SHIFT keys and all mouse keys.

(These are the recommended settings, but you can still play with the arrows and the mouse for example, but these are the recommended settings.

I recommend for those who have a controller to play with a controller, because I have tried all the options and the most convenient controller for me.
I will explain how to play with the WASD and mouse keys.

To move we will use WASD

If we press Shift and adjust with D / A we will do a Dash (if we slide) and if we press Shift in the air / towards the floor or the sky will slip away, which is useful to return to the map

If we fall or try to dodge someone's attack.

If we press the left button on the mouse we will hit a quick hit

A middle click will throw away a weapon or object you are holding

If we right-click on the mouse we will hit a special hit. Each character has a set of different special attacks.

Each blow has several types, and it depends on its direction. For example: if you press S + left button the hit will be different from D + left button.
It was less of a criticism but it was an explanation.
10/7 passes the time but still not the most appealing and interesting"
17882,all of it
17883,Awesomeness...Really like this the more i play it..Nice mechanics cool skills. More fun if u play with LAN in my opinion with friends
17884,"fuckin broken

No but seriously, this game is so stupid. The enemy lives on one hp even though they are constantly getting hit. Not only that, but I somehow lost all of my fucking jumps for such a weird ass reason. An orion was doing his dair and hit me. I had just touched the wall at that time and I wasn't slipping either. I immediately lost all of my jumps after the hit. stupid game 0/10"

I did alot of research and it turns out its literally the game engine that the game is built on, its incomprehensable how its an esport but no report or fixes have been noted to my knowledge, but most esport games ignore the common player for profit so eh its the usual. Over all fun game but i cant give it a thumbs up because untill this game gets ported onto an engine that dosnt ignore inputs or execute inputs that i never pressed this game is borderline unplayable at a legitimate level. Good for fucking around on tho."

18087,"Overall this game is shit. you can literally dodge then hit someone after in a blink of an eye. this game has some unbalanced weapons and its just unbalanced overall.I highly DONT recommend this game,For players 10-19 if you rage easily. people say this game is ""fun"" but really its just a bunch of people sweating and spamming the same moves for at least 4 minutes, literally you can die from anything in this game, YES even the platform. This game isn't made for fun, its made for warming up and getting your hands dirty theres 0 ""fun"" involved. This game is an off brand smash bros. Watch our for the lance players, they're hard to counter especially with most of the weapons, The only weapon that seems to counter lance is spear due to amazing jump feat and even spear can barely counter lance. Another annoying weapon is scythe due to the fact that people keep on jumping above you and grabbing you. and the scythe players keep on reading which is good but annoying especially in ranked. All scythe players do is jump and grab THATS IT. The only way to counter scythe is basiclly stand still and dont do anything. overall THIS GAME IS SHIT AND SHOULD BE TAKEN  DOWN, or buff scythes jump time or whatever"

18099,"Unironically the best fighter game I've ever played. Well put together, though it still has the flaws that other games of this type have such as input delay and server lag, but you can't really do much about that. Interesting competitive scene, tons of characters with unique play-styles, and all of it is accessible for free. The only in-game purchases are for useless cosmetics, as well as an instant unlock for every legend if you're that lazy.

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for an alternative to smash or the like, or even just to have a fun and chill game to screw around with friends in."
18100,"Pretty fun, some sweaty players"
18101,"This game has given me so much cancer that I have considered just going to a cliff and getting shot off of it at 3000 miles per hour like how it always works in this game. The amount of sig spammers that touch this game and genuinely believe they are good spamming the taunt has made me rethink humanity. I've never wanted to go through a screen and curbstomp someone so badly but brawlhalla has made it possible. This game is not worth it the play and now I'm addicted to getting fucked sideways by a hattori or Wushang every time I step foot on the arena, losing 7 times in a row before pounding my keyboard and saying fuck this game. :)"

18223,"When I started playing this game over two years ago on the xbox, I was blown away by the completely original way of fighting. The game uses a set of weapons, that each character will have two of, that have their own fighting style connected to it. At first, I mained cannon characters, as it seemed easier to control them with a controller. But later on, I started using gauntlet character. The base style of fighting connected to the gauntlets connected to my play style very well because most of the attacks made it so that I could maneuver around the stages with ease. I always say that to be the best, move around in the most unreadable fashion while also reading each move the opponent has to basically predict every action they take. Sounds like a lot but that's truly how you win. The fighting system along with the progression system made me fall in love with this game. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a free to play game or for even a game in general."

The combat is solid and fun, even though the weapons are classified in similar categories each character makes the weapons feel like their own. This game is free so why not take the gamble, add this game to your library I urge you to try it. I especially can't recommend it enough if you play with your friends. All in all it is an average game but through solid mechanics it can make it one of the most fun experience you can have."

Thats okay though i understand maybe next time i wont take ur stupid fucking rocket lance up my ass. but other then that the game is really good. i have 79 hours on it and i think its really fun :)

18355,"the servers are absolutely terrible for a game that requires split second inputs. they fluctuate from bad, horrible, reasonable, and every once in a blue moon, fast. but the fast times are fleeting and rare and it makes you want to pull your hair out. nomatter what you do you will never be able to fix the issue. whether you buy a faster computer, internet, peripherals. and for some reason, their ranked set up causes lag in order to ""balance"", which just ends up gimping both parties. the only way this game is fairly competitive is if you happen to be lucky and live in a place where the connection is fluid. but ive lived in 4 different places and i havent found it. if i were you i would avoid this game like the plague unless you want to spend alot of money to fix an unfixable problem in order to chase an opportunity to actually be rewarded for your talent. im plat 5 because i hit a streak of good internet ONE DAY. but mostly i get pushed back down to low plat, and even sometimes high gold. save yourself the headache. the game would be brilliant if it actually did what it was supposed to."

18368,"ya puedo hacerle una critica fiable a brawlhalla
esta bien pero queda hay
la gracia de estos juegos normalmente son los estilos de combate pes brawlhalla carese justo de ello
practicamente hay que grindear mas que en un mmojrp para sacar 1
divertido es pero eso lo mata
imaginta jugar smash sin los 30+ personajes de base
siguendo por este hilo la partida iba con movimientos en retraso
si dije en y no con
porque si fuera con mi internet de 200 megas lo abria solucionado pero los controles tienen delay de 1,6 frames
o lo que es lo mismo media milesima de segundo en una pequeña parte de los movimientos
e lresto del tiempo que no es este numero medio normal cae en que dura mas de 15 frames en responder
mas de 1 segundo en que el personaje no responde
los coontroles se sienten incomodos? no
esto es un problema? en un juego de pelas si debido a que no deja cancelar animaciones enemigas para evitar ataques
agreguemos a esto el hecho de que hay un desequilibrio bastante grave incluso apra un juego de pleas promedio, prodris ir con lo menos roto y ver como tienes que hacer milagros para ganar
por el otro lado como andes un personaje de mov set bueno el cual permita aprovachar los 16 segundos de forma correcta eres basicamente una piedra en el camino de quien se ponga a no ser que tu oponente aga lo mismo
recomiendo brawlhalla? si
jueguenlo todo lo que quieran pero no lo usen de ejemplo de un buen juego de peleas para eso esta smash, teken y streat fighter
si quieren algo mas movido jueguen cualquier otro pero brawlhalla se siente lento en un juego infocado al frenetismo, si aun haci no tienes el dinero para cualquiera de los anteriores (no te culpo son caros los cabrones salvo por teken 7) juegal esta bien
para un final dulce: si es recomndable es mas corre en el peor pc actualmente funcional
su vajo peso lo hace una alternativa mas que una recomendacion
agreagado a esto el tiempo necesario es mas del que ocuparas para terminar un tales of al 100%
lo digo por experiencia

All over the game and graphics are alright but could be better. Simple things and the game is fun if you are in couch party in but to be honest you don't have to spend extreme time on it to get good, all you need are some arms and hands then you'd be on your way. The store is nothing extreme but can be annoying if you have things that you want in the shop but they normally add battle passes with a relation to the story. (You don't have to know the story literally just look up what to do for most of the challenges or you can look inside of the game for the challenges.) Things from the shop don't make you better just for cosmetics. Legends are put behind coins and they get given for free after every game based on your performance in the game. There are competitive modes that you can play if you want to climb the ranked ladder but for a casual player that doesn't matter. The game is very easy to just jump in and leave after a couple of games and is fun to just play in general each legend has different style and signatures while playing the game. All it is is that you have to push another player off the screen. Brawlhalla has different shows and games that they partner with like ninja turtles and street fighter being the most recent ones. Content inside of the game is okay, Brawl of the week is a fun lot of games every week changing weekly with some coming back. anyway all you need to know about the game is that its fun to play with friends and you don't need to spend a whole lot of time to get good while also having a competitive scene for it as well.  

pls no shout am bad at explaining and writing thanks ok."

18443,"Brawlhalla is a fun multiplayer game where you can fight real people online or fight against AI on offline mode, but the game is indeed pay to win. It could have had stuff where you just need to pay for skins if your desperate for them and be able to unlock them for free if you progress a lot in the game. The game could have had or should get a map editor. 8/10"

18466,"Guys I want to talk with you about my breast fetish and s a man with a pretty severe breast fetish I may be able to offer some insight.

Large breasts are subconsciously associated with bountiful fertility and femininity. Due to mens subconscious desire to procreate it only makes sense to be attracted to them.

For example my attraction to large breasts is so strong I can't get aroused if a woman's breasts are below a certain size. The cutoff point for me is there has to be enough titty to fill my hand and spill out. Anything smaller doesn't do it for me and believe me I've tried.

I don't think that women with small breasts are inferior or anything they just don't turn me on for whatever reason. I also struggle to maintain an erection when doing positions like doggystyle because I can't see my partner's breasts or interact with them like I would otherwise. I also need them to be an active part of foreplay and sex.

I can't help it it's completely involuntarily like how everyone has things that turn them on that they can't control. Some people have very complicated fetishes and kinks but I am a simple man, I just like huge milkers.

I LOVE TIDDIES!"
18467,"Its a really good way to burn time, and don't worry about the hordes of players who can predict your every move, if you match with them, just leave the match :)"

If you haven't played brawl yet, don't start playing because you will literary hate your life anb regret all choices you've done up until this point. DON'T PLAY IT. I hope this helped."
18485,"this game is a joke : D first of all, ranked's are unplayable. If you're new on this game and want to try ranked, 95% players u'll meet is fresh accounts who literally oneshot you with full combo and you can't even move. Like if you're doing ranked mode, then make sure players will match depending on skill level, not fkin fresh account against 5k hours brawlhalla player with new steam account. Don't even waste ur time."

18569,good
18570,3 Years worth my time
18571,Fun PC fighting game.  Very similar to Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. franchise.  A ton of unique characters called Legends to play as.
18572,"good
"
18573,"Gameplay-wise, matches are short and sweet, pretty easy to get into, but still has some depth. Coupled with dozen of weapons with their own playstyle and legends having a pair of them with their own signature attacks make for a great game for both casual and competitive players.

Naturally, as a free game, this game has its own premium currency. Though you can play the game without paying a dime and technically you're never at a disadvantage,
1. Unlocking a legend will be a long grind. For context:
-Most legends cost 5600 coins, with the exception of older and newest ones (2800 and 7400 respectively)
-You receive around ~20 coins per match with 100 coin mission everyday, with a small incremental 5 day login bonus. (50 coins to 250 coins)

If you were to play 10 matches everyday, finish daily mission and not miss day in between, it'd take you around 2 weeks for ONE legend. Of course you can skip the hassle and bust out the credit card.

2. Some cosmetics are over the top and downright misleading. Fireballs that look nothing like what it is supposed to look like (guns), and signature effects that does not effectively portray hitboxes, crossover skins that keep you guessing as to which legend it is (mirror of) etc.

For couch play, there is no catch up or fun/quirky mechanic. You'll basically end up spamming buttons hoping you knock the other guy before they do. You're better off with different game for more fun couch play.

Would I recommend it? It's free, why not?"
18574,This is a fun free little Smash type fighting game with in-depth mechanics and fun fights
18575,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

good game!"
18595,this is an amazing game
18596,"This game is probably one of the most polished fighting games in recent times, although not as good is Mortal Kombat 11 or Smash Ultimate it is still definetelly worth your time, especially considering the fact that it is free and all microtransactions are fully cosmetic; people tend to believe that Brawl is ""just a Smash clone"" but in reality the moveset is completelly different and all characters are original to the game itself (except for Rayman but we don't talk about him)"

18624,Fun and easy to master Platform Fighter.
18625,"Smooth movement, plenty of character variety, very annoying metas, and toxic players. Everything you need for a good game. It's like SSBU with slightly less child predators."
18626,"yes ... where should i start so first of all it is one thing that if you do not live in the immediate vicinity of the server you have a disadvantage from the front because of laggs and delayed reactions to the opponent, for example, you just can't dodge properly because you always have delay. The other players (people who live near the server) do not have a delay, which makes the whole concept unbelievably unbalanced and uncomfortable for you as a player. In addition, if you want to be good you never have to have experienced love from your parents let alone have ever been liked by someone and you must hate yourself when you wanna enjoy the game if these requirements are met you can have fun with the game i think all in all its an unbalanced smash bros clone with the baddest controls you ever gonna see in a videogame  for autistic children who never get loved."

18673,"I played this game on a different account for about two years, and I took a break for one year and came back to it a few days ago and I have to say its pretty fun now because of how many legends there are and their abilities and weapons make it even more fun to play"

18678,"Well, this is a fun game (if you don't take it seriously, of course) I played for 400+ hours and I don't have any complaints about this game, really. It's a small size game and 2D after all. One thing that I hate is I always lose to my opponent because they all are freaking good like wtf."

18685,"So. Ive played this game on mobile for a very long time.
Couple things id suggest to BMG.. Instead of making the game to where we can account link make a code for the account you already have 
so you can atleast get the items we paid for with a universal code set to the account from new update
that would make it alot easier for the people who have spent tons on skins and battle passes
( i come back to a fresh skinless account i have to grind for legends i paid 20 bucks for no rare battle pass stuff i earned on mobile WITH TERRIBLE 5 second imput lag)"
18686,Badly balanced trash garbage
18687,"a satisfying game, especially when you're spamming sigs 🥰"
18688,"This game is sick, a heap of fun with friends. If you can get enough friends you can do 4v4 which is insane. Can play just as competitively as you want."
18689,brawlhalla is a good game but you know when they started adding anti cheat shit completely useless into the game would never change anything and its stopping people from playing the game wanna know why? because its giving the same bullshit ass error even though i tried everything fuck anti easy cheat suck my Guacamole

18765,now i LOVE brawlhalla but i wish there is some way to have cross progession because i recently switched from console to PC and it sucks bc i have to restart all of my progess
18766,pp
18767,My friend beat me
18768,"The game is pretty fun for a party fighter, similar to smash bros but with alot less variation between characters which can come off as a bit underwhelming if switching to this. The crossplay is very good for this game as there is no unfair advantages between console and pc other than maybe frames. The gameplay is good too. My main gripe is with the matchmaking, especially in ranked. The game will match you with players up to 100 elo higher than you, which can end some exciting win streaks out of sheer luck. It can also deter new players very easily as nothing stops them from getting destroyed by higher skill players in say, free for all. There is also minor changes that need to be addressed like true sig combos. This game also has a tendency to kill your soul, it has depressed me beyond belief and i am unable to sleep at night because of true combo nightmares. Please pray for me that i reach plat rank :) (am at 1628 rn)

5/10 game its alright but dont expect to grind this game out unless you got friends with you."

18814,"hard on the eyes, not very smash"
18815,"this game has fallen so far.

as the game grows, the character and weapon selection becomes incredibly bloated without the proper balance changes.  since the addition of scythe, the meta has shifted towards passive play.  there's no incentive to attack, so it's more beneficial to sit on one side of the stage and wait for your opponent to attack you.  making any aggressive move towards the opponent puts you at an instant disadvantage because of the way they've designed the newer weapons. it's stale, it's boring, and i can't recommend it anymore."

Its fun to just kick back and just have a chill brawl. Also I have tried ranked as well. Its a little more intense but still pretty fun. Looking forward to more characters and skins. 

P.S.
Its very nice how they give you the option for the legend pack and a very understandable price. I bought it just to support the devs for making a great game."

I think this game is fun for both competitive and casual player(like me)
You can play with up to 7 other friends, and even though half of us were just mashing random buttons it was still a really fun experience because the game is really easy to learn, and the gameplay is really smooth.

So if you want a fun party game, you could try this game!

18955,good
18956,"Not worth it. Put far too much time into the game, am too deep in the rabbit hole to leave. The dark allure of purchasing skins is too powerful and your bank account will start crying. I have the game, and have close to no social life (I also did before but ignore that), and the number of brainless players, including myself, makes for a sad, soul-destroying experience."
18957," the game the developers and the community. everyone is the son of satan i'm not kidding you can try to play by yourself everyone is just like so mean to you for no reason. just think like if you're in a match ok you get dropped on the stage you fight with your fists and seconds later the weapon giver thing drops you luckily get your hands on it and the second you eliminate the opponent their devil starts to come out .they will get so angry like if you pulled their pants down in front of people they become so mean that they will mock you after eliminating you ,don't let you get any weapons and somehow they hack your game like your keyboard's input starts lagging and if you hit them the game will be like screw you you're a stupid little chick who is blind and does not count the slash even though you can see the weapon literally go through their chest but if they do the same to you the game will be like to the opponent that this is the most nicest man/woman in the universe i have seen even though they didn't let you get any weapons, mock you after eliminating you and give you a thumbs down after the match. and the game will count every single slash/hit they do to you even if their weapon is barely close to you. tip#1 if you see anyone with something that can only be purchased from mammoth coins then you will be dead in about 0:45 seconds after the match starts. tip#2 and if you are unfortunate enough to run into a person who uses a character whom weapon includes the rocket lance, scythe and a spear you will know that they will sell their soul to the satan just to win a single match and if you see someone using these weapons just become as tryhard/mean to win against them even if they look all cute and harmless they will be mean in the middle of the match or you can just don't play the game and go outdoors or play another game other than this.

18987,"An enjoyable game, really good fun with friends and the online multiplayer is pretty fun a bit of a problem is some are people are bit goated at the game and will kick your ass several times over when you keep trying to rematch them thinking you beat them when in fact you get body slammed off the map so hard it feels like you got body slammed in real life.

A quick pro tip for anyone wanting to play is dont get too good at the game as you will beat all your friends and it will discourage them from ever playing the game with you again LMAO. Aka beat your friends and become BASED"

1 (3 pound) whole chicken

4 carrots, halved

4 stalks celery, halved

1 large onion, halved

water to cover

salt and pepper to taste

1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)
Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken meat falls off of the bones (skim off foam every so often).

Step 2
Take everything out of the pot. Strain the broth. Pick the meat off of the bones and chop the carrots, celery and onion. Season the broth with salt, pepper and chicken bouillon to taste, if desired. Return the chicken, carrots, celery and onion to the pot, stir together, and serve."

19092,"The game is pretty enjoyable to play. You can play with friends or people around the world. The most coolest part is that you've got to grind a lot, not like other games where you start and you've already reached level 10 or something. But something I don't like is that you've got to pay for mammoth coins. The developers can make it so u get like 5 mammoth coins for some type of a hard task. But yes, I fully understand that the game is free and they've got to earn money somehow. Anyways to every new player have a good time playing Brawlhalla! <3"

19227,yas
19228,I have played this game a lot and it's pretty fun! It's pretty much Smash Bros but free on a lot of platforms. I suggest you play this game. There is a wide variety of platforms it's on!
19229,"Do NOT play this game. playing this game is the same as sticking knives up your ass. it is no fun and it hurts while doing it. the only difference is that shoving knives up my ass doesn't make me want to kill myself on a daily basis. the developers of this game are a bunch of sadistic, terrible, delusional, retarded assholes that should die in a burning house while their mom is watching them melt.  uninstall this game and enjoy an actual happy life!

A few weeks have passed since i made this review. I still highly recommend you not to play this trash program that they are still trying to call a 'game'. A few things came to my mind in these weeks week while torturing myself, aka playing this 'game'. first of all, the game has a really shitty development. Sometimes the game thinks, well lets fck this guy in his anus and take away a jump or maybe a dodge. always fun. Next we have the skill capacity. they made spam weapons and skilled weapons. I'ts is the BIGGEST waste of time to even try to play the game with a skilled weapon. You have to practice it to get good, while someone can pick up an axe and tear you open from your anus to your skull while they don't even know how their keyboard works. HOW IS THAT BALANCED TO PUT IN THIS SHIT GAME?!?!? Take it from me, don't even give this game a shot and just enjoy your life.

Here I am once again after a few weeks. A quick recap on the thing i said about unskilled weapons. I was completely correct. I was done with the game once again and decided i would switch from playing faith to teros. i was platinum in 2 days......."

19268,"Final Fantasy was the game of my childhood. So, I am used to a battle system where heavier weapons are much noticeably slower and deliver more damage per hit than lighter weapons. In fact, often times heavier weapons could not even conduct combos like lighter weapons could. In that sense, Brawlhalla does not fit that. You can have a very high speed character like Artemis using a heavy weapon like lance doing easy multi-hit combos. Usually, signature attacks have to be charged in games since they deliver so much more damage than lighter attacks, but Brawlhalla has no charging system, so signatures can be spammed willy-nilly. I would say that if you simply are not allowed to buy games with real money or can not afford to buy games, Brawlhalla is a good game. It is fun to play with friends. However, if you are willing to buy games on Steam, I do not think Brawlhalla is very good at all. There are plenty of other fighting games that deliver better animation, better hitboxes, better fighting strategies than Brawlhalla. In fact, modded Minecraft BedWars is better than Brawlhalla in my opinion. Regarding the community of Brawlhalla, I would say it is quite toxic. Even though the developers took away post-game chat, players still invite other players to their rooms and use very foul language. I do not think I have been called the n-word so many times in my life than in Brawlhalla. If you are parent reading this, then I recommend you take the extra effort to buy your kid a good game with a good community. This game just is not it."

19352,been playing the game since it came out on ps4 and steam its a absolutely waste of time shit show i would actually argue its even on a downhill spiral hit boxes arent great the dodge mechanic needs immense work the skins absolutely effect the hit boxes epecially the pricier ones and the game is heavily underwheming at technical play for example if compared to Mortal Kombat its a 1/10 and i dont even like MK ive invested over 300 hours total in this game i was able to hang around diamond pretty consistently with no real reward or enjoyment in the game if you can gather 5-7 friends in 1 lobby thats easily the most fun the game can offer you

19367,"It was pretty fun. While it lasted, that is. You have to try and make the most out of your gameplay, or it will soon get boring, or just plain not fun. I've got a lot to say about the game, but most of that is due to my own errors, so I'll leave that out.

Game can have frame drops even on good PCs, and the server connection is *decent* but not consistent. You can be on your way to three-stocking someone and then end up running off of the stage due to the server connection. Not to mention, if you're on Wi-Fi (even fast networks), the connection to the servers can end of varying a ton.

It's fun with friends, provided you're around the same skill level, because beating the same person(s) over and over again, or being beat by the same person(s) over and over again gets boring quite fast. Well, unless you're a sadist or masochist. Or both.

Decent game, but I gave up on enjoying it a while back, since it takes actual effort just to enjoy it."

19411,"Brawlhalla is definitely one of the more interesting platforming game. When I first saw this game, I immediately thought that it would be somekind of a smash clone. Oh how wrong I was when I first thought of that. Brawlhalla got me very hooked and the game is incredibly fun. On a casual level, the game is definitely really fluid as the game itself is very simple and there are countless of different game modes and characters. But not everyone plays fighting games only for enjoyment. Some people take it to the next level and want to compete to be the very best players. Brawlhalla got you covered with that also. The game can be very competitive and learning this game can be very enjoyable. Not only that, Brawlhalla even supports official tournaments that you can compete for huge cash. The esport scene is definitely one of the spicier things about the game as it really gives huge inspiration for many players. However, even with a lot of ups Brawlhalla has a lot of flaws that I can't miss out on. The game can get stale if I am being honest. There are not that many content in the game and most of the time what you do is just polishing your skills. Lore in this game is also incredibly awful since there is no story mode and characters' lore are just mentioned in a 5 paragraph long essay description. Once you get through the highest rank, you will hit that skill ceiling and improving skill becomes much more limited. Due to Brawlhalla's simple nature, training to become the very best can be stale, even when you can do some crazy stuff on high level. To put it simply, the game is not as enjoyable to learn once you get up there. For me, I have been highly ranked (2149), and despite some flaws I have mentioned, this game has always managed to addict me since it is so simple and accessible to everyone coupled with great online and enjoyable learning experience. Great game for casuals and high level play, but the lack of content can make it stale once you reach the skill ceiling. 8.5/10"

unlike smash this game give you 3 kits in a character depending on the weapon it is holding .
combos are encouraged bat not as much as smash the highest i have done is a read of 16 and it was a read and not a true combo.
if you think about trying the game it is free as of me writing the review so why not."

"
19637,"Honestly? With the state of these servers i cannot. The game itself can be fun, with a diverse set of playable legends, weapons and attacks but teleporting across screen, input delay, hits that connect without doing anything and dying despite the screen saying you have already won - all on supposedly full connection mind you - cannot allow me to recommend this right now. BMG, sort your damn servers out."
19638,good game :d
19639,Brawlhalla is a very fun Game and with friends it's even funnier.

19652,Yea c:
19653,"ive been playing this game for over a year and it is a great game, such simple mechanics and very easy to learn if you just wanna play casual. customs with friends are great and the ranked is fun as well. i only wish they would maybe make more ranks higher than plat and masters, the skill gap feels far too small."

19671,h
19672,It is good.
19673,"I have been playing Brawlhalla for over 800 hours so far (PS4+PC) and I can definitely say that it is a great game. First the balance, since every character is very similar with shared weapons, hurtbox, mechanics, etc. all of the characters feel viable. The only differences between them being their weapon combinations, stats, and signatures. Second and third, the netcode and accessibility. It uses rollback netcode, so the online matches feel very smooth with little if none input lag. This game can be played FREE on PC, PS4, Xbox, Switch, iPhone, and Android with cross play available between all of the platforms. My only gripe is that there is not yet cross save, so you must restart your account in order to play on another device. All in all, try the game out and see if you like it. With its free price tag and minimal space consumption, there is not much to lose."
19674,This game has rollback netcode. Ultimate doesn't. Do the math.

19694,"takes no brain and certain high tier characters can spam heavies with no way to punish them

Can't tell you how many games I've been in where people are mashing away heavies and wiffing most, but still win because they have giant hitboxes, come out lightning fast, and have ridiculous range, as well as moving the character extremely fast and into the air which caused me to get killed attempting to punish them. Very frustrating.

I decided joined them as queen nai and spammed all the way to gold no problem. This game is a joke"

19718,"great fighting game, over a 1000h spent. game is fairly balanced, imo smoother then other platform fighting games, also great to mess around with friends, however this game requires serious competitiveness, the ranked mode is quite hard to climb, as the learning curve for this game is extremely steep, mechanics may seem very simple and basic at first but u'd be surprised, trust me, i still learn new things even to this day. basic mechanics and fundamentals are what carry this game once u simple learn them its not enough, they require hard mastery and muscle memory. thats all i really have to say about this game, can be very frustrating at times, as do all fighting games.

19871,"The amount of time I've spent in this game would be surprising considering the score I'm giving it, but I cannot seriously recommend Brawlhalla when there are so many better ways to use your time. There's NO community in any online game I've faced (not even other F2P games such as LoL) that is as toxic as this one is. If you don't live close to one of the servers for this game your connection is jsut utter garbage. You're always gona have some sort of input lag. If you've ever played any fighting game you'll realize this game is very unbalanced and devs just cycle through metas to hype the tournaments up basically as they know exactly what they're doing and it's not balance. There's no penalty for doing or not doing stuff here (NO Rock Paper Scissors type of design you find in literally EVERY OTHER FIGHTING GAME). The whole economy behind this game revolves around being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, taunts are the best selling in-app purchase by a mile. If you don't live in the US (or one of the 1st world countries) then good luck trying to buy anything as the premium in-game currency price isn't region adjusted. The more you play and the farther you get (up to Diamond) the more passive and boring the game becomes. There's footsies, there's defensive oriented characters in other fighting games but this is ridiculous... some matches will be stalemates where your opponent will literally just run away. As a matter of a fact, running away is objectively more effective than anythign else which is an incentive to play passively. Why? Because you have more options to run away, dodge, defend, throw your weapon, etc than you have to approach. Why would I recommend a game whose population is mostly kids yet it has the most toxic players ever? Everyone is tired ofthe toxicity, of the passiveness and the overall same-ness of the game. You don't have to believe me if you don't want to, few people really talk about this but it is the truth. You can check ""toxicity Brawlhalla"" on Youtube.


The game promotes a competitive scene, yet it lacks any balance to it. The fact they don't do anything about it yet they pour a new skin or toxic taunt every other month tells you what the developers' priorities are (its a business after all). Toxicity is a moneymaker. Even Brawlhalla's top players complain about the things mentioned and even more, yet in years those complaints have not been adressed at all. Boomie (#1-2 player depending on the year) has complained about a lot of stuff throughout the years, Sandstorm (undeniably #1) focuses on playing Smash competitively yet he absolutely DESTROYS this scene, eggsoup (ex-top 8 regular) constantly points out the problems with the community and the meta, dopameme (one of the guys who made the best exhibition combo videos) has complained and left the competitive scene due to several instances of lacking balance. These are people that have thousands of hours poured in the game and they all agree with this.

Most Brawlhalla players will defend the game till the end as a fighting game but have never ever played other fighting games in their life. Being toxic and sending death threats and generally inappropiate slurs is the name of the meta.

The game is addicting, not gonna lie, but I do not recommend it when you have to face an absurd amount of toxicity if you're a casual and an insanely passive and unbalanced meta if you're playing competitively."

19887,"Brawhalla, a game which truly encapsulates the feeling of playing with friends. You never feel as if you're alone in this game. Though the server-side maintenance is a little unreliable, it has cemented itself as a game which I play with my friends regularly. I don't main a ""meta"" character like Hattori or Wu Shang, as I enjoy the movement and attacks of Thatch. I played the game so much that I got a Black Color for Thatch and so did my friends for their mains as well, Vector and Mirage. It truly is a party game mixed with a skill-based test, which has let me sink a hundred hours of my life into this."

19910,"theres not a single word that can describe to you just how fucking terrible this game is, the keep away from the only thing that lets you do combos is the most god forsaken thing i have ever seen and when you try to pick up a weapon sometimes you look stupid and just attack the air when your practically standing on it. the throwing of weapons, preventing most anything you try to do is fucking terrible.somehow jaeyun is broken yet my HUGE fucking sword just passes through people and they dont even spot dodge. yet scythe,lance,axe,spear and bow are fucking god awful to play against. the community to this game is absolute filth, constant emotes (that are supposedly not toxic), constant dash dancing, throwing weapons out of arena so u cant play or at you so you cant do much, party invites immediately after shitting down your throat with some jank ass scythe combos. cant wait till multiversus takes what little player base this has left. the devs should be a fucking ashamed of themselves, its like smites dev team but worse cuz the idea to this game was bad to begin with. couldnt just make a decent traditional platform fighter had to go and do some stupid shit and make the game as annoying as possible just to simply play in most cases."

19923,I like this game because it is good :)
19924,"possibly the worst fighting game to ever exist. EVER. If you ever plan to make this a game where you play maybe 3-4 times a week it could be fun, but if you want to compete at a high level and try to experience a 'fighting game' this is not the game for you. 90% of all online matches consists of either gnash, brynn, and or surprisingly hattori. Funny how they all have spear. There is just no fun to be had after all this time i've played. I wish I could say I had some fun playing the game, but honestly its a rage outlet where if I win I feel on top of the world, unstoppable even. But then all of a sudden 2200 hattori and gnashes start to bm and flex their 5k hours. There just isn't any variety in the game anymore and its all just for money. They only care about crossovers and can't give two less shits about balancing in the game."
19925,nice game
19926,shit game shit players
19927,"this game is very easy to pick up and has fun, fastpaced gameplay"
19928,Great game! Even better with your friends if you have no other game. Always exciting and new challenges to overcome
19929,a great game indeed
19930,"This game is definitely one of my most played games ever. Seriously. It can be fun at a lot of times, and I might be diamond, but that doesn't mean the game can be extremely rage inducing. And while that's just a personal problem of mine, I know a lot of players suffer the same issue when playing this game. Of course that isn't the developers fault. If you like this game, you'll likely get hooked. 

50+ legends, 10+ different crossovers, 13 weapons, different casual/ranked modes to your desire, and so, so, so much more. If you like smash bros, you might just like this game. Or hate it and say it's a smash rip-off. Feel whatever way you want about it, but Brawlhalla has many things that stand out about it, and probably the best devs for a game that I've seen."

Would recommend as anyone's first fighting game because all of the visuals are extremely clear and there's only attacks and dodges so there isn't too much thinking needed."

20238,"Reached 1000 hours or more, this game is unimaginably crazy"
20239,it is fun
20240,"A fun platform fighter that works quite differently than other platform fighters. All characters share most of the elements of their moveset - this can make the characters feel a little same-y, but it also means that there can be many more characters, and it also makes it far easier to learn new ones. This also means that characters don't vary wildly in power, because they only have a few moves and stats to set them apart from the rest, and this means that most characters are balanced fairly well.

This also means that the game isn't pay to win. A free to play player doesn't have any significant disadvantage compared to a player who has bought all the characters, because the difference between the strongest and weakest characters is small. I was initially wary of this game's free to play nature, but it's actually handled pretty well - buying all the characters is quite cheap, and doing so doesn't really remove the point of the game, which tends to be a problem in games with similar models. The skins are overpriced, in my opinion; the cheapest, dullest ones are around six dollars worth of currency, and the Epic Crossovers featuring custom effects are more than twelve a piece. But, as they're entirely cosmetic, this isn't a huge point against the game.

Overall? I recommend giving this game a go. I went into it thinking it was just poor man's Smash Bros, but it's genuinely a good time. The characters, while not quite as unique as in other games of the genre, are still fun, and well-balanced besides. The free to play aspects aren't crippling to non-paying players, and they don't take away the fun for paying players. The game regularly receives new content, and the developers seem to listen to the community well.

Oh, and the ability to create a platform in the air and make a grounded attack from it as every single character opens up a crazy amount of fun, satisfying options.

Try it out."
20241,"getting constantly edge guarded by wu shangs side and down sigs are very fun, recomend very much"
20242,"Would not recommend. Played a fair amount on xbox and pc, and can say that, when I'm doing well in certain games, I get disconnected for no reason. My internet is fine. I know what the issue is. People DDOSing, because they're sore losers. Had a friend pay 8$ for a skin, can't even have fun playing the game if I keep getting disconnected for winning."

It's really awesome to note that it also plays on lower end devices like laptops with an Intel HD 500 Graphics card and an Intel Celeron N3350. It lags on full screen but if windowed and made smaller, there's a drastic rise in fps so i highly recommend doing that for more frames.

I would not buying the legend package deal once more in the event that they could simply switch the skins from my console account. That is all I'm asking.

20416,"The majority of Japan's junior high and high schools require students to wear uniforms. The Japanese school uniform is not only a symbol of youth but also plays an important role in the country's culture, as they are felt to help instill a sense of discipline and community among youth. There are many types of uniforms that range from standard to unique ones varying in the ensembles used.

The gakuran and sailor-style dress have always been a part of Japan's ""growing modern"" culture due to its formal appearance and its existence as a concept. Old-fashioned textbooks state that the uniforms were based on the Imperial Japanese Army uniform rather than the European uniforms. The sides of the uniform are similar to existing styles of Japanese dressmaking and the collar had straight lines. Many home economics classes in Japan up until the 1950s gave sewing sailor outfits as assignments. Girls sewed sailor outfits for younger children in their communities. In the 1980s, sukeban gangs began modifying uniforms by making skirts longer and shortening the tops, and so schools began switching to blazer or sweater vest style uniforms to try to combat the effect. As of 2012, 50% of Japanese junior high schools and 20% of senior high schools use sailor suit uniforms. The Asahi Shimbun stated in 2012 that, ""The sailor suit is changing from adorable and cute, a look that 'appeals to the boys,' to a uniform that 'girls like to wear for themselves.'"" As of that year, contemporary sailor suits have front closures with zippers or snaps and more constructed bodices. The Asahi Shimbun stated that ""the form is snug to enhance the figure—the small collar helps the head look smaller, for better balance.""

The Japanese junior and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a military-styled uniform for boys and a sailor outfit for girls. These uniforms are based on Meiji-period formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfits replace the undivided hakama (known as andon bakama (行灯袴)) designed by Utako Shimoda between 1920 and 1930. While this style of uniform is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern Catholic school uniform styles. These uniforms consist of a white shirt, tie, blazer with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same color as the blazer) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and tartan culottes or skirt for girls.

Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version of the uniform (usually consisting of just a white dress shirt and the uniform slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a T-shirt and short pants for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of any particular school, students may often wear different seasonal and activity uniforms within the same classroom during the day. Individual students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing their uniforms incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large loose socks or badges. Girls may shorten their skirts, permanently or by wrapping up the top to decrease length; boys may wear trousers about the hips, omit ties, or keep their shirts unbuttoned.

Since some schools do not have sex-segregated changing- or locker-rooms, students may change for sporting activities in their classrooms. As a result, such students may wear their sports uniforms under their classroom uniforms. Certain schools also regulate student hairstyles, footwear, and book bags; but these particular rules are usually adhered to only on special occasions, such as trimester opening and closing ceremonies and school photo days.

It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas, but this is going out of fashion and many students wear casual dress outside of school. While not many public elementary schools in Japan require uniforms, many private schools and public schools run by the central government still do so.

The gakuran (学ラン) and the tsume-eri (詰襟) are the uniforms for many middle-school and high-school boys in Japan. The color is normally black, but some schools use navy blue.

The top has a standing collar buttoning down from top-to-bottom. Buttons are usually decorated with the school emblem to show respect to the school. Pants are straight leg and a black or dark-colored belt is worn with them. Boys usually wear penny loafers or sneakers with this uniform. Some schools may require the students to wear collar-pins representing the school and/or class rank.

Traditionally, the gakuran is also worn along with a matching (usually black) student cap, although this custom is less common in modern times.

The gakuran is derived from the Prussian Waffenrock. The term is a combination of gaku (学) meaning ""study"" or ""student"", and ran (らん/蘭) meaning the Netherlands or, historically in Japan, the West in general; thus, gakuran translates as ""Western style clothes for student (uniform)"".

The original model of the present day gakuran was first established in 1886 for the students of Tokyo University. During the Japanese occupation, such clothing was also brought to school in South Korea and pre-1949 China. Nowadays, the gakuran is still worn by some South Korean students.

While the gakuran is associated solely as the boys' uniform of most junior high schools and some high schools nowadays, blazers began to be adopted in most high schools.

Most importantly, the sailor fuku (セーラー服, sērā fuku) (lit. 'sailor outfit') is a common style of uniform worn by female middle school students, traditionally by high school students, and occasionally, elementary school students. It was introduced as a school uniform in 1920 in Heian Jogakuin (平安女学院) and 1921 by the principal of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jo Gakuin University (福岡女学院), Elizabeth Lee. It was modeled after the uniform used by the British Royal Navy at the time, which Lee had experienced as an exchange student in the United Kingdom.

Much like the male uniform, the gakuran, the sailor outfits bears a similarity to various military styled naval uniforms. The uniform generally consists of a blouse attached with a sailor-style collar and a pleated skirt. There are seasonal variations for summer and winter; sleeve length and fabric are adjusted accordingly. A ribbon is tied in the front and laced through a loop attached to the blouse. Several variations on the ribbon include neckties, bolo ties, neckerchiefs, and bows. Common colors include navy blue, white, gray, light green, and black.

Shoes, socks, and other accessories are sometimes included as part of the uniform. These socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black penny loafers. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as loose socks, knee-length stockings, or similar) are also commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits

It was fun in the beginning but as you rank up or gain elo, this game makes you wanna try hard more and if you lose you would wanna smash your monitor or something. But kind of addictive , since each game lasts less than 3min xD sometimes even less than 30sec if you get owned by a scythe god. I have not seen people rage like they do in Brawl when compared to online fps games which is way more competitive than a [b] 500MB game [/b]. To summarize , never start playing this game else you will get addicted and even if you try to stop coz of all the spammers and try hards, this game wont let you from playing it. [b] Playing this game with friends will be fun but don't try this alone.[/b]"

20625,"[Ignore my playtime, played more on other platforms]

Decent mechanics, but not polished enough to come close to a game like Smash Bros. Not the biggest fan.
6/10"
20626,Pretty difficult to coordinate the first times you play this game but once you achieve a good coordination and learn the different techniques you will have some pure fun. Especially with friends. Definitely recommended
20627,"Great fighting game, easier to pick up than most. Very unique format allowing for an infinite amount of play styles. The fact that you can not only play for free, but get skins for free is just the cherry on top."

20645,"This is my e-mail to indian dev team of this game:

Hello,

I'm sorry but you do not have abilities and experience to develop games. Do you know what word ""balanced"" means? In this game there is no such thing like balance. Theros, queen nai and other broken legends are f****g broken. Why do you have to make legends for noobs? why? Can't you make this game normal and stable? Yes, stable you moron. Every f*****g update make this GAME to lags, freez and loading like a f*****g potato. This game wights 740 mb and what is the problem to make that simple game works like a good game. You making changes to dodge frames and other things but not change anyting that needs to be change. People are spamming, playing without skill and wining because you make this game like this. What is the point to play s**t like this? Overall the idea of this game is awesome but you do not make this game better with time. Do something for f**k sake. Something to make this game better. You update a f*****g skin and game stops working. What the f**k are you doing? I bet that a whole dev team are a f****g indians with education compare to my 12 years old sister. Ten people from your team are equal to me. Do something solid just one at least. Please make this game better at least a little bit.

PS: Sorry for the rage but you are a moron and a whole squad o these indians.


This is not all i have to say but I don't have energy to rage any more. You all spammers should get banned."
20646,kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda kinda
20647,"This is a very fun and casual little game to play alone or with your friends whenever you feel like playing Smash Bros but can't play it.

The gameplay is very simples to learn with very few and easy to learn controls, such as weak and strong punches and defend/dash. The game gets more exciting as people learn to master those few moves and make amazing plays.

The game has no story, you just drop in a match and play. You can play with friends vs AI, AI only or with other people online, which is very nice to always have that kind of different options to play the game.

The game runs in any computer since it's very light and it's very casual, so you don't have to worry about if the game runs well or if you're gonna lose, so if you haven't played already i recommend trying.

Spammers so if you wanna get past Rank Bronze then you might wanna go ask your retarted brother to play cause they would ac win because they don't use theyr brain.

20763,"I'd say it's a pretty good game to kill time with if that's what you're looking for, but i would not recommend it for anyone with a strong lack of patience and/or natural skill. Maybe it's the leveling system, maybe it's me, but the game is overrun with sweats. I would've recommended it a few years ago when I played casually for the Switch and the player match-ups felt fair, but I feel like all the players like that were scared off or become op asf. Not trying to sound like a hypocrite with this review since I'm a tryhard at this game now too, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone that rages easily or people that aren't willing to take the game seriously. 
It is pretty fun to play casually with friends though, but lets be honest, if you're playing this you probably don't have any (joke, I beg).
Good fun game, scary tough online match-ups."

20860,"One word: Spammers

Lances, Axes. Two things that shouldn't exist. OR Get it nerfed.
Make dexterity a Actual thing. Otherwise characters like Teros Whose a 2 DEX Cannot attack as fast as cassady whose a 9 dex max.
Nix shouldn't have alot of range for a scythe and gun user. Teros shouldn't attack quickly. Lances (Orion, Sir Roland Extremely) Shouldn't be able to carry. Lance should be One EXTREME Hit. Not multiple hits that can carry and is extremely hard to dodge. Axe should not have 360 Recovery and Ground pounds. Spears on some characters should not be overpowered (Orion, Snow Girl). Gauntlets should not have the ability to make somebody not dodge out of its 0 to death combo. Guns recovery should not be as broken as it is already with all its other combo's Gun recovery should be using the guns to boost the character up. Not somehow Flying and still hitting a shot above. That should have a reprocussion of a kickback.

20940,"Brawlhalla is a very enjoyable game to me. Though it is similar to smash bros. by the platforming fighter aspect it is also different in many ways. Brawlhalla has a relatively more simple fighting gameplay. By that I mean in Brawlhalla everyone has the same exact light and heavy attacks, until a weapon is picked up. Each character has two weapons and no characters share both of these weapons but some have at least one weapon similar to another. The thing that causes these characters to be unique to one another is their heavy attacks which are called Signature attacks or signatures for short but the community usually just calls them sigs."

20962,"this game is trash so much spammers dont play this game unless you want to hate your life and be subjected to cancer level 5


update: This game is still trash and u can still be diagnosed with stage 5 cancer. However, after 100 hours of more playing some things changed. Firstly, dodo and mo started playing with us. Moreover, i reached gold rank. Furthermore, moaaz has become so trash and cant play while on the other hand youssef.sh has improved by a lot. i still dont recommend.

update numro 2: this game is still shit and i hate it.i have started to lose hope in the game's community since most of them are either spammers or scythe players which they all deserve to die. during this time period some things have changed such as that moaaz now plays on a mechanical keyboard until he fixes his old keyboard. furthermore i have changed my controls to keyboard only. the only good thing about this game is that we found Hejo. i highly dont recommend this game unless you dont want a life."

20971,.
20972,"After wasting that many hours on the game, I've come to a conclusion that it wasn't worth it. More I was diving into knowing the community and the game itself, the more I see that developers just either don't care or don't know what they should do.
First of all, In this game you can buy taunts, to be toxic to your opponent for real money. So this game monetized toxicity. So questions why this community IS toxic falls behind after knowing that the game wants you to be toxic and doesn't punish toxic behaviour.
Second of all, bad ranking system. We have standart elo system and all, but the main problem comes with an eazy opportunity to make alt and because of that you see many ""smurfs"" on your elo. Also the system with ranks itself. I kinda like how in League (or at least Tft) if you got platinum for example, you can't lose it anymore. You will be stuck there, but you won't lose plat. And there's Brawlhalla, where every lose in ranking game makes you want to die or be toxic (again).
Third of all.. Lack af actually good updates. The only things that Brawlhalla introduces is more legends and skins to buy, new battlepass to make more money... But, where is the normal 2v2 update with friendly fire that majority of the players want? Where is actually new gameplay? Ranking updates? No, we better make new balance features that will ruin someone's legend pick/gameplay completely!
After being into this game for years, I just can't blindly accept it all. I'm done here."

20979,worst fucking game ever i actually want to kill myself. You play against a fucking blue mordex who thinks hes sandstorm and he fucking cucks you cause brawlhaven has the smallest fucking barriers. bow is gay.
20980,Fun fighter game! Good casually but sometimes I would say the hit boxes are weird ngl.
20981,"no dont download this game, once you start it takes a piece by piece."
20982,unless you want to break everything you have and just ruin your day dont play this game its so godly unbalanced you can spam moves this person in the game was spamming special move and did it up down everywhere and the move you couldn't even dodge because it lasted like 5 seconds and the dodge only lasted 1 second and there was no cool down and he could do the move while in the air because of dodging and doing the move at the same time so you couldn't even go around it and all the devs just do is keep just loading the game with in game purchases.

21004,Great!
21005,"biggest problem in this game is smurfs, easily. people will make a second account (mainly for ranked to get easier matches) and just play lower ranked matches. all else is good; legends, design, etc. I'd recommend this game if you don't play ranked mode."
21006,fun game would blow up flight 800 under suspicious circumstances again
21007,"If you are a masochist then playing ranked... or brawl in general, is just the thing for you! With constant spammers and smurfs you are sure to have your ass turned inside out and your fist shoved through your monitor. 
Your Laptop, keyboard, or controller will not walk away unharmed due to the lack of self control whenever you bash the living hell out of it, the next time you see you're fighting an Azoth.
Of course it is not your fault for losing a game, but instead it is definitely either 
A: the games fault and that should never have hit you
B: your equipment is broken/not working properly
C: Lag. (because you would have totally killed that guy on LAN). 
If you don,t like the feeling of wanting to shove burning hot lead down your own throat next time you get N-Sigged by a Teros or a Queen Nai. Then this game is not for you. 
Happy brawling!"

21021,"you'd think after playing the game for 1000+ hours (another steam acc) they would have better servers. nah, you either get mad by the toxic community or the shitty matches that you play most of the time where the opponent gets plot armor because of lag. lag spikes are so frequent that i stopped playing everyday and now only play every now and then so i dont get washed. i will admit i have mid internet but even with that i get very, VERY, little to no lag whatsoever. i love playing apex, they also have trash servers but it's more enjoyable than disconnecting and reconnecting mid match just to make lag go away. i really hate the fact that you need the best f@##$ng wifi around to be able to play with little lag. might just be me but with other online games i get zero to no lag. hopefully when i get a place of my own with the best internet in the world i can go back to enjoying this game. even then i still believe i would get constant lag spikes. i hope this really is just a me problem as i do enjoy this game and wish others to enjoy it."
21022,sucks
21023,"Brawlhalla is a very fast paced fighting game if you like smash brothers. 

Very much like super smash, it is fit for newbies and pros a like. Nonetheless newbies mode is not as fun as with smash brothers as there are flagship characters like mario, yoshi, samus,etc and brawlhalla all are in game characters. You can buy some skins of other series/games though.

For pro playing its much better than current smash as it can be played super fast, almost like smash brothers melee."
21024,this game's ranked system should be considered a sin to man. the game's fun with people but good luck having much more fun outside of having friends

21068,"Brawlhalla has changed drastically ever since the release of this review, and I do not recommend you play this game right now because I do not believe the community in any online game I've encountered, not even other F2P games, is as toxic as this one is. The amount of time I've spent on this game is surprising given the rating I've given it, but I can't recommend Brawlhalla when there are so many better ways to spend your time. Also, if you do not live near one of the game's servers, your connection will be complete garbage as there will always be some sort of input lag. If you've ever played a 2D or 3D fighting game, you'll notice that this game is very unbalanced as the developers basically just cycle through metas to hype up the tournaments. I'm not going to lie, the game is addicting, but I don't recommend it if you have to deal with an absurd amount of toxicity if you're casual and an insanely passive and unbalanced meta if you're playing competitively. Also, I recommend playing with your friends and not taking this game too seriously because the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as low diamond, so be forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you plan on playing this game for a long time."

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

21213,"The Platform Fighting Game I needed bc Smash Ultimate Online requires a subscription service (ain't nobody got time for that).

Pros:
- Good Servers
- Free To Play
- Fast Paced, Feels Great To Play
- Free stuff if you watch tourneys on Twitch
- I'm still pretty bad after 300 hours
- Actual Depth in Mechanics and plenty of familiarity like fastfalling, aerials, neutral game and edgeguarding
- Combos and Dodge-reads are like crack cocaine

Cons:
- Can be frustrating when you lose to people that are clearly much worse than you
- Lots of characters means a lot of signatures to learn. This can be a positive
- Heavy spam is annoying (audiowise, too), but I might just be repeating con 1 here"

21376,"I guarantee after 20 hours in this game you will hate everything that lives and wish you were never born. There is no other game that manages to make me so incredibly angry every single time i play it. i literally cannot remember the last time i closed this game thinking ""well that was fun."" I have almost passed out from rage playing this game. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times. Every time, I think i'll just not take it seriously this time and maybe i'll enjoy it. But this game was created by satan to torture the weak and whether you like it or not, it will suck you in and show you a pain you never thought imaginable. Although I have had fun in this game, the fact that it subtracts happiness from it every time I play it easily qualifies it as the worst game I have ever played. Just know downloading this game will be the worst mistake you ever make and I am being 100% genuine when I say this."

21379,"Fun, thats for sure. paying for the battle pass is very much worth the investment!!! Plus, its not as expensive as other games.Theres loads more characters than SSBU, and a lot more players. the only thing i would change is making it so an invite to party system for X-Box players is dissabled, as myself and friends get a lot of salty party invites after matches we win, and gloating sore winner invites when we lose. Over all, 9.9/10, .1 was removed for the party invite system being added. besides that, its free to play if you dont want to pay money, and there are many veteran players out there who you can learn from!"
21380,virgin gamers love brawl
21381,"Brawlhalla is a fun interactive smash style game (If you are familiar with super smash from Nintendo) but this game lends a very simple control and easy tone to even new players. It lets you play with about 5 legends to start off with you can earn coins in game to unlock new ones or you can purchase for about ($10 US) a pack of legends to play with. There are events, new legends, and much more. This game is sorta kid friendly as in its bad for the fighting aspect but great for the easy and entertainment value. Overall if you are ready to brawl jump in and join the fun its easy and entertaining and overall a great game."

21444,better than super smash bros
21445,"I'm running out of reasons to play the game. I'm a Diamond player, 2300s, Mako main, generally slightly aggressive style. Getting really fed up with the way that the game is going. Pretty much every single ranked game is the same. I get matched against an Ada who never attacks me and parries uber hard, but as soon as I attack them, they nlight/sair combo me to yellow instantly, or I get matched against a spear/bow legend that does the same. I feel like the margin of error on a lot of weapons is totally fucked. When I miss an attack my window to be punished is so massive, and people abuse take advantage of. My main issue here is the strategy of uber parrying then punishing. I see basically zero way to counter it because the other player just always spot dodges and then from there it's a gimp that I can't fight. I don't know what to do. I'm losing 25 elo a game and winning 8 on the rare occasion that I win. I'm not denying that gimping takes really good reading and all that, but I feel like very rarely I lose a game because the other player is actually more skilled than I am. It usually goes like this when I lose: ""lol ur complete shit get fuckin rekt you jew/ez/go die/etc"" and when I win it's ""reported, mako OP/MAKO IS SO OP OMG KILL ME/FUCK YOU FISH FAG"" and it just baffles me. The best part is that whenever I actually try to discuss something with these parry players they immediately get super defensive. Unpopular opinion due to high sodium: parrying is a scummy way to play and parry players are dicks about it. I am really having a hard time seeing a reason to continue playing the game, but I love it a lot. I don't know what to do. I know that some of this has to be on me for not playing correctly, but it can't all be my fault when I miss one attack and get gimped off of the map. In all honesty I believe that makos greatsword is clunky and underpowered and needs a tremendous buff. On top of this mako also has some of the worst signatures in-game and it baffles me that with all these hindrances on my terrible character people still trash talk me for losing. Of course the worst character in-game would lose to an overpowered bow character."

21529,It has no semblance of balance. The developers are only interested in making skins and they don't even put any thoughts into them either. They either do a colour swap or do a crossover. It is the only game I own that has lag spikes and network issues. The developers don't care about the game and are only interested in exploiting children for monetary gain.
21530,only played for 1 day and already I have 11 hours so I think you understand where I'm going with this.

21536,Very enjoyable and fun to hop on for quick games with not much time needed to learn the controls.
21537,"Good game, but it gets VERY time-consuming and boring after awhile.  My main problems with it are:
1) How bland it gets after about 20 hours of playtime.
2) The matchmaking, you constantly get matched up with people who clearly have way more experience than you, and you end up getting bashed to death.
Besides those issues, the animations are good, the anti-cheat is good, the framerate is good, and you can run this game on an absolute potato. 6/10 game, could be ALOT better."
21538,lovely game.

The game has multiple gamemodes which I am a fan of. It has a rank system for players who play competitive. I like this game and I can't get bored of it. To be fair, I recommend playing it with a controller since it's much easier in my opinion. Good game, good community!"

21581,"Brawlhalla is generally really fun, especially with friends. The only downside is when a low-level / experienced person goes against a sweaty person with a lot of experience and just makes the whole match uneven. Other than that its a really fun and easy game to pick up. Its like Super Smash Bros but a bit more complicated. Its also one of those games where you dont need money to win so its comepletely F2P, you dont need special skins or weapons to have fun and beat each other. I really would recommend to people, even if they just tap their foot into the content."

I am hard stuck in the lowest silver rank that you can achieve and i frequently encounter the Teros enthusiast. My family kicked me out of the house because i punch a hole in the wall when i loose. which incase you didnt know my house no longer exists making me homeless. i single handedly demolished my house due to being hardstuck silver. im also a heroin addict

1. Getting your weapon first basically decides if your getting juggled for the first 20 seconds.

2. Characters are fucking boring literally non of them are unique unlike every other game in the genre.

3. Hitboxes seem fucking stupid. For example: a guy punching you from 2m away but your fucking hammer cant hit someone who is a few inches away.

4. characters feel heavy and have 0 fucking mobility. Which for a ""Smash-esque"" game feels bloody dreadful.

5. Gives input for down heavy. performs side heavy.... ok"

10/10"
21850," Overall this game isn't too bad, but the game is filled with toxicity. About 99 out of 100 games will be filled with people emoting non-stop when you die 1 times while they are down 2 lives, and most of the games all of those will be just sig or combo spammers, some of the sigs are overpowered on some characters wich makes the game really toxic and you will be more mad after you play a match than u were before the match. So i don't suggest this game to anyone"

21892,"The characters/weapons have HORRIBLE balance. You'll literally see the same characters over and over because they're the best in the game. The combat is boring, playing like a wuss and throwing your weapon constantly will win games more so than not. Which means most players play passively (They wait for you to attack them so they can counter). The maps are BAD .. typically just a small shelf that you fight on. The devs cater to their sensitive player base as well, so now you can no longer chat with other players. 

This game is a free rip off of smash bros, its fun at first but once you start fighting the try hard kids .. the game shows its true colors."

21930,"What is heroin?
Heroin is a very addictive drug made from morphine, a psychoactive (mind-altering) substance taken from the resin of the seed pod of the opium poppy plant. Heroin’s color and look depend on how it is made and what else it may be mixed with. It can be white or brown powder, or a black, sticky substance called “black tar heroin.”

Heroin is part of a class of drugs called opioids. Other opioids include some prescription pain relievers, such as codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone.

Heroin use and overdose deaths have dramatically increased over the last decade. This increase is related to the growing number of people misusing prescription opioid pain relievers like OxyContin and Vicodin. Some people who become addicted to those drugs switch to heroin because it produces similar effects but is cheaper and easier to get. 

In fact, most people who use heroin report they first misused prescription opioids, but it is a small percentage of people who switch to heroin. The numbers of people misusing prescription drugs is so high, that even a small percentage translates to hundreds of thousands of heroin users.1 Even so, some research suggests about one-third of heroin users in treatment simply started with heroin. Maybe they were mistakenly told that only one use cannot lead to addiction. Both heroin and opioid pill use can lead to addiction and overdose. 

How Heroin is Used
Heroin is mixed with water and injected with a needle. It can also be sniffed, smoked, or snorted. People who use heroin sometimes combine it with other drugs, such as alcohol or cocaine (a “speedball”), which can be particularly dangerous and raise the risk of overdose."

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,

Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

22047,This game is truly amazing. I love how you can play online with other friends and also with other people who enjoy Brawlhalla from around the world! Great Job to the developers of this game!

22052,200+ hours of play time and still trying to know how to punish signatures without using signatures
22053,it good
22054,this game is cool like meatballs
22055,"I'll be upfront with this, I hate this game. I hate it so much I'd quit whenever I have the chance to, however that chance will probably never come. The only reason why I play brawhalla is because there aren't really any competitors, the game struggles quite a lot in terms of balance and focuses much more on micro-transactions than the characters. Signature moves are basically all you need in this game, sure you can punish them but with what? A sig? That won't happen if they miss they can just do it again, the game's servers aren't even that good and lag is most of the time inevitable (it literally makes you jump off the map). Unfortunately as I've stated previously, there isn't any competition so my friends and I keep coming back to this game. This game has it's ups and downs but for the most part it is enjoyable to say the least, just make sure to play with friends (ranked is the absolute worst when you factor in all of my previous statements such as lag and sig spamming). At least it's free to play so I can't complain. In the end I didn't lose money but lost most of my sanity."
22056,"gud gam

22057,"Oh boy time to play some brawlha- NO! What why? ANTI CHEAT! Why not just put the anti cheat in the game and not make people download it out of the game? ............ yes. Alright then, I just wont play the game then. I guess.

22120,"this game seriously need better dev team. Instead of adding more characters every month. Fix ur match making, do something to people who just smurf all the time. I Just see people killing them self, I Used to think why but after some days I saw some players are just too OP according to there ELO. And when u check there account they have 1000+ hours and they are on Gold or plat elo. wow 1000 hours and gold lmao. Update after 10 hours more. The Problem is actually way more critical, today I saw a guy with 30 min of gameplay on profile on plat doing insane combo. Is there any drug in market which makes u pro by birth in this game?"

22178,"this game has no balance you can spend hours on the game mastering scythe, or some other weapon that actually requires skill and get absolutely decimated by someone that mains axe and cannon, and has 10 attack stats. This game has so much potential that can't be reached because they leave in weapons and legends that the whole community agrees on hating. I would really like to see how many people would rank up and how many people would rank down if they removed spam weapons and legends, I believe there would be some interesting results. To be honest I will still be playing this game lol. I rate it a 6/10"

22283,"This game is the bane of my existence. I have only played it because my shitty ass computer could not run anything else. This game is genuinely the worst game I have ever played in my life, and I highly doubt any other game will ever come close to beating it. I hate this game with every atom in my body and my soul. Nothing I ever do, nothing I ever receive, could ever pay me back for the precious hours of my life I lost playing this absolute godawful piece of flaming hot garbage. If there was ever a game to push me over the edge and jump off the Golden Gate bridge, it would be this one. Never, for the love of God and all that is holy, should you ever, under an circumstances, play this game. You will regret it. Trust me. I've suffered all these hours so that you never have to. Don't do this to yourself."

22309,fun
22310,"A high quality but little ragey game if you are inexperienced like me, a simple phrase people tell me is - get better you loser."
22311,Fun but im very bad at game
22312,"A pretty good game but I stop playing as much as before. 

<First, it's a 2D fighting game and platforms are involved, performing well timed combos and getting good at movement are the basics of the game.> 
I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment when I got a good combo on the opponent and play my fair share of platforming game, so the game was easy to pick up. Like everything else you need to practice to get better, but you get the sense of achievement every time you beat someone and that was worth chasing for in my opinion. 
In the end, I got good enough to reach mid platinum in my peak and put 1000 hrs in, so no doubt the game is engaging to say the least. 

<However, this game is horrible on a 60Hz monitor, because of how the game was coded.>
 Input lags and frame skipping happened a lot when I was playing, making it inconsistent to play well when the timing of everything off by a few seconds randomly. Also, I play with no sound since the sound lagged behind when the internet is only SLIGHTLY bad. I don't understand why I can play League of Legends and Valorant so smoothly when a 2D cartoon-ish game is the one my internet can't handle.

<The game sure has some technical issues, but the gameplay itself is excellent.>
 The devs constantly patch up problems with constant content update and continue to make improvements. Although I heard complaints about the balance time to time but compare to LoL and Hearthstone, it's pretty much a paradise with no game breaking problems.

<Toxicity was another problem, which I didn't felt too big compare to LoL. >
Now that they even removed all chat after match, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem.

<To sum up, I do recommend the game. >
There are problems but it might matter more or less to the person playing. To me, the technical issue made improving hard for me, resulting in less game play time."
22313,Cool game no hackers only felix with da combos very annoying
22314,Best pvp and energetic game!!

22365,If you have played super smash bros ultimate don't even bother with this game the hardest part of this game isn't even the combat its staying on the map you have 3 jumps that's it and even if you do have your 3 jumps if you do a combo of the map you cant jump and its really stupid the only thing you can do is hope for your heavy attack to save you. I know ive barely played  but from playing smash this game is horrible I know there's a 50 pound difference but still for a game in this genre its terrible.Only positive the maps are pretty cool tbh
22366,its annoying but somewhat fun

22452,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

22472,"This game is awesome, I really think it´s the best 2d platform fighting game, made a lot of friends and I had ton of fun playing as well as normally expected some rages, the ranked system is great, but it could do better, but if you just want to go out there and prove your skills against someone of your level it´s an incredible experience since you match players that are very similar in skill as you. You start with an elo that it´s not so good for beginners so expect to lose a lot at first, but then when your elo is corrected the experience is really good, the mechanics of this game are awesome and fun. I really find it really interesting that you can go and learn, practice a lot of movements and there is ton of youtube tutorials about how to master them, It´s good to know that you can choose either to master the game or just have fun, mostly like any other competitive game. I really recommend this game, it´s one of the best games that I´ve played in my entire life and one of the few that I actually spend money into."

Like fix the weapon, no wonder no one uses it anymore. Love the game so much but orb needs to  be buffed"
22511,"The game is fine. The players aren't. People take the game way too seriously. It is literally impossible to have a game where you sit back and do silly stuff in brawlhalla. If you want a fun game to relax and play, this is not it. If you wanna play a free-to-play where everybody still plays as if they're in a tournament, then you probably will enjoy it. It's just not for me."

22541,scythe spam is pain
22542,"Saying this game is fun, would be short. But I find it captivating, to always go back into playing, it's adrenaline rushing and really tests your reactions and trains them as well. It's really well programmed as well as seeing hitboxes getting fixed in general is really making this a skill-based game. 
Be careful for toxicity though, as that can really ruin everything about your experience in this game. From people spamming one attack, to people just emoting everytime they can, as this community is filled with these kind of people.
So in general it's a good game, the community sucks, and the scythe is way too op and should be nerfed ^^"

The game has very low requirements making it possible for almost anyone to run the game smoothly. 

2. Player Population
The player base is massive and its very easy to find a match no matter what server you are on.

3. Always a character for you
With many weapon combinations there is always a character you can find that suits you.

22674,"Basically, it's a good game. You can play it with friends and have fun.

But... if you play ranked, you encounter a 99% toxic community.
It is perceived as ""skill"", to throw away the spawned weapon and attack the unarmed respawning enemy.
There is a veeery thin part of the community, who are honorable enough to let the enemy pick a weapon to have an even and actually skilled fight, but the rest of the community uses this low level ""technique"" to win by advantage. It's not about skill, it's about playing trashy and spamming with fast classes. And this goes on even in developer streams or tournaments. It's like spawncamping has become skilled.

It once has been voted the most the devs should do something against the toxicity of the community, but by cherishing this behaviour, they are feeding it.

Also, the classes are barely balanced. The classes in the higher tiers are quick ones, which means there is a meta."

22708,"Brawlhalla is a very fun game, however it does get frustrating after a while. overall good game"
22709,"This is a really fun game when your fighting people who care about fighting properly. Other times it can be a Right+Click spam fest from noobs who only know one combo/move. Depending on what scenario your in, this game is great and bad.

I wish there was an automatic ban for anyone that uses the same buttons more than 10x in a row without pressing another button because this is practically a form of AFK, and if your that lazy you shouldn't be on this game anyway. You kind of people aggravate and agitate alot of the general community that otherwise cares, and puts in time and effort. You don't deserve the reward of being able to enjoy this game whatsoever.

But for anyone else that genuinely cares about playing a game properly, this game is definitely for you and I encourage you to give it a go!"

Play at your own risk. Side effects may include: self loathing, wasted time, carpal tunnel, tunnel vision, depression, anxiety, mania, delusional button smashing, an inflated sense of self worth, a deflated sense of self worth, and in some cases severe butthurt syndrome.
---

Bottom line: it's a free button smashing pvp game with a little bit of depth and it's easy to waste a few minutes at a time on it.

22794,"I spended over 50 dolars on this game didnt even get 1 trade card and the worst deal is the battle pass for 10 bucks since the challanges are way too hard to do and the balancing is so bad the modaration is also not very good , like shythe and bow are way to op and muniun and zariel sicks also so dont buy the battle pass its a scam"
22795,"People often complain that weapons are broken or legends are too strong, but it all depends on how you play. 

If you wish to play, watch Lormen's video on the Brawlhalla mindset, to get a proper approach to the game.
Be open-minded. Each legend is unique, so I suggest experimenting until you find one or two that suit your playstyle. 

That said, I definitely recommend this game! The mechanics are well-made and I personally love the art style, animations, and OST. 
It's especially fun (or nerve-wracking) when you play with friends. Hilarious antics will ensue and competition will get fierce. Play alone or together against the world and you shall experience the thrill of victory or the agony of losing ELO in Ranked."

And it's completely free, with lots of generous battle passes that are enjoyable, and free stuff from Twitch streams they provide.

Brawlhalla is a terrible game. It's a platform fighter with no interesting mechanics, bad controls, and a terrible community. The game is also extremely unbalanced, with some characters being clearly better than others. Overall, Brawlhalla is a waste of time and not worth your time."

First of I do recommend this game alot. It has various maps and a lot of different characters and weapons to choose from. Every character has their own unique signature moves also a lot of diffrent gamemodes. My personal favourite is brawlball.

Some people might say that this game is easy to play, to be honest they're probably spammers and know nothing. There are diffrent combos and strings and overall you just gotta be creative... download it and enjoy... byeee 👋"

23130,"This game was once good and i would have recommended it to others, but recently the developers of the game have just been making the game even worse. For example: the weapons are unbalance, they are adding too many files and now the game is becoming more laggy, the crossover signature; and custom signatures in general are literally a competitive advantage and makes the game feel payed to win. Personally i believe there should be a feature to remove custom signatures. Brawlhalla used to be know for their user friendly updates, but now they have recently neglected their already existing player base in favor of attracting new players. At the current rate that the game is going, it would no longer be a 2D platform fighter but rather a game of tag. The developers of the game are taking away to much and adding too much at the same making the game laggy and unbalanced. I don't think that the game developers see the number of players leaving the game, but they're many. Do you think that is good for the community?? at all?? I am becoming very annoyed and bored of this game because nothing is fair anymore!! I am sick and tire of the terrible matchmaking, i am sick and tire of the game being developed around tournaments and not the community (and by tournaments i mean to 64). I am sick and tired of this game Brawlhalla!!"

23225,"Trash community, waste of time game. I genuinely hate this game more than any other I've played in my life, I've also spent more time on this game than any other game in my life, 401 hours total, all just so that I could make it to Gold, which is straight up just average, and have youtubers like Shwerpy say I don't exist. Obviously it's not the game's fault that I'm bad at it, but come on, my second most played game has like 210 hours, and in that time I was able to beat it three times over, and that game was Dark Souls 3. 

The amount of time I've put in this to become fustratingly average at this game is well over double the amount of time I could of used to get to an actually satisfying and worthwhile level of skill in any other game. And I didn't waste that much time because it's fun, I did it because the game was addicting, it's filled fun attack and combo animations and cute characters which would be nice if it wasn't just being used to make you forget that actually playing it is a perpetual spiral of pain and failure and losses, coming to the game each day telling yourself the lie that you're trying to rank up when in actually you're not even going to move up more than one sub rank for another 2 months, and the only thing you're gaining by continuing to play is hours of your life wasted, wasted on losses and losses and more losses, with the occasional novelty of beating somebody who was already worse than you, maybe gaining some elo if you're playing ranked, only to immediately lose that elo to the next player and end the day with a net gain of absolutely nothing. It's tiring.

This game isn't fun, it's addicting. The distinction comes from how easy it is to simply stop when you realise you're not enjoying it. There have been so many times when I would just sit at my computer playing it long after my mind, my emotions, my sanity have all left my body, leaving me with numbness, the vague knowledge that I should stop, and the disappointment I feel when I continue anyway. I don't continue because I enjoyed the game, I continue because of the lie that I'll be able to feel better if I get a win before I stop, and then when I do win I tell myself the lie that I can't stop this streak now. It's a disgusting cycle that only ends when you either have something so important that you have to stop, or if you suffer in the game so extremely that you realise you have to force yourself away soon before you actually go insane. I found myself in that awful cycle everyday, EVERYDAY, for so very close to a full year, before I was finally to force myself to stop so I could focus on Exams, best thing I've ever done for myself to date.

And it's not just the time too, this game is respectably free-to-play but still has so many useless ways to sink money. I've seen skins, KO-effects, battlepasses, things I thought I needed in my life and actually did buy, well over £100, very possibly over £200, used to buy dozens of normal skins, literally gamble for special skins, buy KO effects and battlepasses (which are only worth anything if you complete the challenges mind you, which would be fine if they literally weren't the worst challenges imagineable and seemingly designed to suck the fun out of each match). With all that spending I have made dozens, multiple dozens of in-game purchase and only about 3 of them actually made me feel anything. The rest of them weren't even remotely worth it and just left me the empty feeling that came with realising that I had just wasted £30 gambling on a goddamn posh skin for a character I've played like 6 times, I wasn't happy that I won the gamble and got exactly what I wanted, just empty. And that was the only gamble that I won, out of the 4 or 5 that I had taken, so much money was wasted on that alone. And what do I have to show for it, I now have a slightly pretty skin I can show off to my friends just so that they can immediately make fun of me for wasting money on this game and for that to be the end of the acknowledgement. It's useless.

And all of that isn't even to mention the chat. I haven't played this game properly, or at least not as much as a I used to in a while, so as far as I can tell they've made the chat harder to use or automatically turned it off or something Idk. But back in the day the word ""ez"" was so easy to type, so easy to read, but caused so, so much pain, especially when you were already low or just trying to make a friend. The community just sucked.

So no, I do not recommend this game, to anyone. There might be a few people, who are really just not doing anything useful with their lives, or just have that much time to kill that they can just throw their life away on a game, those people may very well chose to play this anyway and honestly that's their right. But for the love of God, if you have anything to do in life, if your mental health is of any importance to you, if you wish to spend your life being happy, then for the love of God, do not start playing this game."

23250,very good
23251,I have played this game for far too long. I have had so much fun with this game and never had any problems. That was until they decided to remove the in-game chat function. That was truly a horrible decision. and since that update there has been problems with the anti cheat client. It just seems that the devs want to satisfy a small minority of the players in the game while leaving the rest of us to suffer
23252,Addicting
23253,"Been playing this game since PS4. Would love it but no matter how damn good my WiFi can be, the game decide to lag at the best moment then my opponent pulls an anime move on my ass and disappears and pops up again and suddenly im dead, always when im about to win. Otherwise not bad"
23254,the game is good for comp tryhards and stuff. But overall its pretty fun.

23259,"It's smooth and fast paced,exactly what I want in a platform fighting game, but if you dont want to grind you ass off you pretty much have to buy the character pack of course it isnt necessary but its recommended by me."
23260,Caspian is my daddy
23261,you cant play smash for at least a month after you play this game
23262,"this game exists in my library, i rarely open it, i only do so when I have suicidal thoughts and want to harm myself. You will never find a worse game on steam and I do not recommend but at the same time i would to recommend it less due to it being a little stinky never get this game because it is about as stinky as jar of mayo left out in the sun for two weeks but nonetheless it is fun to play with friends even though they may plan to murder you after because you recommended them such a bad game 

GET THE GAME I DARE YOU, GO ON (0)-(0) 

✨✨✨✨✨

Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. ""What the devil?"" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, ""Tally ho lads"" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended."
23263,"Okay, for an honest review I do not recommend it. The game play sometimes has issues and random moments of lag that can cause you to randomly jump off a platform by mistake. However this wouldn't be issue if this wasn't a common reoccurrence. Another is the community who plays it. The fandom itself is nice but online games people are unnecessaryly rude with the spamming of taunts and emotes so I really wouldn't recommend it unless you've already been into the game. New players will just have a hard time of it and you will hate it. So play at your own risk ."

23322,its a really fun game
23323,To call it a smash clone would be unjust. It is in the same genre of game as smash. its a 2d platform fighting game. The weapon mechanic is unique to brawlhalla but the movement system is what separates it from the rest.

23573,"Guide to become the best player in the game (According to the majority of players in ranked): 

Step 1: Choose a character that has a spear
Step 2: Grab a weapon
Step 2a: If the weapon that spawned is not a spear, throw away and repeat step 2.
Step 3: Jump, press signature heavy up/down depending where your enemy is.

23620,"It's pretty easy to get used to, even for anyone unfamiliar with these types of games! I was introduced to it a super long time ago, and recently got back into it. I found it was really smooth to get back into. Also, the range of characters is really nice, as well as the assortment of weapons. Even if there aren't that many, there's always variety with how you can use each different one! Anyways, definitely would recommend!"
23621,bad game because im bad
23622,"This game is fun and wonderful in many ways, but in others i hate it
The game play and art is great, and I love most every weapon
My problem stems from the fact that  this games matchmaking seems to be a steaming hot pile of dog shit. Every time I log on to play a match I get no hit by some guy who has been playing for three times as long as me and has a skin on every character. I don't know why but at my current state I can't win a single match, unless it matches me with someone significantly worse than me, who I no hit, and then the game gives me another 5 games I can't win
All in all, Fun but matchmaking sucks (for me at least)
But I still love the game, I am completely addicted"
23623,good game

23640,"Ich habe mittlerweile 180 Spielstunden und bereue jede einzige Stunde, die ich gespielt habe. Dieses Spiel nimmt jeden Lebenswillen den du noch hast und um in dem Umfeld, dass sich Brawlhalla nennt zu überleben brauch man die Mentalität Carsten Stahls. Wieso fragt ihr euch ? Es ist fast so schlimm Ranked zu spielen wie als würde euer eigener Vater zu Gewalt greifen und einen durchgehend mit seinem Gürtel verprügeln würde. Es ist fast so schlimm, wie Gewisse Sachen die einer Völkergruppe in Deutschland zwischen 1930 und 1950 angetan wurden. Jeder Spieler der höher als Gold ist hat entweder kein Leben,seinen ganzen Lebenswillen verloren oder  ein 3 jähriger Chinese der in 2 Jahren E-sportler sein wird. Noch kommt dazu, dass die Hitboxen einfach nur dem Stammbaum eines Saarländers entsprechen und Dinge die einen nicht treffen sollten es trotzdem tun. Kinder bitter versprecht mir lasst die Finger von diesem Teufels spiel und spielt lieber Fortnite oder meinetwegen Roblox"

23675,"Despite the endless amounts of rage, Brawlhalla is a lot of fun. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Pick the correct main or everyone will hate you and judge you for playing said character you like. A lot of customization, some free, some paid for. However... the Battle Pass is a scam. Just... is comapred to any other game with one. Kinda upsetting... But yee. Yellow man bad, rayman is the only actual crossover character, and Scarlet is under rated!"

Amplia galería de personajes jugables, con distintos precios y un sistema de conseguir monedas relativamente justo. Varios modo de juegos, entre estos, partidas privadas completamente personalizables, entre varios modos de juegos, cantidad máxima de jugadores, inteligencias artificiales, entre otras cosas.

Cross-Play hasta en partidas competitivas (Ranked), sistema de amigos, repeticiones de partidas, ajustes de controles, etc

Another thing not to do is play the legend casually known as ""Xull"". Xull is quite literally the worst legend in this trash game. Xull is bad, Xull is horrible, Xull is the worst, Xull is cringe, Xull is ew, Xull is yuck, Xull is the reason I am writing this review. I hate Xull and strongly suggest removing that scoundrel from the game. If I saw Xull in real life I would slaughter him and his children. That is all, Thank you for your time!"

Nice to play a bit from time to time,
very disappointing when you start dwelving deeper

1) Do developers seek ways to reduce spamming and toxic play ?
- No, they add quest that are literally called ""spam  this weapon""

2) Is the community nice to interact wit...
-Stop right there, you can only interact with emotes... toxic emotes obviously (tho I admit they do fit what players have to ""say"" to each others)

People instantly give up once you have a minuscule advantage over them.
Input lag prevents half the dodges from coming out at all, pretty frustrating in a fighting game.
Unbalanced roster and legends: lance seems far too strong, with a much bigger hitbox on throw etc etc.

23873,Nice fun if you want to rage.
23874,Fun.
23875,A very strange game with cool mechanics. Worth playing with friends!
23876,"Unbalanced characters, combos that the devs are NOT talented enough to playtest, inconsistent rules between characters and movesets, and a very unintuitive and frustrating movelist.  Lots of recovery after every. single. action. Character response feels like you're playing on dial up with a few choice weapons / movesets. Ranked ELO is very primitive and doesn't make use of any uncertainty algorithm, so beating a player much better than you nets you the same score as if you beat a player who just booted the game for the first time. This combined with a skill floor / ceiling that makes hardlocked tins and silvers a constant annoyance via unmitigated spam make the experience a slog. Good with friends, dogshit if you want a game to take even as seriously as hobby ranked play"

They also removed in game chat, which was probably the only thing keeping me interested in the game. Looks like the axe spammers couldn't take the criticism."

23898,it's just a really bad game people literally just hop on the edge for a bout 5minutes at a time and literally wait for tie breaker like i just went in a 8 minute game because someone did that it just brings the  fun out of the entire game i had to uninstall I want to play not wait around I just stood there and  finished dinner it was just unbearable.

23914,"In short, this game is wonky. I couldn't tell you not to go for it if you're thinking about taking it seriously, but for casual players, there are much better ways to spend your time. Interactions between characters and weapons are inconsistent in a pseudo-skilled sense and 99% of the time you get hit in mutual attack situations, you won't really know why. Character power balancing is a nightmare and it's very likely to never change. The settings menu is one of the worst I've ever come across: to say it's barebones would be an understatement (no support for higher resolution/refresh rate, for instance). To sum up, if you wanna go pro, by all means try to memorize every single quirk that occurs in this game. Otherwise, don't even hit the download button."

Em média a cada 10 jogos só 1 ou 2 é que são realmente bons e divertidos. Se era para jogar um jogo frustrante ia jogar LoL.
Resumidamente não cumpre a proposta de um jogo casual e divertido. Para quem é masoquista ou tem 1500 horas em super smash bros. pode ser interessante."

Other than that, it is also a game that well rewards the players that gets involved in it's community that also offers exclusive rewards if you get involved in its community. So the tournaments, meeting a developer, or even just by watching their twitch streams. Following Brawlhalla on twitter, facebook, and youtube may also grant you some exclusive rewards top."

24166,I've dealt with the horrible crossover skins of this game.  Plus the inability to ban/hide the skins from view while playing.  However taking away the chat after a game has ended  has crossed the line.  These terrible qualities made me stop supporting this game via buying in-game content.

24183,"EDIT: Since BMG continues to encourage toxicity on their platform, I've decided to quit for good and leave my review as negative. You had your chance.

--------

BMG recently decided that they would try to ""moderate toxicity"" by removing the ability to chat. Yet they still leave toxic taunts like ""So salty.""

At least before, my bro and I could retaliate to toxic taunters after a match by using chat. Now they leave literally no retaliation, letting toxic, taunting scum get away with it. BMG is now making a stance that they are 100% in support with online bullying and they will not support defending yourself. My review will stay negative until they either: Remove taunts, or bring back chat."

24341,"It's pretty good for a fighting game, there's a lot of diversity between all the playable characters so that's a plus. If you're starting out I'd recommend playing axe or sword first since their combos and spacing are pretty straightfoward. Personally, I'd also recommend to not touch the ranked side of Brawlhalla as it is the sweatiest and most toxic thing I've ever experienced. The only thing I can think of to add is more pride flag pfps, since they have the ""rainbow"" and ""transgender pride"" pfps already I think it just makes sense to add more, at least the most notable ones (bi, pansexual, asexual, etc.)"

24358,"I would recommend the game, I mean - I've got nearly 500 hours in it. Gameplay wise it is really good, really dang good, however I think that the game might start heading in a bad direction because of the latest update. The biggest change wasn't the new character but the removal of post game chat and its replacement - the emote system, which cannot replace the community aspect of post-game chat. The devs have said that it was done due to crossplay reasons, however it worked fine before. No one wanted its removal. I think it was to prevent toxicity, but I must say that taking away player choice isn't the way to do it. An Overwatch-like ""approval"" system could be a good fit. People that fall in a certain ""approval"" bracket could be paired with each other or some other system that doesn't punish all players. I've met way more kind-hearted than toxic people in the chat. I see no reason too remove it. 

On the other hand we heard the the devs would be testing Easy Anti-Cheat Integration. Why? I've never met a single cheater in this game. Now - I haven't tested what this means for modding and playing on other, more obscure platforms. But in a worst case scenario it might mean that cosmetic modding is basically gone, along with gaming on older / more obscure OSes.

What I'm trying to convey through this wall of text is that giving up freedom for some sake of security is not a good thing. Of course I'm talking about the game. Of COURSE this can't *possibly* apply to rewal life and I'm only talking about the game here ;).

Anyway, this is all I want to say. All that's left is to wait for the devs to respond to community concerns. Well, bya."

24433,"Brawlhalla é um ótimo jogo por várias razões.

O jogo é meio desbalanceado, tendo alguns personagens com Signatures {(Sigs) Ataques únicos de cada personagem} mais poderosas que outros, e algumas meio roubadas. Mas tudo sendo balanceado pelos atributos de cada personagem.

Em Brawlhalla cada personagem possui duas armas diferentes, e Sigs baseadas em cada arma, para cada personagem. É um total de 6 sigs por personagem, 3 por arma, uma para o lado, uma neutra, e uma para baixo. Elas diversificam o jogo e permitem combos únicos.

O sistema de combate é simples, também. Você aprende rápido, mas leva tempo para dominar, com a movimentação sendo a parte mais importante do game.

O jogo também possui uma ótima conexão online. Você pode jogar o multiplayer sem problemas de lag ou ping alto, tornando justo para os dois jogadores na partida, ou 4 se estiver jogando o 2v2.

Bom, eu não sei escrever reviews, então não falarei muito para evitar mais erros de português, mas é isso.

Brawlhalla é um jogo bom, tem jogabilidade boa, personagens únicos, multiplayer bom, e patos.

24529,the best fighting game probably
24530,"i think it's good idk, i don't play that much"
24531,This game is so fucking bad it makes no sense abilities go to far or too short no character is equivalent to others. The game makes it to where one character is superior to others or one character is worse than all of them. Then you have all the stupid spamming characters who's attacks go across the entire map and makes everything ass. This game is a copy and paste of smash bros but a million times worse. The game sucks at copy and pasting a game how is that possible. Half of the maps and characters have little to no effort put into them either making the character busted or trash and either making the map too small or big overall just retarded.

Were you looking to ease back, take some time off and have fun??? unless you're a true masochist that enjoys getting shit on by 9 year olds on mountain dew or a 23 year old living in their moms basement THIS IS NOT THE GAME TO PLAY. Ive put too many hours as is and this game gets less and less rewarding the higher you climb and the more you improve. Unless this game fixes the matchmaking system and its broken (and constantly lagging or crashing) servers; I strongly suggest other games"

24604,"i love that im good at this game. I hate that i know what it takes to be good at this game and how steep the learning curve can get for players. 
Your early game career will consist of enjoying the high paced fluidity of the mechanics. trying new characters, different weapons ect until you find your prefered style. button mashing with be a thing and spammed attacks will happen
Mid game youll start to figure out how to dodge better, how to use special attacks in the air better. youll pick up a true combo more than likely and start doing some minor predictions. perfecting your craft will be the enjoyment.
End game though... end game... its all about predictions, speed, and true combos. some characters can true combo you from 0 health all the way to certain death. and it is AGGRIVATING. a counter mechanic would balance this out. as a lot of characters cant get close to such combos. and rely on predicitons rather than muscle memory. some of your matches will be absolutley intence. a minute will go by and you guys just cant land a hit on eachother. and its like you made a friend through combat. the highs are high.. but the lows can be low. the meta isnt hard to pick up on. arrows lances and rocket spears are the try hards. ive uninstalled and re installed a few times now,"
24605,"I thought this was smashbros
"
24606,"good game
"
24607,"1. hit connection is random, its not even consistent like in other fighting games.
2. The game dogging is dog water, you depend on spamming the dodge button most of the time
3. Most of the damn characters have either the same moves or other characters bs moves, that are impossible to counter half of the time.
4. Half of the people in ranked are either really good or end up spamming one move.
5. If your in silver in ranked, you gonna get loaded randomly with platinum or diamond players, there's no skill base match making at all.

Go play Mortal Kombat, Smash Bros, any of the Ufc games, Dragon Ball or Jump Force if you want a fighting game, Brawlhalla is a completed DOG $HlT of a game."

24614,"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

24734,Bad game with stupid moderation.. I really don't recommend this shit ( DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS SHIT) I had problem with this stupid game and i asked moderator ( Name : Arsonist - in dc). But after 2 min he just banned me from the server with no reason... It's full trash game.
24735,"This game is not fun to play unless you have a group of friends, or are only interested in the E-sports/competitive scene. The casual mode is populated solely by players who don't know what they're doing, and sweaty comp players looking to have fun at other people's expense. The competitive scene is actually marginally better and the people might even compliment you on rare occasion. (usually just insult you)
Playing offline against bots is boring because they're so basic even at high difficulties, some attacks they aren't scripted to dodge at all, and others they will dodge flawlessly without any telegraphing. The game also utilizes a premium currency bought with real cash for loot crates that only contain cosmetic items. The game is not pay to win, but it's also not enjoyable enough to be worth any money."

24811,"Shit game. Teaches you how to play like a pussy in a genre that should be all about combat.
Instead of playing cat and mouse with the opponent for as long as me, choose something else."
24812,"Ignore the positive review mark, this is a game that I can not place whether I like or hate it. Brawlhalla is a game that polarizes my emotional state. When it's going good, It's REAL good, I get really pumped. On the other hand when it's not I want to rip my hair out and stab my next door neighbor.

It's mostly just little squicks that really get me going, like some hitboxes are a bit wonky, or sometimes my inputs just get sent to a gulag. It's the small things that make it feel like I'm being pegged and passing a kidney stone at the same time, but I can just chalk that up to skill difference. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I enjoy the game, it's entertaining. The physics feel pretty solid, and it has a wide variety of characters, so there’s probably someone who you’ll like. My most favorite part of this game doesn’t really involve playing it, I like making cosmetic mods for it for me and friends that play the game. This is a game where I can think absolute horrible things then instantly queue again, so I guess there is a hook.  

I am not good at this game and I will never say I am, but I can say get a few friends and try it out. I will not say that it won't hurt, but it won't hurt your wallet and that's all that matters."
24813,"cool

"
24814,"For all the hours i have on this game i think id rather get tortured to death, first off the games inputs can be very delayed, second most of the weapons are super unbalanced ( scythe / lance ) which makes players who have a lot of hours not like it. Third signatures, you can sig spam which makes the game unfun for experienced players especially when a person who never hits the light attack button beats a platinum. This game is literately worse than For honor  and cod infinite warfare."

The community is very toxic and is quite split up. You really notice how you improve just by playing the game and become able to do cooler combos and such.

24944,"sure, in its basics its ""another smash clone"" but honestly the original characters and its manner of approaching movesets is pretty unique. It forces certain groups to learn the same things even when using different characters by having shared weapons, but ALSO keeping a uniqueness to each character by giving them sigs with beautiful animations. Plus, the lore is fun to think about. I began playing this game years ago with friends in class in highschool years ago... nowadays I still play it and I am graduated and in college. Most of my friends have fallen out of playing it, but there is still a few who I queue up with to have fun :)"

25009,"Gonna throw some quotes I heard over the years from players:
1. Brawlhalla is a balanced game where you can win with any legend or weapon 
2. Meta doesn't matter unless you're a high elo diamond or pro
3. High elo players aren't passive it's their way of maintaining neutral

Translation:
1. LOL just play passive bro you'll win and get to diamond eventually 
2. LOL you're plat so your opinion doesn't matter
3. LOL just run and spam nlight bro

(This was because of the large learning curve this game has). But as time went on and I began to learn the mechanics of the game it became more and more enjoyable and at almost 800 hours on the game id say its more fun than ever. 

If you're looking for a new game and have some extra time to learn how to play I would highly recommend downloading this game as you will not regret it."

- People running around for 10 hours until they SideRC you and instantly kill you
- Combos are easy as shit to learn
- Spamming is so fucking common that I can't even with it
- B O M B .
- Some of the maps are AWFUL, especially ""Fortress of the Lions""
- holy fuck i could write an entire essay just on the lance in this game
- characters are unbalanced its like they didn't even think about what they were adding
- fist counters every fucking thing in the game
- i could buy a nSwitch and Smash Bros with the amount of money you can spend on this game.

25268,good game
25269,terrible balancing and trying to get into gold is nothing but super sweat smurf accounts or heavy tactical spammers. and its a stun fighting game so if you get caught in one attack against some one who knows only the one combo for each weapon type its pretty much over. joke of a fighting game and not worth your time since there are only two playing types to play around. dont listen to your friends who say its a balanced game. rocket lance is still absurdly broken.

25340,"Overall, Brawlhalla has changed drastically since the release of this review. A lot of the information here is no longer correct and there are new gameplay features, dash being the most important. I certainly still feel that it is far too easy to avoid and/or delay interaction between yourself and the opponent, but it would be disingenuous of me to pretend the specifics of this review are still accurate.

Although I am giving this game a positive review, I must say that it comes with a massive disclaimer. If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriously, you will likely enjoy yourself. However, if you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high level, Brawlhalla's glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till you're on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else. All of the reviews - including the negative ones - are ignoring the real problems with this game, and it's something I have thought about for a long time. So, I'll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flaws.

On the surface, Brawlhalla is an entertaining party game, provided you have some friends to play it with. So, if the only thing you're looking for is a simple game to kill some time (read: 1500 hours) with, download it. It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience. Aside from being easy to play, it is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost money, so it is easy to get into as well. There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale. You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levels, so there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding. It also helps that a potato could likely run this game.

While I do consider this game's positives enough to make it worth downloading, that’s just about all the positivity I have to share. As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hours, I can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess. I'm not going to complain about the toxic community, or the netcode, or matchmaking, or any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about. I'm only going to talk about the game's core mechanics and why it fails competitively.

Brawlhalla has a dodge mechanic that grants virtually instant invincibility and makes you unhittable for nearly half a second. Dodging has very low risk because it has only 0.97 seconds of downtime and it is difficult to punish unless your opponent can predict exactly where you will dodge. You can dodge in 8 directions at any given time, and if you are running you can dodge twice in succession. When the iframes from the dodge end, you are able to jump or attack almost immediately, which is one of the main reasons why it’s so ridiculously safe. You can also jump in any direction 3 times, and once you're in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around. This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passive, floaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches. Usually, making the first attack means risking being punished, whereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack. Because of this, it often feels like you’re chasing your opponent rather than fighting them. Seriously, playing this game feels like you're in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent. Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsing, burning building. Sometimes, salty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them. Yes, this is a problem with the community, but it shouldn’t be possible in the first place. A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure. Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase. Brawlhalla’s neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves (in this case, hurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching).

Another issue that ties into dodging and movement is wall camping. It’s possible to wall camp almost endlessly and force your opponent into a disadvantage if they want to approach. Players have won tournament matches by abusing this. A mechanic was introduced that stops you from getting your jumps back after touching the wall too many times, but it's rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping. Once you get comfortable with movement in this game, it’s incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you want.

If you’re reading this and you don’t play Brawlhalla, you might be thinking that all the problems I’ve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity. Unfortunately, the entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic. Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than others, with some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read. A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta. The only way I can imagine this game’s passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodging, jumping, and probably every weapon in the game as well. Understandably, the developers don’t know what that rework should be and how to conduct it. They’re trying to fix the game’s passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the huge, overarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always had.

The other day, I told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to win, which meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me. I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this. Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat. Admittedly, although I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't blame a single one of those people for their anger. Brawlhalla, when played at a high level, is legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence. Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching you, wall camped, or outright ran away from you for the entire game. Considering this, it’s no wonder why Brawlhalla’s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxious, salty fumes.

As much as I want to give this game a negative review, I cannot justifiably do so. Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has. So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review. My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously. However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours."

25591,"This game is so bad that i have to take the time to write this review. This game seems like a blast at first. Wow haha funny knock your friends away! So you play it. And again. And again. And again. And after your 4th game your realise how bad this game really is. It is just smash but ass. terrible ping depending on where you live and even worse when someone that has bad wifi hosts a custom room (1 bar). Not only is this game boring and unbearable, There are way to many microtransactions and it takes way too long to save up for legends or even leveling up in general. Skins are locked behind microtransactions and none can be unlocked for free. Shite ass game. 4/10 dont play"

25622,"I've played this game for a long time, can't say it's good, or bad. What you have to know is that the game requires skill to grind or even feel good, Losing must be a friend of yours while you're playing the game until you get used to the mechanics and understand how the physics work for having better predictions over time. I play the game from time to time, to have fun with friends, I actually already made a lot through my experience in this game.

But here is a very important tip, if you are someone that easily rages, and not mentally okay, Then do NOT play it, the game sometimes drives me crazy, and many others i knew, the reasons are different, mostly spamming, network problems, input problems and many others. Playing the game in this case, can be cancer for you, and I will have to warn not to play it, this isn't something distinctive about this game, some other games has this too (no need to mention any names), and that's why I thought it's gonna be good to mention this point.

Cya gamers all around!! have fun, and be safe!"
25623,good
25624,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

25637,"Absolute garbage combat system, it works for lower levels. For higher levels its just tryhards spazzing out and having strokes to hide animations, maybe some lightspam with scythes too. And the meta is literally not letting your enemy pick up weapons and fight (in a FIGHTING game) snoozehalla.
Overall good game idea but the meta is beyond toxic"

25670,"i love this game alot, play a ton, but i have to say the match making/ranking setting is pretty shit. At no point should you ever be playing someone 60 elo higher then you, Lose (obviously cause you arent at that level) and drop 14 points. that insane and a impossible grind. An its not something that happens once or twice, me and my brother see it literally every nigh we play. An we only play for about 2-3hours most nights.  So if  you play, i wouldnt take it to serious with ranked unless they can fix that. Great game tho besides that."

Interesting characters with a generous amount of play-styles, Fast paced game-play, REWARDING skill climb and generally nice community.(though sodium intake wont be a problem as there is plenty of salt.)"
25678,I like shittting on midgets
25679,this game is awful. all my friends started playing and then their balls just got really really really small for some reason and they became unable to speak intelligently. they can barely form a coherent sentence. especially low man. he got hit pretty hard and hasn't really been all there mentally since. sometimes i cry myself to sleep thinking about what ive done in getting my friends to play this game thus causing them permanent ball and brain damage. truly a terrifying eye opening experience that i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy.

25693,"Good game. Fast paced. Challenging.

Matchmaking F-ng sucks. Hard to climb & improve after certain point.

Great to have fun with friends. Many different characters, weapons & game modes. Grindable colors, emblems, frames & weapon skins. Tons of purchasable  character/weapon skins & fun crossovers. Battle Pass has good value & keeps you entertained. 

After certain point you notice the game needs some serious balancing. At least half of the characters have 1 or more broken Signature. Some weapons are a little too advantageous over others.

7/10 overall. It's good but it has the potential to become so much better."

25949,It's got very fun gameplay. Exactly like smash bros. where you keep weakening them in order to smash them away. Also the walking dead crew including Negan is in the game so thats a huge plus. Too bad you gotta pay £10 just for one of them

25957,"Once you come to the fact that all you have to do is learn all of the true combos for every legend, figure out the weapon physics to the point of effectively using it mid battle, become organic and unpredictable with your dodge patterns, be able to understand you can figure out what your opponent's future dodge patterns could probably be and play around that alll ontop of the relentlessness of the community as a whole? The game's pretty dope, for sure.     Double chase dodging, forgot that one. Kinda important."

25989,"some characters' signatures (heavy attacks) are really unbalanced and spammable, as well as their stats (you get tanky damage dealers).The problem with character hitboxes is also there. The 2v2 ranked gamemode incorporates the  ""small"" map type(chosen randomly) which is really dependent of your weapon currently  on hand (which causes serious advantages and disadvantages).

as a couch game - absolutely 
as a competitive game - run far away from it"

I can tell that they weren't attached to it as well, and just wanted people they knew to join and play with them. The 2vs2 are a little bit fun and challenging, while other game modes seem alright but still, they get boring after a while. Crossovers are always hyped in this game and once you get used to the mechanics you could tell that they are nothing more than just skins who can use the same weapons as any other character can. The only difference is the animations of how they use these weapons. Overall, an enjoyable game that I would rate 3 out of 5 stars."

My email to Blue Mammoth Games regarding a tragic incident:

Hello Blue Mammoth Games,

Me and my good buddies have played  Brawlhalla since the closed beta. I still play gnash to this day and he has always been one of my favourites. My friend Kevin Chung has strictly picked Teros ever since downloading your game. He is level 46 Teros! 

We have all enjoyed your game as a way to talk with each other and have some good laughs. Most of the laughs and good times we had were on one particular map, Wally. We recently noticed with the latest patch that Wally does no longer appear to be in the active rotation of test maps. Upon noticing this, we were all deeply sorrowed. We tried to play a friendly match on what I believe was called, “Grumpy Temple”. It was very underwhelming. I miss the crazy unorthodox angles of Wally. I miss the hectic nature of Wally. I miss the unfinished textures of Wally. I miss laughing with my friends on Wally.

I know not many other people play or even know Wally exists. But we few; who have easily accumulated more than %65 of total playtime being spent on Wally, do greatly miss this map. 

I ask you, with all the kindness in your hearts, to please reinstate Wally back into the test map rotation. I really do hope this email works.

Thank you,
Your Greatest Fan,
The “A – Meister”

26298,"It’s tempting to view Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise as one of a kind. But recently, other games have attempted to capture that same accessible blend of platforming and fighting. If you enjoy Smash Bros. gameplay, but for some reason dislike Nintendo characters, you have options. Originally released in 2017, following a beta in 2015, Brawlhalla remains the alternative platform fighter with perhaps the most staying power. The free-to-play game sports a unique and approachable, if unpolished, set of fighting mechanics that appeals to even veteran Smash fans. Nintendo Switch owners should still stick to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as that game doesn’t lock the bulk of its content behind paywalls. However, as a crossplay-friendly console, mobile, and PC game, Brawlhalla is the platform fighter for the rest of us.

Brawlhalla fight
Run, Jump, and Fight
From indie games like Brawlout, Rivals of Aether, and Shovel Knight Showdown, to the conceptually interesting (if now forgotten) Sony mascot counterpart PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, a platform fighter is really just a nicer way of saying a Super Smash Bros. clone. Other fighting games lock opponents into a rigid arena, whether it’s the 2D plane of Street Fighter or Tekken’s 3D circular battlefield. The depth in those games comes from mastering each character’s complex moveset.

Characters in platform fighters tend to have simpler movesets (you won’t be doing any fireball or dragon punch motions), which gives them a reputation for being more casual. However, they also give players far more expressive movement options, akin to running and jumping in 2D platformers. The stages feature platforms that encourage a more kinetic playstyle. Instead of whittling down health bars, you defeat opponents by knocking them out of the arena, sumo-style. The more damage you take, the easier you become to knock out.
All of this is true in Brawlhalla, and as a longtime Smash Bros. devotee, I immediately clicked with its fundamental combat mechanics. You have a light attack and heavy attack that change depending on direction. There are no grabs, outside of character-specific command grabs, but you do have a brief shield that transitions into a dodge.
However, Brawlhalla also introduces twists that should fascinate fellow fans of this fighting subgenre. You have three jumps, as well as endless wall jumps, which give you many flexible options for recovering after being knocked out. The most reliable way to score a kill is by just demolishing an opponent with one strong attack. Instead of Smash’s damage percentage counter, Brawlhalla color codes each fighter’s icon to display how vulnerable they are to being knocked out of the arena.

Brawlhalla’s item system sits somewhere between Smash’s wacky, random power-ups and a balanced weapons fighter in the vein of Samurai Shodown or Soul Calibur. Weapon icons frequently spawn on the battlefield, and by picking them up you’ll gain one of two potential weapons determined by your character. Special attacks from these axes, swords, and guns entirely change your moveset. Without a weapon, everyone has the same fast, but short-ranged punches and kicks. Weapons give you vital variety in your attack options. Sometimes, the smartest thing to do is toss your weapon at your foe. Other random projectiles include bombs and spike balls. 

Overall, the system could still use a bit more depth, particularly in making characters feel more distinct, but it’s far from brainless. I quickly stumbled across some promising combos and techniques. For instance, a short-range strike pops opponents up into the perfect angle to get sniped in the air with an arrow. The fighting feels unique enough compared to Smash Bros. to justify its existence.
Like any good party game, Brawlhalla features local play for you and friends. Up to eight players can join the fracas. Other offline modes include training and tutorials, as well as tournaments against challenging computer opponents.

Once you’re ready to take on the world, enter Brawlhalla's online multiplayer modes. You can quickly jump into casual free-for-all or team matches or test experimental changes, similar to Overwatch's test server. Ranked play pits you against serious, competitive players. I never stood a chance, and I couldn’t blame my losses on poor connections because I didn’t experience much lag, unlike certain matches in Smash Bros. Granted, the looser feel of these games doesn’t require precise timing and frame counting like in other fighting games. 

You can create custom game rooms for you and friends. Brawlhalla also mixes things up with a new limited game with a quirky gimmick each week. Platform King forces you to move to the correct platform and earn points. Another mode has players trapping the opposing team in bubbles. Even before Ubisoft acquired the developers at Blue Mammoth Games, Brawlhalla played a bit like a modern Rayman game, so I was also happy to see Rayman Legends’ chaotic melee soccer minigame Kung Foot make a return alongside a playable Rayman.

Everyone Is Here (For a Price)
Brawlhalla’s fighting mechanics serve as the addictive base every free-to-play game needs to entice players to spend money. Unfortunately, you will have to spend money, either as one-off store purchases or as part of a battle pass subscription, to unlock the bulk of Brawlhalla’s content.

Brawlhalla’s continuously expanding roster has dozens of characters, including guest star costumes like Steven Universe, Hellboy, and real-life wrestler Xavier Woods. Characters aren’t cosmetics, they’re the core of a fighting game. You need to test lots of characters to learn who you like, and to learn how to play against others.
However, aside from training modes, you’ll need to drop cash, or do a lot of grinding, to get a roster larger than the measly initial rotation. The same goes for emotes, weapon skins, KO effects, and more. It makes the absolutely massive Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with its tagline of “Everyone Is Here,” seem even more generous. I recommend just buying the one-time $20 pass to unlock every present and future character.
Brawlhalla sports a flat cartoony art style that sometimes looks like a Flash game, but at least it has a lot of color and personality. I’ve always wanted a Smash Bros. game that used sprites instead of polygonal models, and this is the closest thing outside of fan projects.

The downside is that aside from the handful of recognizable mascots (Lara Croft, Shovel Knight), the somewhat generic, MOBA-ish fantasy characters tend to blur together in the heat of battle. They all have generally the same chibi proportions and share many of the same weapons. I found myself becoming detached from fights I couldn’t fully follow or get invested in. Ironically, I gained sympathy for people who voiced similar criticisms about Smash Bros. Brawlhalla’s bland stages also left me disappointed. Forget Smash Bros.' bustling battlefields ripped from other games. These stages as generic as the characters, but with none of the charm. Their pedestrian layouts, while competitively balanced, do little to amp up the excitement.

The good news is that Brawlhalla’s simple visuals allow it to run at a smooth 60 frames per second even on my old HP Envy 17 laptop. Aside from the PC version, the game is available on consoles and mobile phones. Even better, crossplay lets everyone compete together, although I found using a controller to be far superior to using a touch screen or mouse and keyboard. This also isn't the kind of fighting game you want to play with a fight stick. You can’t even adjust graphic settings, because there’s nothing really to adjust. You can at least customize the controls.
At fighting game tournaments, you have your main tournaments, with big popular games that draw in crowds, and your side tournaments, with smaller and less recognizable games that still deserve a shot."

26300,lol good game ez
26301,"This is a very interesting fighting game with its own chips. Every month new characters, gamepad support. And this game is free. I often play this game with friends, and we have a lot of fun. But there are also disadvantages: some cards are imbalanced, not all have cool characters, this also creates an imbalance. I think if you play this game for fun, then you will like it.

26328,"Let's start off by saying, yes, this is indeed a PC version of Smash Bros. But at the same time it feels unique. 

Some characters feel very alike because they all share the same type of weapons, but at the same they are very unique in the style they use them, animations, etc. Each weapon has the same standard attacks, but the special attacks are all different from each character.

The gameplay feels really good (when you've got a good connection), and you can make some insane combos when you've played the game for a while. I haven't played this game as much as other people might have, but the hours i have gotten out of the game have been very fun.

Also i want to mention the crossovers. You can play as characters from Adventure Time, Steven Universe, The Walking Dead, WWE and Kung Fu Panda and many more! I know it's probably for marketing, but at the same time it's so awesome.

One complaint is just meeting tryhards in public lobbies, but that's probably just me being salty and bad.

7/10 would recommend to people who doesn't have smash bros, but even if you have, you should still try it out."

26391,good game
26392,guy hit man go fly and die
26393,"I just want this game to make a better communication between mouse and keyboard. For example when i click left mouse (basic attack) sometimes its not attacking on time its having a delay. Same with mouse 3 middle mouse, sometimes it happens that when im out of the platform throwing my weapon it doesnt want to throw it. It waits till i fall in void. So this stupid game can maybe repair it.

26426,"Yes, very fun pvp platformer game, with unique characters all with their own unique lore. This game features amazing move sets, being able to do long strings and has what they call heavy attacks with visual effects to boot and every legend has 3 of such heavy attacks which u can pair with your combo strings should you choose to do so.  Although the art style may not be for everyone, so please do keep that in mind, but in my opinion it is a very fun game"

26453,"This game is very well crafted, has really nice skins, great progression, and I really good game to play with friends. There's just one thing wrong: the servers are T R A S H and the only solution I can find online is to pay monthly for a service that routes you to better servers. With these garbage servers, there's input lag which basically makes it impossible to get good with random input lag that makes it very hard to react, and sometimes it just straight up does something different on my screen for 3 whole seconds and then shows me what actually happened which 99% of the time is me dying and having 0 control over that outcome. I know its not just me because I see this everywhere online and I have never had connection issues in any other game, and I play A LOT of multiplayer games. This game is very good but it goes from a 9/10 to a 1/10 because it's simply unplayable some days. FIX YOUR SERVERS! It is literally the only issue this game has!"

If you're expecting something extremely competitive, this probably isn't for you, just go play Smash Melee.

Fun character roster, a bunch of great game modes. Free to play, No P2W.
Animation/art style is basic. Tutorial is there but lacking all non-basic concepts, and training mode needs dummy recordings. A lot of weird tiny hitboxes on attacks, but I've not experienced any glaring balance issues with characters."

26553,It's addicting once you get into it but it's not very beginner friendly since rank starts you in silver and not in tin where it should start. This can often lead to beginners getting demoralized not beating anyone in ranked because the players in that bracket already have some experience compared to beginners.

26558,"Finally decided to review this game. 

Bottom line is, this is a great PvP fighting game. It's fast, responsive, and good for casuals and sweaty bois alike. Easy to learn, difficult to master. I prefer Brawlhalla way more than smash bros because of the tempo and balance of weapons/legends. The developers are always adding and cycling stuff throughout the game so you can expect new or fresh content. It's definitely worth a shot considering the base game is free, chances are you will end up liking this game."

26580,very bad childish game. got to diamond easy as hell.
26581,"Yes I know, how am I making a ""No"" review for a game that I already have over 500 hours in?

Short Answer: Somewhat addictive. Badly balanced. Has one of the worst and most toxic communities I have came across. Can easily turn you into a toxic and aggressive person, which means it can really ruin your life, despite being a *game*. Has many Input and Network issues.
======================
Long Answer.
The game is so badly balanced: Most good players exploit this imbalance to their favor which not only breaks the fun but annoyingly destroys the players who try to keep the fun around. The game is made in a way that you will really want to win, unless you actually do your best in a match and you're very proud of it.

The game has one of the worst and most toxic communities I have witnessed so far: This includes not exactly every single player in the game (because we will exclude new and the rare good players), but around 90% of the players.

The game can easily turn you into a toxic and aggressive person: That's simply due to playing with toxic and aggressive people, and there's nothing to explain here. If are not getting how this makes any sense, this is like ""Spending time with happy people will make you a happier person"".

The game has many Input and Network issues: I absolutely hate this (everyone does), The escape button in this game is broken, when you're in a match and you're thinking of exiting the match, the escape button may or may not work on the press, so... yes, it happens by luck that the escape key may actually display the options menu so you can quit. And that was only one Input issue, there are some others. Network issues in this game are well known, by issues we can include many different problems like lag, input lag, sound lag, etc...

I can definitely recommend every game out that (who haven't played the game already) to not even think about it. Find something better to do in your life or just play another ""good and worthy"" game and have some real fun! Cyall around Gamers!"
26582,"Game is utter shit, those fuckers need to fix this broken shit and stop sucking eachother off fcking fuckers"

26632,this game is no good. game is bad no fun (pls buy me the dlc)
26633,Brawlhalla is a super fun game it's on every device it's not one of those easy games where u can just easily win or it's easy for everyone it does actaully take some skill you have legends where you unlock them by playing games wich i find fun and different gamemodes like a ffa a 1v1 or 2v2 and duels maybe more im still quite new it's free wich makes it better
26634,k
26635,"when i first download this game i thought its a good and fun game to play, buuuut after some time in the game you'll get too toxic, the tutorial in the game teaches you nothing cause the main play is full of secrets and so hard to learn (trust me i've played the game for 70hrs), the matchmaking is awful in ranked matches cause they're not skill based at all and the game itself is so much boring after 1 hour of play, so if you love your gaming accessories, just leave this game in peace and never install it."
26636,"Absolut dogshit game if you want to play competetive full with booster and smurfs you will not have fun and after the game when you see the enemy team 1 with 1.3k elo and 1 with 1.8 seems very balanced to me.

Stay away from this game and look for something better i highly advise to do so or you will loose every bit off mental health you have, this game is the worst brawler you can imagine, stale meta, boring waite for enmey to atack and dodge for a punish playstyle meta, highly unbalanced weapon and legends as well and if your lucky 1 balance patch in a year the rest of patches are just mtx patches so they can make more money with this mess of a game i wouldent mind if they do so to fix the game but the servers getting worse and like no patches because ""they dont want to adjust stuff while a season of pro brawlhalla witch nearly last a year so thats that.

im done ranting above this dogshit game and rdy to move one and hope there will be another game to fill the need of a funny brawler thats not a mess like this."

26668,"This game makes me so mad, that I want to break everything. Would play again!"
26669,This game was fun 2-3 years ago but in the last year the meta for the semi-casual player has gone to hell. Its sigs over and over again and just not fun like it used to be when the focus was on combos with lights. I actually uninstalled it after 3.5 years.

26672,"Brawlhalla is a great fighting game... if you overlook the toxicity that goes on in online matches. There's a bit of a steep learning curve but if you put in enough time and effort, it's really rewarding."

26772,"after 630 hours its my time to review this game

the game itself its fine, the weapon movesets have depth.
the community is awful, a TOXIC hellhole
2v2 ranked (plat) is literally unplayable, thanks to Teros, Zariel, and Queen Nai spammer.

The recent dodge changes are AWFUL in my honest opinion, it no longer rewards mindful play and dodging, people can just dodge out of punishes due to the fast dodge cooldown. punishing bad play doesn't seem rewarding and people are better off spamming (fuck ranked tbh)

The recent wall slip changes are amazing and promotes more aggressive plays. but the dodge changes are reflecting the opposite.

now i only play this game with friends. nvm fuck my friends

im not a native english speaker, sorry for the bad grammar."
26773,Brawlhalla is one of the best games i have played in a while.  anyone who says brawlhalla is a rip off of smash most likely has never played Brawl

26819,"This is one of these games that you play, you get into, learn combos and characters, maybe even buy a skin or two. Then you drop it (for a reason or another). Then when you least expect it, you scroll through your library, you see the title and and you install it again because of the quick dopamine rush you get after a winning streak ^^

I love this game~! Otherwise i wouldn't spend 340+h on it, when games last few minutes.

Keep in mind two things:
1. It's easy to learn, hard/takes time to master.
2. No matter what, try to be as positive in the chat as possible. This game already has toxic people, no need to add to the pile. Just saying gg after a game (it's literally binded to one button by default) is enough to show respect for a fight, even if you lost no matter how badly. There's always another match :)"

26947,This game gives me cancer but I love it.
26948,"The game is pretty good and fun considering it's free. It gets updates often, balance patches and new character come every once in a while.
BUT you shouldnt bother trying to play this seriously. You will have connection issues. The engine is old and clunky, so gameplay isnt always smooth, which will cause you random input lag and sometimes just completely miss some inputs. Some mechanics just break sometimes, walls will not have collision every once in a while and you will lose matches because of factors completely out of your control.
With the new anticheat system the input lag got somehow way worse and missing inputs are now very frequent to the point of matches being unplayable if you're unlucky"
26949,Terrible interface. Terrible
26950,gg
26951,"This game makes me so mad at times, but that's completely on me. The game is fun and can be competitive, but it can also be played in a free for all, that often depends on luck and taking the right chances. It's easy to understand and hard to master.
 For a free game, you have great variety and hours upon hours of gameplay to enjoy with friends or alone, with more than 50 characters and not even a bit of pay-to-win or any pay-wall for the said gameplay.  
That's right, despite being free, you can only buy cosmetic stuff. That said, if you get hooked and play 200 hours before you know it, chances are you might buy yourself something.

Cons: 
 If you really want to be competitive on ranked, you might want to have good peripherals ( good keyboard, screen, good internet) and if you play with a joystick, it's very important to configure it properly and have a good one with minimal delay, but that's only for competitive playing."

26957,"I would most definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys/is interested in platform fighters. Brawlhalla is a simple to pick up but difficult to master type game, unlike a lot of other fighters, and is what makes it a viable option for all to play. It's an overall fantastic game and is a must play for those who are experienced in platform fighters.

26960,"Bralhalla is not a very fun game at all. None of the weapons really stand out, the game is balanced sure, but it feels way too competitive, depending on your elo everyone uses the same weapons and characters with the same stats. Oh did I forget that some people use high defense legends as a crutch because they get hit way too much, basically forcing almost everyone to use defense stance or attack stance. Not to mention how gauntlets are still one of the strongest weapons since the past year and a half I've been playing this game. The meta rarely ever changes and some characthers never get tweaked. The monetization is pretty good actually, I just think that players should be able to choose 1 characther to unlock after reaching lv 5 or 10 with their account. Scythe is not broken and I see why people like it, but in general, the weapons have barely changed at all and it is boring, only time the game ever feels fresh is whenever a new character comes out, but its not enough. ""Oh but Team Fortress has gone multiple years without updates and people stay play it"" Yeah, that is because the game is as balanced like brawlhalla, it is fun to shoot, and because you either hit or miss someone, verytime you die you think ""Man, if I tried juking him the other way I could've won that"" which aptly rewards skill and game sense, doesn't matter if Brawlhalla does't do the same thing because Team Fortress 2 still rewards you for losing with contracts. And even with brawlhalla rewards you with coins and a random color for your character, all you use them for is other characters and more colors. But because brawlhalla doesn't feel rewarding whenever you lose, its not that worth it unlocking all the characters unless you are just in love with this game. It is a good party game for sure, but I don't ever see myself playing this instead of other games."
26961,IT SUCKS
26962,nice
26963,this is the best game i have ever played
26964,"I'm a chill guy, I usually don't get mad when I play games but this game.. I'm telling you, this game is something different

26974,"It's quite a fun casual game. Controls are easy to understand and best played with a group of 4. Anymore than that, the arenas are a bit too small and gets too chaotic really fast. 

It's a good game to play with friends that aren't into gaming and it's very compatible with the mobile version."

27196,"This game is too gud, too exciting, too intense, too toxic"
27197,gudgame
27198,This game has by far the worst development history I have ever seen. Brawlhalla used to be fun... But now its just bad. The input delay is fucking horrible. It is legit impossible to play. And you cant even use any programms that reduce it because they now have an anti-cheat for whatever reason. In my +1000 hours i have never met a hacker because it is just not possible to hack in this game. The anti-cheat also makes your input delay soooo much worse. The developers really need to focus more on the gameplay than on crossovers. So many players are quitting the game because it is not fun anymore. I really hope they maybe consider doing anything that pleases the community.
27199,"Yes

27292,"A Great (and very addicting, very very addicting) Fighting game with simple controls and battle mechanics
It's a really fun game with alot of free cosmetics (Battle passes/Twitch rewards/Colors) and is probably the best Party game hands down! (though it can be better, i'll get to that about now)

Now this game should stop pumping out cosmetics for the rich and work on it's features
(besides bps5 being absolutely dope)

-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Here are things i want fixed soon, Please do understand having them unfixed doesn't make me hate the game or play it less, They're just things i hope to get a solution
If they were to be done i would play alot more >D<

- Account linking -
ik it's being worked on every week but an easy solution is just to make a special Blue Mammoth Games account system and it can be linked with Steam, Google Play and PS accounts while Apple accounts can't be linked with anything but can still make an account, or not...

- BP Shrines -
Battle passes are an absolute waste for both the players and the company.
The company only makes money from their great hard work for only a limited time.
while players who started playing late look at the previous Battle passes and cry inside... (i started playing halfway at BP4 TwT)
How to fix these issues? Restart the gosh dang Battle passes!! but with a twist..
Now people who've finished the Battle passes might get angsty at this feature and honestly that's just dumb and selfish... but they do get a reward for being there... It's that they won't spend extra money.
Pressing the Battle pass while there is no Battle pass or if there is an active one there would be a new tab above named (Shrines), Pressing it would show a new menu named (The Battle pass shrines) why shrines? donaskme.
Each previous Battle pass would be there and you can spend like 10$ to reactivate it only for yourself for 85 or hecc even 40 days, Two Battle passes of course can overlap and there would be two tracks, The ongoing one and the reactivated one.

- Trading -
Ok hear me out, Trading has a bad rep for being a feature where alot of people get scammed but really that is the Trading system's fault, If both players agree on a trade than there should be a 5 sec timer where they can reject the trade or just wait for the timer to end to accept it
that is how scamming is prevented... Another thing is that colors should be tradeable and maintain the character even if it was a roll, Me and my friends always get eachother's mains while not getting ours and it's really frustrating. >:I
eg. My friend got Coat of Lions Yumiko (which is a limited time color :IIIIII)
This feature would make Giveaways (which are inevitable, don't get me started) alot easier and generally better for the community.
Maybe even make the Trades cost mammoth coins.

- Offline is horrendously boring -
The ""Party gamemode"" in the offline section is just making a custom room but without humans and no rewards, Now the bots i have no problem about them, they are surprisingly smart at Hard and above and seem really human (while at chosen they exit humanity and become satan himself) but my problem is that they are really uncustomizable... The easiest solution is just to make after Player 1 chooses their character/skin/color/weapon skins/stance they'll do the same for the bots.
Also in the offline Party gamemode everything should be unlocked just like in training... This might seem greedy but it's ""Offline"" so it would be just for fun, Plus they're just cosmetics -_- now stats don't have to be immediatly unlocked cuz they change the gamplay, Other than that i never play the Party gamemode unless i actually have no internet access.

- It should be playable for two people on the same keyboard - Fixed!

you deserve a medal for reading all that btw lel"
27293,i like it
27294,Bu oyuna fighting game diyenlerin beyini yok.

27298,good to play with friends or online
27299,best game
27300,"How do we start....

Well, Brawlhalla is a really good fighting game with a resonable price - free.
I don't know what other titles can you compare it to, only because it's literally free to play.
With comparison of gameplay to other fighters, Brawl was really easy to pick, medicore to master game. 
You just need some time and practice with youtube tutorials. 

What do you get by playing Brawlhalla:
-eternal depression
-unlimited stress and frustration
-ungodly anger
-raging over spammers who after game text: ""ez spammer get good kid"" (at this point you are starting complentating your life and maybe you're the person with problems)
-loosing your sanity in ranked
-BUT MAYBE 1 cool clip every couple of months

So would i reccomend this game?
If you're picking up this game, try to learn the basics and understand the game. It will take some time but in the end it will be worth it. If you will want to leave this bs of a game, then go ahead and do it, it'll be better for your mental. On the other hand if you're like me who don't know why this game is so addictive, i don't know what to tell you, it's jsut funny how i keep spending hours just playing this game and having fun.

One more thing, you will encounter many people trash-talking about you and your playstyle, don't listen to them if they're shitheads. They themselves probably lost their sanity being 0-to-deathed by Mordex players in experimental.

27303,"Good game to play with friends, however after a month or two it'll get boring. If you haven't got any buds you can try playing it with strangers but you will quit this game even quicker.

27343,"Brawlhalla was really cool when I had no cash for games, a simple platform fighter with fast pacing high skill ceiling and good gamefeel. None of the new characters really fit the classic vibe of the game but the polish added over the years had done loads to improve readability. overall brawlhalla has excellent online gameplay and freaking cool collaborations. 10/10"

27351,"If you are reading this stay away from this game, it isn't good people don't know how to play the game when they are losing. Every match turns into a heavy attack warzone and people stop having fun when they start to lose. Majority of people in this game do not have a light attacks key/button bound because heavy attacks are just better. 
Edit: 120 hours later, game is still bad just keeps getting worse."

The free to play sensation every claims is just 'another smash clone'  Hits different with it's weapon mechanics, lack of grabs, and ability to dodge. The game itself does a wonderful job expressing characters in a light hearted manner well enough for kids to play. 
With a guest cast just as diverse as smash bros, it's no wonder this is as big a hit for being completely free!"

27575,"This will be an in-depth review of the game, and take this as a semi-experienced, non-professional player’s point-of-view opinion, rather than fact, and you may disagree with me in any stage here. Do note that this is my first ever review of a game, so it may be a little scattered.

I will be going over:
- Toxicity
- Ranked
- META and Dodge
- Why I still play this game

Toxicity

Toxicity is for some reason, one of the “big” reasons a lot of people really dislike this game. I personally, do not mind this at all, sure there will be points where I would be a little mad. But in the end, it’s just a game, and I don’t really care that the devs put the salt taunt or the wave emote in. See there 2 examples of toxicity, 1 is where they lose and try to cope by calling you passive, or abusing the meta or a spammer, along with threats, then the other is when they win and trash talk you, maybe threatening you things like that. There’s one where being toxic is a genuine strategy to put off your opponent. But, I have 1000+ hours in this game, and when they win and are toxic, I accept that they were better in that particular match, and move on, personally, I don’t do this sort of toxic behaviour, and if I do say ez or trash, I usually say it to my friends and am clearly joking. Do note that no online game will have no toxic behaviour, so being a player who has played many games with toxic communities, it’s safe to say that this is normal. And this is one of the least things you should be worried about in the game.

Ranked

The ranked system is not the best. No numbered system will determine a player’s skill level, but it will help a person be consistent in their gameplay, with players of the same elo. Elo will not determine your skill, but your rank might. To evaluate, when a player in gold plays against an experienced platinum player, it is safe to say that the platinum player will win. Not because they are platinum, but rather because they’re more knowledgeable of the game mechanics and how to apply them into their gameplay. This is because your rank is predicting or averaging your skill level if you play it a lot. Another problem with the ranked system (more towards diamond players,) are queues. Being a player in a lower ladder ranked region SEA, queue times can be a problem, when playing a game like Valorant and waiting 5-10 minutes for a game is fine, due to the game lasting 30-40 minutes. Do you see where I’m going here? My longest lasting queue was for 10 minutes, while the game lasted for 3 minutes. Being a 2200+ player, I was queued into a high plat, therefore gaining about 2-5 elo. The queue lasted longer than the game. And the SEA ladder is lower than that of US-E and Europe, so unless you’re a professional SEA player, the elo difference of that of other regions are huge.

META and the Dodging Mechanic

The dodge is one of the biggest things Brawlhalla is differentiated from other platformer fighting games, commonly paired with Smash. It is it’s biggest uniqueness, and it’s biggest flaw in Brawlhalla. Due to the timing of the dodge having no stun after usage, and having low cooldown of 3 seconds in the air, and 1 second on the ground, makes it one of the most powerful game mechanics. It is complete iframes and is the reason why being passive is the most effective tactic available. The META right now, is to be passive, win neutral, and use heavy weapons, this is all due to the dodge mechanic. Heavy weapons such as hammer and axe and their massive hitboxes with their substantial damaging true combos, makes them the most powerful weapons to choose from. Reads are available but not needed, so this makes these weapons the most optimal choice in neutral. So you shouldn’t be mad at someone for winning due to playing towards the META, because you can choose to do so too. Playing neutral and being patient is the best and most optimal way to win a match. Since I’m a string-based player who doesn’t play heavy weapons, I do suffer against passive Teros players, but this is my choice, I can go ahead and play teros too if I wanted to, but I find it more fun to play weapons like scythe and spear.

Why I still play this game

I still play ranked and continuously play this game. Why? I find this game fun, and I think many other players do too. I learn from my gameplay and get better, finding more ways to play and having fun is what I like to do. I play ranked as a training ground, finding friends and having a good time. And also balance it out with 2v2s and spars with friends. Although many people don’t like this game, I do, and it’s my opinion. Not to mention, the developers are working on fixing the META right now, there are balance patches, and also the new dodge change in experimental, helping encourage players to play string-based weapons. Right now, this game is not in the best state it could be, but the future of the game is looking bright. This review can either help you not start to play this game, quit this game, or continue playing, all of which is your right to choose from. 

Thank you for reading this and I hope you gained some knowledge of this game, this is my first review, none of this is to be taken seriously. :)

Just to put this out there I have a small YT channel and want to build a community and some brawl content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLRcQlpeBDmLvfy1ltY00cA"
27576,yes
27577,it fun
27578,cool
27579,ITS ALL ABOUT THE NEUTRAL
27580,"Love this game, not gonna lie. Only bad thing is that if you're new it's FULL of old-timers who know this game better than the devs so just be careful who you fight. Would not reccomend ranked for new players"
27581,its alright

27588,it good
27589,yes /steam:happy
27590,"Whats smash bros when you got brawlhalla. I mean honestly, this game is 200x better than that mario fighting game! This is a real mans game and not no hissy boy game like smash bros! Who's with me!"
27591,its a rip off of smah
27592,"penis balls
"
27593,"Broken legends. 
Broken weapons. 
Doesn't even give two f*cks if its broken unless a pro player says it is, then they hurry and hurry to fix it to please the pro players that bring in the sweet sweet revenue. Normal players? Haaah! Just ""git gud"" scrub. We don't care what you think, you just play our game. Here, have an update that doesn't change anything mechanic/game-wise but some stupid cosmetics that only 1/4 of the player base will spend their money on. 

I would only recommend playing this with friends, otherwise you'll just rage on an almost daily basis. Don't even bother.


And another thing, the developers have no idea what the word ""balance"" and no idea how to try to balance the game because they made balancing it so complex that even the people who came up with the idea have no idea what they are doing. 

Like honestly, do not even consider downloading this game because its free. This is not one of the exceptions where a free game is good. It's just the same rotation of overpowered/meta legends you will see in Ranked, Casual and Experimental. So if you trying to find a reason on why you should kill yourself, then go ahead, but if not, just don't even think of the name ""Brawlhalla""

YEAH YEAH YEAH, I have 200 hours and I need to ""git gud"" but that doesn't mean that the game is funnily unbalanced. Only players who play the same OP/meta legends will say its not cuz they are winning all the time with those legends and OP weapons that BMG does not even give 10 f*cks about because why would you add such a broken weapon in the game, to then later have to nerf it after a tournament when 25% of the participants use it and the top 4 used legends with that weapon? 

Makes no fucking sense right? I hoped this helped you.


13/AUG/2022: All the things I said above still applies today and now that MultiVersus is out, they are rushing to get player feedback on what's wrong with their game. What a joke."

You aren't going to be good for the first 40 hours at least and don't be surprised if your peak is Gold because that's 70% of the player base.

27674,"Edit:  I no longer recommend this game as it has became very annoying over time. As someone who has over 375 hours of time, I say this truthfully with no rage. I haven't played for a while and am just coming back. I left because of the spamming but as I came back it has been worse. As a player with pretty good skill I can counter it pretty well, but it has gone out of control. People are so corrupted to win they don't even try learning anymore. With new emojis at the end of games spammers are very toxic. I am someone who normally can stay calm but this makes me very angry.

   So if you do get this game it is very fun with friends and is overall fun (Besides spamming). Please don't be that one person who spams and ruins the game.I will not return for a little while because of spamming. 

  My recommendation to BMG: Maybe add five second cool downs to signatures or certain cool downs depending on the signature. This would improve other player's experiences as well as my own."

27748,"From having a lot of hours on xbox and 300+ hours on pc. This is to be honest. It's just a absolute piece of shit of a thing (to a point where it doesn't even deserve game title to it.) The game development was good at first but then it's like bmg just gave a homeless man that is a drug addict 1mill. dollars and go crazy and make updates with this. I started to play this game a while ago and didn't really play it much on pc & the only thing that kept me on this game was my friends playing it. 

I'm honestly disappointed that someone thought that adding different weapons and changing the stuns / damage output would be a great idea. & that bmg and give out thousands of dollars to pro players but yet fix their fucking hitboxes. What's even better is when they brought ubisoft into this because they are literally known on their platform is when we bring a character to a game, WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE HIM / HER BROKEN SO NO-ONE CAN BEAT THEM. over 4 years of looking / playing this game, it has gone from something that you want to remember, to something that you just want to put in a trashcan and blow it up and then melt the entire thing to make sure that it's gone.

it's a waste of your mental compacity and a complete waste of everyone's time. to put things to a end, I'm happy that this game is going to meet it's doom soon. for exp. The battlepasses, they're making these for people to buy so they can get some money left of after this game dies. but in all seriousness. 

This game is ass, don't play it because it's a waste of time. Goodluck to others that play this thing.

27752,great fun with friends
27753,welcome to brawlhalla
27754,Just Btec super smash bros
27755,it is uhh fun!!! standardish smash style game (there's probably a name for the style but i don't play much of these types of games typically so i'm unsure of it) and lots of legends (characters) :)
27756,yes
27757,"Very addicting, wasn't very fun the first time I picked this game up."
27758,"Played it for a while, fun w some friends. But gosh darn the players are toxic"
27759,"A stark reminder that ""it's just a game"" really only applies when you lose."
27760,supu
27761,love this game
27762,"mordex. mid scythe legend, bad players. their shitsing

27763,play something else
27764,good for playing when you do workout (bicycling at home)
27765,If you want to break you're whole setup then play it.
27766,gud gam
27767,this is a game that is very attractive and once you start it you can leave it but not for long and is one of my fav games and even a potato(shit) pc can also run it and is free
27768,getting adictive sometimes
27769,"its quite engaging 
"
27770,"the connection is very bad. Ive played many games and ive never had any problems with my connection. But this.. the enemy keeps teleporting, sometimes its just so bad that the enemy keeps playing moves and theres no opening between missed attacks, its just as if they have infinite dext while your attacks are very slow. Sometimes, when you have to pick up weapons, you actually have picked it up but then the weapon turns back to the ground. Ffs its very bad"
27771,"one of the most toxic games i ever played, but very addicting"
27772,"goodgame

27776,Too GOOD
27777,On top of being free and multiplatform so a good game to just chill with friends it is a smash clone but it's arguably better than smash depending on your prefrences.
27778,:) yes
27779,"I used to be scared, BUT NOW I AM BRAWL, I wish there were more trinkets that ran across the ocean opening the path like moses, I saw the world as it was, but t'was fate the story of the monster and the prolific slayer. Down to its roots this game shows you your inner brawl master, I am now a Koji warrior and raid the skies with mordax! Saluts to you my friends in thailand and china, I wish you the best BRAW ON!"

27785,It can be uninstalled.
27786,"A very interesting game to play when there is time to kill! short and skill based!! That is all you would get! and i think this is what people demand these days :)
and whats more fun about this is that their servers are great! no lag or disconnects plus no cheater!!!"

One match I'm playing against someone who might as well just stand still, and the next I'm playing against someone who has what feels like a thousand freaking hours in the game.  I don't understand how you can physically make a matchmaking system this horrifically bad.  This is made even worse by both me and my opponent getting constant no regs with attacks that vary obviously hit."

27874,"GREAT game. 100% would suggest this as a way to learn platform fighters over smash (not that it isn't great for high level players as well). It is much simpler, easier to pick up, more intuitive, and not to mention cheaper. It also has actual functioning online play that doesn't both make you pay monthly and lag like hell. It can run on pretty much anything better than a chromebook. my only complaint is that if you want to play with more than 1 other friend, you can't que up for online play."

Posting new skins but cant fix hitboxes.
Cmon for real you can see that u hit a person and hear it as well but u didnt hit them on their screen .
How the fuck can it still have a player community and how can u not fix that .
I guess devs just like adding a colors and skins for kids and not fixing their own fricking game .
Good job nice game . :)"

27922,"Please, for the love of God and everything holy, fix the God forsaken netcode, it's shit.

Edit: also, the scythes ruin the experience completely.

Edit 2: the fact that they removed the public chat from matches also removes one of the few good things of the game, which was making friends with those few chill people you could meet.
This game just keeps becoming shittier by the update. Emojis could've been a nice addition by themselves without ruining something that has been there for years now."

27964,"not being keen to platform brawling games i figured i wouldn't like this game, but it seems those early assumptions were wrong and i have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing so far, from the two rotations of champions I've gotten to try they all have their advantages and weaknesses and all have a play-style one can enjoy. the match making can be hit or miss in casual, definitely have had the game were you've been hit with those that have played for months on end looking into the hit frames and what-not, but by the same coin you definitely can get game where you absolutely destroy the other players, but you will get those close game enough times where the matchmaking feels like its doing its job well."

27995,"Friends forced me to play this game and I hate that I always think I've wasted 3 hours of my life in BRAWLHALLA. But it's not 3 hours. It's 24 hours. I can't remember those hours. And it all adds up, as my eyes slowly begin to go from dry to tearful. I squirm in my chair, as it squeaks just like I do. Nothing makes sense. It was never 3 hours. My mouth slowly deforms into a weird hole that evicts demonic nasal howls at 2 second intervals. My father wakes up, knocks on my door and asks if I'm alright. I don't answer, I'm no longer in control and I don't want to be. The thoughts come back, slowly. I'd rather be known for playing LoL than for playing this game. I was just in denial. Deep down I knew that I played more than three hours. That I sometimes logged in to get the coins. And sometimes played. My father told me I have anger management issues and I proceeded to combo him out of the world. Life is hard without a dad. But such is life for anyone who enjoys this game."
27996,Absolute Hell
27997,"This game is the definition of a dog shit free 2 play but pay 2 win shit game, you don't have to be good at this game to win, all you have to do is pay for a shitty broken legend with an uncounterable combo where you can not even dodge and are stuck in a combo for 30 seconds and lose due to the developer's rat ass interests in improving this game. They are money hoarding donkeys with no love put into this game. I have only 20 hours on it and can say it's a waste of time and it's utter dog shit. For the people who haven't played it don't make the mistake of thinking this is a fair game where you have to work hard to get skilled and get better, you only have to pay to become better."
27998,I like this game a lot reminds me of smash bros
27999,dope game almost as cool as smash
28000,Its not asmash bros rip off. Its good.
28001,Smash but better
28002,Brawlhalla is a fun game that everyone should try at least once. It’s just not necessarily a game that everyone will want invest a lot of time or money on.

28006,"10/10 no word
"
28007,Brawlhalla is very fun its easy to run if you don't have a good computer also the game may seem pay to win but its only for cosmetics and crossovers which are cosmetics with extra care and most if not all legends can be bought as they're base skins there are many different weapons to choose from and to main also there is a battle pass which for free you can still get super cool stuff from and if you pay you can get much more than what you paid for anyways I urge you come and play this game and see if you like it :)

Also, game is full of fucking virgins that keep running away from the fight and just wait for the certain millisecond to attack because they're scared of going down 10 elo. Boo hoo. Shit game"
28051,"Hillbilly piece of crap asswater poopenfarten game is what this game is, it claims to be an esports ready ""competitive game"" however this is completely false and a lie by the ass-sniffing developers. Half of the playerbase are just simply spammers who will repeat the same move over and over, even worse is the fact that it works and is actually one of the best strategies at lower tier. Unless you of course want to perfect the skill of dodging and be precise to the frame with <200 ms reaction time. Props to the pigcrap eating developers for their ingeniousness, you have to perfect dodging and reach levels of esports pro in it to simply counter this strategy any obese loser can do. Even if you care enough about this dogcrap game to do this and you become an esports dodging ninja pro, some characters moves still cannot be dodged and are unpunishable due to the near instant recovery (hattori) so your 100 intense hours of dodging dojo training will still not work against spammers in some cases. Furthermore, this game has one of the absolute worst controls i have ever seen in my entire hardcore gaming career. Half the time that you attempt to do a neutral signature you will do a side signature accidentally, the controls are so shart that mastering them and being able to do a neutral signature all the time instead of an accidental side signature due to turd water controls is a part of the skill curve. No wonder this game is free. its absolutely diarrhea. I am writing this review to ask the developers to compensate me for the 66 hours that i have played this game and in which i have underwent what could only be defined as psychological torture at the very least. All in all, Crap game and absolutely not fun unless youre a sweaty loser and are willing to invest 500 hours into the game."

28091,"amber wolf ability is op, please don't fix it's my main"
28092,"The best game if you want a game that's like funne smash melee but is even more toxic

spamming is a requirement and gimping and skill is just optional




BUT THIS GAME IS AMAZING YET MAKES ME FURIOUS"
28093,Scythe = Win
28094,i like the game because its much better then other free world games and you updating the game much to. And Then we can do more jobs and stuff in Grand Theft Auto V
28095,It's pretty fun and its a chilled game and its a nice multiplayer as well
28096,"Brawlhalla is such a nice and fun game to play 
with friends its even more fun lol
i recommend playing this game when you're bored its really fun"
28097,Very fun and addicting! The better you get at it the more addicted you get.
28098,"Amaaizng game, right click spam"
28099,"just like super smash bros but harder. i played it for a while and was amazed at how a person can start getting good. always something new to do and players to face. and when you need some extra fun your friends can face off with you to.
i would recommend this to anyone who is just bored or wants a good easy battle with a friend

28102,"gartbage game, they pusrposely put you against players that are better than you in ranked. So you don't rank up. I've played against players that i have lost 5 times in a row too, but have never played against a player that i have beat. Trust me the people who make this game are the worst type of people in the world, it shows thourhgout the game. The 2v2's and 3v3's are so unfair that's its not even funny, you would get paired against 2 diamonds that are premaid while you get a random player thats silver. Trash game donest deserve a future"

Solid fighting system and has a lot of mode to offer for you and your friends. You can enjoy playing solo or with a teammate. Overall, it follows the Super Smash bro's concept with a 2D element. You must give it a try at least with a friend."

28189,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!! BEST GAME OF ALL TIME 1000/10 
CAN THE DEVS PLEASE SEND A PICTURE OF THEIR ASS TO ME"
28190,"Don't recommend playing the game. If you do and you play on a controller consider purchasing a backup. I've personally haven't needed a backup as I'm somewhat of an elite/alpha gamer. 

This game is tricky you like it, but you don't. A year ago I decided to quit the game. As you can see that didn't happen, I didn't break instantly and start playing the game again right after deciding to quit, it took me months. 

I've recently started picking the game up because I'm naturally good at it, but the game constantly bugs out. I've missed many hits because of the game bugging out It's becoming ridiculous. I've attempted to contact the developers many times to no result. 

I'm furious as I've been dropping out of my ranks rapidly because of the game being broken. I'm sure there are many players like me experiencing this unfortunate bug and it's embarrassing."
28191,Worse game than fortnite
28192,very fun and addicting a definite would recommend
28193,This shit so fucking ass like i cant get a single game wit someone on my skill level its just a ton of turbo combo user and no life tryhards. this my last time trying to play one of these free to play games cause its just a bunch of broke ass no lifes that cant afford smash or cant get a life

28220,this game is a fun action filled plat former you can collect different legends and get different podiums sidekicks and lots more. you battle people on a small island with many weapons and many different maps to choose from. i personally would recommend downloading this game as it is very fun and enjoyable in my opinion i would rate this game a 9/10. make sure to check this amazing game out.

28277,"This game has good potential but has huge problems with its mechanics. Dodging is practically useless unless you have lots of practice with a perfect timing that doesn't fit well with the extremely easy way to string attacks. In addition, the game will not reset jumps after contact with the ground on occasion. After several frustrating games with opponents simply spamming, I rage-quitted. I am not reinstalling until I see an update addressing these problems."

Unranked is full of sweats and ranked is full of the same 4 legends edge-guarding and spamming their same 2 broken moves that stun you for 4 hours and launch you across the map. Never play this game, just buy smash bros. Devs dont do shit. Delete this game if you have it and refund any of the shit money wasting in-app purchases that take your money for the ugliest skin in a shitty 2d Super Smash Bros knock off game on the steam store with sweaty spammers as the only player base. This game makes you unreasonably mad the first game you play. There is no enjoyment unless you become one of  them. And if you are one of them please uninstall and remove this game from your library because you do not deserve to play this.

28294,"Pretty fun, very quick and fast paced gameplay. This game is all in the mind, learning tech isnt a huge priority which makes it welcoming for new players, but the gameplay can become shallow if you rely on tech. Rather, memorizing the movement patterns of your foes and learning counters is the focus for competitive players, which can turn a lot of casual players away from the game. The game is very balanced and overcoming sig spam is a matter of learning to make better predictions. The game also relies on punishes and burst attacks which i think is fun and exhilarating. There are little to no bad matchups, if any they are minor, but certain weapons are less of a threat against certain playstyles, which is why i recommend playing every weapon to learn their ins and outs. To defeat the enemy, you must become the enemy. Put yourself in the enemies shoes so you can predict their actions.

Overall, i hate my parents 0/10"
28295,"boring, also alot of tryhards"
28296,i dont give a flying f*ck but this has been the worst game i have ever played in all of steam. this has to be the hands down the most braindead spam based i have ever played. there is no such thing as skill based match making in any competitive mode. i have developed a deep hatred of everyone including the developers whenever i decide to play for even just a second.

Fairly well balanced. Easy to pick up, but has opportunities for advanced movement and combos for veteran fighters.
New content fairly regularly, including battle pass, events, new maps and new legends. Battle Pass is always worth the money, and comes with plenty of challenging side-quests for times when just random queue isn't cutting it. Also has many fun play modes outside of just 1v1 and 2v2, with Free-For-All and Brawl of the Week. 

Great game! You should try it out, and support the devs if you dig it!"

28352,THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
28353,this game is very fun good yes
28354,"It's a free game, play it"
28355,"This game is a pile of garbage, its completely unbalanced with some legends and weapons being so broken that you win just by selecting them. Ranked in this game is so unbelievably stressful to play, and it will make any player just explode in rage after losing to a dumb game mechanic, lag, or a toxic sweaty player. Speaking of toxicity, Brawlhalla basically encourages it, there are so many taunts that are only in the game just to piss people off, such as the salty taunt, grave digger and the feared WOo-HoO (default taunt). Also for some reason, this 2D game, can lag like crazy. Even though it is not even a gb to install, it sometimes gets incredibly laggy causing players to walk off the map over and over until the opponent wins since you just killed yourself multiple times. There is so many problems with this game, and so many features that could be something, but the devs are more concerned with adding in the most useless and random things such as a GI joe crossover that no one asked for, random twitch rewards no one will use and dumb battle passes that have some really awful rewards (Season 5 colour scheme especially). BMG really needs to lift their game and actually make changes to a ton of things, including the ranked system, clans, rewards for acct and legend level 100 and so much more. The actual gameplay is fun however, and can be pretty great to play with friends, but if you spend more than a hundred hours playing this addictive mess, you will start to become much more aware of the problems brawlhalla has. I would suggest that you save your own soul, don't download this game but if you do, try not to get addicted..
Oh and also my most important point,

Just because Brawlhalla is bad and full of mentally challenged players doesn't mean i will stop playing it, at this point i'm cursed, im in an endless cycle of rage and enjoyment (mostly rage). No matter how annoying the game gets i always come back. There is much hope for this game but not the community, being honest im surprised most players figured out how to install this game with it being on a thing called a website and the title of the game being more than 3 letters long. This game isn't a game, its pain but yet its going places. 10/10, i would stop playing but its impossible."

28577,yes
28578,"This game fucking sucks. I play it a lot.

In all seriousness, it's a fun game to play casually and can get very competitive too. My biggest complaint is that all the characters feel rather similar to play as, but in turn, that makes it really easy to play as different characters without intensive labbing, and allows for a very balanced cast overall. Most of the game's faults are addressed really well by the devs in my opinion, especially seeing as it's a free game. If this game looks interesting to you I highly recommend giving it a try. And if you enjoy it, support the devs too :)"

28584,"Dogshit broken game and everyone on this game is a dick sucking shitter, stay far, far away from this game, and if you can, kill anyone you know who plays it by shooting them in the back of the head. Watch their head explode and bask in the pink, red bloody pulp of brain and skull that has been expelled onto the wall next to them. I repeat, do NOT play this game, I swear one day I will legitimately fucking kill a man over this godawful, dumpster fire of a game. Everyone on this game is either a 12 year old excrement stain who couldn't play this game properly to save his family, a sweaty 14-18 year old who has absolutely no life and has dedicated all his time to sweating in this shithole game, or a 30 year old miserable beer belly having piss drinker that's currently experiencing midlife crisis so he plays this game is is absolutely shit at it. You will never find anyone on this game who has a life considering they take this game so seriously, like it's life and death. If you play this game seriously, I will instantaneously lose all respect for you the second I find out. Once again, stay fucking EONS away from this game, it's a fucking cesspool of snotty 12 year old iPad kids or sweaty bastards who've never heard the word 'shower' in their life. TL;DR: Kill everyone you know who plays Brawlhalla in a serious manner. Thank you for your time."

28599,"Kind of a replica of the Super Smash games, different based on fighting capabilities. Lots of different characters and weapons that developers keep adding on a consistent basis. IMO, changed fighting games by implementing more of an aerial combat style. Most fighting games (such as Street Fighter or Tekken) focus on learning and redoing combos, while Brawlhalla focuses on more of a strategy-based combat. Anticipating player movements while dashing and dodging in mid air or on the ground. Uses the entire map as players can come from the brink of the border and back onto the platform. The game changes play styles from the different ELO ratings- best way to explain is if you play the game competitively. Great beginner's fighting game, even better if played competitively."

28617,"If i ever meet anyone in real life who helped make, or play this game, I'm going to remove their ability to procreate in the slowest way possible. A cheater-laden-lag-switch-spam-fest. Few are courteous (how are taunts polite or mannerly?). For this free game, i payed too much. i wish i could have that time back.... oh well.... here's for hoping i run into one of you.
Revision:
I REALLY hope i meet one of you toxic, waste of space, bags of excrement in person.
I'll be glad to show you what manners from a real man look like."
28618,"at first sight this game looked like it was created by some students who we're making a game for a project on school. but when i opened the game i instantly got addicted. it is a fun and entertaining game that is fun to play with friend. the mechanics are somewhat hard to learn. 
the only downside to this game is the fact that there are way to much spammers, but if you play this game long enough (wich i assure you, you will) you learn to ""punish"" these spammers.
i higly recomend this game BUT! you need to have a tough skin cause this game will make you rage!
have fun playing brawlhalla

28628,"Really like this game, but the new update just straight up broke it. I don't mean the meta or anything, I literally cannot play it because the anti cheat refuses to install itself. Considering I bought the collectors pack, yeah, I'm pretty pissed."
28629,Great game. Cosmetics are a little pricey but other than that its great. Perfect alternative to Smash Bros.
28630,fun
28631,"The only thing that makes sense, is that game companys have been (since the beginning of time) selling the source code/s to the blackmarket.
Selling you the game out the front door, and double dipping out the back door to the blackmarket and hackers/sellers of cheats. The world we live in...


Botters, cheater, hackers, stay far far away! If you have friends to play with sure! but you can't play a single match with a real person. 100% perfect dodges, lag switching or manipulation to to dodge and not take damage from attacks, players using macros and other BS to attack faster than is actually possible giving extra attacks of opportunity that are not possible for you or any human.

Just watch them throw bombs at themselves and or run off the edge like and idiot while they will combo you like living gods... but re re enough to throw bombs into their own faces and throw themselves over the edge for no reason.... ya I have cancer now, but its been multiplied by cancer.... so SUPER CANCER!

Also...

28806,"Its the first time I'm putting a review on steam. normally I don't care about making reviews but this time its personnal. Sorry if my writing is bad, english is not my first language. 
Brawlhalla, lets talk about the good things about the game right ? Its free, its easy to pick up and can run pretty smoothly on a potato PC. So if you want a game to play with friends that is free then I recommend to pick it up and enjoy it from time to time. The heroes ? Legends ? Champions ? Anyway the characters have pretty unique designs to time to time and are all quite different, there is quite a variety to play. I could continue singing praise to the game but im not loosing more time to do that. I will say in all my misery, spite and fucking hatred of this pile of pure garbage:

Brawlhalla sucks, here are some reasons.

The community is hot garbage, some of you will probably say that it is not the case but no, this game has a community that is uniquely bad and toxic. Maybe because a lot of you are old and bitter or young and dont know the tiniest meaning of respect. And no, Blue Mammoth is not helping and are worse to my eyes. If you see this review Blue Mammoth community manager know this, you are very bad at the job you are doing. Dont play this game for the community and assume everyone is a piece of shit because most of them are. And yeah im talking to you bunch of ruffians who should get another education to learn to at least be polite. To those who are the non-toxic part, don't let the rest drag you down but damn, you chose the wrong community to be kind to others, because most WON'T. 

Ah yes the gameplay, easy to pick up, hard to master, frustrating as hell because of the shitty hitboxes and lag. Yeah Shocking even if you have a good connection, if you get matched up with someone that lags, you are NOT going to enjoy yourself. Balance is thrash, some legends are really broken, Mordex is one of the exemples of this. The reason why ? 
Lingering hitboxes on signature move, really good signatures moves, gauntlet. (hope you love getting comboed to death)
I wont add the scythe because it take some skill to play but holy shit it such a frustrating weapon. And yes im taking a dump on all of you Mordex mains. (No i'm not telling you are a asshole to play the furry, but more like you are one of the numerous Metamancers that is rampant in video games)

I didn't play 600+ hours, I lost 600+ hours of very precious time of my life. So please, play the game casually if you want, it is actually fun. But dont go ahead and lose this time in ranked. Don't do the same mistake that I did. On that note, I wish everyone to stay safe, enjoy life as it is and be thankfull of the time you get to exist in this sad world. Try be good, always strive to be better, but not here, your precious efforts are too worthy to be put in a piece of hot trash. 

Take care."

28854,stupid game do kaka on it haha
28855,"(Updated at abt 1000 hours) So for starters, this game would absolutely be worth 5 stars and it has been historically if it wasn't for this game having the WORST connectivity I've ever seen recently. I've lose more games to lag than anything else at this point which has completely ruined an excellent game for me. I am certain this is on the opposite end as I have gotten both a new PC and upgraded WiFi since the connectivity issues began a few months ago.  I was willing to wait to see if they would improve over time but no such luck. This game's lag also has the strangest tendency to make you run off the stage when there's a connection problem, but only show you this after you've died which is quite strange. So unfortunately i'm going to have to quit playing one of my favorite games until BMG gets some better servers or something. It really does suck, I love brawlhalla but I can't play with these unbearable connections anymore."

Easy to pick up and get sucked into, however starting to dig in too deep will only bring frustration and stress to your life. Ranked is either about spamming or a diamond player started a new account because he got bored and cleans the floor with your face.
I regret paying any amount of money because I thought this game is fun. It is pain.
Sometimes we sit down with friends to troll around, its fun in that regard, just dont let yourself sucked into it."

28947,"This game is phenomenal at being nothing but utter garbage. I thought this game was about 1v1 fights. It is not. Your opponent whether it be experimental, ranked, or friendly, will never attack. The new ""meta"" is to run away and let your opponent strike first which makes the gameplay incredibly stale and slow. Everyone is too worried about winning rather than fighting for fun. New players are extremely discouraged from playing the game as the ranked system is full of smurfs. I suggest new players to find a different game. The Brawlhalla community is also the most toxic community I have ever seen. Worse than CSGO and COD combined."

You have many different characters you can choose, you have many different crossovers in the game, for example, the streetfighter crossover and the street brawl gamemode, (I absolutely love it), and the community isn't really that toxic for me. I also love how Brawlhalla hosts tournaments every now and then which is a pretty fun way to learn how to play and learn different mechanics and on top of that, you get viewership rewards for just staying in the stream. 10/10 game, my most played game."

cry when I saw the longing not to
What a shame because his eyes were lying
And I as always credible.
II:
There was another girl he liked
I thought my girlfriend
But later I understood who he was
And how much love he had.

Chorus: I
cried when I saw them together I
cried when I saw them holding hands I
cried when I saw them by chance
https://Versuri.ro/w/y5
And I didn't know I cried for their longing.

III:
But today I think I fell in love
I don't know what happened but it's true
It's not my brown
- eyed boy He has blue-blue ones.
IV:
I hope there is no other girl.
Let it happen again as before.
But I will always think of them.
Two brown eyes that only I loved."
28979,too many people who dont know what grass is (just editing to say after another 120+ hours of playing I still stand by this)
28980,"This game has a lot of bugs and error that need to be fixed, especially with a few signature moves. I believe that makes this game more frustrating than it should be and could result to losses that were not deserved. I've been playing this game for over 4 years, and so far, there hasn't been a point in its release where there weren't any hitbox bugs or inconsistent damage. This game is fun, but can be more frustrating than it should be a majority of the time."
28981,"Bu oyun bana hem muhteşem hem de sinirden çok garip şeyler yaptığım anlar yaşattı, sadece arkadaşlarınızla oynayın ama tartışma ve kavgalara yol açabilir.

 Gelişmek istiyorsanız (gerçekten gelişmekten bahsediyorum) sizlere benim yapabildiğim ve idrak edebilmeme rağmen yapamadığım bazı çok önemli tavsiyeleri vereyim: bu oyunda bir şeyi yapabildiğiniz en hızlı şekilde yapmak yerine en doğru zamanda yapın (mesela bir komboyu yaparken bir tuşun animasyonunu yaparken diğerine spam atmayın animasyonun bitmesini bekleyip basın diyorum read ile karıştırılmasın), ikinci ve verebileceğim en büyük tavsiye ise hareket, ne kadar iyi hareket ederseniz o kadar iyi oynarsınız, doğru düzgün hareket etmeyi  e spor maçları izleyerek, iyi oyuncuların guidelarını izleyerek veya oynaya oynaya deneye deneye geliştirebilirsiniz.

Size sanki kendim çok iyiymişim gibi tavsiyeler yazdım ama ben de bunları git gide geliştirmeye çalışan biriyim, sadece daha yenilere faydası olur diye yazmak istedim.

29052,"This aint it
It tries to sell itself as a version of smash bros
But every character feels almost identical and doesn't really have unique traits
Every character drops down as a melee and everyone has the same kicks/punches
Every character tries to grab a weapon, but the weapon you pick up is random
Its very repetitive and very simplistic 
It's way less fun than smash bros on the nintendo 64 tbh 
Camera movement is also pretty shit as it doesn't focus on your character, but rather the whole map
If you look at footage of smash bros, the camera kind of follows you
Not worth the time to get into or take seriously imo"

What I liked about the most is its a game that is easy for beginners to get into, once you find your the right legends for your gameplay style you should start to dominate."

29182,"This game will bring you nothing but pain and distaste. You will hate and harm yourself for losing against 12 yos that will call you trash bc they spammed you to death and you will hurt yourself and your keyboard bc you agree. Your self esteem will dissolve in the psychological hell that is this ranked queue. As you are probably thinking right now, I also thought I had the mental to ignore that. Spoiler: I didn't. This game is basically a non visible slow form of self harm. If you only play with your friends you might get away with it, but the matchmaking queues are just unavoidable self destruction. You have been warned.
They have cute skins though."

The game is awesome and very well made. 
The community is relatively welcoming and pretty funny.

29326,"i've been playing bawlhalla for about 5 years now and let me just say. this game is the worst game you'll ever play. not only is it toxic, but you can also have 5G wifi and live alone and still manage to lag in the middle of a ranked game and keep in mind it only happens on ranked games. any other game and you dont lag. so  when its your diamond game and you lose to a person you're about to 3 stock cause you lag off the map then it really wants to make you uninstall this game for good."
29327,"brawlhalla desperately needs competition. Without another free to play fighter directly competing for the same audience as brawlhalla, they have no incentive to make changes that will improve the game such as better netcode and mechanics that punish playing passive and reward playing aggressively (being the largest complaints i've heard from some prominent players in the community). If they're truly making an effort to make their game as enjoyable as it could be, it doesn't show. BMG have all facilities available to make important changes but choose not to; their game makes enough money as is.

in short, this game is shit and they're not changing it."

29339,"Brawlhalla is an amazing platform fighter for anyone willing to sit down and learn how to play. there are many different ways to play each character and all of the characters are unique in there own way. you should however keep in mind that at times this game can be frustrating, if you have had issues with broken keyboards or computer screens in the past then this game might not be for you"
29340,"this game is ass lmao many people wouldnt like it but if youre into last man standing, king of the hill and real competition then this is it for you. many possible hit combinations and many game modes, all of them entertaining and fun. best to play with friends. when u start its going to be more of a really hard game but you'll start getting used to it so u have nothing to worry about. if u wanna start, then u must be ready to be giving in a real lot of time and effort into getting good at this. and trust me, you wont regret it because its way more fun when u can do more stuff n combos in it. i recommend you check it out, for your sake. good luck!"

29479,"Easily the most dissapointing game I've ever played. Each character uses almost the exact same moveset, aside from heavy attacks. All characters get two weapons and have basic attacks without a weapon. There isn't much variety in combat. It's just generally a battle of who can spam the same move faster. 

Feels like a really cheap Smash Bros. clone that failed horribly. It does just about everything Smash Bros. does, except worse. There a very few items drops, the stages are pretty much the same just with different looks, there are a couple weapon types, and the list goes on. It seems like the developers going with the simple brawler completely ruined the game.

All of the good characters a either locked behind a paywall, or require heavy grinding with the absurdly garbage starting characters you get. There seems to be more of a focus on Micro Transactions than actual investment in the gameplay. 

What it all really boils down to is that this game is just a repetitve spam fest with weird and wonky moves that are hard to land and seem to have very misleading ranges."
29480,"good

29481,aa
29482,Figured I'd recommend this game since my kids have put 719 hours into it. I'm guessing they have no complaints!

29485,"A game that i play for 2 friends but i do like it in a mode bc i beat my friends everytime at it and it's fine. BTW i never played matchmaking bc it has everytime some stupid teamates or toxic players, noob players. (it should be a ranked part in that it could be only your rank)"
29486,Remove Raymond.
29487,"Terrible game, no diversity in moves tries to be a clone of smash and fails terribly. Every special move and weapon are basically re-skinned for other characters. And most attacks go through the opponent, terrible and boring."

29522,very good but sig spammers fucking suck
29523,"I love this game it's so fun. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good 2D fighting game. I personally prefer SSBU however the money commitment is ridiculous. I love playing SSBU with my friends however i cannot recommend they commit to SSBU because its on borrowed time however I always recommend people to play Brawlhalla because its fun, cross-platfrom and incredibly easy to pick up and enjoy. The learning curve is also a lot easier than other 2D fighting games. The frequent updates also keep the game alive and enjoyable. 11/10 would recommend."

29526,If You Cant Get Smash
29527,hi
29528,"My favorite game to hate.
Free competitive mode in a free game with peer-to-peer servers is the biggest mistake any game can make, and results in the entire lower half of the ranks being swamped with smurfs, people with internet so bad you can't hit them or dodge them, psychotic no-lifers who've spent thousands of hours in practice mode or simply all three at once.
If you want to play this game, do so in a closed group of friends who you're cool ruining relations with, same deal as Smash Bros but free"
29529,super recomended if you want an experience of a super smash bros or if you want a free game to play with friends doesnt matter the platform so good

29604,"Honestly, not that fun, but the short que times and match lengths means you can use it as filler for so much."

29613,liked
29614,good
29615,"The PC community, for brawlhalla, is usually non-toxic I can say fairly. Platinum 1 On playstation and you run into the toxic emoters who play passive or talk trash somewhat occasionally, it's rare even in ranked to come across toxicity. Some playstyles I don't agree with personally but it's not the game's fault, it's just something as a player you have to get around so I say give it a try. There are extremely friendly players sometimes who'll say gg wp to you, despite the outcome."
29616,this game is so good
29617,Great game for anyone looking to play a Smash bros like fighting game.

29626,its fun but its an ultimate rage simulator kind of game play 2 games and then smash your desk kind of game
29627,UwU

29663,game is very balanced
29664,"I'm disgruntled - Battle Pass 3 ended with ZERO warning in-game.  I was < 1 hour away from completing it.  I was cheated, time wasted.  I emailed Brawlhalla -  their response made it clear that they don't give a darn about the individual consumer and don't care about terrible practices (such as this).  Perhaps they announced the dates on social media.. I don't follow that stuff.  I don't recall seeing the end date when I bought the Battle Pass either.  In any case, they need a warning IN-GAME and they need to publish the dates IN-GAME so people will be clear how much time they have to complete it.  The right thing to do would be to either give me extra time to complete it OR give me the rest of the unlocks OR at the very least allow me to buy the rest of the unlocks with mammoth coins.  BOO ON YOU BMG / BRAWLHALLA.  I've spent over $200 in support of this game, not another penny from me!!!"
29665,i have this game on geforce now and when i wanna take a break from class and am done with work i often hook up my xbox one s controller and play for a bit and play on my ipad

29674,"I recommend this. The game is as challenging as your internet. I love to play with games and it has brought me inmeasurably good times and memories with them. Keep up the good work. It is not a Smash Bros copy, it is a reasonably good game."
29675,"fun but you get salty fast

29677,Very Good Game
29678,This game is very fun when you start. Especially with friends! I recommend this game to people that are bored and looking for something new. New updates come here and there over the years which is relatively good.
29679,"This game scratched an itch for Smash Bros initially but has turned into a game that I am still quite fond of. There are even a few things about it that i wish smash had. All in all, this is a good fighting game and can get pretty deep and artful if you get into it."
29680,A great fighting game.
29681,good
29682,Its good if you and your friends do have smash bros
29683,its a good fighting game to play with friends and other people! i love all the avatars and how they look! great game for anyone who enjoys combat and just battling friends. plus its free! what more could you ask?

29689,"It's alright, just to much paying, I don't play it very often and the most common complaint I get, is it being compared to smash bros, which I agree with it being too similar to the Nintendo game. I would not recommend this game."
29690,I haven't played the ranked matches much but I've enjoyed playing the game with friends.

29711,"Bad games with no balance and the developers don't even care with the game balance and stability. They only care about money making creating new skins. Been playing for a while, this game surely is a good way to destroy your mental health. Lot of people who only spam and make use of the lance weapon unbalance gameplay, not worth of your time."
29712,"Very nice game, i would of liked if the characters where bigger but it's a good game ovverall!"
29713,"The game would be perfect if spammers didn't exist. :D
Too bad they exist and that's why I'm uninstalling the game."
29714,"This game is like a circle, you can enter it, but you can't leave it. At this point it's just a life routine. The game is sometimes fun, but you spend most of the time raging, so if you play this, you have no free will anymore."
29715,good
29716,trash game bad animation pls delete lance

29729,this game sucks less but it is still awful
29730,"Haha, childhood shows & cameo weird stuff go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Fighting game that is just ""Kid:I want super smash bros, Mother: We have smash at home. Smash at home:""

Only nice thing is the synthwave selection screen, I simply can not get my mind around how people find this as a good fighting game. Its ledgit just crappy smash that uses cameos to make itself different from other games. But blah blah there are original characters blah blah, I don't give a shit they aren't interesting so are the cameos.

1saltyboi/10



Edit Note: Okay, I say all this I still stand by it, if you are looking into the game for the Cameos now that MultiVersus is out thats a far better choice."
29731,do not ever start playing this game. This is a game where it makes you rage insanely hard but then you get addicted and cant ever quit. I have uninstalled this game 7 times now. This game is hidden on my account. I also have this game ignored. But i keep redownloading it. Please do not do this to yourself. Go play some other games.

29780,"Smash Bros-ish game executed well, and really fun to play.
Never got into the game that deep, but that 19 hours of playtime didn't feel boring in any way.

Review Score:
8/10, I suck at this game"
29781,.
29782,"Brawlhalla is a platform fighting game where you play a selection of different unique fighters, you can play in free for all, ranked or even private lobbies. Each character has a range of different weapons and skins. 
Graphics- descent for the game
Soundtrack- descent music
Audience- All ages
Difficulty- difficulty depends on who you fight
Story- not really a story
Game time- however long you wanna play
Price- Its a free version of smash bros 
6/10"

29793,"I own smash bro's yes. But this is FREE, theres no pay to win in this game it's only cosmetics. Online play is great, playing with friends can keep you hooked on it for hours, combos to master, fun to learn new moves with new characters, regularly updated, and did i mention FREE? I haven't played recently but when I get back into it I know I'm not coming off for a good few days lol"
