0,"Pros: Immersive, fun, interactive. 
Cons: limited interaction with objects (would love to be able to explore around the map).. 
Also this guy who tries Fred's suit for the first time, it doesn't make sense that he keeps dying, it's so not real life.."
1,If u Love grappeling this is your game lots of it and kewl story worth a play
2,"It's a good game. Not my type but it is one of those games where and when developers actually tired [key word tho] to create something worthy and not to just spit out ""early axe-as-s"" to grab the money. Totally recommend especially for the price tag it holds during sales."
3,"A great 3D platforming game with a story that draws you in. The game overall is short, but the length is perfect. There are some sections of the game that are harder than others, and areas that take a little experimenting to figure out where to go. Even with these flaws I recommend giving the game a shot. On the plus side it works great on the steam deck!"

7,Character had a child. Child is not with maddie. 0/10.
8,"Fun gameplay. Abrupt story, would've liked a customized made maps for each player to play on."
9,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
10,sweet game i wish i finished it 2 hours faster so i could refund it :0
11,great game worth the 5 dollars definetly reccommend to anyone. the movement in it is just beautiful
12,"Great game, nice controll scheme and great story. Worth more than the price you will be paying"
13,relaxing
14,"good game 

thaTS IT VERY GOOD GAME."

17,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda
¬º tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ¬Ω tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¬º tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8‚Äì10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you‚Äôve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don‚Äôt leave them too long or they‚Äôll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"
18,This is a nice game with great movement mechanics which I have not encountered often playing other games. The story gave me a weirdly nostalgic feeling where I still do not really know where it came from.
19,"7/10
Got this game because I remembered 2016 YouTube channels would ALWAYS play this game... game a vibe doe"
20,Uncle's kinda Sus
21,Fun but short parcore game
22,Short game. Controls could be better imo. I preferred using my ps4 controller over keyboard. Overall art is good. Characters kinda look like ragdolls but it IS a story so I forgive it. I think it is worth playing but I do not intend on replaying it. Worth the time.
23,One of the few games I'd genuinely consider speedrunning. A short but ever sweet story with a gameplay loop that doesn't get old.
24,"i have an uncle too, he dosent fly, he- nevermind"
25,yes
26,"It's a fun little game that I got with a bundle long time ago. Over the years I have played it through on at least 3 or 4 different occasions. It is a very unique game. And it is quite challenging at some places. 

I don't know if I would want to pay more than $5 for it. But the game mechanics are a lot of fun. The story is not particularly deep. But it does make sense."
27,wish i had an uncle
28,leafy game
29,play this game.
30,"GOOD: Really fun platform game with a sweet enjoyable storyline. The gameplay is solid and enjoyable. Great for casual playing and as a chill game.

BAD: The lack of a ""restart level"" or ""skip cutscene"" option makes getting the achievements a massive pain in the arse! You need to go to the main menu and enter the level again and then sit through all the cutscenes you've seen a dozen times already."
31,"GG, but I haven't played it in forever because I got discouraged in the ice cave part because I suck at games XD

Will probably play again at some point tho"
32,"Awesome game. It has an amazing story and is told in such a good way. Its also fun to play, just swinging around and stuff very enjoyable."
33,Ice Cave made me say gamer words
34,"Great game, although very short."
35,A casual game with solid mechanics and beautiful aesthetic that would make you lose yourself playing for a couple of hours. It also has a speedrun mode if you're interested in getting the shortest time for a specific zone.
36,"such a rare gem <3 the mechanics of this game is nearly half the fun, it is just so fun to swing and jump through caves"
37,is nice
38,"This is a story about someone's uncle

now here is my story with this game

it was free and it took 4-5 hours of frustration and determination to beat it and i forgot this existed until now 

Good game ez do play it"
39,My Dreams Be Like
40,"As a bedtime story, a man tells his daughter about the time he went off to search for his uncle on one of his adventures. You play as the man's younger self, equipped with your inventor uncle's various contraptions to navigate the cavelike world he was last known to explore. The devices power up as you go along, to the point that by the end you can cross tremendous distances and soar over great chasms. 

The sensation is both tense and relaxing, like swimming in the air, or maybe a sci-fi twist of swinging on vines like Tarzan. The game feels like a very pleasant medley of other influences too: You've got the [i]Unreal[/i] engine world and physics, with puzzle mechanics and progression like [i]Portal[/i] (a theme with many of the games in my library), a [i]Myst[/i]-like soundtrack and ambience, in a world reminiscent of [i]Journey to the Center of the Earth[/i]. I think Steam recommended this one to me because of one or more of these influences, but I'm not sure.

I played this one because it's one of the shorter ones in my library, with an expected playtime of 3-9 hours. This playthrough took me about 5 hours. I had played once before several years ago, but didn't remember much about it, not even where I stopped. [spoiler](Think it was shortly after meeting Maddy.)[/spoiler] A friend got it because he saw me playing it and [i]he[/i] finished it, but I never got around to finishing it until now. Near the end, your character says of Fred ""If he could do this, I can""; similarly, my friend's winning the game gave me the extra ""It can be done!"" kick I needed to finish this one up.

The puzzles are not usually hard to figure out, but can be tricky to execute. Having a moving keyboard drawer can make them even more difficult. I did get stuck in a few places, but getting unstuck typically just meant hovering the cursor over things until it lit up. I technically didn't complete one puzzle: The game gave me a hint, and then when I failed many times and came close one time, it eventually (kindly) let me progress without fully solving it myself. The achievements tend to be either finishing a level without dying (er, falling, no lives in this game [i]per se[/i]) or doing it under a certain number of moves. If you're a very careful player, you might be able to get these in your first try. ([i]Narrator[/i]: Daniel was [b]not[/b] a careful player.) I would play this game again to try to master the levels enough to get the achievements.

There are also collectibles, which look like seismographs (saying so because the first one I saw I took for a regular prop) and which you can hone in on from their beeping noises. I only unlocked one Unlockable, which was a mode to change my beam color from blue to any custom color of my choice. And I think it happened because I collected X number of collectibles. There's a counter of how many you've collected so far in your Esc menu options. (I didn't see a similar counter for how many grapples you've used, so you may need to count those yourself -- or use as few as you can -- for the achievements.)

Pretty solid game, although I got caught in the geometry a few times. When I got caught, it was usually trying to figure out how to start a puzzle, rather than being in the middle of executing one. This happened in the ice cave level especially, where the geometry is very creative. Fortunately the game has a checkpoint system at fairly frequent intervals, with an option in the Esc menu to restart from the last one passed.

It packs in a lot of story for not being a long game, and does a very good job I felt with the story's closure. It's a nice, quick, fun yet challenging game!"
41,swing.cool
42,Very epic.
43,"First person platformers can be hit and miss but A Story About My Uncle was highly enjoyable for the most part. It had some annoying bits near the end but this was a minor nuisance. My issue near the end was that it became difficult to determine what chunks of ground and rock one could grapple to. I didn‚Äôt seem to have this issue before the ice caves level for whatever reason but it meant a lot more deaths than normal. The windmills earlier were also quite finicky. Overall I liked the grappling system as it made me try to plan out a route before taking the first jump. There are also a decent amount of augments you get such as extra grapples; rocket boots; super jumps; and cores that recharge your grapple mid flight. All of this makes you strategize when to use them so you don‚Äôt run out mid flight. The story was at times basic but had some promise. You are searching for your missing uncle and need to explore this strange world to find him. My only complaint was that you don‚Äôt learn more about the frog people and their history. For instance you get a companion who deciphers glyphs for you but they don‚Äôt stick around long and there are plenty of glyphs after that point that I would have liked to know what they meant. The voice acting was very good. There wasn‚Äôt much music in the game to judge. The graphics were decent overall. It was never a stunner but had some good art direction. The only bits that I thought looked weak, even for 2014, was the fire; hair and the frog people‚Äôs feet. There were also some awkward transitions in the game where it loaded the next section of the game but only had a blank black screen. These transitions only took a couple seconds on my SSD but the first couple made me think maybe the game had frozen. I think adding a ‚Äúloading‚Äù message would have been better. The ending seemed to be a bit flat and weak but I suggest waiting for after the credits when there is a post credits scene which ties things up nicer. 

	I played A Story About My Uncle on Linux. It never crashed and I didn‚Äôt notice any bugs. The game saves at checkpoints. Usually I don‚Äôt like this over manual saves  but these were spaced out well for the most part and weren‚Äôt a big problem. The game has a v-sync toggle; an FOV slider that goes from 60-120; three graphics settings; and three AA settings. I left V-Sync off as the game picked up my 144Hz refresh rate without it. Alt-Tab worked. The performance was very good. There were a couple bits where the frame rate dropped to 58 and 59 but these accounted for a total of about two minutes of my overall play time which was next to nothing. Typically the frame rate was above 80 FPS and was even over 100 FPS for a large chunk as well. I found that a keyboard and mouse worked great for this game which was impressive as platformers can be a mixed bag with them.

Game Engine: Unreal 3

	Overall I think A Story About My Uncle was a solid platformer. If you like games like Valley you should like this. The story and presentation were good and the game play was more fun then nuisance. It had some areas to improve but was still enjoyable. I finished this play through in three hours and six minutes. I think it is worth it‚Äôs current price tag of $16.79 CAD.

54,really pretty physics platformer with a mystery to uncover. the characters are charming and it looks very pretty. jumping around and grapple gloving your way through this world is a highly enjoyable experience.
55,"""A short but sweet game."" Truly beautiful if not for visuals but also in gameplay and story-telling. Hell the game starts out as a story being told. 

Cannot believe that when I first bought this I quit right around the corner of the ending of the game. Nearly 5 years later I come back to it."

59,"It's a short and sweet, charming game with excellent storytelling, movement, (although the boots kinda suck) and a phenomenal score. Though, since it can be completed in under an hour, and that price tag really isn't helping, I just refunded the game after beating it, since 119 minutes translates to under 2 hours. I so wish there was a ""meh"" catagory, because the game really has no replay value."

70,"OK platformer, the usual amount of frustration and skill involved.

Story is hit or miss - you might really dig it or you might not even realise it exists. And the story itself is very much open to interpretation."
71,"I just really like how the chemistry between maddie and the character flows. It really makes us question whether or not the girl that is asking the pappie is the daughter of yourself and maddie. Like did we get freaky in the sheets. Also why did fred abdon us :C.

Furthermore I trurly believe that the graphics for this game are stunning. Something you should about me is that i have severe panic attacks and lemmie tell you when i say the graphics are good i had to question what was real and what was fake. It put in a food coma for three weeks ( i am 350 pounds ( a normal weight btw)).

What really intruiged me was the thought that went into designing this game and the individual character development of all those frog people. Thats another thing i touch upon in this review, fred said he used that pad to send his trash off. So pray tell how were frogs born into humanoids. I'll tell you how, he came on the disposal pad and he pumped a frog full of his cream (with no mercy).

does fred smoke?
does fred hate me and b maddie?
will he ever return?
when will he be back?
will he deliver us from eviiilllll?!

72,a story about leafy
73,"A fantastic casual exploration game! 

A Story About My Uncle starts when your daughter asks for a bedtime story. And what better story than you yourself - as a  young boy - discovering a ''portal' to another world, where you track your uncle Fred's footsteps, in hopes of finding him.

Using various mechanic (such as grapple hook, power jump and rocket boots) powered by your uncle's ingenious costume, you are on a lifetime adventure, throughout a mysterious world, discovering only bits of clues of what this mysterious place is, and where your uncle might be.

Don't be fooled - this game is awesome, with intriguing story and really fun mechanics. However, this is very casual adventure platformer - not a story rich game."

97,"It's a nice short platformer.
The story is not really that interesting but the gameplay is fun. Not really hard and you get plenty of checkpoints so it doesn't get frustrating.
My main problem is the price however. For 15 Euros you only get about 2 hours of gameplay on your first playthrough and that time goes down drastically on your second time. I do not recommend this game at full price but if you see it on sale, it's definitely worth it"
98,"Great game. Don't mind the ugly characters, the landscapes are beautiful in game."
99,"This was a fun little physics platformer. I do wish I could have skipped the story parts since they slow the game play and I didn't particularly care what happened in them. I didn't bother exploring or trying to collect anything, as is plain by my lack of achievements to show from the game."
100,I felt like Spider-Man!
101,"Got the game for free, can't recon from where but free is free. 

Tbh game is not a ""normal"" one what you could expect. It's just a Journey with grappling hook but still gives some fun :) Takes around 2hrs to complete but needed like mid tier PC for it the time I was playing it so it was ""slower"". Is it worth buying? Well, depends. If you're able to quit 5 packs of Cheetos then yes ü§£ But not for the full price, take it while it's on sale cause it's a one time ride :) If you're fast enought you can even buy it, play, and get your money back tho xD Highly recommend playing despite its price, it's a nice game :)"

7.5/10"
107,the uncle did unspeakable things to me
108,"goodd
"
109,"Unique, breathtaking.
While I'm not a fan of 3D platforming, I loved this game. The story takes you on a journey. Yes it's short, it can be finished in 2 hours but took me closer to 5. But it is worth your time. Consider it a movie. One you'll fall in love with. Maybe not one you'll watch over and over again. But one you'll remember for sure. 

This was something I'd not seen before. It's worth having a look if you haven't yet."
110,good but too short
111,very nicee
112,"swingy swingy like the spider-man.

no but really, this game fucking slaps. super underrated."
113,its been a very long time since I have played it but i finished it without stopping and I liked it a lot.
114,It's a really good game
115,A nice 3d platformer with a grappling hook. What more could you want?
116,such a nice chill game
117,"One of my personal favorite games ever, Amazing story telling, superb graphics and quite literally some of the best mechanics I've seen in a while, I haven't played this game in years and I got a nostalgic feeling just playing it again."
118,pretty fun 3D platformer. Only buy when its on sale tho.
119,Cool  Game
120,"Pretty short game, I would wait for a sale to get it but I recommend getting it. Not much of a story but really great 3D platforming, satisfying progression. Some pretty cool gadgets with great design, the overall environment of the game is pretty.  Although the game is linear you can get through it in a few different ways, if you understand the game mechanics sometimes you can achieve shortcuts that are satisfying. Great for speed running."
121,Relaxing game with breath taking locations and a nice (even if simple) plot.
122,"If it wasn't for the cheats posted somewhere on the internet, I don't think I would have finished this game. Nothing makes sense in it."
123,a little fun game with a cool concept
124,"this game is truly amazing, the atmosphere alone makes it one of my favourites and yet the mechanics and story continue to improve the experience, this is one of the few games that i spend time re-playing over and over simply because ti was a blast. this review may say ""6 hours played"" but i assure you its hundreds well spent."
125,"I loved the story telling in this game. Having said that, the controls feel unpolished and can be quite frustrating at times. this game is worth it even with this inconvenience.

129,"This game is beautifully crafted with a gripping and sad story about your uncle.

130,Nice movement mechanics and not to long to get boring.
131,"Outstanding game to chill to, great ambiance, and overall theme."
132,"Amid all the hubbub about video games being art, or being the next great popular medium, or whatever; it's easy to forget that video games are actually very fun for children, and thus are (were) primarily designed for children. A Story About My Uncle falls perfectly in this zone, and is an excellent kids' game. If you're looking to buy this for a pre-teen, like a 7 to 10-year-old, definitely go for it: the magic of a different world and strange aliens is well-realized, the story is simple enough, the graphics won't be a problem, and the levels are just difficult enough for their age range.

Unfortunately, about 95% of the people reading this review are grown-ass adults trying to discern whether they should themselves play this kids' game, because apparently you can't outgrow childish things anymore (see also: the Star Wars fandom). So for your sake, I'm gonna give this game a negative recommendation, though it realistically doesn't deserve it."
133,"Absolute masterpiece, 10/10 story 10/10 atmosphere 10/10 graphics. Even played it two times, feels really good to play it in winter, late at night, with a cup of hot tea."
134,"What a fun little puzzle platformer!

It looks good, it sounds good and the gameplay is fun. The story is a little bit cutesy, but it's told well and doesn't detract from the experience at all. The platforming mechanics and puzzles are mostly very simple, and ample checkpoints make even tough spots a non-hassle.

My only real gripe is that it's VERY short; 2.5 hours for $15?  Eeehhh... (waffling hand gesture). Easily recommend if you see it on sale though!"
135,"It's a nice game, a short one too. I really liked the art style and colors, but felt some sections were dragging a bit too much although nothing too annoying. Something I found weird was the lack of music on most sections, could help the game feel  a bit more cozy. I'd recommend it if you like first person platformers."

141,"I don't know why I bought this, I'm terrible at parkour or anything in video games that requires really precise timing. I was so bad at this haha I hated it :')"
142,good chilling game
143,"--- GAMEPLAY ---
The platforming and movement in this game is excellent. Moving around the set paths feels very smooth when you get a good rhythm going. There is never really any major combat or enemies in the game besides for one major one so there was never really much of a challenge besides for a few more difficult areas to traverse and a few times where the environment was changed so I had to take a few times to attempt to get through one area.

--- STORY ---
The world building is good, from the start when you are first learning about your uncle while following in his path to find him to learning about the strays and their break off society. I was really engrossed in it as I played. The main narrator is great with most of the other voice acting being mostly good. Some of the bugs in the game did kind of make me do a reality check though as the npcs could be a bit janky

--- Worth The Price ---
At the time of review the price is: ¬£11.39
Worth the price? No, not at full price. The game only took me less than 3 hours to complete. On a heavy sale it is worth it.

--- SCORE ---
7 / 10

149,"I know that it looks like I haven't played this much, but that's not true. I've played and gotten 100% of everything in this game on a friend's account when I couldn't afford this game, and though I am ashamed to admit it, I pirated this game on a crappy old laptop that could barely run it. That all said, this is my favourite game of all time. I know it has bugs, I know it has a lot of low quality things in it. But something about this game makes me love it even more than any triple A game I've played, or any other indie game with a lot of heart and soul in it. I love this game, and now that I finally own it, I will never remove it from my computer. I love this game so much, and recommend it to anyone who thinks it looks even slightly interesting. 

TL;DR, I love this game, and you should buy it."
150,pesh
151,"Its a very short game about a kid finding his uncle, that's it really not to much else, the levels and I guess you could say platforming is probably my most favorite part of this game i loved each and every one of the levels if you like a short but kinda challenging experience, and or also a really beautiful looking environment, then i'm gonna have to say this is definitely the game for you."
152,"Fantastic Platforming Mechanics, Pretty short but that can be a good thing to some.  A lot of fun to play though, would love more some day!"
153,Idk how i got this game but it's hella cool
154,very short under 3hrs. But it's worth it. Fun game
155,The controls are very wonky.
156,"cool concept, but the game doesnt have nearly enough to do with it"

161,My uncle is an alcoholic
162,loved this game alot
163,"[h1] Amazing story without an uncle[/h1]

Easily one of the best platforming games. The platforming is super responsive and the story overall is interesting and sweet. Honestly when  you go for those long jumps it really gives you a special feeling like you're flying. I was blown away by it (especially at the windmill section lol). No other game has managed to recreate this feeling. Bosses are  unique and every room has it's own challenges.If you're a fan of platforming / parkour games then you really have to pick this one up. The game's length feels just about right - it isn't too short and it doesn't drag into infinity.

165,"Games good an all, fun gameplay with a story and does enough to support it but imagine if it had a level editor and a steam workshop"
166,It's a Good Game
167,"This is not about the game, this is a story about my uncle, he abused me when I was a boy kicking me and blaming me for things I did not do because, he's a bad mechanic."
168,"Game breaking Flaw: Not long after you get into The Chasm, you'll be confronted with three spires sticking down from the ceiling.  You are meant to swing from one to the next and land on a VERY tiny ledge leading to an opening in the wall.
This is impossible. 
After 1/2 hour, not matter what timings and patterns of movement used, you always land JUST short of the edge or you actually land, and hear the sound effects, and then fall to your death to start over.
Don't. Waste. Your Time."
169,very good i like the story 10/10
170,one of the best games ive ever played. come back to it fairly often. like a good movie. wish i could put 2 thumbs up
171,"This game feels like a bedtime story. Like, an actual bedtime story, in the good way.

The gameplay is quite satisfying once you pull it off, but it can get tricky at times. My biggest nitpick would be in the ice cavern, sometimes it's kind of hard to know where to go, and I don't mean in the ""try everywhere and explore"", but in the ""I'm stuck in this platform and I just jump into the unknown until something works"".
Wasn't a fan of that. I was a fan of everything else though.

All in all, a game worth playing."
172,Fajna platform√≥wka 3D.

174,"Acrophobia, the video game."
175,greple hook
176,good
177,"Finished the game in 3 hours. There are some hidden items that you can try to collect. Flying and jumping was fun. After a while, you get to do new stuff to keep you from getting bored with doing the same thing. The goal of the game is to go from point A to point B, and there are many different paths that you can take. There is no time pressure, so pretty chill. Nothing outrageously difficult. The controls can be better, but it is more than sufficient to complete the game.

Story is meh. Voice acting is meh. I want to say the game is too short, but honestly, I would quit anyways if the game is longer, so I am glad it is over, which is a terrible thing to say about a game. There are moments that the game try really hard to be sentimental, but they are really not emotional at all. 

Definitely not worth it at full price. Maybe $5 at most.

193,this is good game when i borrowed it
194,"This is a challenging First Person Platformer, mostly in the final act.  If you like to flex your platforming muscles, then this is a game for you.  Pick it up on sale."
195,"Cheerful little game, so many falls to death though... Every achievement in the game is real. Takes work and skill as it should.
Two problems: First big area (sanctuary) is smooth 60 FPS, bright and colorful. Second zone is dark, gloomy, and so much more laggier. Why?
Changing language from ""---"" (English) to ""English"" (still English) is basically no change yet a restart warning pops up. Why?"

200,I want this in VR
201,I got this game for free years ago. It's a fun little game. It's a novelty game cuz it's so short and easy to compete. I recommend getting it on sale.

206,"Weirdly feels like a prequel to Outer Wilds unless that's just me...

Great first person platforming that will make you try and try for faster times, good feeling of speed

Get it on sale when it's like 5 bucks"
207,My unclle was a special man
208,"I'm not really sure what others see in this game. I do like the feel of it....sort of. But the story is weak and you can hardly call this a puzzle game - which is how I found it. 

Just finding ways to get from point A to point B gets very tedious and quickly. I keep expecting something else to happen maybe some things to find, yes there are a few, but that is not the case. The graphics are a mix of dark and foreboding with some cartoonish junk thrown in.  The voices of the few characters you do encounter are bad....real bad.

If I had paid $4 for this game it would not be so bad. But after just finishing The Talos Principle and looking for something similar, this is a huge disappointment. If it is intended for kids then okay...I get it - but for me it's a big ole flop. Not sure if I can even get through it but I have invested some time so I will probably try and get to the end."
209,"every time I play this game I get chronic diarhea, please fix"
210,"The story is not really something  to care about and you are meant to follow the symbols to progress but mayeb they jsut forgot to add them in the last levels.

It is an ok game not good not bad"
211,Cool game i spent more time with uncle fred than my actual uncle
212,"Please, just make more like this.. Another good one similar is Downward. <3"
213,"A short game with a sweet story. It's fairly easy and relaxed, and although the movement system could do with a little more polish, I enjoyed the game."
214,Amazing Game! Amazing Team! It's the game that keeps on giving! This game has it all! A great game at a great price for all ages! Must recommend!
215,"Got because of leafy, did not enjoy"
216,"https://youtu.be/EtxIMBJxPzU

Starting from a strong core concept, the air control and camera are just enough off from the core to be fiddly enough to make large jumps fail."
217,"This game is a hell of a lot of fun. The faces and cutscene animations aren't great, especially these days, but the gameplay is top tier. You really feel like Spiderman swinging around the levels, if Spiderman used tractor beams instead of webs, and the story is sweet, if simple. Sometimes the difficulty fluctuates in weird ways, and I occasionally got frustrated trying to figure out how to progress, especially in the Ice Caves, but that was rare. Just remember how much you can change the trajectory of your jumps in midair with the arrow keys. Absolutely worth a look, and despite the graphics not being the best some areas are legitimately beautiful, particularly Star Haven."

240,"[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a first-person platformer with narrative elements. While a pretty game to look at with some rare moments of heart, this game struggles to satisfy as a platformer or a walking simulator. Lacking an emotional core to motivate player investment or a stable platforming system that doesn't result in constant false starts, this game can only be recommended as a curiosity to those interested in how an action-driven walking sim would play. Otherwise, stick to games that excel at either of those genres individually.

You play as a nameless nephew, reliving the story of his wondrous adventure in search of his uncle Fred. In searching for Fred, you must follow in the man's footsteps - across vast swaths of open air, chasms littered with floating rocks that are only navigable thanks to Fred's inventions. Largely through the use of a grappling beam, make your way through a half-dozen terrains as you meet different peoples, discover ancient remnants, and try to piece together what happened to uncle Fred.

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] tries to merge two typically separate genres: platformers and walking simulators. This game's gameplay largely consists of platforming, while it borrows the exploratory/narrative elements, short length, and the general structure of walking sims. Unfortunately, this game delivers underwhelming experiences on both fronts and thus leaves fans of either genre feeling disappointed. On the walking sim side, the game's story is bare-bones and lacking in emotional depth. Too many opportunities to offer immersion or character to the world are neglected, and what is shown feels one dimensional. Uncle Fred is too distant and enigmatic a character to develop strong feelings over, and there are simply no other characters worth mentioning - not even the one other named character. The epilogue is about the only time the game gets close to pulling a heartstring, though even the execution of that leaves players with more questions than answers.

In terms of the platforming, [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] delivers choppy and unpredictable gameplay. Grappling across sheer expanses should offer a thrilling breath of fresh air to players, but the experience more often verges on a strain as players must contend with the game's minimal UI and midair aiming akin to drunk Tarzan swinging on vines. The first major fault is the lack of notice for whether a player would be in range to grapple with an object in the distance; depth perception is shoddy in this game, leading to a ton of false start deaths. Momentum control is another, as plenty of barely-visible/moving areas prevent the player from accurately gauging whether they will hit the surface they're grappling towards, causing mid-flight death. Midair aiming can also be needlessly complicated by the lack of full 360-degree aiming, forcing players to sometimes lose bearings in low-light zones and thus get stuck trying to maneuver to latch onto a ceiling target while falling. The memorable pitfalls of this game's platforming outweigh its moments of wonder and exuberant traversal, that's for sure.

The game has relatively few strengths to compensate for its weaknesses. The environment design is one highlight: glowing blues and warm oranges color a luscious world, which though repetitive can help please the eyes over the course of the playtime. The soundtrack is not very memorable, though it too pads over areas with sufficient replayability. There are some bits of narrative dialogue offered via mementos scattered about the world that occasionally convey some charm. In terms of replay value, secrets scattered about the levels tied to unlocking new gameplay features could incentivize players who can tolerate the platforming to return.

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a cautionary tale about the experimental mixing of game genres. This game at its core seems to want to deliver the walking sim experience of an emotional journey about family and loss, but decided to dedicate most time and energy to implementing first-person platformer gameplay, largely botched that, and left the narrative elements underdeveloped as a result. Ultimately, while this game could still be appealing to genre die-hards and might even be worth a tepid recommendation at a sale price, there are simply better platformers and walking sims to spend your time with. [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] gets a C."
241,the story is bad and boring
242,nice
243,"Got it a few years back when it was free on the store.

Fun and simple linear platformer where you use your all sorts of gadgets to get to your destination.
The story is interesting and the graphics are looking good for the most part.
The soundtrack is nice.
I didn't bother doing the achievements, because by the looks of it, they seem to mostly be speedrunning-based.

Took me about 3h to finish the game, since I wanted to enjoy it and see as much as possible out of the game.
If you're playing to speedrun in, as many YouTubers does, it'll take about 15-20 minutes (if you're mad good).

Plus and minuses;
+ Great story.
- Kind of overpriced for being such a short game.
+ Cool experience.
- Decent graphics, could've been better, especially if you have a great GPU (I have a 3060TI & a 165 hz monitor).

10/10 - worth to buy if you've got some spare money!"
260,Repetitive.
261,his uncle slaps godayum
262,Spider-Man goes on a journey to find uncle Ben.
263,IT'S A GOOD GAME
264,Pass. The story is lacklustre and the mindless jumping doesn't help
265,This Weeks Apprentice In A Nutshell!
266,"More of a ""meh"" than a thumbs down. Very low playtime (~2-3 hours) for the full price (but worth it for $1 from Humble Bundle like I got).

Feels more like a tech demo.

Voice acting is amateur, story is ho-hum and gets in the way. Also has a really off color part where the character is asked if they romantically liked a teenage frog creature, um...okay weird.

The core mechanics are interesting and I wish they had been explored more instead: traversing terrain with a jump, 3 charges of a grapple hook, and rocket boots. Instead the levels are linear, and most require a certain order to be able to get to the next platform/location. And they all have a hint of what to grapple so there is very minimal exploration or deviation from the ""approved"" path. Nice scenery in a couple levels, others are forgettable caves, and there's really only 5 maps total.

Basically I'd like this game more if I was a merchant/explorer/pirate/something traversing and doing things in an expanded, somewhat open world version of the Star Haven map. Alternatively I'll just play the Scout in Deep Rock Galactic, where most of my grappling hook skills came from haha."
267,"Playing this game was incredibly freeing, it felt great to be swinging over open skies, your only mode of transport being the exo suit your uncle made for you. Traversing the beautiful scenery, there was nary a frown on my face, each turn bringing a sight more exciting than the last."

269,"I had the good fortune of playing this when I was younger. To say the least, I was mesmerised by its fairy-tale story and beautiful environments. Replaying it now, I appreciate the environments even more, as well as the movement mechanics. The range of the grapple device takes some time to get used to, but otherwise, I'd say this is a really solid first-person platformer and well worth your time. My only gripe is the ending that kind of falls flat, as well as the lack of much character development for any of the NPCs."
270,"great beautiful game, great story and awesome atmosphere and mechanics."
271,This is one of the games ever made

276,Beautiful
277,"2.5 hours for $14...
Okay well, lets begin with something. A Story about My Uncle is a story where you hunt down your uncle through some strange fantasy sky-realm populated by frog-people. You do meet some frog-girl but damn if I cant remember her name, in fact all of the characters you meet, I cant remember. They seem to be really cookie-cutter and really poorly acted. The animations are really dodgy at best, as it seems like around the second act of the story, the characters started lacking a lot of detail in their animations, only using key frames.
I finished this game in two hours, and apparently it can be finished even faster than that. Thing is, I was kinda hoping there was more and was sorely disappointed that there wasn't. 
Onto Character Arcs... There are none. The for girl decides to tag along with you for a noble reason ""finding your uncle"" but then in the next chapter decides to stay behind in the skylands because she didn't really want to find your uncle, she just wanted to escape. The story is written to think that this is a big decision, but the fact is that an hour of knowing her is not enough for me to get invested in her, and as such I really didn't care if she stayed or left. At least there's a time-trial mode, if you're into that.
I also found that sometimes the platforming didn't work quite as it should. There were several times where I'd click on the crystals several times, and I'd never shoot them with my gauntlet beam which caused me to fall.
4/10: A good game if you're just looking for platforming that seldom works, but please for all that is holy do not buy this for the full price."
278,"The story is short and predictable. However, the game looks beautiful and the gameplay is very fun."
279,p
280,In my opinion a must play for anyone into just chill indie games. It was absolutely incredible and the ending nearly got me tearing up.
281,"fun gameplay, not sure what the story is"
282,commentary youtuber
283,"It was an adventure for sure, i completed the game in one sit but it felt like i knew the game. Very nice end and it was pretty sad."
284,this game is awesome! really cool mechanics and some really fun glitches!
285,"The story to this game is kinda cute, but the main plus to this game is the actual game play. Swinging around like I'm Spider-Man, powering up with crystals, its all so addictingly fun. It can get a wee bit frustrating at times, but what kinda game like this doesn't? I'm sure there is some people who have already mastered it, but I'm just here having fun feeling the chilling wind on my face as I fly through the sky. :)"
286,"I'm not sure how this game ended up in my library.

As a 2014 game, it reeks nostalgia of that time. Both visual and gameplay-wise.

It's a peaceful game, but it can be challenging when it wants to."
287,nice casual relaxing game
288,"Story was rather short and sweet, characters were cute, some levels gave me a headache from time to time, but one thing that I loved to bits was the visuals. Most of the scenes in the game are screenshot-worthy and and are so beautiful that you might forget that you need to go somewhere, so if you're into fantasy environments, then you're going to enjoy this one. Take your time, enjoy the gameplay and have fun!"
289,verycool.
290,"Expected a good story game but there's really nothing of that sort, just a hollow boring plot. There's a ton of quality improvements that could be made to the game, the biggest being adding a waypoint marker so that I know where to go next especially in places where there are a ton of floating rocks all around you. I did encounter a couple of bugs too and the so called strays and ""frog people"" are hideous and feels like they were added just for the sake of it without really putting thought into it. The narration could've been better too as some lines failed to portray emotions rather than just reading from a script. Also, what are those random telegraphs hidden around the area?

All in all, the game failed to immerse me because of it's issues and shallow plot and I can't really recommend this at this time"
291,"Short, chill, satisfying to move around, great sense of scale, voice acting could be better.
As many other Unreal Engine 3 titles, go disable framerate smoothing and it'll unlock from 62fps and run very well."
292,"There is charm and there is whimsy. There is wholesomeness and there is genuine emotion. However, those things cannot make up for the rough parts the hold this video game back. This video game claims you can grapple from almost anywhere and that is simply not true. Specially towards the end of the video game the places in which you can grapple are few and far between. I understand this is intended but then it shouldn't be stated that the player can grapple almost anywhere. Not to mention the darker portions make it near impossible to see where you're going while trying to figure out ""on the fly"" where you can grapple, let alone see the points you CAN grapple from.
The controls while simple have nuances that are not explained which leads to frustrating bouts of trial and error. There is pleasant music throughout which keeps the player calm during the frustrating portions.
The characters and backgrounds are rough. It is obvious this was done independently however some things are just poorly done. The voice acting while well done, is brought low by poor animations and jagged edges. Denny Crane."
293,"No, too twitchy. It's frequently not obvious which steps to take to get to the next platform and the timing and aim have to be just right to make it work, so you never really know if the effort you are making is even going in the right direction. Lots of experimentation with lots of failure and no real sense of accomplishment. Not fun for me."
294,leafyisgone
295,Great story! Great game play! Highly replayable!
296,So simple in every way yet so profound
297,it good
298,yes

301,"A simple request for a bedtime story from your daughter has you remembering Uncle Fred; a man who has long since vanished on a spontaneous adventure with no one knowing exactly where he wandered off to ‚Äì except for you. Retell a magical adventure full of mysteries and intrigue, of strange creatures, enchanting caverns, dangerous beasts, and otherworldly places; the story about your uncle.  


[b]Warning: this game can give you motion sickness; this issue is resolved by going into options and removing motion blurring and/or speed lines.[/b]

Before you buy, I‚Äôm going to note here that I only recommend it depending on why you want to play A Story About My Uncle. If you want to play for the story, or you like speed runs and optional timed challenges, then yes, you‚Äôll probably like this! If you‚Äôre playing with the intention of getting 100%, I doubt you will. A handful of achievements are actually kind of difficult to get, beating the game will take about 3+ hours, but 100%‚Äôing it? 10+. One is getting a gold medal on all timed challenges and the time constraints are‚Ä¶ not going to be giving you much room for mistakes.
With that out of the way, the story is pretty good, the gameplay itself is really fun, you fly around 5 areas with a grappling hook and the speeds you can hit are exhilarating. Some of the paths you need to take aren‚Äôt obvious and there is a bit of room for exploration, but all stages are linear. There are a bunch of collectables and story objects to interact with to enhance the world building, but the game ending is a bit disappointing. While I don‚Äôt fully recommend A Story About My Uncle, I definitely don‚Äôt hate it enough to give a negative review.  

TL;DR: 3-10+ hrs, good story, fun gameplay, exhilarating speeds. Optional timed speedrun challenges and plenty of story collectables. Hard to 100%; ending falls a bit flat, play it if you want."
302,Charming and quick. A great way to spend a few hours if you're looking for something relaxing.
303,really good game
304,its fine
305,EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
306,it is a challenge
307,good game if u want to relax u might smoke some ZaZa before u play for a better experience
308,"If you plan on playing this game be mentally prepared for a tough, intense and unforgiving platformer.

[u]PROS[/u]
 - This game was developed by a tiny team and they've managed to create an impressive and unique first-person platformer
- The platforming is challenging and creative
- The story is simple but touching

[u]CONS[/u]
- The platforming (which consists of 100% of the game as there is no combat) starts off easy but ramps up with each chapter, culminating in a difficult to very difficult (depending on player skill) final stage in the ice caverns that might have many players throwing in the towel out of sheer frustration & anger. I managed to complete the game but by the 2nd-to-last and final chapter I was cursing out the developers, raging and considered quitting once or twice.

-Now I'm no stranger to tough platformers; I've played and completed Ghost Runner which is touted as one of the hardest platformer games ever but the difficulty there felt fair. However, in this game the lock-on system for the grapple felt way too specific/finicky and there were many, many times when I felt like I should have been able to grapple onto a floating rock/etc only to plummet to my death, yet again."
309,"my uncle is slightly a dingus

just don't go in expecting portal"
310,"Fun core gameplay of jumping, grappling, boosting and zooming along islands in the sky; probably springing from someone asking ""is a supercharged grappling hook enough to base a game on?"" and based a game on it.

Earlygame with expanding toolkit, and midgame with expanded challenges keep a great sense of flow and difficulty making leaping through the sky a smooth and entertaining experience as you quickly get into the rythm of slingshotting yourself at high speeds through the rocky platforms making up the course.
Sadly, the last level of the game is fairly tedious, with an early unfun surprise challenge, and later some ""unmarked"" unusable platforming while the previous ""leaps of fate"" stops really conveying where to go, hampering the flow which made the early game great.

Cozy characters, well one, made the journey enjoyable even if it halts completely in the final chapter.

Recommended for a fun novel platforming experience."

Overview:
a 3D Platformer with a grapple tool to find the right timing and momentum in jumps and landing points.
combined with low quality visuals and rather ""no story"" player ends up exploring an unknown ""empty"" world to find his uncle...
I`d rather find 30 minutes walking in the park more entertaining the 3 hours in this...

329,"The main feature of the game - movement - isn't fun, at least for me. Sometimes it's plain boring - jump here, grapple there. Sometimes it becomes a movement puzzle, solved by trial and error. Sometimes the section can be brute-forced using obviously unintended methods or landing where you are not supposed to land.

Plot doesn't makes sense. Characters are basic. The environments are pretty, though."
330,great game
331,The game is ok but the physics are shit. There is almost no room for error. It's almost like there is only one way to get where you need to get and if you get the timing of it wrong even a little bit then it's not gonna happen. I've been playing for five hours at this time and i'm about halfway through even though the game should only take about 3 hours to beat
332,"It's meh.
I think I got it for free a while back. I wouldn't pay for it.
It's pretty short, which means the story doesn't really take off. Voice acting is bad. Level design is bad - either too easy with save points every step of the way or suddenly none for a whole section. Puzzles are more in the direction of ""guess what you have to click on now to continue. Could it be this big thing right in the middle of the room?""
I really don't like the mechanics. At all. You fling yourself around in order to reach the next platform. God forbid you touch anything or you're dead. Also there's three different kinds of jumping - normal (space), high (right mouse), and far (right mouse + sprint). Why? No idea - you stop using normal jump straight away. Why do you need to charge the other two? Also no idea. There's no reason.
Then I struggled with depth perception a lot. Can I reach this island with a far jump? Oh shit, jumped all the way over it. Can I reach this other one with a high jump? Ah nope, wayyy farther than I though.

The ambiance is really nice, though.

All in all you're being dropped into a strange world that you get no explanation about where gravity seems to selectively only affect you, you jump around a bit, find the uncle you were looking for, say hi, and leave. No consequence. Might as well not have.
Oh, and also, you're apparently the only character without a name??"
333,"One of the best experiences I ever had. I remember when I was a small kid and I was playing this game. I couldn't understand where I should go!

355,"Interesting story, good platforming. I enjoyed it and recommend it.
Completion difficulty: 7/10"
356,"Consider this a niche recommendation for a sale more than anything strong. It's far from a must-play experience, but ultimately I found that I enjoyed it.

""A Story About My Uncle"" is a first person platforming game with a focus on a ""grappling hook"". It's a slow moving game that makes it relatively easy to get from point A to B. Even the hook isn't about smooth swinging and acrobatics... but functions as a hook shot that brings you straight forward. It works, but it feels more about being easy to handle rather than satisfying acrobatics. 

It's obviously intended as a chill experience with very little in the way of punishment, speed, precision or dangers. I jumped from A to B and talked to people about stuff. But this relaxation is both a blessing and a curse and it leaves me a bit confused on how I feel.

The thing is.. the last level wasn't chill. There was dangerous levels of butt clench as I was forced to string together jet boots, falling stalactites, ice walls and precise landings. I hated it for the stress levels, but it was also the first time that I was having fun. 

More fun events, unique challenges, and satisfying platforming occur in the last 25% of the game than in everything so far. It wasn't that they built up to it... but that they introduced the mechanics far too late and end up shoving half a games worth of progression into one awesome stage. 

But even at it's best, the level design had MAJOR problems guiding the player forward. Probably more than a dozen times in 3 hours of play I needed to stop and struggle to find where to go next. The levels are 3 dimensional with lots of vertical space, and are made up of random asteroids and floating islands that lack defining features. Half a dozen times I ended up making what looked like the only possible jump... only to realize that I'd returned to the start of a stage. 

The terrible guidance wasn't unforgivable because there's little punishment for mistakes, but it was a constant annoyance that started in the first stage and only ended with the game itself. Had there been an objective market, I'd probably have finished the game in an hour and half, but it would have been a better paced.

The game definitely ended on a high note and it's probably why I'm thumbs upping this. This could have been an absolutely amazing game had they unlocked skills earlier and introduced the challenges gradually... but as is.... its just a decent way to spend a few hours."

‚òê Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished"
360,Good game with a good story line. Perfect if you looking for a game to play mindlessly
361,pretty. but not much else.
362,this game is really great the sound track is the best thing and for a game being 7 almost 8 years old its still a very good game it can be hard at sometimes but its still fun but for what you really get i would say its worth it but i would also recomend waiting for a sale
363,fun
364,its aite
365,cool
366,Chill game.
367,I've waited for the part that he touches us in bathroom but I guess they will add it with a DLC.
368,"Let me start off with the most central point of this story, the platforming. It's smooth and logical, speed is relative to the object you are on, the physics engine is consistent, you will always get the same result when you get the same situation. Next is the story telling, it's paced out, you will never have to much put before you at once and with no timer, you get the enjoy the story at your own pace. The are is stellar, with the color blending the molding of objects, the change in tone of a place."
369,good
370,Chill out like a spider-man.
371,"Playing the game makes you feel great, like a semirealistic spiderman. Story I was initially scared would make me cringe but is good enough that I didn't need to even once. However, it has one of the worst flaws in all games, as it is way too short."
372,6/10
373,"Very short and relaxing Game.
The normal story can be played in just a few hours but i also found it fun going back trying to complete all achievements and finding all the collectibles.
For the price i definetely find it recommendable (Often on sale as well)"
374,I forgot how I got this game for free.
375,"Pretty short game, good time killer. 
If the game is on sale i'd definitely pick it up."
376,"A small but good game.
Interesting mechanics to say the least 
Nice voice acting - With an enjoyable story"
377,it cool
378,"Remember Maddie.
May each of you find somewhere to belong."
379,this game is based on my ungle
380,Nice n chill game
381,It has weird frog blue people but i really like mechanic of hook thing and go fly around with it
382,"A game that after finishing, I felt compelled to go spend more time with my uncle, that is a compelling urge I have never been made to feel by a video game before. 
Truly a platformer that couldn't have come out in any other year than 2014, and out of many of the games of 2014, this one is the best as far as I'm concerned, besides Skylanders: Trap Team of course!"
383,the original developer who made this game before he sold the rights was from my town we buried him today he was only 23 this is all i have of him left he was my dear friend and brother thanks for finishing the game fully.
384,It's beautiful.
385,"[h1]Not Bad, Relaxing Game[/h1]
Like the story of this game, not bad, [spoiler]but the achievement is kinda hard for me, I dont like the achievement lol maybe I'm just noob haha[/spoiler]. Not bad, overall."
386,I can't explain how. But this game just has... immaculate vibes my guy
387,"Truly one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Incredible narrative told through extremely entertaining gameplay. Its a short one, but an absolute must play!"
388,god
389,at the very end of this game i was in tears I practicallly criewd  AUNT MAY DIED IN SPIDERMAN NO Way homEW
390,"Definitely a B or C tier game, but fun for a few hours. Definitely buy it on sale."
391,Great game with cool grapple and platforming mechanics as well as a memorable story.
392,it was alright
393,Very peaceful fps parkour platformer. Flying through the air with the wind sounds really feels calming.
394,„Ö§
395,At least he didn't swordfight with his uncle
396,"it cool
"
397,Great and Fun Game ! Relaxing and visually pleasing :D
398,fo da
399,"A story about my uncle is an incredible game that leaves you wishing for more with a bittersweet ending. I wish for another game but I know this is a one shot. The gameplay is fun, the characters (although maddie is terrifying) are loveable. I dont remember the last time I had such a good, calm relaxing time in a video game."
400,"The story, in my opinion, is definitely woth listening to and the gameplay is also quite easy. The challenges, of course, are more difficult but still fun to try out. I can only reccomend this game. Sadly, it is quite short. Have fun :)"
401,"Astonishing graphics, pretty cool arcade gameplay, good story.
Definitely worth it's price."
402,Cool
403,Leafyishere gave me too many memories with this one.......
404,Was actually really fun and got invested- up until the very last area where it was just extremely tedious. Would recommend!
405,"I remember seeing this game on a background of a story time a few years back and forgot it until now. The game was honestly great. I went into it expecting just a parkour game, but it was so much more than that. The story was truly something else. For some reason it felt so gripping. The game-play was also fun as hell. Most of the time you feel like spider-man, swinging and jumping around. Truly a great game."
406,i got this game somehow for free bet it was really good when it came out but i just dont feel it aged well if ur want to go for a challenge try to do all the achievements
407,"Fun platforming game. Nice mechanics. Short game though, I finished the story in 110 mins. Not much reason to replay unless you want to speedrun or find all of the secrets."
408,"personally the game was fun but way too short, I beat the game in 4.5 hours. and If i were you, i wouldnt pay 15 bucks for a game you will complete in 4.5 hours, luckily the game was on sale for 3 bucks when i got it. the time trial mode isnt bad, and its great for commentary"
409,"Hm... I'd say this one is about 60/40. One of the puzzles got me stuck for a stupidly long amount of time. The voice acting isn't great, and the characters aren't very charming.

But fun go vroooom"
410,"Fun mechanics.
Story: 6/10"
411,"Short, good, decent. Try it and give your thoughts is pretty much all I can say"
412,A beautiful game that tells a lovely little story and has an extremely fun way to get around.
413,Great game
414,god tier
415,short but great. my fav
416,its my fav
417,Phenomenal story and amazing mechanics!!!
418,madeline mid
419,"One of my favorite games ever. The gameplay was amazing just soaring through the skies grabbing onto certain platforms and the difficult wasnt really there which made it much more enjoyable. But the STORY was a masterpiece. I fell in love with the characters and everything that happened, this game was perfectly written like a great movie. 
Will hundred percent return to play it again. Honestly you can even try to beat this game within the refund period but not worth it the developers deserve the money you give them for this masterpiece.

422,Really short but nice story
423,Short and loveable like Danny Divito.
424,"I've been wanting to play this game for a good while now. I finally got the chance to get it and man it sure was a great game. The story, the levels, everything. I am so glad I got the chance to play this masterpiece of a game. 10/10 would play again."
425,"Lizard Cyclops. 10/10
"
426,Actually a very good story in my opinion. Nice atmosphere and just a chill game!
427,Absolutely amazing game. Graphically and story wise. Music and lighting make this game what it is. The gameplay gives you that slight challenge but keeps the game chilled and relaxed. Eventhough this game is short it is one of those gems that you will always come back to in the future and play again.
428,Whenever I play this game I feel like making a commentary video on Youtube about gamers and their big dramas
429,good
430,good game
431,"VERY overpriced.
I got it for free, but it didn't even matter since I finished it in less than 2 hours and could've refunded anyway. The gameplay is enjoyable but very repetitive and unimaginative. Every living being that speaks looks like an abomination [spoiler](Maddie looks like Riekling from Skyrim)[/spoiler], but at least the scenery looks great.

If you get it for free or it's on a HUGE discount, then sure, go for it. It DEFINITELY isn't worth anywhere near 12‚Ç¨ though."
432,That 'Leafyishere' game. Man the memories..
433,"Fun game! done all achievements, was fun. story is meh, but fun game to speedrun!"
434,better than spider man
435,Good game but short
436,I have an audio issue that strips all the sound off this game. The sound works only in the pause menu (not the main menu). There seems to be no fix to this issue and the developers moved on to support only the new games. Feelsbadman.
437,beautiful
438,"nice aesthetically pleasing game. platformer/parkour with a grapple. short story, but I still need to go back for the collectibles. Great game overall!"
439,good
440,omg this game got me mad girls
441,loved it
442,"What I can say about this game. This game obviously created for kids 5-10 y.o. in start this game so casually and not hard, but after activation crystalls in ice map, gameplay became more harder than before. But mechanics of this game so simple and contented some logic goals and far strategy. Gamestory so short but also not bory. In the epilogue of this review i can mark this game 6/10, after walktrought Witcher 3 GOTY."
443,Pretty Good.
444,A really relaxing 3 hours
445,Pretty fun name can be taken out of context tho
446,good game to pass the time very relaxing.
447,"this is a really great game. amazing visuals, good gameplay and a nice story. the only negative i have with this game is that it's too short. i was able to finish this game in less than 5 hours on a crappy potato laptop causing me to struggle with controls due to lag. still though, if you want a fun game that isn't that long, this is the game for you. it's probably the platformer i've enjoyed most out of the few platformers i have played."
448,"Beautiful game with a great story u don't need pay to attention to and still enjoy the game, great gameplay and beautiful enviroment.
I buyed the game only because of the gameplay but after I played trough the story, I loved it.
I strongly recommend this game.
"
449,"A fun, easy to pick up, short pretty platformer.  I play through this at least once a year.  only 2-4 hours to complete.  fun physics.  not too hard, not too easy either."
450,Video Game.
451,"Beautiful short game (apart from the optional challenges which require a bit of training and time to do), the main story is captivating since the start and it made me wanting to know more from it and Fred's adventures (the uncle), especially after the end, which I resented just like our character in the game, this is a very good thing about this game where I felt strongly connected to it just as if I were being in the adventure. The ambience is so well done, you go from closed narrow dark caves to a big and open sky with rock islands, it felt like a dream.
It was hard to 100% especially the time-trials and it's easy to miss some spots for the collectibles, given that the maps felt like a maze."
452,"Much shorter than I expected but as they say, short and sweet."
453,"Y'know, this game may not have the best polish, and maybe it's a little on the short side for $17.49, but it's a lovely little game. It has an intriguing art style to match up with its unique mechanics that are still fun to use today. The level design is interesting and fun but sometimes can ride the line of it not being clear as to where you are supposed to go next. The voice acting is good, not great, but I personally like the way they tell the story, plot details, and exposition. I bought this maybe five years ago and fell in love with it; every now and then I'll load it up and give it a quick playthrough. Good job Gone North Games, you created a game that I've come back to several times."
454,"Really good fps movement-platform game. It is as short as it needs to be and brings up new mechanics gradually to keep you interested until the end. The story is heartwarming, and the voices are really good. The graphics are basic unreal engine 3 but there was not a single technical problem. Recommended!"
455,"A very short and very sweet game. Its a fps platfomer and it is very smooth. Controls are very responsive and the game feels completely bug free.
The artstyle is very pretty  and some parts of the game are challenging. 
You can finish the game in about 2 hours honestly so you only need one sitting to complete it. I dont see the short length as a negative either since it feels like the perfect length for it.
9/10"
456,Pretty good and chill game where u can fully immerse into a new universe. Great game to get away from raging in CSGO. I finished the game in 2 days.
457,"The First Person Platforming is very good with an emphasis on speed and momentum of your swings. I watched a couple of speedruns that looked very elegant compared to my attempts. 

Unexpectedly for a game like this you actually have npcs animated that walk around. 

The story is nice with a sad gut punch ending."

461,"the grappling hook is quite literally the only reason to play this game, but its still fun"
462,"awesome, lost my sense of direction a few times, but I made it through."
463,This game are very good. You must try it yourself
464,i have a very different story about [i] my [/i] uncle...
465,"[h1] Preface [/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is a First Person Platforming Game developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Publishing. This genre is quite prone to being a mixed bag, and unfortunately this title is no different. Before I elaborate, allow me to post some bullet points:

[h2] PRO: [/h2]
+ Nice Visuals and Environments (if a little samey)
+ Nice Dialogue
+ Cool Premise
+ An Intriguing Mystery
+ Fun Side-lore

[h2] CON: [/h2]
- Very Rigid Controls, sometimes finnicky (no midair control)
- Optional collectables aren't fun to get, there is little sense of wonderment
- Empty feeling world (zero character interaction, most environments are dark, dreary, NPC placement feels very ""sanitized"", as if a bunch of Garry's Mod ragdolls having been frozen next to one another at semi-regular intervals)
- Not enough substance to warrant me continuing

[h2] Review: [/h2]
As an artist myself, I'm by no means here to bash the developers and be all angry and hateful. I enjoy the effort, and I definitely see a potential player base that could enjoy this game (even just judging by the amount of Steam Reviews).

The game is rather nice visually, some it's lore is interesting, the central mystery of the uncle's whereabouts is intruiging, but it all sort of lost steam for me by the 90 minute mark and I only played an additional twenty to see if it got any better. I'm sad to say: it did not.

Like mentioned in the overly long bullet points above: The game's world feels empty, the platforming just a little too slow, simple and yet strangely precise, a precision sadly not accounted for in the controls. For example there is this move the game shows you at the very start called the ""power leap"" where you perform a high jump (""super jump"") and sprint at the same time, unfortunately, once you do so, you cannot adjust direction midair anymore.
The normal jump and power jump doesn't give you nearly as much forward momentum as you would expect either and the margin for error in actually jumping is little to none. In most platformer games, especially 2D ones, the game is automatically programmed so that there is a slight delay to when you're actually registered as having gone off a platform, so that if you press jump just a tiny bit too late, you still perform the jump (to account for the average human's reaction time and intuition). This is not present here and it feels wrong to me.

There is a village at the start of the game and it feels empty, there are obviously characters there, but they don't react to the player, barely to themselves even, as if they're all stuck in some far off fantasy land, perhaps a more engaging one than the one you, the player, are exploring. Them talking to each other makes barely any audible sound (if any! I actually can't remember.) And it all feels so ""scripted"" and, as said in the bullet points, ""sanitary"" like the NPCs have been surgically put there, with vast swaths of empty land and then a few NPCs and stock houses, placed at just the right angles, both the houses and the NPCs, it feels uncanny, as if lifeless life, a dollhouse hitting to close to actual home.

Lastly, and most importantly this was just not the game I was looking for. I recently played a game called ""Cyber Hook"", a fast paced first person platformer with a hookshot mechanic like the one here, but that one felt more organic, there was lots more momentum, speed and challenge that didn't feel stiff, meaning I could tackle a level in many ways. This game's grappling hook is just a puzzle mechanic, to a very simple puzzle, that feels unengaging to me, namely ""get from point A, to point B"".

It feels like the game is trying to have the precision and slow pace of a puzzle game, whilst simultaneously having the frankly banal gameplay loop of a normal platformer. Unfortunately there is a reason to why Sonic runs fast and Mario levels are filled to the brim with enemies, alt paths, pipes and powerups.

[h3]Much love to Gone North Games and Coffee Stain Publishing either way, I wish you luck with future projects. Who knows? Maybe I'll check your next game out and find it riveting. [/h3]"

477,i wrote a review and i found it but short
478,"You're pretty good!





P.S.: Thanks for the freebie."
479,great story and game
480,"A nice platformer that, although quite basic, has a good  story about  [/ spoiler] grief [/ spoiler]
and how does one child deals with it."
481,"It is a Story, but not about my Uncle

Anyway nice Gameplay and all the Characters in this Game
Some of the Achievements are kinda tricky but with time you can master them by yourself"
482,normal
483,cool one
484,Short but beautiful game.
485,Good relaxing fun with an Ok story but its mostly about the swinging game play anyway.
486,My uncle is nice I guess
487,"Pros
- Nice and beautifully told story
- Fun gameplay
- Cute dreamy graphics and fantasy scenery

Cons
- Somewhat repetitive gameplay and even frustrating at times
- Story and characters could've been more developed
- Short game

Overall a nice ""weekend"" game, with a really sad background story once you pass over the metaphors. It can remind you at times of Dear Esther, What Remains of Edith Finch, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or even The Fidelio Incident just to mention a few. 
"
488,"The artstyle and story is cute and pretty and the worldbuilding is decent and interesting. The mechanics however feel very clunky and are not fun or intuitive to use at all, while the level design is messy and confusing."
489,"Short, beautiful, and relaxing game."
490,One of the best games i have beat it lots of times and absloute ley love it recomend getting it.
491,"Alright platformer game. Runs better on Proton than native. The following launch option was used:
PROTON_USE_D9VK=1 %command%"
492,"super unique game, perfect for a warm night with hot chocolate :D"
493,good pass time game
494,"It's fun
"
495,i wish it was story about my dad instead :( he left to buy milk long time ago
496,Swingy swingy like monke fun
497,zipline tomfoolery
498,Short but beautiful platform game
499,"I can't recommend this simply because of one level near the end. When you are navigating the ice cave near the end as the cubes are dropping, it is impossible to get through. The problem is that the the distance that the grapple varies. Sometimes, it can stretch a decent distance, yet when you repeat the same distance, it doesn't feel like attaching to attachable objects. The speed at which the cubes are dropping also makes it tough. While you float to get on top of a cube, you move so slowly, but the cubes are dropping so much faster than you are, again, making it the hair pulling level. I could not get past this level after about 50 tries. Afterwards, I just uninstalled it and watch the end on YouTube."
500,"I'm biased, I suppose, in that I tend not to like most jumping games. But there are some that I've enjoyed. That said, a lot of reviewers have commented on this game's ""tight controls."" It could be that it's just a matter of having more patience but in my opinion the controls could be substantially better. I understand there has to be some challenge to a game but in my view the precision requirements are a bit too much. A lot of this is simply related to the time factor and how much you're willing to keep trying and failing in order to advance. It's unfortunate because when I look through all the various screenshots and scan the reviews, I think A Story About My Uncle does have something to offer for the majority of players. I guess I personally would have to give this a yellow light. Unless you're a tremendous fan of jumping games, I'd recommend some caution here. Wait for a sale, try it and see...for me, it was just a tad too tedious."

503,"Visuals: stunning.

Gameplay: simple, fun, but sometimes a little frustrating. Generally a decent platforming experience, though I wouldn't ever want to repeat it again, which is tragic because all the achievements require that.

Story: interesting concept, but the ending was unsatisfying for me.

Time taken: about 4h including some short breaks between.

Overall: for a game that prides itself heavily on the platforming rather than the story, I didn't especially enjoy the platforming, and has therefore very low replay value. I did like the story a lot though, so it's worth a look if on discount."

519,"I really enjoyed the start of this game. The movement mechanics were a lot of fun to get around with. The difficulty spikes hard though, and that did frustrate me a bit when I wasn't expecting it. It's also easy to get lost once the difficulty spikes because when the jumps get harder to make, it also gets harder to be able to find where you're even meant to be going to begin with. I even got stuck in the scenery once and had to reload from a checkpoint.

Overall though, it was still a really good experience, and I would recommend the game (probably on sale, because it is pretty short)."

532,"The pinnacle of first person platformers, it is absolutely worth your time"
533,"A Story About My Uncle is a short, little game with beautiful graphics and a lovely story-line.
It's a very linear game, but for me that's what made it such a fun experience. It was relaxing (while also frustrating) to just float around in such an amazing world while getting to know more about the world we were in.

Now keep in mind, if you are looking for a game with very in-depth controls and lots of options, this is probably not for you. This game is more on the casual side, where you just sit back and enjoy a straight-forward experience.
While some parts could get frustrating, it did not take away from the game in it's whole.

So if you're on the lookout for something short and sweet, this it it!"
534,I had a lot of fun playing it
535,"A short and sweet fps grappling game.
I do mean short, having completed it in under two hrs. So full price is definitely not worth it"

537,"Short, Cute, Sweet, and Relaxing. Recommended."
538,"(I got this game for free during an event that happened a few years ago)

I wish there was an ""eh"" option, instead of ""yes"" or ""no""

The game's fun, if you like strictly platforming, but there's a lot of very annoying physics that make it hard to enjoy on occasion (sprint-jumping doesn't allow you to change your horizontal direction mid-air, but regular jumping/falling does??)

The story's passable, it's nothing to write home about nor is it a strong aspect of this game, considering it's 99% platforming and 0.5% collectibles and 0.5% everything else.

This game was made for speedrunning, but there's a lot of annoying quirks that make it hard to enjoy in that aspect. If you can see past these though, the game's probably worth your time, especially if you like speedrunning simple games."
539,is fairly good
540,"The gameplay is mostly based around the character controller and I do like not how they implemented it. There is no coyote time, there is no double jump at the start, for some reason there is a power jump that you can only use on the ground not in the air. Nothing feels satisfying. I also don't like the level design, it is completely linear and forces you to play the game in one way, along with being completely boring and unnatural. you have to complete these long annoying jumps that just feel like trial and error. I think a much better approach to parkour gameplay is to give the player a lot of stuff to grapple onto and let them try and find the fastest way to complete the level. instead of forcing them through a totally linear level. I would instead recommend either valley or cyberhook if you are looking for a good parkour game."

554,now i am also an uncle
555,"I don't recommend playing it especially if you're not very patient.

Incredibly frustrating.
At first the game was pretty chill but with time the puzzles required more and more precision.
The graphics seem nice at first but with time you start to notice the low quality textures and oh the awful awful character models.
Maddie is such a boring and basic character. There's nothing really special about her except her weird species.
The game is very similar to Portal 1 and 2, I'd even call it a very bad version of Portal.

Waste of money."
556,"Transported to a strange and wondrous world, one that you could never have imagined existed, you begin a long and perilous journey.  With your uncle‚Äôs inventions you explore this world, uncover clues as to the whereabouts of your missing uncle, and meet new friends along the way.

A Story About My Uncle is a first-person, narrative-driven platforming game where you travel through distinct areas in a strange world with the aid of several devices, most notable being a futuristic grappling hook.  Here you travel through the skies, up cliffs, and over yawning chasms by jumping, grappling, and swinging your way forward.  A Story About My Uncle is all about finding out where to go and figuring out how to get there.

While the game is interesting, it is far from fun.  There were issues with the grapple mechanic that slowed the game to a crawl.  The story, while interesting in the beginning, fell flat early on and ended poorly.  Additionally, the voice acting was poorly done and grating.  In the end, it came down to not only the mechanics for the grapple but the numerous inconsistencies of the distance in which to grapple an object.  In a game where the placement of the grapple is just as important as being able to grapple an object; it is important to make this aspect of the game work, and its failure made the game unpleasant and frustrating.  I would not play this game again.

All the achievements are challenge mode‚Ä¶for example, completing a level in a certain amount of time, or without falling, or using a limited number of grapples.  Getting these achievements will require multiple playthroughs and plenty of time and patience‚Äîbut well worth it in the end.  The good thing is after completing the game the first time you can jump between chapters.  Additionally, you can get achievements by finding all the collectibles or optional story items.

I did not like A Story About My Uncle, but it was okay enough for me to finish the game.  While the game is pretty; the story is uninteresting, and the main mechanic is flawed.  There are far too many minor problems that I had with A Story About My Uncle to be able to recommend it.  If you like platforming games or challenging achievements then this may be the game for you, but I would have to say give A Story About My Uncle a hard pass."
557,"Solid story, gameplay is fun. Good game."
558,"This is an awesome parkour game about a grown man who goes looking for his uncle (the entire game is based on your childhood memories of your uncle told to your own daughter). It has some pretty tricky manoevering at times, the world design and music are just great. It deals with the different stages of grief, sadness, death (at least that's what a lot of players seem to agree on), I have to concur that the ending is pretty emotional. The only ""downside"" is that it was pretty short."
559,Pure love for this game in its entirety!!
560,"A very good game, a good story, a funny gameplay but maybe too short..."
561,Loved it
562,Makes me wish I get motion sick for added immersion
563,"The game was given away for free some time before.
It's very short, platforming challenges are intermediate, story is too shallow and ends abruptly. It feels like a student short film project that tried to make something meaning full but still lack something at its core. 

Only recommend playing if it's being given away for free again."

565,A LONG STORY SHORT IT WAS HIS UNCLE
566,A fun story based first person platformer. The game is short and the story seems intresting. The game's rather fun but it doesn't have a lot to offer but I think if you're looking for something fun for a couple hours this is the game to go to. There's very little replay value past acheviment hunting so that varys. All in all it's rather solid.

Puzzlewise is interesting and gives a nice variety of puzzles
Gameplaywise is nice, sometimes frustrating when if goes the way you dont want, but overall is good"
578,"This game is beautiful. 
While the story isn't really a focus, it's definitely there if you want it. There is a point to why you're going on this adventure. 
The use of the first-person narration is quite nice, and I feel it just enhances each section you play through. The game is telling a story, so why not have the character tell it too?
The visuals are great, with each section having it's own vibrant colour scheme that makes the environment really come alive while you play.
And my god, the gameplay. It's so fluid when you get the hang of it, and it doesn't feel repetitive with the progressive upgrades you're given. It mixes walking and exploring, jumping and swinging and hurtling through the air like a bullet really very nicely. 
I was loving playing through, and while short- maybe a few hours- it feels nicely paced, and there's definite replay value. 
The difficulty comes from the player's ability to work out where to go and to learn how the mechanics work, and while cartoonish, feels very meaningful. 
I love this game. Definitely play it."

582,"[h1]On of the best short stories I've played[/h1]
From beginning to end this game took me two and a half hours. 
It is one of the best short stories I've ever played. The Narration is adorable and compliments the story in one of my favorite ways. Although the character design could be improved, it does match the aesthetic of the game. The story and the gameplay work side by side and are paced perfectly. With a great story that perfectly translates to the gameplay. The level design is absolutely beautiful and the visuals compliment it almost too well. The platforming and movement are so fluid and ever so slightly challenging, it‚Äôs probably the most fun movement I‚Äôve seen since TitanFall 2."
583,44
584,"It's an ok game, tricky and quite fun platform. The story was not very interesting and I had forgotten what it was about when I finished it."
585,"Hm, how should I go about this.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[b]Gameplay and Controls:[/b] Starts off pretty fun but then the difficulty just spikes up at the caves and man, I was pretty close to dropping the game during the boxes portion of that level. Level design is pretty intuitive at the start but then suddenly there's just rocks everywhere and it's a 50/50 of can you grapple to this area or not because the distance of the grapple is completely random. The jump tends to be weird at times as well, and then there's the occasional bumping your head onto a rock will ruin your momentum.

[b]Bugs:[/b] Sometimes you get stuck on rocks and are unable to move because you aren't technically supposed to be on top of this big rock. But also you can grapple on most surfaces, most of the time, except on this rock, and that other one yeah, and sometimes you phase through this rock and get stuck in it. Aside from the clipping, not much other issues.

[b]Voice Acting:[/b] Pretty rough. Not the worst, but it's pretty emotionless most of the time. Kinda off-putting at the start of the game but you get used to it.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]Story:[/b] Yeah, it's pretty good, cute story. Nothing too spectacular in my opinion, although honestly I think my frustration with the end game just soured the ending for me. 

[b]Visuals:[/b] Very pretty. I took a couple of screenshots and was planning to do a screenshots run without the UI but I don't think I'll be doing a replay. Some non-puzzle areas are rather dark though. But it's a beautiful game. Just, don't zoom in on the characters. Don't.

[b]Overall Rating: 6/10[/b]
Fun at the start, but the bugs and the level design at the end really just hinders the game for me. Was hoping to do an achievement run but I'll probably skip that. Decent game to buy on sale I suppose. Hesitantly recommend for the story. But if you're looking for a good platformer, perhaps not."

587,"A solid game. Isn't anything amazing, but hits every mark it sets out to hit."
588,"Very pricey for the length of the game, but its fun movement does have some replay ability. You'd be mad to try and master it tho"
589,time well spent
590,"This is not a long game, but it is immersive and wonderful! I loved it!"
591,"About 9 minutes in and I encountered a glitch with a floating rock, got stuck inside and can't get out. I quit the game and left this review. Probably not the worst thing that could happen, but on a platformer, it's somewhat serious.

Either way, I couldn't get immersed because of that glitch. I'll keep playing and if my opinion changes I'll change my review:)"
592,A terrific platformer with a surprisingly good story. Can easily recommend it!
593,"Well, it started as a strange, but surprisingly interesting game. No combat or anything, you just had to move through the level, and the path wasn't difficult to find. Also, I became interested in what this world was, and how ""Uncle Fred"" was connected to it. Even more so after meeting the frog people. The end wasn't anything to write home about, though.

In chapter 3, I started to use a Youtube walkthrough to validate I was doing the right things occasionally.

In chapter 4, I used it to frequently find the way without dying all the time. Towards the end of chapter 4 I was about to drop the game when I hit an egregiously frustrating sequence that I couldn't get past. I stumbled onto a set of cheats, used that to bypass that piece, and once or twice after -- arguably, I gave up more quickly now that I knew I didn't HAVE to do the frustrating stuff. I looked it up on Youtube to see where that guy was going, tried it a few times to understand what the problem was, and if it didn't work after a few tries I'd just skip it. The chapter that followed didn't exactly improve things either; I was mostly just bypassing things more than I was playing them. And, of course, they kept increasing the distances between checkpoints to an insane amount.

It's usually the imprecise controls. Forget the controller, that doesn't even work properly. Mouse controls felt weird at first because I'm not used to it, but it worked out. It's just imprecise, and some sequences require the right timing and angles and whatnot. That's just frustration until luck hits, or I bypass this with a cheat.

If you have a high tolerance for frustation for tiny scraps of progress, maybe this game is for you. Otherwise, stay clear.

Funny enough, the cheats are actually built in -- they are just hidden, but can be accessed through a config file. There must be a reason why they left them in the production release...

594,"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway."

[spoiler] A really good game, (this'll be a long review)
 
The Sanctuary:
 i really enjoyed this one, the story in this is cool, especially the hold and powerjump feature,
the grappler is really cool to play around with,
The storyline being u grabbing the suit before going into the launchpad,
and u get sent, into the sanctuary. 
This map being really cool, is u being launched, into the sanctuary. which is a lot of water, that u have to avoid falling into. the reason the water is dangerous, is because the suit is too heavy and u'll sink to the bottom when in it.
U spawn in a large rock, with i think grass.
In front of u is an obstacle course, which cannot be done without the suit, and the power cores needed to power the grappler, theres two in this map.
After a while, U'll find fred's items if u find it.
As u parkour, u'll eventually start to find floating, moving, rocks. which u need to grapple onto. after a while of this. U'll find the village.

The Village:
U start off entering the caves, and then meeting Maddy, (Madeleine) who'll take u to her village.
u ask if she has seen fred, and she says she's seen him, but hasnt in a while. as fred, is the one who taught them how to speak, and much more, she then says to go to her village, that shouldnt be that hard, and says that maybe Samuel, The village's elder. can help u find him, after getting to the village. u have to find samuel, and once u do, maddie will be there, with samuel. after a few seconds of dialogue, she says that she wants to help u find fred, but the elder doesnt let her, in terms of safety, the deeper caves aren't safe he says, maddie gets upset and leaves. after that, he'll give u the 3rd core. Allowing u to use 3 grapples mid-air.
U then have to go to the chasms after finding samuel.

The Chasms: U first start in a deeper state of the caves. U find maddie, in the start, who then tells u to carry her over to the end of the chasms, After a bit of grappling and power jumping, power leaping. and flinging off with the grapple. she translates some Stray writings. ""dont move when the eye is open"" After a bit more of grappling, power leaping, power jumping, and flinging. u then meet, the first boss of the game. Then u know what they meant. The monster will from time to time open its eye, and u shouldnt move when the eye is open, U have to escape the monster to Star Haven. 

Star Haven: The stray villages, in a spacey kind of world. floating rocks, out of the caves. villages. After a bit of parkouring, u then get to the first village, and u find rocket boots. allowing u to fly through the sky once without touching the ground. after a bit more, the second village is found, halfway through the third, Maddie challenges u to complete it without using the grappler, Its a very hard challenge that i wasnt able to complete, if u lose, she'll laugh and say ""Told you.""
once ur in the third village, maddie gets off. and three people greet u, In the village. using Crystals is forbidden. but maddie was secretly experimenting with some, and was able to make a flashlight.
the three people are impressed by it. and the cutscene ends. U then can explore, and after a while. maddie will call u to get her, U then do a bit more ""parkour"" and theres a balloon ship (idk what its called) with a box, u grapple onto it, and then it moves, u then find another island with another balloon ship, maddie says she wants to stay, and if u find fred, to tell him to go and find her, and u go alone. and ur taken, to the Ice Mountain.

Ice Mountain: U enter the mountain, and u proceed grappling, except this time.. u cant, The ice is too thick for the grapple's power (idk what its called) to get, and u need to search for places with no ice at all, or where its less thick.

After a while, u'll find crystals, Power crystals. which allow u to harness its power to recharge the grapple.
After a while, ur rocket boots break, and ur suit is busted. and u cant use the boots. But a bit after, u then find tools, and fix it. And after a while, u find fred. who is happy to find u, and even wearing the suit he made u. and while hes talking, u interrupt him saying what maddie said to u, to tell fred to find her after u find him, he says he will, and u say u brought her to star haven, he says he wished he could have brought her too.
Fred shows u the launchpad he made, and he trusts it to only do one launch. u ask him if u can go home. he says he'll stay here, in Ice mountain. with all the other species. he says that the one launch, is urs. once u launch. the game, is finished.

613,"Not quite at the end, but I don't like games that stress me out, and this manages to avoid doing that while still being really fun and challenging! It's also pretty and has some satisfying mechanics to play around with. And, it's a great length -- short enough to be an easy thing to pick up and not overstay its welcome, but long enough to really get immersed for a bit!

If I had to make any complaints, it would be that 1) for a super cool physics-based game, it can be sliiiightly wonky, especially when you hang onto the grapple too long and bonk whatever you were latched onto. A lot of times, that item will completely overtake your field of vision and it will stop you from being able to continue your run, which can be annoying. And 2) The translation for English is pretty good, but not perfect. You will catch characters using the wrong tenses of things or phrasing things oddly every so often and while that's no biggie, if you're nitpicky about that sort of thing (Like me) it'll take you out of the experience a bit.

Overall, really great and fun!"

616,I bought this game when I was in high school in 2015.. For 6 years it was just sitting in my steam library unplayed.. unopened.. I noticed it today when I was in one of my classes for game design and we were talking about games with Unique movement systems and I remembered buying this game.. After class I played the whole game in 1 sitting.. and all I have to say is that this game is beautiful.. and the story just cuts straight to the soul.. the player movement feels so smooth and natural.. while this game may be short it is 100% in my top 10 games of my life.. please buy this game and play it the few hours it will take you are worth it for this story..

625,A very fun story to play through
626,pls no uncle
627,Its a short platformer where half the game you dont know where to go.
628,Good game
629,"It's a short game but honestly I cannot complain whatsoever, it was a cozy experience revolving around the interesting map design with platforming isn't particularly challenging is fun enough, the game knows when to stop or introduce new mechanics to keep the flow of progression going and ends just when you feel like you are done with it, the game isn't anything spectacular but it is a game done right.

This doesn't have the quality of Triple A title but it is a labor of love and I really enjoyed the warmth and coziness of the atmosphere, it was a really ""warm"" experience is the best I can describe it, it is like a short story you read before going to bed. I really like this game even if its so simple and recommend it."
630,"good looking game, good story"
631,great game
632,yes is fun
633,"Chill and relaxed game that I beat in one day of playing it, the story is pretty nice and the grappling is just sooo good."
634,good
635,So goooood! How is this not in vr?
636,Dated.
637,Amazing
638,"its really a beutyfull game, has an really good story, the only thing that bothered me was the worm animation, insted of it just screaming, it could have an cutscene like, jumping and eating regardless the game is very good and well polished
"
639,Great game with wonderful atmosphere and graphics thought it was a bit short and repetetive but otherwise its a nice little game
640,Fun game. Found it from watching Leafy.
641,Not a good game i almost started crying because it's too scary and the uncle looks like a suicide bomber and you will have nightmares about maddies teeth she's scary and i will have nightmares about her for a long time other than that it's ok game
642,"I first played this game back when it came out around 2014 and even till this day, the game play still holds up very well. It is snappy, fast paced, and is that perfect mix of simple to learn, but difficult to master. The story is good, though the voice acting is‚Ä¶ fine. It is also very short with about a four hour playtime for the main story. Still though, you can tell the developers put a lot of love and care in this game and it is definitely worth a try,
"
643,"If you're going to make a precision platformer don't put the interact and grapple actions on the same button.

The narrative and story telling is decent but you have to get through some awful platforming to get to it. A lot of the time I would have no idea where to go next and have to take big leaps to look around and hope there was anything I could grapple or leap off. It's a short game but since you can only jump and grapple it becomes boring fast. I played it with a controller but I think it would be less tedious playing kb&m.

I found this more frustrating than fun and so can't recommend it."
644,good
645,"i AM zen, i AM calm, i AM speed"
646,Not that long but a great experience
647,Recommended.
648,gud
649,"HPRAlchemist loved it, though. ""Had a great time."""
650,Ghostzapper doesn't like it
651,"Its an unique game with an awesome parkour system, it has an interesting and attractive story and it  has a fantasy touch that makes this game much better,unfortunately i had a few bugs that made my experience a little ""stressing""but aside from that is an awesome game 9/10"
652,"I finished the game in 4 hours and it was super cool, I had adventure, suspense, parkour and much more, but graphics and gameplay that amazed me. I recommend it to anyone who likes tricks in combination with parkour and a story that if to say how it is means to say how it ends."
653,I loved this at the first sight a very nice story with a very nice world for exploring
654,"A frustrating, ugly and pretentious first-person platformer about man boy love."
655,"awesome, got a lil emotional at the end cuz even the ending is sad but.......awesome, i recommend"
656,yes
657,Veri niceeee :)
658,has trading cards
659,"Summary: Recommended only if you like linear, short, parkour games, if you can accept the occassional bug, and if you buy as part of a bundle or for less than 3-4 bucks.

Decent FPS runner/parkour game, with fantasy setting, grappling hook mechanism. 80% of the game is linear and the last 20% provides platforming options and a spike in difficulty.

Story is meaningless but there is a bit / collectables are forgettable and not worth picking up / achievements are too hard to get in a playthrough.

Overall Rating: 5/10

This is a positive review, only because there is no ""thumbs sideways"" and because the game ended before I got pissed off or too bored at it."
660,its a nice and relaxing game with a pretty cool narrative
661,Fairy tale with beautiful locations and satisfying controls.
662,++++++++++
663,This was very fun but I didn't learn anything about my uncle.
664,fun af i finished it in a day
665,very nice story game. i wished it was a longer story do
666,Good game
667,i make a cum
668,"Very nice and calm game,good gameplay, mechanics and voice acting."
669,rip leafy
670,great game
671,
672,ezzz
673,jumpy jump
674,good game 8/10
675,"Honestly, I couldn't ever get the hang of the movement and I eventually lost interest trying and failing over and over to get through the first bit. The story seemed cool so I looked up a playthrough video, and I was mostly disappointed on that front too."
676,one of my favourite indie games
677,i'm a bit of a gamer
678,"This game got me started on story games. Played back in 2015 and still recommend it nearly every month to a new person. I went into it completely blind & just to kill time - so my expectations were very low; I left pleasantly surprised.

The core game mechanic of swinging around is surprisingly fun and well made and the story is very enjoyable."
679,good game
680,"Very fun gameplay and an endearing story. Nothing too special. This basically answers the question - What if Pixar made a videogame?

7.5/10"
681,"Good game

8/10"
682,Great game 10/10 definitely recommend
683,Chill and calm.
684,"A narrated platformer-like FPS where you sling yourself between targets and platforms to progress. There are hidden extra story bits to find so go explore as much as you can. I started playing with a gamepad but soon it was clear that it was going to be almost impossible to complete the later stages. So go for keyboard+mouse from the start. Well worth a playthrough, takes only a few hours."
685,7.5/10
686,Great story
687,"This is a great little inertia based game. There is a tad bit of jank with how the grappling mechanic works and how far you have to be from a target to lock the grapple in, however once you figure it out it doesn't get too annoying.   I completed the story in about 2 hours or so spread out over a period of about six years.  If you want to glide around with the greatest of ease, from rock to rock like you're on a trapeze, I suggest following the community guide (after you finish the game) and edit the files to allow you to not run out of grapples. Explore the world, enjoy the art, let the insomnia consume you."
688,how did this game get into my library?
689,"Really good game.
Unfortunately it's not possible to clap some frog cheeks. I hope the next update will fix this.

"
690,"It's amazing game, it took me more time then I would like to admit, but I still enjoyed it. Thanks:)"
691,"Searching where we have to jump to...
Some map are so dark that it almost impossible to get trough without dying a dozen time.
You swing again but you stumble in the rock to fall to your death (not under it, nope).
You swing the 10th time and finaly got a good angle to swing to the next rock but don't make it to the cliff coz ""level developer"" want it to be hard..."
692,"A Story About My Uncle
My uncle name is Anton he is an ex heroin junkie
he gave me smoke weed when i was 13 it was strange but made me laugh
short time after he disappeared i learned from his mother that he's in jail (russian jail) yikes
he was there about 4 years after he got out he told me what there people have sex with a broom
i didn't touch any drug since when don't do drugs kids"
693,"Wonderful smooth movement, jumping and the energy beam grabling is fantastic. The way the story was told as a bedtime story was quite fun and unique in my opinion and I really enjoyed that. The game was a lot shorter than I expected and the graphics were wonderful. I just wish the crosshair marker would have been smaller for better screenshots, or that there was a way of hiding it temporarily. 

If you receive this game for free, its definitely worth it, but at just above 12‚Ç¨, I dont think it is worth it compared to the content length and quality. If you get it at a discount, be sure to grab it!"
694,"The movement mechanics are so fun and smooth, they make this game very enjoyable."
695,Unique mechanics and style. Lots of fun.
696,"A nice, physics-based (in like the swinging and moving part) and short game with a cute and wholesome message at the end"
697,"The game looks good and has cool mechanics. I must be unco or something because I find it exceptionally hard. You don't click at the right millisecond and you miss the jump and then can't recover. Later in the game you have to make 3 jumps perfectly. That's a nope from me. I ended up cheating and going into Flying mode just to finish the damn story. Even then I got lost in the later caves. 

Actually after continuing to finish this game, I realised it's not just me, the grapple won't grab even if I'm very close to the rock if I'm falling, which makes no sense. The other stupid things is that I can grapple too close to the edge of a rock and just fall of the side and ""die"" or grapple onto a narrow platform but still slide off the edge and ""die""."
698,"What a dickhead of an uncle lmao. Short game, completed it in 2.5 hours. It was fun but I got it for free, I wouldn't pay full price for a short experience. There are extras, such as time trials, but I don't care for those, maybe other people do. 

Wait for a sale."
699,amazing game!
700,Yes.
701,"Literally one of the best games of all time

Very relaxing,
satisfying,
good difficulty curve,
good replay-ability in the form of time attack

would be better if it was free
bcz its short but it is reasonable on sale
would buy :)"
702,I love this game so much! please make ASAMU 2

704,Yep uncle
705,Really fun and relaxing game
706,"A Story About My Uncle is great for a bit of first-person adventure - beautifully made and well-soundtracked, it‚Äôs a great challenge but a joy to play.¬† Admittedly there isn‚Äôt much replay value, but it‚Äôs charming enough to be worth a couple of revisits."
707,"Straight up I recommend this game on sale because its dirt cheap and really fun. Even if you get it full price, you should be able to beat it in under 2 hours and refund it (my first playthrough like 2 years ago it took me 94 mins and i refunded it, i bought it again and this time took me 74 minutes)

its a very unique game, it was made by one person I think, so the graphics, voice acting, and story arent the best, but theyre all good enough. the gameplay is amazing, its very fast paced and all of the platforming abilities work and feel so good together

i totally recommend this, its super short, ends abruptly, but its worth picking up because its cheap and honestly free if you refund it when you are done"
708,The story is lacklustre and the game is kind of boring.
709,Cool little game
710,A nice relaxing game with a deeper meaning hidden within the 5 stages of grief. Worth every penny and every second spent.
711,Great story!
712,"Cool little game. Story is solid nothing groundbreaking, gameplay however was fantastic. Especially the grapple mechanic. Very fun to play. Also soundtrack's very good :)"
713,"Although the game is short, it provides a beautiful story and even more beautiful landscapes. I am not the biggest fan of these platformer type games, but this one i liked alot. Its not stressing, infact, i find this game quite relaxing."
714,"First-person jumping puzzles in a glittery, sparkling world with an insanely powerful grappling hook. You swing about the place and jump and that. Not quite as good as Valley though."
715,Really enjoyable game. Does not require much skills and it is suitable for everyone. I recommend this game to whoever likes adventures and indie-like games.
716,"What a chill game! I liked the physics puzzles, the narration & characters, and the storyline (even though it was pretty short and simple). Also cool to have a story-driven game without violence or gore. Charming!"
717,"Fairly brief little game. Could finish it in an evening easily. Fun grappling mechanic, wish it would have developed more mechanics and new abilities and harder puzzles, but fun nonetheless. Story was meh."
718,Nice story and beautiful environment. Platforming is also quite good.
719,Very good lots of yes ahuh orange apples
720,uncle is gone
721,it really makes you feel like spiderman.
722,"way shorter than I thought it would be! For a grapple hook parkour game, the actual grapple hook isn't as physics and momentum based as I wish it was, even still this game was pretty fun... also some of the visuals are beautiful."
723,"First of all, rest in peace to the creator of this game.

Secondly, so no one gonna admit that people got this game cuz of Leafy lol?
"
724,"Short and sweet. Get it on sale, though. Easy puzzles and smooth gameplay."
725,fun
726,"Way more fun than I expected. The story is meh, felt like it was just there as a reason to go spiderman swinging. But the actual gameplay is very fun, makes me think of portal logic puzzles in some places."
727,:(
728,fnf smoke em out struggle garcello :loudly_crying:
729,nice game..
730,"I think the target audience is way younger, like 12 years old?
For me, the story was way to shallow, only positive things, no twists, noting complex, like it was a childs book.
The gameplay was OK, sometimes frustrating when checkpoints are way too far apart.

I recommend Overgrowth, which has about the same jumping, just without the grappling hook or booster shoes and a way more mature story .. and combat."
731,"Well, what should I say...

The game is decent, I think this would be the best thing to say.
I wouldn‚Äôt play it again but it was decent for the almost 2 hours it took from start to finish.

It does have a charming storyline and everything you do in the air works quite well.
Everything else just doesn‚Äôt click with me.
The animations suck. Only the first-person animations of your character are okay. All aside from that looks really terrible. The NPC animations are really‚Ä¶ REALLY bad.

The worst part is landing on platforms. I couldn‚Äôt find a reliable way to land on any platform without falling off of them.
Most of the time I would fly of something and have no chance of coming back but spawn on the last platform I was standing on.

But when I take a look at the achievements I think that it was intentional to gain some type of momentum and gain a bit more of airtime. To be frank, I don‚Äôt have a single achievement in this game, because the only way to get them is to finish the levels without failing once or using the least amount of grappling hook shots.

I can‚Äôt remember where I got the game from, I mean, look at the amount of games I have...
But I think it was from a certain humble site where you can buy the occasional bundles with games and software. and sometimes they give out games, I think I got it from there :/

It‚Äôs an indie game. and its ok for what it is.
it looks decent, it runs well, plays okay but its not a must have.

Nothing was ever said about a second game so I can‚Äôt say much about it.


Okay that‚Äôs all there is about it. I wish you a great day.
-	DaveStyle out!"
732,"p fun a solid GAME
"
733,Very fun game. It's short but i enjoyed it very much.
734,"This is My go to Game
I have bought it 4 times for myself, friends and Relatives
It is the only game I have finished completely in single player, I keep replaying it, it is relaxing
I really wish they would make more
LP"
735,a peaceful game is the best way to describe this title. I really enjoyed playing it.
736,.
737,.
738,"While there are some enjoyable aspects of the game, most of it seemed pretty bland and boring. I liked the main mechanic, but very few parts of the levels utilized it to its fullest. Collectables are pretty much useless and add unnecessary fluff that gets boring after five minutes, not to mention their placement is questionable to say the least (see: my playtime, about 75% of which was spent looking for them). Mediocre (bordering on bad) voice acting would be bearable if the cutscenes were skippable (which they aren't), especially since the story isn't as gripping as some people make it out to be ‚Äì it's very simple and dull.

It doesn't hurt to grab it for free, as I did when it was free to keep for a few days, but unless you don't have anything else to play, I wouldn't recommend it."
739,"I was slightly surprised by A Story About My Uncle. Going in, I expected a by-the-numbers platformer with a story narrated in the background. What I did not expect was the effort and care that clearly went into presentation here, nor being approached by characters in a manner that reminded me of Half Life 2. It's not perfect, but it's solid, and for a low budget title it shoots above the bar. The game manages to engage and invest the player in what is happening in a very effective way, and isn't overambitious with its plot. If nothing else, this one aspect deserves to be lauded, because it's one that many games fails at.

In terms of gameplay, well, it's a bit mixed. I think the mechanics overall work well, they fit in the story in a good way and there is a lot of potential for fun in them. The speed you can generate is notable as well, maybe even more so by someone that is better at the game than I am. However, the game falls into the same trap that many (if not most) first person platformers fall into: a lack of depth perception. It's pretty difficult to judge how far away an object is, which is something vital in a game with such small platforms. 

Additionally, there is a big problem in level readability here. It's simply confusing, half the time you don't really know where you're going and just progress on pure faith, hoping that the way forward is the one you think it is and that the one boulder is the one you're actually supposed to swing from and/or is actually close enough. There are some cool moments here and there, and the environments are great, but they're all undercut when you look around and constantly wonder ""Where am I even?"". 

All in all, this is not a bad game. It has problems, but it's pretty fun and has some really qualitative presentation aspects to it and connects it with a simple but entertaining story. A Story About My Uncle is good for what it is. Whether it's worth playing or not I leave up to you."
740,good fun and a nice game to relax on
741,"the game markets itself as an parkour game so the unskippable walking sim segments were quite the curveball. the story itself is pretty bad to the point were i turned voices of halfway through the game. the parkour mechanics itself arent that great either. the main mechanic, a grappling hook is way worse in this game than in similar games like verlet swing or cyber hook since hooking something resets your speed if you are going to fast and pulls you directly towards the point you hooked, which means that it is practically impossible to swing around objects. the only thing you can do is hook an object and then let go shortly before you hit it so you dont crash into it and can fly past it. i think the level design also gets worse over time where the beginning in which you are in a cave and can hook anywhere you want is the best, the middle in which you can still hook anywhere you want but are in a more open space so you have less spots to grapple is okay and the end in which you are in another cave that mostly consists of ungrappleable surfaces is the worst part of the game, since this just adds difficulty by taking things away rather than adding new and interesting variables. the game experiments with some interesting ideas every now and then with a few things like stealth, or moving ground but those ideas are always only present for one room and then its back to the normal boring gameplay (not to say that any of the named ideas were better than the normal gameplay, but at least they were interesting). simply putting more stuff that can kill you in your way like spike grounds or floating dangers could have made the game more challenging by adding something rather than just removing potential grapple spots so i dont see any reason why the game is the way it is."
742,cheats are fun
743,yes.
744,the platforming carries it dont give a fuck about the story
745,it's a no for me
746,"Fun and relaxing platformer, kinda wish the devs would give it a workshop so I could chill out on community maps"
747,"It  is an ok 3D platformer. Not bad, not great. The story is about the nephew (you) trying to find his uncle Fred, that's it. The achievements are challenging but they are not enough to make me replay. I felt so bored I speedran this game in 3 hours to uninstall it.

In short: it is a mediocre platformer. 6/10"
748,Fun little game not a huge or long story but still interesting and fun
749,Astonishing
750,"Quick game, good for speedrunning and slight relax. Simple but interesting story, recommended to fast paced gamers."
751,Very Pog. Just amazin
752,If you are into the feeling that comes from source bhopping/surfing i guarantee you will like this. If you dont like the story (which i didnt) its a great game to play while listining to podcast/music.
753,"This game is honestly beautiful. It's a short 3 hour game but I've been having a blast on the time mode and just trying to speed-run the game. I bought it in 2016 and played it some, never did finish it but I am so glad I went back to replay it because it's amazing. Hope we can get a sequel because there's so many things that need answers."
754,pretty cool uncle
755,yes
756,when I press play the game will start and close automaticlly please help I cant play
757,yes
758,Based
759,fun game. buy it on sale or something cause this game is pretty short (about 2 hours of play time)
760,Fun little game.
761,"The environments are quite good; the sense of scale and wonder.. this game would be pretty cool in VR but it's not as good as Windlands. Perhaps it's because it's from 2014, but the people models do not hold up. Unblinking and awkward limbs, I wish there were more interactability rather than forced cut scenes and mediocre expositionary dialogue. Finished it in 2.4hrs, even on 75% discount it's $5 - there are more games out there that give you more value than $2 and hour. The gameplay is fine, it has good progression by giving you new abilities and puzzles at a decent pace, but not fun enough (for me) to do all the challenges."
762,"A beautiful experience. I haven't played long, but I can see myself playing this one to the end. I can't say that I've play many first-person platformers that are this good, in fact only the Portal games come to mind.

As for performance, I had no problems with my rig.

i7 4770 CPU
8gb RAM
GTX 660 GPU

Getting 60fps at 1080p on default settings, only enabled V-Sync."
763,got this game because of leafy and i do not regret it. the game is fun with an interesting game mechanic. my only problem is that the game should of been longer because of how enjoyable it is!
764,Steampunk acrobatics game with relaxing atmosphere. Not much more play time than 16 hours.
765,"its fucking beautiful. not graphically, but story wise. its a bit on the short side but that's fine cuz it doesn't overstay its welcome. and its fun enough that you'll want to keep coming back and playing it to chill out or have fun. and theirs enough collectables to offer very good replay value. I love this game."
766,"Short and sweet. Even though i got this game when it was free for like a week, I would still pay full price for it. Its a beautiful atmospheric experience with a charming story and lovable characters. The gameplay is fun and enjoyable and isn't overly difficult, I don't remember ever getting stuck anywhere which is very important in a ~2-ish hour game. Its got some post game features where you can try to speedrun the game or try out challenges for some of the levels which is nice but definitely not the main selling point here. Find yourself 2-3 hours, turn off some lights and just immerse yourself in this wonderful game for an evening, you'll never forget it."
767,My wife left me
768,Haha I knew you couldn't do it
769,"The game is incredibly short, I finished it in just 5 hours. I guess you cannot expect that much more from the price. However, the gameplay has ZERO depth. You just aimlessly fling yourself between rocks, hoping you're going the right way. You have almost no control of where you are going, and mostly you're just lucky. Many sections begin with a single rock and you have no idea where to go next, so you just fling yourself in one direction and hope it's correct.

Also, the story is incredibly vapid. It feels like the devs are trying to say something profound with this story but it's completely meaningless. After a very short game you find the character you're looking for. You expect some kind of pay off, but he just sends you up in the sky and the game is over.

The only thing this game has going for it is the views. It is quite a beautiful game, if you ignore the characters and their animations.

You're better off playing something like Valley if you would like a similar game.

3/10"
770,"I wanted to like this game, but I just can't. The story is plain and doesn't wrap up anything satisfyingly, the characters are placeholders and don't get any development, and it's loses a lot of steam as you play. That's saying a lot as i beat this thing in two hours. Twenty minutes of that was spent on some pointless optional challenge made a lot harder by that this games aerial movement is passable at best. Sure the game play is very good at it's core, and it does add things to keep it interesting, but it just isn't enough.

In summary, it's short, bland, annoying at its worst and good at it's best. 4/10 spend your money elsewhere."
771,"Pleasant little 3D Platformer. If you're into jumping, that's 100% of gameplay."
772,"A great game but hard. I loved the easy part where I could swing from one floating rock to another like spiderman. However when it got to the challenging parts I quit in annoyance and then went back to it. That is the charm of the game for people like me who are not very good at these types of games, however, it was great fun and in the end I completed the game and felt so proud of myself."
773,sweetty game for relaxed playing
774,"Good. Fun. Worth if if cheap. First playthrough lasts 2.5-3.5 hours ish, but getting good while grinding for the steam achievements was fun."
775,verry good story yes and looks verry good. short game
776,uncle fred touches me in funny places
777,Really enjoyed playing this one.
778,"The game is short but sweet. While some of the character models are kind of funky, I think it adds to the homey feel. The environmental graphics are beautiful though, and the puzzles are not too challenging. Overall a fun game for some nice relaxation, with some extra bonuses for those who are thorough."
779,"This game in a nutshell: You grapple, hit a stone, die and respawn... with a story in the background."
780,I liked how it was ambient and relaxing.
781,"I got it for free. It wasn't bad, but if I knew how much fun I would get out of it (which wasn't a lot) I wouldn't buy it."
782,Very nice
783,Its like cs surf but no surf
784,"Love it.
It's does depends on what you like. But if you like games that you can play and relax this game is recommended."
785,"This game feels great to play and i would definitely recommend it. It's only 3¬£ during sale and it's worth every penny of that. This game is a not a shooter or intense game but a very relax and laid back game, great if you just wanna chill. The story isn't super big which i think is a good thing"
786,"10/10, easily a steal during the steam summer sale, kinda sad I got this for free because it's worth the money"
787,Pretty emotional...................
788,pog
789,"Loved the game, took 3 hours and i enjoyed every second, The ending was moving and felt very gratifying to finish. All in all this game was worth every penny, and I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes a story rich parkour game."
790,"Really unique concept, extremely fun and well executed for the short 3 hours or so it takes to play through once. Great game to pick up on sale. Only negatives are that it is relatively short and there isn't another one! I hope they make a second or a game featuring similar mechanics one day with a longer run time."
791,"Buy this game, regardless of the price, you will not regret it.

I seldom leave good reviews. 

This is a good review.

Play this game."
792,super fun and nice story
793,fun but a bit short

796,"got this gem on a free week, got to keep it permanently, played it a few times and i must say, shits good, play it, its a cool story, cool mechanics. fun."
797,i dont know when this game was made but is a very interesting game and i love the mechanics
798,"I really enjoyed this game, I rarely play something through to the end but A Story about my uncle was the exception. Ill probably end up installing this again in a few years for another play through."

801,"rather short game, completed it in one sitting but holy shit is it amazing I absolutely loved every second"
802,"Pros:
- great story
- fantastic graphics
- movement is, for the most part, very smooth and feels good

Cons:
- short (finished it under 3 hours, despite being stuck in some areas)
- barely any incentive to replay it, besides time trial and getting all the collectibles

Overall, I really enjoyed the game, gameplay and the story are rly good. 
The only complaint I have is when you grapple on the edge, you cen sometimes get stuck on it, but it's not that big of an issue.
The game could be longer. I bought this for 3.12 euros on summer sale, but the full price (12.49 euros) is a little bit too much for such a short game in my opinion. There is some replay value (time trial, collectible/achievemnt hunting) but I would still only price this game at 10 euros at max.

So my final score for this game is 9/10. I highly recommend it, but if you want to buy it, try to find it for a lower price."
803,"HEY IM FLYING WOOHOOO!!

A perfect game for those who wants to chill and enjoy , controls are so easy that anyone can play it 
i thought this game is just hanging here and there but it is not , the story makes it interesting + this game has certain boss (i completed till we leave the blue girl in the another village)

a total win-win situation if u purchase it :smiley:"
804,Great story but a little short
805,amazing gamne
806,"Well, At first this game seems like an average indie game but after playing it 4  1.5 hrs, Oh boy ..... i m addicted ....Yeah yeah its a small game but achievement made it worth playing 4 more time"
807,"A first person exploration/adventure game where you play a young boy in search of his uncle, who has gone missing in another strange reality. Starts off charming with a neat grapple mechanic but bogs down over time, less with the difficulty of traversal and more with the difficulty of trying to figure out where the hell you're supposed to go."
808,you just go zoom zoom with an advanced rope
809,"i got this game when it was free and let me tell you this, 

graphics are not rlly that good but that doesn't change how the story goes

on my opinion the story line is very good when there is not rlly allot of talking but jumping and the ambiance of the game"
810,"This game is an unique platformer and a true gem. Extremely enjoyable even with only five playable levels. What would really make this game stand out would be community map support. As it stands though, this game can be completed in an evening and for that reason I cannot recommend buying this game at full price."
811,"The game is an atmospheric, immersive story told through narrative and a world that you want to explore. It has some technical shortcomings, though you won't find them too often if you follow where the story wants to take you. All in all a good evening's worth of game that will most likely touch you."
812,"very good game, but really doesnt do enough, buy it if its on sale"
813,My uncle penis feed me when I was 9 years old
814,7 years later and still waiting for a sequel
815,Good game with a nice story. cool movement mechanics too
816,"So I just finished this game after having it collecting dust in my games library for years. Having received this game as a gift from a friend, prior to playing this game, I had no idea what to expect from it. Condensed, the story is quite an endearing one, but as a game, it has a couple of problems that I want to elaborate on below. The negative review marking here should be taken with a grain of salt. Instead, treat it instead as a hypothetical ""Neither"" option. 

To me, ultimately the question comes down to whether the story presented in a story-based game is worth the price, something I cannot comment on as I received this game for free. However, I feel that I would not want to pay money for this game's story, nor do I feel like the story managed to engage me on any level until the end of it, upon which I started asking questions about what the story was trying to tell me. You may be more or less affected by the story if you can relate to it as it deals with themes of abandonment, preoccupation and family relations. Unfortunately, as a story standing on its own, I would argue that it fails to provide any real answer to the questions you ask if you try to analyse it metaphorically. The characters you meet are very endearing however, and the game is also very pretty, with the environments you explore being alien yet simultaneously very natural.

The game itself is merely 3 hours long if you go through the story itself. For me, the problem here is not the length itself. The problem is that, during those 3 hours, I was more engaged by the actual gameplay this game provides, which consists mainly of you figuring out how to get from point A to B using a grappling hook and other aerial abilities that you unlock as you go through the game. This creates a mix of puzzle-platforming which I was more intrigued by as I was going through the game, than the story it was telling me. Whether this is a good thing will be up to you, but what I can say is that this is no walking simulator like 'What Remains of Edith Finch', where gameplay is meant to service the story the game tells you. Another game that does this better is the Orwell series. Unfortunately for this game, those examples I gave did a better job on their story than this game ever did. The gameplay here also fails to connect to the story itself other than the fact that the platforming that you are doing has been done by the character you are following.

On the other hand, gameplay-wise, I very much enjoyed playing around with the core gameplay loop, and the game lays this out in a very Nintendo-esque type of way, slowly introducing you to new mechanics with easy puzzles, then builds upon these with new challenges that you have to figure out, building on what you previously learned. There was also one point in particular that I really enjoyed gameplay-wise where you had to backtrack over obstacles that you had previously overcome, which were now in motion. The new abilities you receive as you go through the game blend really well together and you get a Metroid-esque type of feeling of you powering up as you go along.

As such, to sum up this game, I feel that if you're going into this game expecting to be told an interesting story, you may leave disappointed, and there are many venues that explore this better. However, if you go into this game expecting a puzzle-platformer of sorts, you may find it worthwhile for the few hours you get to play around with it, and you may come off it wishing for more gameplay, new abilities and more challenging puzzle-platforming, like I did.

817,"I love this game. The physics are really fun to mess around with even after you have completed it, and the world building is very immersive. Left me wanting more."

837,Good time pass game. A decent frictional game don't expect too much from it. Child friendly game i would say. The story is about a Uncle as the tile suggest. Nothing much to expect Just the regular game you can you it as a background of the video! get it on sale! might not worth the original price but a good game overall.
838,"I played through this game at least 3 times, i hadn't played another platforming game as good as this one in a long time. please give it a chance"
839,"Very Nice! 
It has a very good atmosphere in my opinion. Also the Gameplay feels smooth as it should be in that kind of game."
840,Nice and relaxing game.
841,i would still buy the game even if it had costed me 500inr . 9/10
842,"I have played through this game twice now, i would get it if you enjoy a short story game. It was really fun when i played it but after a good 1.5 hours then its all over. I got the game for free, but i wouldn't spend more than $10  on the game."
843,"The game took about 6 hours for me. The story was good, I liked it. This is a good game."
844,"I don't get this game at all, I only have it because of a giveaway a few years back. More than a story, or anything, this is a short platformer game. Not a puzzle platformer, mind you, a platformer, in first person, for that extra bit of ""where the hell am I positioned?"". If there's a game begging to be ported into VR, is this one, but...

But... the fact they cripple your grapple with only three charges (it should be unlimited, frankly) and add mechanics like air jumping just to make things unnecessarily complicated, instead of exploring properly the one cool mechanic they've got, is just beyond me. Well, this is except in the last level, where you can recharge in certain spots your grapple, you could have just made the platforming more interesting (have some puzzles, maybe) platforming and grant the unlimited grappling. I also found the controls, both keyboard + mouse and controller rather weird and unfriendly.

The story, since the title, there isn't much to it. Play the first 5 min, and that's about it. [spoiler] Now, I've plenty of issues in the way they handled the story. It's simple, I get it, it's meant as a story a dad makes up from the top of his head - or is it? - Why do it like this though? The problem is that it's tropey as all hell, and at points self-aware of this, explicitly as part of the text. Do not do this unless you're subverting or deconstructing something, it exposes and stops the story dead on its tracks, because you're not doing anything with it. Plus, it makes the audience aware, and the problem with that is that Maddie is one of those late 80s obnoxious children characters from cartoons, that everyone hates, played straight - in spite of her voice actress being too old to play the character (the voice acting is awful and poorly produced all round) - and ending her story by leaving her in a place she has known for 2 minutes. Girl, you're not going to have freedom there, whatever that means to you, you know nothing of these Strays. Also your uncle is a loony with a really weird fetish for glowing rocks, it really killed any enjoyment I might have had when I met him at the end of the game.[/spoiler]"
845,"This is a very fun game that you can pick up and play through in an evening, or you can spend as long as you want trying to complete the various challenges and time trials.

Others comment on the controls not being perfectly fluent but for the price (considering you can find good deals for it everywhere and its common in bundles and the like) your getting a still smooth enjoyable experience, at no point did i find it too hard or too easy and its the kind of game you can take at your own pace, giving yourself restrictions to make it harder, or just flowing through and enjoying the scenery.

The story while not perfectly narrated is still engaging considering how it is overall, the daughter chipping in occasionally is cute and refreshing and especially the portions with Maddie are just pleasant.

If there was anything bad about the game it would just be the length, and the fact that considering the games size and presumably the developers resources at the time, the world does get a bit samey aswell as the puzzles, im sure if you gave the dev's todays resources they would have made something even better, so you should still be considerate of the fact this is a now 7 year old game, and it stands up incredibly well."
846,"+ story
+ a nice looking world to explore

- as you get further into the game, the jumping puzzles become more and more annoying, up to a point where the game requires you to make 3 very precise jumps and land on a tiny floating rock somewhere way out of sight from your initial position. Some players may like this but to me these dexterity/timing puzzles are just a waste of time.
- The only thing you can do in this game is run around, jump at huge distances and hang on objects using a rope. It's a platformer, yes, but any serious players would want something more

This game has limited value due to its pretty bland and repetitive mechanics of jumps and hooks. So, at best it's good for 1 evening, until the puzzles get too frustrating to progress further

6/10"
847,Decent
848,Fuck maddie
849,its aight
850,i played twice it is very good yes
851,"Ok, first things first. The game itself isn't bad as such. But recommending it would mean that I really think money spent for the game was well-spent and fun-cost effective. And I don't. I got this game as a freebie and completed it with a certain degree of fun (albeit tainted with a pinch of annoyance).

Second important factor impacting my oppinion of this game is the unavoidable comparison to grappling mechanics of Bionic Commando. And here's where this game falls terribly short. And it's the core feature of the game.

The grappling mechanics is the game's biggest asset and it's greatest flaw. Your grapples are limited to three consecutive ones before landing on the ground. Unfortunately it's easy to sometimes mistakenly click twice and lose one grapple (which usually means you won't be able to reach the platform). The game also doesn't ""recharge"" your grappler on some surfaces - it seems as if you've properly landed, you can move properly, you can even jump but you have no mor grapples to use.

Furthermore it's impossible to judge beforehand whether you'll be able to use you grapple on something or will it be too far away. It feels as if it didn't matter on the predefined grappler device characteristics but more like predefined map spots from which you can or cannot grapple things.

In Bionic Commando you had the bionic arm which you could use to swing around and hang on it. Here the device pulls you automatically towards the object. Maybe it was a conciencious design choice but it's annoying as hell. Especially if you add it to the fact that the game cannot fully make its mind whether it's a platformer, puzzle or exploration game and you get yourself into a situation you don't know how to get out of.

The game itself is cute, has some story behind it (haven't finished it yet so can't tell whether it has a reasonable resolution). But seems to be rather short (with 3 hours on record I'm definitely way past half of the game).

The environment is nicely drawn but the characters look dated (I'm writing this in 2021, the game is from 2014 and it shows. The sounds are ok.

If you get this as a freebie - give it a try. Might be worth few hours of your time. If you have a chance to grab it with anhefty discount, well be warned that you might be disappointed. But you might like it anyway (number of positive comments shows that people indeed like this game despite its flaws). For the full price - wouldn't recommend it."
852,"""A Story About my Uncle"" A masterpiece of a video game. The experience was so good, the story line, the graphics all of these were absolutely amazing. I had a fun time in this game. This game is like the Michael Jordan of platformers. The Aesthetic and the art choice continues to amaze me. This was definitely worth my money !"
853,A very chill and laid back story about some weird looking avatar things.
854,"Gotta admit, I nearly gave up near the end, it seemed that the difficulty spiked abruptly at that point, but I finally made it, and I have to say that all in all I loved the game. I liked the visual part, and the way they chose to handle the narrative. Finding the collectibles and the additional pieces of story was rewarding, and I enjoyed the challenges too."
855,good
856,"Es bastante divertido aunque algo corto, me gustaria ver mas"
857,its poggers
858,nice story
859,"the gameplay is fun but the frog people are UGLY. 

also, the narrator made the entire experience like 10x worse"
860,"This game had a lot going on for it. Nice graphics, interesting story, neat worldbuilding... But sadly some of the worst gameplay and controls I've ever experienced. I would describe the gameplay as ""Super Meat Boy on Xen with noodle arms"". The level design is just bad, as not only simply getting around is a tedious chore but it's also a ""where the fuck do I go"" kind of game where your destination is never clear and you do a lot of going in circles accidentally. The experience reminded me a lot of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, except in that game the horrible controls were the point. Here, they just get in the way. I don't even want to know the end of the story because of how frustrating the whole thing is. And if you think I just hate difficulty: not at all, Dark Souls is one of my favourite games of all time. But A Story About My Uncle isn't just challenging; it made me feel like I was repeatedly trying to put a thread into the hole of a sewing needle while covered in oil and blind drunk.

This game made me hate grappling hooks."
861,"[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a linear platformer from Gone North Games.  As read in the description, the player takes the role of a nameless adolescent boy who navigates a foreign world in search of his uncle.  The core gameplay centers on three mechanics - long/high jump, grappling, and single-use rocket boots.

Gone North clearly put in tremendous effort into [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i].  The world is gorgeous, particularly for the Unreal 3 engine.  In terms of platforming, the levels are well-designed.  New mechanics and challenges are introduced at a constant, appropriate pace.  Difficulty increases incrementally.  The story is simple and told in a cute way.

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] has a few minor negatives.  The voice acting is sub-par.  The main narration has frequent points in which either the actor pauses mid-sentence or sentence fragments were hastily pasted together.  The story comes to an abrupt end that does not flow with the gentle rolling out of the main tale.  Some of the levels become monotonous and feel as though certain platforming sections only appear to make the levels have similar length.  

However, the game does have a major flaw.  Its grappling mechanism needs a great deal of polish.  The player may use the grapple beam three times before standing on solid ground, which introduces a fun challenge in this mechanic.  However, it is exceedingly likely that the grapple will use multiple charges with a single mouse click, effectively forcing the player to fail.  It has the appearance of the grapple beam slipping and re-catching.  By the end of the game, when the player needs very precise control over their movements and checkpoints become sparser, such a failure in the grapple system becomes unbearably frustrating.  I attempted using two different wireless mice, a wired mouse, and a wired controller.  All input devices had the same problem.  Had it not been for this issue, [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] would be a great experience.  By the end of the game, the grapple beam failure made me regret my purchase, and I would not play it again.

If a player has an input device that will minimize the failures of the grapple system, then [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] would be highly recommended.  Otherwise, players my be in for a frustrating experience."
862,"Its a cool game, but only buy it on steamsale, for me personaly its not worth the full price"

875,"*Recommended, but only if you can get it on a sale*

A Story About My Uncle feels less like the introductory chapter to a game series and more like DLC, and no, that‚Äôs not a shot at its length (although it does falter there in relation to price). What I mean is, the way the story and world come together, it seems like something you should already have some knowledge of given that you‚Äôre putting these skills together in a series of limited connecting events designated around a single gameplay mechanic.

Ah, I suppose that doesn‚Äôt do much in terms of clearing up what I mean. Let me try this again- ASAMU is a short adventure centered around a system of parkour and grappling. And because you‚Äôre not doing anything uniquely different throughout the title aside from that (compared to a bigger game which would introduce variations throughout), it comes off more like a DLC since typically that‚Äôs what extra story packs do- create a separate environment, introduce a new gimmick, and then set the player off on a quickly-resolved narrative.

Is this a criticism? Yes and no. ASAMU could have done a lot more with the movement puzzles its gameplay focuses on, yet it‚Äôs saying something that I wanted more since I found it fascinating. It goes like this- you have the ability to spring, jump, super jump, leap, and grapple. You‚Äôre going to have use all of these abilities to traverse through the rocky terrain that makes up most of the world. Velocity, jumps, and falls are all crisp, and there was an option by developer Gone North Games to make this purely about movement ala Sonic- that is have the level layout revolve around darting, bounding, and, grappling in a fast-paced environ. Instead, they opted to make it a parkour puzzle wherein you use the aforestated powers to plan your traversal across a world with broken floating rocks and platforms. Was this a good decision or bad? In light of their budgetary or time constraints, it was good since it allowed them to focus on one aspect rather than split up the effort, but given that ASAMU should have been longer, you could have had a combination or alteration between the two parts to change up the gameplay.

In general, the controls work and respond fine, but there is a big issue in the form of the grapple: it works like the tractor beam from Star Wars in that you get locked into a directional suck once you use it on an object to pull you forward. The problem with this is you can‚Äôt turn or jump at all when you‚Äôre doing this, meaning if you target a platform at the wrong angle, there‚Äôs a 95% chance you‚Äôre going to have to restart as your character will fail to land on it and consequently fall, and yes it gets frustrating despite the abundance of close save points (and the ability to insta-respawn). The introduction of rocket boots helps alleviate things by giving you a mid-air boost jump, but I don‚Äôt think this was intended to be a solution, rather its own gameplay mechanic. There were a couple of solutions that could have been implemented to overcome this- one, give players directional control, or two, incorporate an auto-grab ledge animation that causes the protagonist to pull themselves onto a flat bed even if they come at it at the edge.

Graphically, ASAMU looks solid- it kind of sucks for the developers that they made it using Unreal 3 given that Unreal 4 came out earlier the year their game was released, but it still looks great for the most part ‚Äì in-between the blocky roundness of the Xbox 360 and the beautiful polygons of the Xbox One. Texturing isn‚Äôt as strong as it could have been, but given that the game is consistently dim, it‚Äôs not noticeable, with the exception of NPCs. OMG did they look ugly, and not in a xenophobic way but in an uncanny way- facial animations (really all animations in general) are particularly jarring.

Outside of the illumination from your grapple, the lighting is baked, which was for the better as most of the title takes place at night and most of the environment‚Äôs luminescence comes from these in-game crystals that, if dynamic, would have made things too dark. That being said, ASAMU, as a whole, could have been brighter as it was sometimes hard to see where to go next despite the presence of glyphs indicating as such. I also liked that your character model is small, indicating you‚Äôre a child.

With sound, the score is good but not used enough. It plays during the beats that the director wanted it to play, but outside of that it‚Äôs mixed in way too quietly, even with max volume settings. The same issue applies to SFX where you get these nicely crafted acoustic accompaniments to your jumps, windfall, landings (LOVE the oomph there), and use of tools, but in general it‚Äôs soft. I also would‚Äôve liked a lot more ambience, particularly for the cavern areas.

With voice acting, you primarily have the performance of Walter Ferrero as the narrator, who does a good job at simultaneously explaining what was going on whilst also interjecting his dialogues with other character in the story as well as conversations with his daughter outside. His daughter is also good. The other voice acting, particularly for Maddie and the titular Uncle‚Ä¶.your mileage will vary is all I‚Äôll say as I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of them personally, though I acknowledge they had script limitations and delivered things as they were told to.

This brings us to the story. ASAMU evidently draws on classic epic poems like the Odyssey and Beowulf, as well as frame stories like The Princess Bride. It details a tale from the narrator‚Äôs childhood wherein he ventured into an alternate microcosm in search of his missing Uncle Fred. Because the environments are relatively similar to each other, you don‚Äôt have much in the way of an adventurous feel, despite that being the intentions of the devs. It‚Äôs also not emotional in the slightest due to the lack of fleshed out characterizations and relationship developments, though I don‚Äôt think this was a big intention. That being said, the writing is good insofar as it is does a great job simultaneously narrating what‚Äôs going on storywise, providing the protagonist‚Äôs inner thoughts, explaining new discoveries/items/mechanics to players, and incorporating the aforestated dialogue, all without coming off as forced or expository. In fact, it was so good I wanted more. There are too many sections where you‚Äôll be walking or running and not have anything but silence, and I feel this was a missed opportunity to include more from the well-done script, even if the package as a whole was lacking in scope.

Overall, I did enjoy my time with ASAMU. It‚Äôs a shame that no sequel has been made or will be made (as of the time of this writing) as I think it laid the foundation for something solid to be built off of ala Portal -> Portal 2. While the story lacks an epic or even thrilling feel, and while there were problems with the gameplay like the tractor beam, the physics engine combined with mostly-precise controls made it a fun playthrough. Hopefully this concept is picked up on again in the future.

I got around 4 hours (maybe less, my Steam clock is inaccurate since I was afk for at least 30 minutes), which does not justify the $15.00 asking price. Granted, I didn't look to get all the collectibles since I didn't think they were worth it (they do provide some goodies like new game modes and a different colored grapple beam, but that's nothing substantive). As such, I recommend getting the game on a sale."
876,9/10
877,Very Good Game When You Are Bored
878,A relaxing platformer with some story. One playthrough takes about 2 hours.
879,"PRAISE THIS GAME!!! This is ultimately my favourite game ever. The best game I have ever played! Although at first I found it to be quite hard to get to the check points, with some practice I was able to continue and the art and graphics have made playing A Story About My Uncle something that I am sure I will do time and time again. The story was lovely and the characters and places both eerie and equally beautiful. If your looking for a game that will make you feel like your actually in it, and some of the best graphics you'll ever see, look no further."
880,"The world is beautiful and the story charming in a simple kind of way. There is no permadeath, so you can keep trying...and you will. The controls desperately need optimization. The mechanics are are mixed bag of successfully making it from Point A to Point B without getting stuck in scenery, getting lost in the too-samey environment, overshooting your mark, and awkward, far-too specific controls. All of this gets in the way of what should be a very smooth, seamless experience. This game WANTS you to be flying smoothly, uninterrupted through this amazing environment. But the issues listed above keep it a stilted journey, finding you constantly pausing to correct for this or that so you don't miss your mark. Meh."
881,that one game that leafy played or something pretty good
882,Its fun and challenging
883,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platformer game, with some interesting grappling mechanics, and a nice story. The story is narrated by the protagonist, who's telling his daughter about an adventure he had as a boy when searching for his missing uncle. Uncle Fred, as he was called, was a scientist who'd invented many different devices, including an energy-based grappling hook. The story begins with the protagonist visiting his uncle's home, and being transported to a fantastic world.

Personally, I found the story enjoyable; while the narration felt slightly off at times (in terms of the dialogue delivery), the story itself was nice, with some beautiful locations and a loveable character in the form of Maddie, a young girl the protagonist befriends along the way. The gameplay is another good point of the game; as I mentioned, it's a first-person platformer, and your main method of movement is the grappling hook, which allows you to traverse large distances; you also get some upgrades along the way, like more charges for the grappling hook, or even some rocket boots, that increase mobility. As for combat, there's no combat at all in this game, no enemies to fight; in that regard, it's a very peaceful experience, and there's no risk of death (if you fall, you immediately respawn at the latest checkpoint).

The world design is wonderful, full of beautiful and different areas for you to explore; even then, the game is fairly linear, though you get plenty of times to appreciate the views. However, I'd say that the graphics themselves, while being nicely stylized, still show some rough spots here and there, especially when it comes to some of the character models. As a final note, this game also has a good soundtrack.

So, do I recommend A Story About My Uncle? Yes. It's a rather short game (it can be finished in around 4 hours, maybe less), but for what it offers, it's an unique enough experience to stand out."
884,"Great game mechanics and a decent story, that's about it!"
885,Pretty good game.  Relaxing and wholesome.
886,"A 3-4 hour story with grappling/grapnel hook and air platformer physics that sometimes get in the way. Pretty easy, maybe not for those with a fear of heights.
Stay after the credits for a little bonus/conclusion."

890,gg
891,"Its a very good Adventure game. In the first playthrough there are many challenging worlds.. but with the time challenges u master the gameplay..
I highly recommend this game. It was so much fun and had a neat little story with a great created world!"
892,"this is not a charming platformer this is a rage game with no directions

YOU WILL GET LOST A LOT"
893,"This is a fun little game that actually gave me more playtime than I expected. I actually got it when it was free for a time, so maybe that's why I thought it would be shorter. I would imagine the audience of this game is actually children, but not too young, since I struggled a fair bit with some parts of the grappling parts (which make up the majority of the gameplay). It mixes the grappling mechanic with rocket boost shoes, plus crystals that can recharge your grapple tool mid swing. It introduces each new mechanic very naturally and I knew exactly what they wanted me to do most of the time. Note: When you get to a part that seems suddenly way harder, look around for another platform half way. You probably missed it and it isn't actually that hard.

I found the environments beautiful, although they're extremely static. The story is very linear as one would expect of a small game. The voice acting is alright, but some of the lines have grammatical mistakes, if you care about that.

All in all I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit and it offered quite a challenge to me (not that I'm a great gamer). I'd recommend this game. Maybe not quite at full price (which is roughly 7 USD currently) but it depends where you are. There is some replayability in the fact that they provide a time trial mode. But I closed the menu as soon as I saw that since I literally said to myself in one part of the game ""Gosh I'm glad there isn't a time limit on this.""

I liked the ending. Somehow it got me feeling wishy washy sad but... I'm emo like that."
894,Amazing game with fun gameplay and outstanding visuals. The story is rather short (about 2 hours) but entertaining throughout. Definitely worth playing.
895,"Game is really fun and everyone should try it at least once, brings a feeling of freedom when you are mid-air and jumping high.

898,It's fun and easy to control with Keyboard and Mouse. Definitely worth the short time you put into it.
899,"I played this a while ago back when Steam was selling it for free but I wished I paid for it, It is fairly short though, me, Who's bad at video games beat this in about 6 hours and a half. I will say this game has a lot replay value as I never got bored doing the achievements or just playing again, For $15 this game is worth it. To the actual game, You basically have this glove that can grapple on certain places and you don't know how good it feels to successfully swing off of a rock floating the in sky and then maneuver your way onto a surface until you have. The glove also has this thing where holding RMB will charge it up, just letting go will make you jump really high and letting go while running will make you leap super far. Eventually towards the end of the game you get more stuff that helps even more but I won't say that due to it being fairly late into it. It's great platforming, great story, great pretty much everything, If you have $15 laying around and like platformers, Get this game"
900,yes
901,very good
902,I am now a commentary youtuber
903,Good stuff
904,10/10
905,ass
906,"Good but short, wait for sale to buy it."
907,"This game makes me sad. It is possibly one of the best and most interesting platformers I've ever played, but I will never see it fully developed. I truly believe that if this game had been fully developed and was not left in early access that it would have been a game of the year. The story is intriguing but not overwhelming, the caves make you both filled with wonder and fear, and the movement mechanics aren't revolutionary, but they're applications are. However, in my opinion the greatest feature of this game is it's art style, most textures in this game look unfinished and sometimes buggy, but the scenery is still amazing. Rather than having beautiful graphics, this game has beautiful style, however as I said before we will never experience this game's full potential."
908,Yo it's the Leafy game
909,Grapple yourself into a cute story about OP's uncle.
910,Good i recommend
911,good game
912,"What a great game. A good story, fun mechanics and even though I found it through watching leafy so long ago, it was still great buy."
913,"I can write a review for a game I don't own
n1 steam"
914,"this game no longer works i tried to run it all day but all i got was ASAMU-Win32-Shipping.exe is not responding from my research this has been a problem sense 2014 7 years ago and the problem is still not fixed!               
this game should be removed from steam as it is clearly  in a broken unplayable state, and has been in this state for years"
915,"Relaxing, but don't buy it just for the heck of it. It's not that good."
916,"Great game with a unique movement mechanic, interesting story, and good atmosphere"
917,very good game
918,"A small but fine game.
Very refreshing control paired with a nice story.
Definitely worth playing it."
919,Good Game
920,short gameplay. completed within 3 hours
921,"A thoroughly pleasant game, that succeeds in bringing together arcade movement mechanics with a chilled out family friendly storyteller atmosphere."
922,Perfect for YouTube commentary videos lol.
923,"Very charming little story game. The animation and voice acting/syncing isn't triple A, but it's pretty decent none the less. The game also has great Speedrun potential. All in all I can recommend the game to anyone who likes a shorter 3-4 hour story game with fun and somewhat difficult movement mechanics."
924,i don't like how the uncle touches you in your no no place at the end
925,nice story fun game play like the old youtube vids you would see people play this while doing news storys or something
926,my cock shrunk 1 inch I now have no  penis
927,"holy crap ! I really expected an indie game which lasts for 1-2 hrs...but when I first played this gem, I was like ...  holy sh** those mechanics are gold ! 
the achievements are not that ez to get, so you have to at least learn the map or some cut's to go for the grabbling stuff !
I have 21 hrs of playtime and I still have two achievements missing 
definitely a must have ! its cheap, sweat and reeeally good (good choice for the engine ! )
I would even recommend it at full price !
*edit* - I'm done now and btw the levels have such beautiful landscapes, it looks totally amazing"
928,"Brilliant game
I just completed it and enjoyed it a lot"
929,Nice little game. Great story. I don't normally like jumping games but this is really good. Mechanics work well. Would have liked a few more checkpoints on the hard bits.
930,"A bit dated, but a spectacular first person platformer.  The game itself is very short, about 3-4 hours but there are unlockables for extra replayability.  The story is cute, but slightly cheesy.  Overall, If you can get it cheap, its a very immersive platformer.  The use of the grapple device and other unique abilities allows for a very smooth experience."
931,We need to take this game back from Leafy.
932,"Good game, generic story, but the visuals are beautiful.
An agility game, with no enemies but gravity.
Con: It is not really balanced in difficulty. At times it feels easier than it should be, and then you might get stuck in the same spot for hours on end trying to get the perfect angle to jump from a rock.
It can get frustrating, but overall it was a fun game."
933,Pretty good
934,"This game is geniuenly breathtaking and definitely worth checking out. Beautiful colours, simple and heartwarming story, great music and incredible atmosphere. It gets even challenging sometimes, I would never expect such experience from a game. 10/10"
935,6.5 / 10
936,"The game mechanics are very interesting, but somehow this game generates a lot of stress and frustration on me, probably because it took me a lot of effort to master the controls. Anyways‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all, it is repetitive and the story is flat. If you like challenging games, then probably you are going to love it."
937,"
This is a nice little short game. The story is perfectly fine. Worth downloading if you want a little one-day game."
938,"A short, but sweet platformer that is good enough to play around with its central mechanic that you can ignore the severe lack of an actual story, unlike the title suggests."
939,good game .. fun to play
940,A short but fun game.
941,"Mama, do we have pizza........?

NO 

:("
942,"Fun little game, good mechanics with a simple story. Good way to spend some free time :)"
943,"It was just okay. The graphics were decent with fun mechanics but the story was pretty bland. It didn't feel rewarding to find secrets or even finish the game. [spoiler] You get to the end and your uncle just yeets you back into the real world after all that park-core, are you kidding me?! I thought there would be some awesome reveal at the end. I had already understood the uncle created the people and what not so it felt redundant. [/spoiler] Also the movement reduction during dialogue was frustrating... the story could've been better but if you like fun/ chill platforming puzzles go for it."
944,"The game is great. It has a nice atmosphere, but it could have been a little longer maybe. I hope there will be a sequell to the game."
945,"3-4 hours long. The game supports a controller, but you're better off playing this one with a keyboard and mouse."
946,"It's a short and challenging game, moving around is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. I started playing with a gamepad but for me it ended up feeling more comfortable with mouse and keyboard."
947,nice
948,"Very fun game, really wish there was more content though"
949,pretty unique game
950,"I like the story line. There could be more fill, but it's good nontheless."
951,Good Game !
952,"Great story, wellmade levels the graphics is the most awesome, wish you could have a blimp to just move around and enjoy the scenery! A few times you ponder where to go, so just check around and see what is hookable and not. It can be frustrating at points, but overcomming that feels soo good!"
953,what is even happening
954,well that was interesting
955,It's a fun game with satisfying mechanics. I'm a bit sad that the game isn't that long. Good story and a cool concept of the glove.
956,good
957,"I don't think a game has ever made me hate my life more than this one. Story is eh, characters are annoying, and the gameplay is too ""difficult"" for my tiny pea brain. Not gonna waste my time trying to get past one puzzle part after trying everything (even though I did to beat the game.) Rocket Boots are bad, grappling is a mixed bag. The graphics are nice, and I can appreciate the originality, but not a game for me. Buy it on sale, the game takes around 3 hours to beat and to me $14.99 is a steep price for a 3 hour game."
958,"Traveled across different worlds, risking your life from falling into the abyss, manoeuvring across tricky terrains, just to get that 1 minute talk with my uncle and he asks you to fuck off home.....

Verdict
‚òê STAY AWAY FROM THIS!
‚òê I would not recommend this
‚òê You may get this on sale :)
‚òë I would recommend this
‚òê PLAY THIS BEFORE YOU DIE!"
959,.
960,I liked it and it was fun to play.
961,"Well, it looks good, it has a nice atmosphere.
I didn't enjoy the storytime they brought, and couldn't get into the gameplay.
Maybe I was just not well enough with the timed jumps and the grappling thingie.
On the other hand, I never liked games that want you to puzzle yourself through jump sections with trial and error. But in the end that's the primary gameplay loop. 
So the game and I just had the misfortune of meeting. 
It seems to me that it's basically a jump-puzzler that offers a voice in the off that should draw you into a endearing and fascinating strange world. 
Both pulls into the game don't catch me."
962,"Kind of like Portal without much of a story but interesting gameplay concept. Sometimes , it feels bland doing just puzzles but they get somewhat challenging after a while so they will probably keep you engaged in the game , the game atmosphere is very lonely like , you dont see much characters and even when you do its not for a very long time , ending was insanely disappointing they probably could have done better than that."

967,"I think i got this game for free something like 5 years ago and never actually played it until today. And i'm really glad i did! I wish it was slightly more polished gameplay wise, but i still loved it."
968,this game is super fun but the ice cave is super fucking hard
969,.
970," I really liked this game.
 It did some cool stuff with the mobility tools it gave you, and there's nothing more fun than jumping massive distances between rocks in the sky. It felt a little short and honestly about a quarter of the game was spent retrying a jump because it was hard or it wasn't obvious how to cross it, but even that wasn't too frustrating.
 As for the story, it's engaging enough. It's got that classic Harry Potter book 1 feel, where you're chucked in and get to explore a weird world you didn't know existed.
 Overall, worth playing. You'll like it if you like platforming, colorful and inventive locations and abilities, or escapism. You probably won't like it if you want more characters and story, fast-paced action, multiplayer, or a longer playthrough.
 7/10 - Entertaining."
971,"the hand game, very cool yes, short but cool yes"
972,"Loved it, the story is actually really nice and the last level is literally so hard. Nice challenge. The game is around 3 hours long to beat i'd say. HAVE FUN :))
"
973,"Weird, short and oddly compelling. It helps that the core gameplay is a lot of fun, with satisfying flow."
974,"Short little game that is very well done. Platforming is very well done. And nothing overstays its welcome. Worth a go, with enough skills a normal playthrough is just a couple hours, and you end up satisfied."
975,Cool game
976,"A Story About My Uncle is somewhat of a platformer where you are using a power suit to grapple and super jump your way through multiple areas within the game. The game itself has a linear path with small branching dead ends that could give you a little more story insight to the world by interacting with objects your uncle has left behind. Despite being linear with little to no exploration, A Story About My Uncle has some great locations and set pieces.

It does have some problems, though. One is that the game is incredibly short; a 2-3 hour experience for $15 with little replay-ability. There are collectibles in the game as well as time trials and if you are truly starved for more, there are achievements for perfect runs and optimized grappling runs as well, however i wouldn't necessarily put achievements in the 'more content' category.

Though i did enjoy the game, its rather one note and quite hard for me to give a pass. Just know what you are getting into before you decide to purchase."

The game is rather short, but nevertheless very sweet. The ending especially is satisfying and also an open one. Truly worth the couple of euros you'd otherwise spend at a fast food restaurant."
984,"I somehow got this game for free a few months back but it's worth a buy at full price. This game implements a unique platforming mechanic which was not found in any other 3D platformers I've played previously. It's the only 3D platformer games that made me feel more comfortable with a mouse and a keyboard. 

The grappling mechanic felt a bit frustrating at times, but for the most part it was okay. What I like the most about this game is it's unique mechanics, as well as the graphics which is quite decent if we refer to the date when this game was released."
985,"Maddie
Where are you ?"
986,"Short, but interesting story, combined with challanging mechanic, but enough checkpoints, to not be too frustrated, when you fail to jump and graple multiple times in a row."
987,Pleasant adventure with different game mechanics which never let you get bored. A nice game if you want a relaxing evening.
988,Great
989,"Fun platforming game, however way too short."
990,"Really fun, but short grappling game."
991,"It's simple and very short, but it's fun for what it is. It plays a little like Portal (if you've played that game by Valve) in that you use devices to navigate spatial puzzles. Physics and momentum play a part in the navigation. 

I played this with KB/Mouse and with a steam controller and I recommend playing with the KB/Mouse. The controller works, but the ""Look"" movements have to be so quick and precise that it's hard to enjoy on a controller."
992,"Amazing game reminded me of my uncle , he also went to the land of blue people and commited many crimes on his own kin 10/10 would chase my uncle down again."
993,"has a very cute story to it with some laid back/tricky gameplay towards the end, honestly this is certainly worth the money for something to pass the time with, it's also great if you have a laptop because it's not a very demanding game. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did"
994,"Um √≥timo jogo, pena que √© meio curto."
995,small sweet fast game
996,"Short and fun. Doesn't wear out its welcome (though it comes close in the final third). Voice acting is a mixed bag, but it's really the gameplay pulling you forward and not the story, so not a big deal."
997,underrated game and brings you a pleasure to play it:)
998,"Immersive atmosphere, interesting narrative, and fun mechanics. It is a meditative, calming yet challenging journey - and even if it doesn't last that long, it's definitely a journey you'll appreciate experiencing."
999,Love this game. have played it 2 times in a row
1000,Repetitive playthroughs'
1001,"I got this game during the ""giveaway"" and i said to myself, mehhh whyy nottt and i did not regret it, and i think its very well worth the price :)"
1002,<3
1003,yes
1004,It's a challenging but a very chill game. Definitely worth checking out.
1005,:(
1006,"-a well thought, designed game
-it's a storytelling game with cool physics movement (jumping and flying around)
-for a casual players or you just wanna have fun and chill
-the only downside of it is a short game"
1007,cute
1008,"Loved it, the story is actually really nice and the last level is literally so hard. Nice challenge. The game is around 3 hours long to beat i'd say. HAVE FUN :))"
1009,"Has an interesting concept, good level design and the movement feels smooth. The story isn't too obnoxious either.

But... It is reeeeally short and repeat playthroughs are actively not encouraged with sections that take away your movement options for dialogue. I wouldn't care if it had a lower asking price but at $15, I just can't recommend this. I'd wait for a sale."
1010,Parkour boy go brrrrr
1011,"[b]+ Grapple mechanics:[/b] Grappling around the world is fun, but there are around three things you can do: grapple, use a jet while in air and refill grapple stacks using some crystals.

[b]- Voice acting:[/b] Main voice actor is so bad, it's laughable.
[b]- Story:[/b] The story is almost nonexistent, you just search for your uncle through some caves.
[b]- Too short:[/b] The game takes 2 hours to complete. If it had some story it might be okay, but since it's mostly just jumping around it just means the developers ran out of gameplay ideas.
[b]- Level design:[/b] There are a couple of sections in the game where you jump from one small island to the other and it usually involves spinning around some columns of rock. Do this fast enough and you might end up forgetting where you're supposed to go, because all islands look exactly the same.

[b]Rating: 2/10[/b]"
1012,"So I got this back in 2014 and forgot to leave a review.

But I'll say this much I found the story engaging and kept me guessing and the game play is smooth, if you like games like 
Mirrors Edge then you should love this.

The game play it's self have some puzzles but mostly platforming where you feel like your hauling ass threw levels when you get your momentum built up which doesn't take much."
1013,"fun and simple, relatively short. You get a grappling hook and big jumpy powers to navigate some pretty levels. Achievements are quite tough, though"
1014,"I'm hesitant to recommend this game because you should only buy it on a sale where it is $5 or under. Besides the price point, it's a fun little game with a story that's decent enough to keep you interested. The mechanics are very satisfying to me although I've seen other reviews talking about how they didn't like them."
1015,incested frog people
1016,Good but a bit to short for 12‚Ç¨
1017,Great Game !
1018,"Frustrating game but challenging with a village of amphibians and you have powers of Spiderman and Ironman.
I just died 174 times."
1019,"I did not play 14 hours of this. I have no idea who did.

It's a pretty boring parkour game, and you could be playing way better games in the same style. Try SEUM or Cyber Hook to see how a movement centric game should feel like. If you are looking for story and style, go for Mirror's Edge."
1020,"good game, i still got 0 achievements"
1021,"fun game
"
1022,My favorite game out of the ones that I didn't grow up with
1023,A great game with a great story. Would recommend.
1024,"I googled that leafy grappling game and brought me here. Always wanted to try it... Didn't even expect a story so not reviewing that, came here for the mechanics and it's a very chill game, 3 hours well spent, 100% would play again."
1025,"Good game, decent, short, would recommend, but not strongly.

decent gameplay

alright story, nothing to write home about"
1026,"Fun game, very hard platforming!   My daughter loved watching me play it.  If you enjoy a challenge, this game is for you!"
1027,a pretty fun game to play while listening a podcast or watching a show. fun gameplay & cool graphics
1028,wholesome game
1029,fun
1030,It was cute. I loved it.
1031,Really fun parkour game with an interesting story. It's a little difficult from time to time but all in all a good game.
1032,"The game is fine, played it a little"
1033,pretty good game if u listen to the story
1034,Pretty funny platformer with nice story
1035,"It's tough to rate this for me. 
I mostly liked the game (except for the last third aka ice cave). 
The mechanics themselves are really fun but they suffer from floaty controls. 
It was also often hard to tell what I could grapple to and where I was supposed to go. 
I was disoriented and clueless quite often. 
I wouldn't get it for the full price (12,50‚Ç¨ as of writing this), but I would recommend you playing it, if you like first-person jump and run games and can get it in a bundle or for like 5 bucks. 

Had some really enjoyable moments, but it was quite middling overall for me."
1036,hhhihh
1037,"If you can get it on sale, do. While this is not a $15 game. It is a very good game. It's short, but I played it years back and it was one of the most memorable experience I've had while gaming. The gameplay is simply yet fun, the characters are likable, and the graphics look great. Pick it up on sale when you have a chance."
1038,cool
1039,"This game was very well made I had a blast playing!

Very short I don't think I would have spent $15 on it. Buy it on sale."
1040,"I could play this game and I must say there was emotions and I love it... I was sad at the point where I had to leave Maddie, because she was like a nice friend. Thanks I could get this game for free and I don't regret it for playing this game.

"
1041,"This is a great parkour game, with a very interesting lore! I did not finish the game yet, but I already recomand it!"
1042,great story and gameplay
1043,"I'd give this neutral if I could.
It's good, kid-friendly fun, difficult in very brief moments (but once you figure it out it's pretty easy again)- and that's about it.

For the simplicity, style and length of this game- I feel it's key focuses should be on ART, STORY and GAMEPLAY

[b] Gameplay [/b] 6.5/10

It's fun, and basic, and for the length of the game, it is [i] good enough. [/i]

I would say that's all there is for that, it's some running, jumping, grappling. You gradually get all the upgrades in probably the first hour or so, which is fine. But the game starts to play with your limitations (like increasing how many times you can grapple by hitting crystals) or by de-activating a power ( [spoiler] your rocket boots get damaged at one point [/spoiler] ), but the introduction of these seem really just thrown in at the end to increase the challenge for like... 10 minutes overall in the last half hour? But- it's a short game- keep this in mind.

[b] Art [/b] 6/10

The art style is quite lovely, each act/chapter has a different style, though it kind of seems like they had a 5 minute brainstorming session of ""what kind of themes should we do?"" and picked 3.
and the character modelling is a bit unique but stylised, it fits the rest well.

The voice acting is really meh for the most part, the voice for Maddie is pretty good but every other voice is just one step from being read from the script in front of them, but I feel that this could be due to a small team and a lot of non-English speakers perhaps.

Animation in some places is hit and miss.

[b] Story [/b] 3/10

The story is definitely kid friendly/kid-oriented, and a bit... cheap - very basic and sort of goes nowhere, and when you think it's going to, it still doesn't. Story goes as such... [spoiler] Narrator is main character/you telling a story of when you were younger, blahblahblah eccentric scientist uncle missing, strange suit, teleporter, teleporter takes you to strange place  [/spoiler] and then [spoiler] gotta find uncle! frog people, crystals make suit good, go here, go there, 2 hours pass [/spoiler] and finally you [spoiler] Found uncle! Uncle says ""I'mma stay here, you go"", use his one-way makeshift portal, end game [/spoiler]. I know that spoiler covered story is a bit short, but that last bit really is how the last bit goes more or less. No development, no closure. It's short, but there's no end really, which is a great shame.

Like I said, I'd give it neutral, I feel where it lacks, there's good enough reason.
Is it worth ¬£11.39, probably not, but small dev teams gotta eat so you do you... pretty sure I got it from a Humble Bundle or something idk

Where it's really lacking is it just seems like there were lots of ideas that maybe if they were fleshed out it would make the game so much better- but this is a student made game essentially so it's kind of fair enough.

I definitely didn't feel the need afterward to finish the achievements."
1044,"This is an excellent game, and I highly recommend it! It's a fun parkour style play through with neat environments and a decent little story to go along with it. I will likely play it again at some point. :)"
1045,"good game
"
1046,"A truly amazing game. I enjoyed vaulting myself from platform to platform. The game has a really great atmosphere. 

It's not the longest game but definitely worth playing. Good story & music."
1047,this game is some doodoo poopoo fart shiii some actual ass some real garbo
1048,reminds of those 2016 YouTube commentators' background gameplay lol.
1049,"epic
"
1050,Very good story (about the uncle).
1051,"Good game, baaad story. Predictable ending and no tension or surprises. 4/5"
1052,my uncle molested me when i was 6
1053,good game
1054,"I was struck by the aesthetic beauty of this game right from the start, though the grandeur of it ebbs and flows depending on the environment. Certain environments are downright mind blowing!

Overall, it starts slow, but the poignancy of the story grows and grows. I'm continually struck how I play this on an HP EliteDesk which is a decent computer, but by no means a gaming rig however, this game plays beautifully and fluidly.

I'm also struck how my favorite 3D platformers are all first person, such as the Mirror's Edge series and this game, more recently. I'm playing this game with a controller, though my weapon of choice is definitely a keyboard and mouse. The game plays well with a controller, I think I would probably be a more competent player with a keyboard and mouse, but I use those all day, so a controller is nice for a change.

As far as mechanics, it's a nice balance of freedom and boundaries. Some aspects take a bit to get used to, since, the giant jumps and grappling hook are very unusual elements for a first person perspective game. Which reminds me of a good example of this balance: there is no falling damage, so you can fall as long as you want as long as you hit some visible ground, however, falling into the mist or darkness is the main cause for going back to a last checkpoint (and this does happen often!) But one issue with no falling damage is that unless it is a square hit onto the ground, you might bounce of a rock and careen into the abyss in spite of hitting the ground. The whole ""glancing off rock"" deal happens a lot with the floating rocks that you use to grapple, and it takes a bit of practice, but after a while, you can learn to be deflected in your desired direction. I really like all of the mechanics I've just mentioned, but I will say that learning the best times to let go of grappled targets is immensely tricky and bouncing off of a rock I've grabbed and plummeting into the depths is not a fun mistake.

The narrative of this game is a father telling a story to his daughter, which is such a wholesome, creative method of delivery. The game has been very wholesome (not without scary parts, for sure) but it seems like a very healthy way to engage say, an elementary child, on these fundamental fears we all deal with: the dark, monsters, falling, rejection, saying goodbye. This game is absolutely unparalleled by any other games I've played in that regard! I think a great comparison here is how one ""fails"" in this game versus Mirror's Edge. In this game, it's like falling in a dream, you just kind of fall and either you wake up, or the dream continues. In Mirror's Edge, you get to hear what it would sound like as many of your bones snap right before your brain sustains too much trauma to continue functioning. I think both games are wonderful, but geared towards different audiences, heh.

This game is worth the time, even just to *see* some of the levels.. For parent's this is a great game to start discussions about some primal fears in the human brain (if you're into that sort of thing)

Cheers!

1056,Muy lindo juego para pas√°rtelo en una tarde. Entretenida la jugabilidad pero hasta donde dura. 7.5/10

1060,amazing
1061,"story, movement, bhop
nice"
1062,"Works great on Linux. I think I played it before the remake. Both times the setting was absorbing, the first version had better story AFAIR. The story is simple, btw. The achievements quite the contrary. ;) I think ""apostata"" is rather weird Polish translation of ""stray""."
1063,I had an uncle?
1064,"This is not a peaceful adventure, I leaned my self forward in the chair too many times.

Great game."
1065,its good

1068,It's bad
1069,i like but i cannot live a perfect life knowing that somebody probably wants to do maddie
1070,Loved every second of it.
1071,"This is one of those games that has a nice atmosphere to it.

A feel good game.

Short but sweet.

The mechanics of moving from place to place with the hook work well and landing the jump gives you a sense of achievement.

Played it through in one go, from start to end - just couldn't put it down.

Not many games keep my interest, but this did.

Recommended to all."
1072,"The movement mechanic of the grapple is a neat gimmick, using it feels nice while platforming, other than that  the world is nice, the story is pretty much bland and the character design is decent/mediocre, that and the fact that it only is like 5 hrs long makes me recommend it but on sale only."
1073,can we PLEASE get this game in vr. it would be surreal
1074,very well made game buy it
1075,pretty good casual short story game
1076,"Amazing story about an uncle and his nephew, even though short, a beautiful game who implements different ways to parkour. Brilliant."

1079,yes
1080,"very fun game, the story took me about 2 hours to beat my first time, now im doing speedruns on this game, really fun and i highly recommend it!"
1081,nice puzzle game and great story line. its kinda short but its enough for me.
1082,Is good.
1083,"This game is old, but its amazing, they need to make a second tbh"
1084,"the best singleplayer story rich game for its money 
and the story of the game is good"
1085,"I really wanted to like this game, but all in all it felt underwhelming, like a half-baked project that didn't know what it wanted to be. Not enough story and depth to feel like a narrative-driven game, not enough tricks or platforming variety to feel like a good platformer, it kind of fell short in both regards. I still give it a very tentative recommend because at times it was nice and the overall plot is sweet, but I'd recommend to get it with a big discount and not expect too much from it.

PROS:
- Story in a story: a man is telling his daughter a bed-time story about an adventure he had as a young boy looking for his uncle in a mysterious world. Simple, but touching at times.
- A couple of sweet characters
- At least one really beautiful level
- Good voice acting

CONS:
- Pacing is awful. Levels are very long with only platforming and too few narrative breaks in between. Countless times I thought I was close to finishing the level, but realized there's still a huge section to go through. While you're platforming, in most cases there's nothing to look at, no environmental storytelling, no story bits and not even any memorable music. Feels like repetitive platforming in a void - really boring.
- Honestly, I hated the couple of levels at the beginning that are mostly set in the dark. Boring and underwhelming. I get that it was supposed to be in contrast with one later level, but still.
- Except for one side-character, the in-game race of frog people doesn't have any personality to them. They're basically just part of the scenery.
- In the second half of the game there's a sudden difficulty spike that makes the experience quite frustrating.
- Towards the end the level design is a bit off, it's often not really clear where I'm supposed to go, what to grapple towards etc.
- World-building is wonky, many things seem to be just thrown into the story for the sake of it, without any logical explanation or connection to the overall narrative. It works for some stories, but it's not the case here."
1086,Muito bom!
1087,"A Story About My Uncle is ironically enough less about the basic story and more about the parkour. The graphics, scenery and atmosphere are beautiful and the gameplay is fun enough to keep you playing, but not as intense as some might expect. It's a great game to play while listening to or watching something. For whatever reason I felt attached to a particular character you meet mid-game which saved the rest of the story for me as it was just.. Basic? Too basic for a game that only offers one type of gameplay. It's definitely not worth the 15$ so buy it on a deep sale."
1088,"Oyun dinamikleri g√ºzel, ama √ßok gereksiz derecede uzatmƒ±≈ülar ve zorla≈ütƒ±rmƒ±≈ülar. Ayrƒ±ca hikayesi g√ºzel ilerlerken bir anda √ßok hƒ±zlƒ± ve duygusuzca bitiyor."
1089,god i love my uncle
1090,Fire af
1091,good game
1092,I bought this game because of some commentary youtuber that played it all the time. Good game
1093,love this game
1094,That one kid's challenge and their annoying voice broke me
1095,"This is more like A Story About My Ankle considering the amount of times I fell due to the odd feeling with the gravity and grappling method. Interesting how most of the achievements are given for not falling tho.
Must admit, been a little bored after a short time due to no variations on the theme or story bits to give me an idea of tasks to accompany me. Still a good game to play, jumping around is satisfying, requiring the best from dexterity, speed and trajectory calculation. Graphics and sounds are good, the colorful and dark locations are nicely mixed up. Controls are responsive enough."
1096,A very short first-person platformer that I hope will inspire some great new games for us to enjoy.
1097,"What a lovely game
gave me a wholesome feeling !"
1098,"pretty good game and a good story..
definitely recommended to try"
1099,"I think this is the best game that I ever played with. It has a great storry, awesome movement and level design, the game is just beautiful. Sometimes it is a little unclear where the path continues, but other than that this game is a must play, unles you don't like platforming games."
1100,he touches you
1101,"Well, it has a nice story and it's gameplay is challenging"
1102,"Simple game with an emersive story, if u haven't played it, youre missing out on a real gem."
1103,fajne
1104,"decent little game. Not much replayability unfortunately, and not very hard platforming. It felt like the game's difficulty never ramped up, and there was really no climax. One could argue that that's how it made the game feel like it was a journey you were actually on, and not just a game you were playing, but it's a lame excuse to not ramp the difficulty up. I still had fun. The colors and ambiance seemed to be a big focus of the game and it did that extremely well"
1105,"A lot of fun and some serious frustration, Great if you have good reflexes. Would love this suit in the real world. Can't comment on the ending as I don't think I'm anywhere near it yet.

Edit. The ice caves, if you have zero patience and slow reflexes, I would not recommend this game for you.

Also lack of story means there is very little to spur you on, except your own determination to mot let this game beat you. I may be in the, this game beat me category :-(

Mostly I play this on a day off work, in between doing other boring house stuff, 15 minutes here, 10 minutes there.

Never thought I'd say this, but walking or running would make a nice change of pace.

3rd edit, stuck in  a cave for 3 hours, falling blocks. Nope, can no longer recommend this game. Not all of us have cat reflexes, so this is now looking like a waste of money as I can't progress any further."
1106,I Don't Wanna Talk About Uncle
1107,A Good game to get lost in. Simple details and easy game play allow for immersion into the atmosphere and story.
1108,
1109,Money well spent
1110,"good story, gameplay. well made"
1111,"man, I got bored."
1112,good game for a Friday night. I played it only for like 3 hours or so because it¬¥s very short. It¬¥s something you need in your steam library.
1113,"short game but it very endearing, it definitely sticks with you and you should get it."
1114,A short but very immersive story and game. It took me 3 hours finish the game.
1115,the original developer who made this game before he sold the rights was from my town we buried him today he was only 23 this is all i have of him left he was my dear friend and brother thanks for finishing the game fully.
1116,tis good boss
1117,"i like the game 
"
1118,"Fun platformer, pretty short and basic though"
1119,"story 
puzzles
parkour
just yessss"

1122,blue man group the game
1123,it‚Äôs alright ig
1124,"Fun, sweet game. Can be frustrating at times."
1125,A beautiful experience unlike anything else i have found. Definitely recommend.
1126,"A game with very fun mechanics, at a price. The game will often interrupt your high-speed spiderman jumper and force you to stand around while a bunch of NPCs exposit at you. Replaying this game can be a total chore."
1127,"The biggest adventure is happening right now - Our live while playing this beautiful (but short) work of art. Undoubtedly you need to check it out and enjoy little moments while searching uncle Fred. I strongly recommend ""A Story About My Uncle"""
1128,"I beat the game and I honestly didn't really enjoy my time with it. It's short and not super memorable. The story was a hamfisted ""old people bad no like progress"" yarn and the game play, while fun at first, really got bland. The mechanics are sound, but after a bit there's not much more you can do with them since it's all tether-based. I finished it purely just to finish it, and I can't recommend it to anyone."
1129,It's a beautiful game that I enjoyed a lot. Traversing the game was fun and not overly complicated. Controlling the character was nice. The story was endearing and I even shed some tears here and there. I last played it 4 years ago and it's still in my mind as one of the best games I played

1140,"A simple game with a simple story, really great and solid mechanics, the collectibles are kind of hard to find but it's great to go back and look for them, the limited grapple achievements are kind of hard but they are definitly doable. An all-arround great game for its price"
1141,"Short but good game with beautiful scenery.

Try it if you like parkour games. Very cheap on sale."
1142,A somewhat short narrative based platformer. Very nicely implemented concept.

1156,"An absolute gem. A small master piece. The storytelling, the game play, the fantasy world were all tied together in a very beautiful and somehow haunting manner. This kind of game feels good to play from the perspective of a father with very little time to myself. I was able to chop this game down in small pieces over a weeks time and still enjoy it a lot ^_^"

1158,"The game is pretty nice, actually, i think it's worth buying if it is on sale. And i don't recommend trying to get all the achievements done, you need the tricks to be good at the time trials"
1159,"Overstayed its welcome, despite its very short length. Your enjoyment will depend greatly on your patience for its central floaty-jumpy platforming mechanic. Some may like it. I found it tedious and hugely frustrating. Think I'll have to go and watch a Let's Play to find out what this very moving ending is that people are talking about."
1160,Is gud
1161,great game
1162,"One of my all time favourite games. Only problem is that it is very short. Grab it while it is on sale, and make sure to play with headphones"
1163,"besides csgo surf, this was THE game for mediocre commentators from 2016-2017 would always use in the background"
1164,"A short but wonderful experience, a nice story about finding your adventure while exploring through a visually pleasing world. Can definitely recommend."
1165,it good
1166,It's a really fun little game
1167,"This is an awesome game! Maybe not worth the base price since it's only 2 hours, but those are 2 hours of full enjoyment. All in all, buy it, it's really cozy and wholesome with lots of fun!!
4/5"
1168,I pissed myself 3 times while playing this but its cool

"
1170,i cried on the end but dont tell that to anyone
1171,"A Story About My Uncle is a game which combines storytelling in a mystical land in the search of ""Uncle"" with parkour, levitation, running and a lot of jumping. While the mechanics are balanced and the gameplay is pretty fun and bouncy, the story felt rushed and sometimes unengaging despite the game's length. I expected more dynamics, interactions and fights when I tuned in this game, but I was wrong. Overall, I think it is a fine parkour game with colourful textures, but even so, it lacks in storytelling and action beside the parkour and the jumping."
1172,"Good game, very good!"
1173,player models are nightmare fuel
1174,"GOOD

1175,"Banging game, good story and calming to play"
1176,A Short Story About My Uncle
1177,"Lovely little game. Core gameplay is fun, although can be mildly frustrating at times. Lovely art direction, lovely style, although the graphics do look like from another time, long ago."
1178,"Good game to kill some time, the end was quite good."
1179,I played through this once to simply pass the time and I can safely say that this was a beautifully made game with astounding environment design. The simple story that the game has just makes it that much sweeter and more charming and I couldn't have asked for anything more.

1181,"One of the best indie games ever. Played it for the first time when i was 10, now i am 15 and i still can't resist going back to this game and playing it over and over again."
1182,This game was something else it is just marvelous
1183,"While pretty to look at at first, it gets repetitive REALLY quickly. Backtracking is annoying and having to wait for timed jumps is absolute dogshit. This game makes me mad. proper mad."
1184,"What if Black Mesa made Xen chapter, but actually good?

But seriously: Nice little game, hard to hate on it but I found the platforming aggravating after a while (which runs contrary to the beautiful and relaxing setting unfortunately.
Most of the time it worked, but at times I'm clicking the 'grapple button' and nothing happens, even though the sound effect plays, then I fall to my death.
Getting back into the action is ok, but occasionally save points are spread out a bit and having to wait, and wait for the character to fall seems too annoying.
for example: sometimes missing a jump can have you back on the ledge in 2 seconds, other times it's 5-6 seconds, and if you fail a jump 5 times in a row, it gets REALLY annoying.

So why am I recommending it? It's cheap, nice story, good setting, everything is a great score and when the gameplay works, it works well.  When the above situations happen, it just wore me down to the point I could only play 20 mins at a time  and didn't even bother finishing it (think I was only 20 mins from the end, but I just lost all motivation to continue).

If you like to try 'nice' platformers then this is worth your time, glad I tried it."
1185,"Eh, the game is okay. The story is kind of interesting and the level design is pretty but nothing to write home about. A decent amount of the platforming is fun but for the most part I found it a bit tedious. It doesn't help that the controls themselves are quite unforgiving; if you should happen to just slightly misaim your swing and hit a wall by accident, you are virtually guaranteed to fall into the abyss. The game was also quite short; I've completed it in about 4 hours.

All in all I would still rate this game positively, but wait for it to go on sale...a steep sale."
1186,Fun gameplay and a heartwarming story
1187,"Great game, great voice acting and great atmosphere. Story is simple and short, and characters are good. Give it a try at least once."
1188,"This game does not have tight controls nor does it feel responsive. Overall not a fun game and nothing in the game made me want to keep playing it. I wasn't interested in the world or the story, all I was interested in was the platforming and it fails for me. If you get it for free maybe check the game out but otherwise its not worth buying at all."
1189,"This an amazing game, worth every dollar.
It's like a movie you take part in as the main character"
1190,"Ok so i was not expecting a platformer to have this much story and depth. The story is amazing, graphics are good, it is a good challenge which i like and it really makes you think. Might Replay it for a you-tube play through. Would highly recommend it. especially when its on sale."
1191,good
1192,Really amazing advanture game
1193,"Got it a while ago when it was free, still boring and confusing on what your supposed to do in the first levels. The movement looks unique and cool in the trailers but in reality its just frustrating, I cant count how many times ive smacked into walls because the grapple hook didnt do anything."
1194,"Short but good, and pretty freaking beautiful."
1195,"leafy
"
1196,"Very fun. I love the movement in this game. It's short but its incredibble and really fun to play

1199,Beautiful story! hope there will be a party 2 or another game like this. Its fun and doesn't take that long to complete the storyline. Perfect when you are bored and want to play a good story game!
1200,A little overpriced at full price but PLEASE buy this game when it goes on sale. This is legitimately the best short game I've ever played.
1201,Short (3-4h). Gameplay is all about movement and it's made okay. Story is nice. As a whole it was fun experience.

1203,A super game. Very funny and interesting. The story is so cool but is short. It would be better with an online mode.

1205,"If you have a headache, and still feel the need to play a video game. This is a great mind relaxer. Soft and quiet environments, as you gently progress your way through beautiful landscapes with a gentle laser grapple. This is a very short game. but it's fun to speed run if you're looking for a challenge. 10/10 I'd say it's a perfect game."
1206,"Boring. All you do in this game is jumping from rock to rock. Sometimes some gimmick is introduced, but it's not enough to make it interesting. Also unskippable sections where you just stand and listen to frog people talk, without any thing to do, do not help."

1220,not bad
1221,This game was a delight.  The controls were solid.  The level design was pretty darn good.  Just play it.

A Story About My Uncle is an amazingly smooth and beautiful puzzle game. You follow a breadcrumb trail to find your Uncle, Fred, through magical floating islands. This journey looks gorgeous, and the path is clear most of the time. The characters are likeable, but kinda shallow. This whole adventure is wrapped up in a frame story where you are telling your daughter a bedtime story. It‚Äôs honestly pretty cute, and there are a lot of small details like when you close the game, you hear, ‚ÄúI think thats enough for one night‚Äù
[/quote]
[quote]
I had a few issues with this game though. About half way through the game, you get a pair of rocket boots that gives you a boost mid air. Most of the jumps don't require a boost, and I ended up using it as a crutch 90% of the time. I think that this should‚Äôve been given to you in the beginning of the game, and then taken away halfway through. This would help players just learning the system, and add a layer of challenge to the latter half. Also, I found myself getting caught on the geometry of the last level.

[quote]
Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a very good game which is very relaxing, challenging and very interesting.
The music, the effects and the overall vibe while playing this game is outstanding.
I know this game from LeafyIsHere or something, on YouTube, not sure where he is now though.

About the price, i suggest waiting for a sale. Game's pretty short but highly worth it but not for the full price in my opinion.

1223,"Boring, barethread story. Bad controls.Good art though."
1224,"A Story About My Uncle (ASAMU) is a very fun semi-platformer game. You grapplehook your way through different levels, I imagine that this game is the closest you will get to flying through the jungle like Tarzan does. Its asmosphere somehow makes me think of Subnautica, even though the gameplay is not similar at all. I highly recommend ASAMU if you can get it for a reasonable price, it will last you about 5 hours."

1238,"Good story and plot

1239,Great Relaxing Game
1240,"A short but sweet first person puzzle platformer. In terms of gameplay the only thing I can liken it to is probably Portal, but only in the sense that it requires you to take advantage of momentum to do huge leaps. The grapple described in the store description is a really cool gameplay mechanic, and there are always new variables being introduced to keep the gameplay consistently fresh.

The story is of the type you might find in a childrens' fantasy novel, and the voice acting is what I'd describe as serviceable, not amazing but not bad enough to distract (this is an indie game). Finally, while not truly amazing graphically, it has a clean look to it and the level designs are pretty phenomenal, with a huge sense of scale and verticality to every level. I'm genuinely surprised it was the Goat Sim devs that made this, and I really wish they'd do something else in this vein. There's clearly a lot of untapped creativity at that studio, but if the meme games bring in more money I can hardly blame them."
1241,This game is stupid. The controls are bad.

1248,"This game is great!!! It has great level design and a very fun parkour elements! I would totally recommend this to anyone!!
"
1249,"Best motion sickness inducing game I've played that isn't VR

This game excels at what it set out to do, and provides a lovely narrative with solid writing and a good ending. Good voice acting carries the theme of being an interactive bedtime story, and is generally one of the most pleasant games I've played in terms of tone. 
That being said, I really don't like platforming in 1st person. It's why I never got Ghostrunner. If I'm leaping between platforms, lemme see where my character's feet are, lemme see my hitbox, lemme know what I can do to make that jump before I leap."

1254,"A Quick Review
Rating (1-10): 9
Hours played: 39

The games main flaw is its limit game-play with a full play through only taking a couple hours with a slow introduction. Once you get into the flow they add more and more movement options to keep you interested as you play,making the story progression all the more interesting waiting to see what your next power-up will be. The Story itself isn't mind blowing but certainly keeps you entertained when you're not swinging from rock to rock. While the game itself is limited in expansion there are a few extra challenges and Easter eggs along the way that are fun for those who want more."
1255,the game was really fun but its 2 short and u finish it within 2 and a half hours so its not really worth the price

1265,"For as short as a game this was, this was a pretty nice experience, the graphics are nice, the story was interesting and somewhat entertaining. The only thing I might say that is a problem is the price tag is a bit high as the game is only like 2 hours give or take, but if you see it on sale I can give it a recommend."

1273,"T√≠pico juego de alguien a quien se le ocurre una mec√°nica ""novedosa"" y la tiene que explotar a como de lugar, sin importar la jugabilidad del resultado final. Un compendio de casi todo lo que se debe evitar al dise√±ar un videojuego.
El argumento existe porque seg√∫n parece hay que meterlo. Aunque sea con calzador y con unos personajes tot√°lmente as√©pticos y, en general, sin ning√∫n sentido.
Los controles, como se puede esperar de la mec√°nica usada para los desplazamientos, complicados. Cabe se√±alar que la combinaci√≥n de teclas no est√° en s√≠ misma mal implementada, aunque se agradecer√≠a haber contado con algunas asistencias visuales para el apuntado o la informaci√≥n de la distancia de los pedruscos donde tendremos que engancharnos para cruzar.
Los escenarios imposibles hasta que no lo has intentado una docena de veces. Propiciado por el hecho de que la mayor√≠a de las plataformas u objetos para engancharnos no los podremos ver hasta que no estemos ya encima de ellos. Es decir, hay que tirar para adelante sin pensar por que no nos podremos hacer una idea previa de por donde hay que ir ni lo que vamos a encontrar ya que, directamente, no lo veremos desde donde comenzamos. Por otra parte, las plataformas ""v√°lidas"" son estrictamente las que el desarrollador ha decidido. Si intentamos descansar en lo alto de una monta√±a, por ejemplo, que no est√© previsto de antemano, simplemente nos escurriremos hasta dar con nuestros huesos en el suelo.
El sistema de encontrar objetos coleccionables, de nuevo encajado a presi√≥n, ya que como he comentado en el p√°rrafo anterior, la exploraci√≥n es imposible ya que nos caeremos de cualquier sitio que no est√© habilitado al efecto y sin previo aviso. Y dichos objetos no est√°n precisamente en lugares accesibles.
Menci√≥n especial a la orientaci√≥n, en la que parece que el dise√±ador ha volcado todos sus esfuerzos para hacernos a√∫n m√°s complicada la existencia. Prep√°rate a encontrarte cara a cara con la desesperaci√≥n de no saber para donde tirar entre tanta piedra similar sin ninguna pista salvo en contadas ocasiones.
Mi intenci√≥n original, como en el resto de juegos que pasan por mis manos, era terminarlo antes de dar una opini√≥n. Pero he de admitir que, tras cinco horas, ha podido conmigo (creo que puedo contar con los dedos de la mano los videjouegos que lo han conseguido)

Solo recomendable si te mola el rollo sado.

"
1274,amazing and relaxing
1275,Beautiful atmosphere. Fun platformer.
1276,"A Story About My Uncle isn't a bad game. It's just... underwhelming.
The graphics are fine, but the character models are a bit jarring, and definitely break the immersion.
The story feels like an afterthought. The beginning half hour or so makes it seem so exciting, but the rest of the game ultimately fails to deliver.
The gameplay is a mixed bag. When it flows, it's fun. But the difficulty is all over the place, and the level design is often flawed.

To me, A Story About My Uncle seems like it's trying too hard to be something it's not. It wants to be a sensational game that leaves a mark, and falls short of that. There's certainly worse games out there, but for me it didn't quite reach the standard set by its glowing reviews."
1277,Game play is just the right amount of challenging so that you can enjoy the story and characters. There's a feeling of nostalgia built into it for the story that makes it feel good to replay.
1278,"Finding it a little hard to describe the experience. It is not a bad adventure, with a light-hearted journey into a fantasy world. The jumps can get a little repetitive at times. If you have time, then go ahead for a this unique experience. But do grab this in a sale as I do not think it is worth the full price.

6/10 Could do with a better story line, but still a fun puzzle platformer."
1279,"One of the few games that I've considered trying to speedrun now that I've played through the story once. When you know what you're doing, the controls are fluid, and it feels good when you're moving quickly and effortlessly through the level. The story is also pretty good, and it's a chill game overall; although, I was annoyed more than I probably should've been by Maddie."
1280,good
1281,"A lovely little game (about 3 hours long) about frog people, grappling hooks and your uncle."
1282,"This game is worth every penny. When you're bored alone, what's better than going on a beautiful, natureful journey through a first person platformer game. Very meaningful story behind it too"
1283,nice story

1285,"Honestly, one of the best games I've played in a long time. The ending put a smile on my face and even though there wasn't story after step of the way, I was still intrigued on what obstacle I would have to face next and what I might find around the corner. 10/10"

1287,swag
1288,"I gave an honest effort to this game, and I wanted to like it, but I could not enjoy it at all. It's a walking sim, but with a lackluster story and repetitive visuals, I didn't feel there was much worth exploring in the game. The level designs are tedious at times, excruciatingly frustrating at others. The controls made the game borderline unplayable, and with no way to remap buttons, I was stuck using my mouse and keyboard. This was an aggravating game with little to offer, and I don't see myself ever touching it again."
1289,Gameplay feels nice even if wonky sometimes. The story is completely forgettable
1290,i still miss my uncle
1291,A great game with fun Parkour puzzles but lack of content and shitty writing it does have a sick plot twist that may take awhile to get it
1292,far too short took about 3 hours to complete was just starting to have alot of fun with it. :(
1293,"Not my type of game. Just meaninglessly running in silence and rarely hearing some narrative.
Not worth the time"

1303,"A Story About My Uncle review
Overall score (1-10): 8
Hours played: 32

A Story About My Uncle is a game that I find as a game filled with passion and loved by the developers with its different game mechanics and options can make the experience very customizable depending on how you want to play the game. I would say that this doesn‚Äôt actually fit into a category, it makes its own mix of adventure, 3d platformer, sci-fi and story.

Positives: 
- There are a lot of different options including different languages for you to customize your game
- The game delivers a great story that is easy to follow but not as easy to predict what will happen
- It has a difficulty of normal and you barely find yourself completely stuck, but there are still some challenge (But those are solvable)
- There is a lot to explore and you don‚Äôt always have to follow the main mission
- Great for speed running
- The soundtrack (holy crap)

Negatives: 
- The graphics are not realistic, not pix-elated but it does not give you a ‚Äúwow‚Äù feeling, backgrounds, humans and creatures  
   look very fake
- Very short story, not worth to play a second time unless you are really into the game
- There are some really annoying bugs ‚Äò
- Some not necessary dialogues that you want to skip but you can‚Äôt

Summary and overall feedback:
The game is worth buying unless you are going for an outstanding visual experience, this game fits most of the game styles and is not for a targeted audience. Not necessarily wait for sale, but if you do so it will most likely be up for 3‚Ç¨. I hope this review was helpful and that you‚Äôll have a great day!

"
1304,"Firstly, the game is VERY cheap on sale, and 100% worth the buy. Amazing graphics, especially for when it was made, and new and interesting game mechanics. Character models are questionable, and the game is very short, but if you try to collect achievements the game provides plenty of hours of challenges."
1305,Frustrating and challenging. Its like doing parkour on different worlds. Its funny how you worked hard to pass through the puzzles and obstacles then your uncle sends you home right after lol
1306,"While not a very long game even with the extras such as time trials, ASAMU is a wonderful atmospheric platformer with a great idea for gameplay. It does not overstay its welcome by dragging itself out unnecessarily. The beautiful landscapes and atmosphere also makes for a nice relaxing game."
1307,"I played this game with the mouse but much easier for me personally to move with the controller. The game itself made really quite impressive images of the whole environment very beautiful , and relaxing if you don‚Äôt fall again and again. : D"
1308,Lit
1309,fun game. the story is good so is the gamplay.
1310,HOT
1311,"From its visuals to its music, this game screams and oozes beauty. It has stunning landscapes during each of its levels that just demand you stop a moment and take screenshots. To top it all off, the game has a short and sweet story to accompany it. It's the kind of story you don't get all too often in this medium. The perfect blend of childlike, fantasy, and adventure. It reminds me of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons in that regard. With a tale that instills you with childish glee, but refuses to let itself be silly, and instead has a somewhat somber tone to it. It was beautiful and perfect for the short three hours it took to finish the game.

Yet seeing as it's a video game, we also have to discuss the gameplay, which is a first-person platformer/parkour style game. Although I can't say I recommend the game for the gameplay as it feels floaty and lacks weight to it at times. Not only that, but the game is riddled with bugs, such as getting stuck on a rock and being forced to return to the previous checkpoint (which is nothing more than a minor inconvenience as the game has many checkpoints and is never too difficult). Despite being a platformer, however, I felt it was a bit too linear. That's why I'm willing to venture and say the game is a grapple-simulator. A walking simulator, with the walking being replaced with grappling.

All in all, if you have three hours to spare, and want a heartwarming tale more than anything else, then give this game a shot. It's too gorgeous not to."
1312,Fantastic Good Graphics Story is Great but haven't completed yet
1313,it slaps
1314,"Probably one of my new favorite games, good gameplay and story."
1315,Go on and fly across
1316,first game that gave me motion sickness. gameplay is kinda boring
1317,"thats a game bro , this game has a very good story, the movement's so good , the framerate its high without having a super pc , with a i5 6100 and an gtx 750 the game so smooth , and just don t give up playing this game"
1318,it's quite good for 2 hours game
1319,I have lumbago.
1320,"It's pretty good, achievements are kinda hard though."
1321,"For a platform puzzle game, it sure has janky and unsatisfying platforming.

I got it totally for free, and in that case it was still worth the short time it takes to complete. Don't expect it to hold up any longer than that, however, and it's definitely not worth paying actual money for.."
1322,"This is a fun but short game that you can beat within a few hours if you rush through. However, you can also choose to complete challenges that give you achievements and increase the replayability. Overall the game has great mechanics, but I wouldn't recommend buying it for full price due to the aforementioned short story so snag it while it's only 3 dollars."
1323,A childish game ?Maybe...but it has a beautiful story and places.
1324,"It's a nice game and has a kind of sweet story, but it can be teeth grindingly difficult at times. I'll admit to using the unlimited grapples cheat and the fly cheat."
1325,trippy
1326,.
1327,good uncle

1335,"Pretty sure I got this through humble bundle but no idea... Anyways, the game's great, I'd wait for it to go on sale (15$ USD is a bit much imo, but eh) though as the story's pretty short and there's minimal replayability. There *is* however a good story. For what it is, the story's fantastic, just enough implied events to make you curious and just enough confirmations to let you understand what happened. Very well done, in my opinion. Each level (area with different environmental visuals for this review) is very unique and well made. There's room for speed-running if you're into that, as well as places to get""style-points"" (nothing in game, point  wise, just ""cool-factor""). Voice acting's good overall as well, characters are lovable/believable to a good extent. The world feels lived in, not just existent.
Overal: 7/10.
Cons are nothing major, just; short, no real replayability, and costs too much by default. Definitely wait for a sale, but if you do obtain this game, do play it through. It's a good one!"
1336,"Kisa, tadimlik bir oyun. Oynamasi keyifli, oldukca chill. Herhangi bir kombat yok, sadece tastan tasa atlayip hikayeyi dinliyorsunuz."
1337,"A waste of time and potential. The story has almost no weight to it, and the gameplay is tedious and reptitive. The best part of the game was the easiest, and that was the first quarter of the game. The rest of the game is not worth exploring."

1352,"Such a wonderful game. Absolutely gorgeous in its colour palette, style, and detail. Every environment was truly magnificent, made only possible by the scale necessitated through the mechanics. The technique on showcase here is astounding.

The gameplay itself was rather satisfying! Other than a couple sections that were a little difficult to read direction-wise, I found the signposting surprisingly intuitive! The far-reaching leaps collapsed the space from seemingly-impossible to accessible. The simple control scheme kept this movement relatively easy to master.

I'm not sure what I was expecting story-wise, but it was quite lovely. It's such a charming game and the end almost made me cry, despite it being rather cliche (that's how you know it's told exceptionally).

Quite a wonderful way to close out my Autumn."
1353,"TLDR: The platforming required speed and precision, which makes it infuriatingly difficult with a controller, but genuinely satisfying with a keyboard and mouse. The story is short and high level, but builds a world where there's clearly more going on.

The worlds are colourful and pleasant to be in, with little in the way of interaction with other story characters.

Some criticisms about the difficulty curve and how the game is non-stop platforming puzzles which require you to focus on the platform elements, and not the world you're in, are legitimate.

Overall though, it's enjoyable and a nice way to spend a couple evenings."
1354,Never beat it but it was good to pass the time
1355,‚ô•
1356,OMG U GUYS SHOULD PLAY THIS ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1357,good gam
1358,wonderful short story and fun puzzles throughout. More wholesome version of portal I'd say.
1359,"a white man finds a previously undiscovered indigenous race and civilizes them by giving them garbage so they can build huts

also the gameplay was frustrating and poorly thought out"
1360,"A really, REALLY great game, just finished playing it, its really fun, and short :) 
I honestly think it deserves more attention."
1361,Short & relaxed game
1362,"A very fun, not very challenging platformer with a decent story and amazing visuals.

Yea, what can I say? It's fun and if you're looking for a real challenge, try getting the achievements, most include running a certain section perfectly within a certain timeframe. Aside from that the game is not too difficult."
1363,gaga
1364,"The game suffers from being a very short experience and having a very slow and frustrating introduction. The power up progression is surprisingly satisfying. Everytime I feel like my moveset has reached its peak, a new movement option is unlocked. A lot of the platforming becomes increasingly satisfying and right when the game starts feeling incredibly enjoyable, the story is finished. Because of how limited your moveset is at the start, most of the early game revolves around waiting for platforms to cycle to a favorable position. Despite being a short experience, the moments where your character has all the tools at his disposal are the most enjoyable parts of the game.

TL;DR
Really short game with a rough beginning but enjoyable movement options right before the game is finished."
1365,"Short story game, good when you are bored or have nothing to play."
1366,Fun game. Gameplay is fluid. Controls are precise. Nice!
1367,i really like this game. i just wish it wasnt so goddamn short
1368,"Wonderful Story, Made me cry. Still, 10/10."
1369,"It's not a long campaign, but the gameplay is very smooth. Really neat design and very well done!"
1370,"I usually have a hard time with first-person platforming, but it's done so well in A Story About My Uncle that I felt I was able to get the most out of the game. The controls are very responsive*, and the physics and levels feel designed around each other. Everything comes together to create a sense of momentum that feels great to play around with.

The story is short but endearing, with a few extra pieces to be found if you're willing to explore for them. It also serves as a tutorial and an introduction to the main paths through the levels. So long as the gameplay looks interesting to you, I'd say the story is worthwhile even if you're not interested in the challenges mentioned next.

Between the game itself and the list of Steam achievements for it, there's a few different challenges to try. Doing the levels without falling, or aiming to use as few grapples as possible are both decent skill tests, but my favourite was the time trials. I spent a fair amount of time exploring the levels by attempting different swings and jumping over rocks/into chasms to find the fastest paths I could, and when I finally put it all together it was extremely rewarding.

*I play most games with a controller, and did start this with one, but ended up switching to KB/M. They both worked well enough."
1371,This game will make you really angry!!!
1372,nice story
1373,"I played this game a long time ago, and I loved it. The only problem I had with this game was that it was too short. I would honestly buy this game if I had too."
1374,"I liked it when I played it, but not really for the story. I really just liked the game-play and swinging around from flying rocks."
1375,"This game is actually amazing, it far surpassed my expectations. The whole game is super smooth, there's a strong story and absolutely stunning visuals. also the difficulty is just right so that there are some sections you'll have to try a few times but nothing to the point where I had to stop playing. That being said it's a shorter game for the price but if it goes on sale and you have nothing else to play then its a must."
1376,"This is a really good narrated game, with quite good adventures. really recommend it to everyone who wants to spend a quality time for a few hours. It totally worths it."
1377,"This is a surprisingly well made and well polished game, not sure how this game mad it into my library, but I do wish I played it earlier. The SipderMan-esque gameplay swinging around takes me back to SpiderMan 2 days."
1378,A game with a strange surreal feeling. Somewhat unpolished.
1379,swag
1380,"[h1]Flawed and short, though not unenjoyable[/h1]

[b]Gameplay[/b] 
The main appeal is obviously the grappling and swinging mechanics. It's not the first game to have them, nor even the first game to center completely around them, but they work well enough. Movement is enjoyable, though level design seems strictly focused on moving from one puzzle set to the next, and difficulty ramps up rather quickly, where any wrong movement means automatic death or a major setback, so there's never really any chance to just enjoy the freedom of motion. There are hidden collectibles that may give a reason for some further exploration, but even then it's more about carefully navigating some slightly janky environments, so there aren't really segments where you can just freeflow, making it feel like there's some squandered potential there.

[b]Visual design[/b]
The environments are pretty enough and there's a general pleasantness to the color palette. There isn't a whole lot of variety and while the general appearance of every level is unique, it all boils down to different textures on more floating rocks. There aren't many characters around and ultimately that's a good thing, as I found the design of the good guy characters rather unpleasant. The girl you're supposed to befriend made me more uncomfortable than the one monster that appears.

[b]Story[/b]
Clearly an afterthought. It hinders the game more than it enhances the experience. Depending on how you interpret the ending, the titular uncle, [spoiler]may turn out to have been dead all along and what happens in the game is just a made up story the narrator tells his daughter, which makes the whole thing rather pointless - making someone be dead does not make a story automatically poignant, this is not how you tell a story about mourning and no amount of whispery tones from the voice actor is going to turn this into ""What Remains of Edith Finch"".[/spoiler] The other option is not much better,[spoiler] because if you take the story literally, then dear ole uncle doesn't give two thirds of a sh!t about you and literally sends you back within the minute of you having found him - oh and also makes sure to let you know that he's going back to the niece he hatched from an egg  that he likes better than you.[/spoiler] In either case, none of the actions you take in the game relate to any of it, and the game would've been better off without it at all, just making it about exploring an alien landscape with a magic grappling hook.

[b]Ultimately[/b]
I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's not a bad experience for the less than 4 hours it lasts, and if you don't find the difficulty too frustrating, the designs too unappealing or the story too senseless, you might have a better time with it than I did."

1386,was pretty fun and totally unique
1387,"This is a really nice game, albeit short. there's not much to talk about considering how simple and short it is. just get it if you want a relaxing and easy platformer for a few hours. 
Buy it in a sale."
1388,I really enjoy the ending and overall the gameplay is fantastic.
1389,spider man ps5
1390,Awesome story and game
1391,Beautiful game and it's super relaxing - unless you're playing time trails then its stressful as hell
1392,Superb game with great art work
1393,"NIce graphics, cool concept!"
1394,"i would make a joke but like honestly its just really good. like. uh, very really good"
1395,"The Good:
+ Grappling beam can be fun to use.
+ No fall damage
+ Instant respawn
+ Well optimized

The Bad:
- Correct path can be difficult to discern.
- Some parts nearly impossible if using a gamepad.
- Dull story & rushed/underwhelming ending.
- Uninspired environments (mostly just floating rocks)
- Can cause motion sickness.

Final Thoughts:
I beat it, but didn't really enjoy it much. The grapple mechanics were fun sometimes, but nearly everything else in the game was dull and/or uninspired. Ultimately though it was ending (or lack thereof) which left me feeling like the whole experience was just a waste of time. 

(Also, if you're looking for games on Steam built around the whole travel-by-grappling hook mechanic, may be worth checking out Remnants of Naezith, Silver Grapple, or The Free Ones.)"
1396,"Gud gaem
"
1397,intriguing story and swiiiiiiing
1398,Cute game but graphics haven't aged well and it's for a niche market.  I'd say kids under 12 who are decent at first person games.
1399,a nice game
1400,this does not dissapoint
1401,Real nice 3 hours.
1402,nice game
1403,Very fun puzzle game involving a grapple hook and a missing Uncle.
1404,"crashed twice on the entrance for the village but otherwise it ran like shit on my intel igpu

good game"
1405,Okay
1406,"I have replayed the game maybe four or five times. It is gorgeous. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone.
"
1407,"its a storyabout my real uncle!

im just kidding guys i never met this man in my life"
1408,"I had high hopes for this one, sadly it's awful.  Did they never play this thing themselves?  I can run right into a windmill and somehow can't grapple it.  Restart and can grab it at a good distance.  The constant bouncing off everything is far more annoying than entertaining.  Way more frustrating than fun.  This is a waste of time.  Play this one after you've finished everything else in your library and the next game is still a week away.  Otherwise, bypass it.

For those of you still reading this game offers a cool mechanic where you can grapple and super jump to basically fly around fantasy worlds.  The problem is that the developers didn't actually test gameplay or didn't care that the results are exactingly precise.  Watch youtube to see videos of people getting frustrated a the ridiculous of this game.  Somehow the character can leap incredibly high and stick the landing...until you need to go up to a tiny ledge.  Then he just bounces around and slippy like ice.  Then they give you stupid puzzles like fall off an island and click at just the right instant...because for some stupid reason if you get too close it doesn't work...to slingshot yourself to another island.  It's really just dumb and frustrating.  This is truly  sad because the movement looks so promising."
1409,"Got this when Steam decided to give away like 2000 copies of this or something. Very good game, definitely would have paid for it."
1410,fun but short
1411,good game
1412,Nice short adventure with some fun mechanics.
1413,fun
1414,"A Story About My Uncle seems to be, at its core, a heartfelt story of a fairy tale a parent may have made up for their child, encapsulated by an exploration game with creative and gripping movement mechanics.
Telling stories this way usually results in meandering and lack of focus, pitfalls that the writing seems to struggle with throughout the entire experience. Luckily, the gameplay hook is strong enough to pull you in anytime the story loses you.

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚¨ñ‚óá"
1415,Good story
1416,A nice relaxing story.
1417,"Cute little physics platformer and story, but pretty short - you can finish it in two hours."
1418,"Shitty controls, boring story. Cutscenes are too frequent and you cant skip them. Dont buy it"
1419,Nice little game.
1420,me like
1421,finished it graphics are great loved the game feels smooth had fun
1422,now let me tell you a story about MY uncle..
1423,"Delightful gameplay, cute story and nice graphics. Worth giving it a try, I think most people will like this.

Arbitrary scores:
Graphics: A-, not triple A, but lovely.
Mechanics: A, sometimes a bit funky, but they feel amazing.
Story: B+, pretty good, pretty cute.
Speedrunning: B+, cool tricks and stuff, but the mechanics sometimes fail which ruins the run.
Challenges: C+, alright, but quite tedious. Would be nicer in smaller segments.
Overall: A-, has got a lot going for it."
1424,beste
1425,Simple game overall but a neat story and fun puzzles.

1427,"Great Story, great game."
1428,"I really wanted to like this game. I played it from start to finish, but in the end my experience was more of a negative one. You¬¥ll need a lot of patience for this game. Nevertheless I try to judge it fairly:

PROs:
-easy to follow story, a little naive but quite nice
-good puzzles for the most part
-gain better equipment over time, which leads to more motivation and gameplay variety
-quite a decent amount of different surroundings/levels

CONs:
-movement feels clunky (bounce off spots, slippery movement)
-auto save spots are all over the place (some are too close together, some are too far away from each other)
-decent shooter skills are needed (mouse flicks in later crystal-levels!!!)
-unfair spots combined with terrible terrain decisions
-pseudo ""deep"" story parts
-fail state issue: watch yourself for seconds falling to death over and over again..."
1429,good
1430,"Soo beautifly game !

I Recommend this game !!"
1431,Fun game
1432,spiderman
1433,"Genuinely good and unique game, maximum PogChamp"
1434,"Took me about 5 hours to finish the game. Got the game free on Humble Bundle, but I think the original price is a bit high for what you get. 

Plenty difficult, well balanced, gamepad controls are easy to forget if you don't remind yourself of them."
1435,"Very nice and exciting game, but the storyline is super short... 
I bought it yesterday, played 2.5 hours and the story is over.
But the game itself is really nice and captivating. The mapping is a ten out of ten!

Definitive recommendation to buy"
1436,"A thoroughly enjoyable game. Great physics and overall visuals, and a wonderful storyline. Good fun and easy to pick up"
1437,amazing and great story game.. for me it looks like mirrors edge
1438,"Really great game, wonderful story, amazing music. This game is incredibly immersive and I would highly recommend it! 11/10"
1439,"decent game, quite short tho"
1440,I am not fussed on it.
1441,A short game built around a neat mechanic.
1442,Damn. Filled with goosebumps at the end!
1443,"Amazing game, great story, fun gameplay. 10/10"
1444,jus wholesome
1445,"I feel a bit harsh for giving this a 'no' but there are issues with the core gameplay that I, personally, can't overlook.
The game mostly focuses on you using your grapple to move around terrain. This is mostly well executed but for a couple of major issues:

1)	Understanding distance.  It is often very hard to tell if an object your are aiming at is small (and close) or far away (and small).  I often find myself restarting sections to learn where the grapple points are and which are in reach, rather than understanding where I can or can't grapple to instinctively.  This is perhaps exacerbated by the lack of scenery ‚Äì having no close floor, celing or walls gives little parallax effect between objects so judging distance is tricky.
2)	Randomness. Some sections involve moving objects.  How your grapple interacts with these can be wildly different between runs for no real reason.  Even worse are sections which seem to have totally random objects.  One scene in particular where you have to traverse a pit by moving between falling blocks was especially painful ‚Äì blocks appear to fall randomly and several good runs were ended when there was simply no more blocks to aim for.  Net result is that completing these sections feels more like a lucky break in scenery placement than an achievement due to skill.

While neither of these are game breaking - restart points are usually plentiful so you're not set back much for failing, they do make the game more an exercise of repetition and I never feel my own skill or reactions play much part in my success or failure."
1446,Great story and I loved the look of the game!  Definitely worth the $4.49 on sale.
1447,"Good mechanics and decent story but not very full-filling, anyone expecting a deep story and a game that lasts more than 2 hours will be disappointed."
1448,"Very cute game, engaging and fun.  It's like being SpiderMan, but different.

During the current sale, $4.49 isn't a bad price, but at normal $15 dollar value I can't say it's worthwhile.  The story can be completed in about 4 hours, and it doesn't have a whole lot of replay value.  There are collectibles to get, achievements to grind, and time trials to see how quick you are, but that;s it.

GOAT mode is the best. thing. ever."
1449,ok
1450,Very yes
1451,good uncle :)
1452,Yeah It's pretty good.
1453,fun
1454,good story and gameplay.
1455,Short but good. Finished the game in 2h
1456,Just play this game and have fun. Roam the fantasy world and enjoy. This game playable on low specs pc. Amazing Graphics .
1457,vary naice
1458,I am pretty sure this did NOT happen to my uncle so thats kinda insane that you just assume he is an insane cave dweller living with frogs thats not cool he was only insane and never left his house but he did not live with frogs!!!! developers i demand an answer !!!
1459,such a beautifull game wish it was a bit longer
1460,"A quick and fun, single player game. Great story and mechanics, truly was fun. A bitter-sweet ending but was truly worth the couple hours it took to complete, will have to play again at some point. If you are looking for a single-player, story, this is the game for you!"
1461,"ive beaten asamu countless times, and the beauty of it gets me every. time. i love this game !"
1462,"Yes, it is amazing. Pretty robust imo. Only wish for there to be VR support to have an excuse to replay this game. The story is also quite nice and sweet."
1463,A Story About My Uncle is a pretty good first person platformer that is similar to Valley. It was one really fun and I thought the difficulty was really well done and was the perfect level of difficult.
1464,The great game !
1465,nice story and gameplay
1466,"
Great game I really enjoyed playing it"
1467,Updating my review because of steam awards nomination 2020!
1468,bom d+ pra passar o tempo
1469,Good game
1470,"Speechless, masterpiece..."
1471,AmAzing.
1472,Good
1473,"The idea: great
Execution: not so much

The terrain looked mostly great, though a bit too static. And by that I mean not too many moving parts. The ones that were moving were moving in a circular motion, yay such excite.

The story was interesting in the way it was told. Though it felt like it was just put there as a second thought. It was not really engaging, with the characters being really dull and unexplored. Not too many interactions. I expected a whole living city with people to talk to who might tell you something about the place.
[spoiler]You meet fred after all that time and he is happy for a minute and then sends you home, like what?[/spoiler]

The difficulty was pretty flat. Easy at first, then it got a bit more complex with the triple jumps and additional boosts. Other than that a few places where frustrating with randomized platforms and places where if you fall you have to do a bunch of easy jumps all over again. Taking a lot of time.

I really like games like these but this one just had too many flaws to be truly enjoyable. I spent a lot of time thinking that this could have been done so much better. And indeed, it could have been.

I only recommend this if you really really love 3D platformer games but if you are here for the story... well.. better be on your way somewhere else :D"
1474,"Because of the boring and repetitive gameplay, I couldn't immerse myself with the story. It's basically just jumping around."
1475,only one cons: not gamepad friendly.
1476,Short but fun game
1477,"A decent game, if you follow the path there shouldn't be much issue about getting around the game. A few difficult set pieces. When you go off the beaten path there is where you will get stuck and find surfaces that look like you can land on it. 


When it comes to story it's about a man remebering the adventure to go visit his Uncle. Though some parts had you guessing other things."
1478,"Started off good. 
I had trouble with the windmill were i would get clipped though them robbing my momentum and getting me killed. 
In the Ice Caves the game says you cant grapple ice, but then then you can, until it decides you cant and the recharge crystals don't work all the time. I was rubbing my face in one and i would work, next time it did.

I want to like it, but the inconsistencies just ruined the game for me."
1479,I'm pretty sure this game is a N.A.M.B.L.A. recruitment tool.
1480,lol best
1481,finished the game already lmao
1482,"Amazing adventure, would love to see a sequel."
1483,"I've never seen more amazing adventure game than this one! Just 10 minutes in and I was already stunned by the complexity of the world I've been in. You MUST try this game out. I've played that for third time already. You can finish it in 2 hours, but it's goddamn worth it a try."
1484,good game 9/10
1485,It was a good time.
1486,"3D platformer with very uneven difficulty level. Some sections are childishly easy, and some can drive you crazy with their high difficulty. The game has some storyline, but it only focuses on it at the beginning of the game. Then we just go ahead and it is not clear why we are doing this and what the hero wants to achieve. The ending does not make much sense. We meet good old friend after many years and there is not even room for a short conversation between the characters."
1487,good game
1488,fun
1489,"it's a story about my uncle, but i don't have one."
1490,"3D platformer, NOT a puzzle game. Comparisons to Myst are misplaced."
1491,"Very nice game, motion is smooth, controls are fluid and the narrative was nice. Story feels like it ends too abruptly though.

6/10"
1492,yes
1493,"Nice and Fun parkour game, great story 

would recommend"
1494,"if you're looking for a parkour game with a good story, this one is for you."
1495,"For a long time this game sat in my library, untouched, gathering cobwebs...

Today I chose to finally install it. I was instantly hooked. I guess it's partly because I love books and stories.
The gameplay is nice, but a bit short though. But then again, it's a bedtime story so I suppose it can't be long.

If ya like books and stories, **get it.**"
1496,halal-free
1497,This game starts off as an OK platformer but the later part of the game it just becomes annoying. So much of it becomes trial and error because it isn't always clear where you have to go and the rocks you grapple to mostly get in the way. Oh and the windmills can fuck right off. Graphics are nice.
1498,I enjoyed this game a lot while the story was too short
1499,"Like portal 1, good but short."
1500,"fun game.  very nice story, an all around great experience"
1501,"Beautiful story, worth the money"
1502,"Some games just have incredible mechanics that grapple you - pardon the pun - right away and get you thinking, get you playing with them over and over again, trying to find new ways to apply them to the world over and over again. 
Others pull you in with incredible ways to tell their story, making you grasp for every last bit of it, while fearing that the end may come too soon.

This is unfortunately neither of those two. There's been a plethora of games with solid examples of fluid progression through levels in an easily accessible, yet challenging way. ASAMU seems to copy neither of those, and the result of that is that the game just never feels all that polished. More often than not jumps don't work out as well as you imagine them, and each time the game makes you wait until you've fallen down all the way into the abyss before you respawn.
And the story is just ""meh"". It's forced onto the player, and lacks the neccessary length to build up immersion in order to really work ones' emotions. Where other games have managed to properly punch you in the feel-guts, this is just a slight tickle, nothing more.

And then there's the price, the basis for the negative review. It's a good enough game to be played once, maybe even twice, and it at least tries its best at presenting itself, but the price of ‚Ç¨12,49 for a playtime of just 2 hours is absolutely unjustified."
1503,"Beatiful.
Could be a little more forgiving, or have more checkpoints near the end, or have better collision control... But... It's just beatiful and amazingly different."
1504,"An amazing game overall. The story is fantastic, the gameplay is fun, and the atmosphere is great. I would highly recommend getting this game."
1505,What a wonderful platformer.  Enjoyed the story.  The Achievements didn't interest me but was totally worth one run through.
1506,"this game is a game, and i like  game :D"
1507,This is now my home screen i don't care what you have to say.
1508,Fun little game like Mirrors Edge. Get it on sale
1509,"very nice game fred is a pedo
"
1510,"god damn first person platformer isn't supposed to make you cry
why the hell does this one"
1511,"amazing game, definitely worth ¬£10 at most, considering how much content is in it"
1512,nice game
1513,"great game great story., would recommend waiting until its on sale because 15$ is  a steep price for such a small game. Unless you really like platforming games, then you can easily sick many hours into tho game."
1514,"WTF is this?
"
1515,"A bit short game, but the storyline is pretty nice, enjoyed bhopping and tryharding the map."
1516,short game but good story and some times hard gameplay
1517,"Unplayable even with cheats. Don't know who did the testing of this game, but unless you get the timming perfectly matched and you shoot at the right spots... forget about beating it. Concept is cool, but badly executed."
1518,great game to play when bored
1519,"Theres not really much to say about this game, the story is boring and short, the gameplay is bland, just getting from A to B"
1520,"Very Good Game!
The Platforming With The Glove Is Great!
10/10"
1521,"i wish it had more story or dlc
"
1522,Great platforming.Good story.
1523,Great game! Very simple but I very enjoyed playing it!
1524,its just really fucking cool
1525,"Really nice game, got it a few years back and I still enjoy it!"
1526,"This is one of my fav games. I‚Äôm still waiting for the 2nd one to come out. In my opinion this game is perfect in every way.  It‚Äôs beautiful to look at, chill to play and affordable. The storyline you‚Äôre supposed to follow is both thrilling and a lot of fun. 
There‚Äôs likable characters and everything in this game makes sense even though is a fantasy game.  This game is indeed a bit old but still looks great and does not take up too much space. 
I seriously can‚Äôt recommend this game enough. Anyone who is reading this now that likes fps adventure games should download this game at once because it‚Äôs such a nice experience that u don‚Äôt want to miss out on. Trust me. 
"
1527,"I played it for 30 minutes. I hate the jumping, it's awkward. Maybe good for a controller, but not with Mouse/keyboard. Nice scenery though."
1528,"Step 1
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.

Step 2
In a small saucepan heat butter and milk over low heat until butter is melted. Using a potato masher or electric beater, slowly blend milk mixture into potatoes until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
1529,Crappy gamepad controls
1530,Pretty nice and quick story.
1531,Decent spiderman sim
1532,"Took me about 2 hours to complete, but I really enjoyed it. Simple concept, easy to understand, and really fun to grapple around the different areas. I enjoyed the story as well, and i would say it's easily worth the $15"
1533,"Played through the game in around 2 hours, truthfully it was amazing. I definitely recommend this game if you want a mix of god gameplay and a great story."
1534,"My god is this game good. To be honest, it was a little short. But other than that the game is amazing and the story is great. 1010"
1535,good
1536,Short platformer that's fun for a quick play.
1537,"A genuinely fun platformer game that I ended up rage quitting from when I got to the room with the falling blocks. To heck with that room. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this fun, albeit sometimes very difficult, indie game."
1538,Dumbest idea to put time trial in buggy game.
1539,"Let me start by saying that, firstly i thought the general idea and principle of this game sounds fun, and secondly I am not easily frustrated in computer games. However, this game got me to the point that I wished I never had started playing it (because when I start a game, I want to finish it)

The main good part in this game is the story. It is a nice narrative and has some interesting ideas. However, only 3h playtime (if you do not care for achievements) is not nearly enough for the price they want you to pay.

The controls in this game are difficult. You have a lot of options to interact with the environment and make your way through the levels. The first 1.5 hours of gameplay were quite nice. The levels had a few challenges to keep it interesting but nothing too crazy. However, more and more options in the controls became available and the parcours were getting difficult very fast.
So, at the beginning of the second hour of gameplay everything became more a trial and error sort of game. The general way you were supposed to take to your goal was not always clearly indicated and most of the time jumps that seem pretty manageable took 10 or more trys until I succeeded. There are only few checkpoints, so each fail meant, that you have to do quite a huge amount of the parcour again and thus takes a lot of time, until you are even back at the point you failed originally.
The fact, that the grapling device sometimes simply fail to connect to objects which worked well before, was not helpfull either.

I said to myself, maybe it is only this part of the level which is this difficult to master. Just pull through and you will have fun again. But no, unfortunately even the next 2 levels i encountered so far are try and error too. If i still could refund it I would do it. But as the horrible parts of the game start at about 2 hours of gameplay, it is already to late when you discover, that this game is pure luck if you make the jumps and has not a lot to do with skill or training.

Most of the players do not seem to care for the achievements (as they are extremely hard) and only around 7%-8% percent of players have finished them. So, achievement hunters will most likely get very frustrated.

In total, I advice everyone not to buy it... not even when it is on sale."
1540,"Pros:
- Aesthetic and beautiful
- No actual uncles touching... well, anyone
- Life lesson's included, if not, still touching and reminding of our inner-kids.
- Overall a fun experience to help you relax and let go for a few hours

Cons:
- Not much replay-ability (unless you want to have a run on the same exact platforms)
- Really short game 
- Not always as accurate as a platformer should be, considering there is a very finite amount of space you can travel to since it's Staged instead of Open-World."
1541,"Its a fun, challenging, and sometimes frustrating game. Overall I would definitely recommend it, but it isn't graphically pleasing to be honest. Its achievements are tedious but I'll complete them at some point. :)"
1542,"Not too bad, but is heavily focused on the story, even within the short game time, the gameplay can be kinda repetitive, and there's no real gamebreaking upgrades, just things to improve jump etc. Keeps it's charm by being short though, so it's not a bad game, especially on sale"
1543,"Gameplay: 9/10
Ending: -10/10
this game has the least satisfying ending its so dumb"
1544,"had fun playing it,
had fun replaying it.
had a cute little story.
hated the fact i couldnt skip the cutscenes after the replay."
1545,Great Game! Really got me into thinking about life. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story and people who enjoy parkour games. I would also recommend to people with the passion of lore or decryption of other-worldy languages.
1546,"Nice platformer, relaxing and enjoyable."
1547,Dodgy spiderman simulator. Very fun. Must play!
1548,nice game
1549,"Fun concept, but repetition, disorienting maps, and, to a lesser extent, bad voice acting, killed it for me."
1550,really fun game. I recommend it 10 out of 10
1551,its the game you see in the background of youtube drama videos
1552,pretty damn good
1553,"id say a story about my uncle, but itd be taken down from steam because of sexually explicit content"
1554,Fain.
1555,Wish my uncle was that cool
1556,It's pretty neat.
1557,"The story was a little short, only took about 2 hours to play through. But all in all it had a fun grappling mechanic that worked well and the story was engaging."
1558,"guud
"
1559,i've played it a couple of times through its ok
1560,"Short game, but fun grappling mechanics. Unfortunately it ends right when the courses gets challenging and feels like it could be so much more."
1561,"Super short game, but pretty nice. Personally would not pay full price since the game is literally 2.5 hours long, but still a good game regardless."
1562,"Story: Meh
Characters: Meh
Gameplay: FUCKING AWESOME, basically like csgo Surf, 100% recommended!"
1563,Good game. Buy and play it
1564,fun little adventure. can be done in 2 hours on normal play.
1565,"the story of this game and my uncle are similar:

both touched me"
1566,very noice
1567,"The mechanics can be fun but it's honestly just dull and unpolished. The landscapes can be pretty at times but mostly lifeless. 

If you speed through it a little, it's not so bad. 

It has a nice children's story feel but with more ""adult"" morals attached."
1568,Haven't really played the game but I do love seeing vids with it and making just playing it on a Friday night is great highly recommend!
1569,Such a pretty looking game. Amazing story and wonderfully entertaining grappling ability.
1570,"Its a fan and balanced game. Nice graphics, I didn't encounter any glitches, all in all a good experience"
1571,"[h2] A Story About My Uncle [/h2]
 
 [h1] Bedtime Story [/h1]
 
 A father tells his daughter a bedtime story about his wild adventure to another world when he was younger. You play as the Father when he was younger, going on a journey through the Trash Disposal portal into another world in search of his uncle, Fred. This is a parkourish game in a first person perspective. Jump, Grapple and Rocket boot your way through the floating rocks in search of your genius uncle!
 
 [h1] Jumping into the Storyline [/h1]
 
  The game revolves around the narration by the father to his daughter. You play the narrations. The story sounds like a child‚Äôs fantasy story and this is good as fiction has a huge fanbase. The protagonist discovers that his uncle has not returned from his trip and it has been a very long time. He decides to venture into his uncle‚Äôs laboratory and finds a power suit that belongs to his uncle. He wears it and jumps into the Trash Disposal Portal and was astonished to find himself in another world where everything seems magical. He finds glowing markers left behind by his uncle and follows them. He encounters a weird ""salamander-people"" type civilization (Called Strays) and befriends one of the girls there who claims to have seen his uncle and she agrees to help him find his uncle. The story continues at the same pace with the same objective until the end. All you have to do is successfully pass the puzzle parkour courses. The story is decent and not worth spoiling, so I will not go into the details. All I want to say is that the ending will be good!
 
 [h1] Grappling towards the Gameplay [/h1]
 
 This is parkour but not really. You utilize gadgets to help you to get from one place to another. There is no wall running, bhopping, or any of the other parkour crap. There are only three ways to get across spaces: Grapple, Power jump, and Rocket Boots. I can‚Äôt disagree that this game has a unique concept. There is no violence whatsoever in this game, hence it is friendly to players of all ages. The First Person View makes the game very thrilling to play. Imagine jumping from one rock to another and missing the ledge and looking down as you fall into the void in First Person...Scary...Right?
 
 As I mentioned above, there are only three ways to move across the floating terrain, apart from walking and running (Obviously). So that means there are three Gadgets:
 [list]
 [*] A Glove that boosts you 20 feet off the ground. Basically a power jump. You start the game with this, hence a default gadget.
 [*] A Plasma Grappling hook which does what a grappling hook does. You find this during your journey in the first level. You start with 1 grapple charge and you can find more later on. The more the charges, the more times you can grapple other objects before you land.
 [*] Rocket-Powered Boots allow you to fly for a limited time before it runs of fuel. It gives you the Ironman vibes. You find this way later in the game.
 [/list]
 
 Apart from the parkouring part, the game has nothing more to do. There are collectibles too, scattered around the area. Each collectible will trigger a dialogue from the protagonist telling something to his daughter related to what you found. After you complete the game, you can try speedrunning it in the racing mode, trying to complete it before the designated time. There are also achievements for completing a region without falling and also for using a limited number of grapples in the level. They did a good thing by adding these challenges as the main game itself spans for like 5 hours, hence it is short. 
 
 [h1] Graphics [/h1]
 
 For a budget indie game from 2014, the graphics are pretty good! The beautifully made environments are what give the game its charm. The lightings are on point for a game of its time. The light reflections on the rocks, the glowing crystals, the skies, all of them are a feast to the eyes.
 
 The game doesn‚Äôt require a rig with high specs to run. I am pretty confident that this can run on even low specs PCs. Hence this can be played by almost everyone!
 
 [h1] Pros [/h1]
 [list]
 [*] Unique Concept.
 [*] Mesmerizing graphics. Old game but good graphics for its time.
 [*] Gives the thrills and the chills to the players.
 [*] Decent storyline.
 [*] A Non-violent game with a peaceful and calm mood throughout the game. Even the scary monster is smiling!
 [*] Smooth controls.
 [*] Not really hard to play.
 [/list]
 
 [h1] Cons [/h1]
 [list]
 [*] Minor visual and gameplay-related bugs and glitches here and there.
 [*] Very short gameplay of 5 hours.
 [*] Not a game I would re-play for the story. I would play specific levels only for the collectibles and achievements.
 [/list]
 
 [h1] Rocket Booting to the Conclusion [/h1]
 
 I‚Äôve had mixed feelings for this game before playing it. But when I started playing it, it really made me interested and I inclined towards supporting the game and recommending it to my friends. The gameplay is very intriguing and entertaining, while it lasts. I do recommend this game. I highly suggest getting this game during a sale as it goes for a very cheap price!

1573,guys at the end your uncle goes and does naugty stuf don recomend !
1574,This game is not worth it's money because the story is extremely short(it took me like 5 hours to finish it) but besides that it's good.
1575,one of the top 10 games ive ever played
1576,"I am going to be one of the few people who did not enjoy this game. You'd think there is still something coming that might be exciting about the game but I could not get into it. It was actually more frustrating than it was fun. Very bland and repetitive. Story does not make up for it. Also, if you are into weird games that almost make no sense, then this is for you."
1577,"i got it for like cheap as hell so i would recommend for a deep sale. However, the only thing good about this game is the platforming once you get the grapple hook. The story is shite, and the jank is quite. but it was pretty exciting to be swinging around the caves and stuff. Atmosphere is there for sure, but the voice acting and story were just cringeeee. gg"
1578,Great game !
1579,"Nice little story, interesting gameplay. 7/10"
1580,very epic
1581,This game is worth every penny
1582,cool game :)
1583,Everybody need to taste this game
1584,"Its a puzzle game with some story About His Uncle ...
I didnt expected anything but i like it. Its a relaxed game."
1585,Good game.... worth playing after all these massive good for nothing online games.
1586,"Within 4 hours, I've probably killed this kid like 265 times. Or more. 
Beautiful world, but ugly character design and weird mechanics. 
Level design is also lacking. Half the time I was standing on a flying stone looking for where to go next. That's an achievment in itself, because you are usually in a giant cave, or in the middle of nothing, but still you have no clear way ahead. I had to do random leaps of faith to figure out where the hell to go, or to get myself back to a checkpoint for orientation. 
Towards the end you randomly lose one of your abilities, after just learning it. 
The story is sort of okay, I loved the father-daughter dialogue and the little epilogue, but other than that, there is not much to talk about.
Achievements are all for the hardcore gamers basically, which is fine, but I kinda feel left out.
Overall, the game was a huge disappointment for me. I don't hate it, there are good things in this game, but it ran out of ideas quickly and left me feeling... nothing, basically."
1587,Very relaxing
1588,"Really cool and different movement mechanics with a neat story to go along, graphics and art style are meh though
"
1589,i like spiderman...
1590,Great game for free. Too short for $15. Id pay 5 or 10 for it if I had too.
1591,Fairly addicting 3D platformer game. The storyline is somewhat emotional ngl.
1592,it goo
1593,cool
1594,very good it dosen't matter if its a bit old tho its short af
1595,Very nice game <33
1596,Very good game
1597,Unique and worth playing
1598,"Short fun game, I got it for free ages ago & just played it now."
1599,"Short game, but pretty fun to play through"
1600,"Short but sweet. Game slowly introduces you to new mechanics and provides many alternatives and challenging routes to the skilled players. 

Story was trying too hard to pull the Pixar level of emotions and unfortunately fell a little flat due to the voice acting. 

Got this game as part of a humble bundle and glad I played it and in a sea of shovel ware and rehashed AAA titles this was a welcome break from it all."
1601,"Short n' sweat. 

Manages to keep building on the simple mechanics it establishes in the first chapter of the game, I thought the game would go on to a point where these mechanics got boring due to how many of the same challenges you do, but the game doesn't over stay its welcome and knows when it should end."
1602,super fun
1603,very fun! i want to gut the blue woman like a fish
1604,"Good game overall. Visually very nice. I had to restart from the last checkpoint a few times because I got stuck in between some rocks and stuff, but not a huge deal."
1605,"A Story About My Uncle:
1 Hour of story mode
6 hours of trying to complete maddie's challenge."
1606,"A very short game that took me a long time to complete. The simple music, beautiful visuals, and incredibly fun grapple-beam gameplay kept me coming back over and over again. I've played through the whole game multiple times...it's THAT fun to play!"
1607,YE
1608,Amazing!
1609,"honestly i just got this game because of leafy lol. saw him play it, it seemed kinda fun, so i bought it."
1610,"Awesome and heartwarming game, short for sure but interesting and fun. Also extra bonus point for Maddie *.*"
1611,yes very fun my uncle raped me instead tho
1612,amazing
1613,A sweet and peaceful tale.
1614,The most beautiful story game I've ever played
1615,"Great little game and story kept me engaged till the end 
"
1616,Best Story Told Game I've Played So Far And it's Very Calming Some Ways
1617,its short.
1618,"This game is amazing! Visuals are fantastic, gameplay is great. It has a simple but very nice story. Also it is very refreshing to find such a beautiful a game you can get through in one day when most of them require weeks from you."
1619,Finally decided to finish it and it is shorter than I thought. It is still very fun and just a very nice looking game that I could tell that the developers were passionate about. A little rough around the edges but I am sure you can have a fun time with the fun platforming and movement.
1620,"peng ting walla
"
1621,"simple parkour adventure short game with a lot of fun and a childish story (that i like it) and good atmosphere.
its really good for chilling game."
1622,"Stunning visuals, decent story. Good fun."
1623,"If parkour with a grappling device through caves populated by salamander/human hybrids sounds like fun, then ASAMU might be up your alley.

It's a bitter-sweet game in many ways. The story is fantastical yet rooted in loss. The gameplay is so tight and enjoyable, but the entire experience is very short-lived. You get near free-reign over how you explore the environment, and while there are only 5 levels, they are fairly massive and hold many secrets.

Beyond the main quest there are also time trials which are at least mildly addicting and, along with the collectibles strewn throughout the environments which beg to be found, make up the main elements which add to the replayability of the game.

It's a great casual game as well as a great game for speedrunning - just get it on sale!"
1624,"So, A Story About My Uncle
A fairly typical platformer-with-a-gimmick title, a genre with which there is nothing inherently wrong. This title unfortunately has more negatives than positives.
First up the good; I found the ambience sound to be pleasant, and the environment vistas were pleasing to look at from a suitable vantage point, and, well, that was pretty much it. The rest of the game just did not measure up. Voice acting was poor, the story was minimal (this in itself isn't a dealbreaker, but might have been a nice addition if it was better), and individual models+textures left something to be desired.
Then there is the gameplay, which boils down to: platformer + a magic grappling hook. Seems fine but I had major issues with it.
Firstly, the tether length seemed to vary according to what it was being launched at, and since you cant tell if you will be in range of the next hook location until _after_ you jump out over the abyss, this presents an annoying problem that doesn't really go away.
This leads nicely into the second issue I had: telling distance. I don't know if it was the models, textures, lighting (in fact I especially felt the lighting failed to do the game justice, and may have just been set in a way to make things more difficult to see), field of view, or just me, but I found it exceptionally difficult to judge how far away objects were - you can see why this might be an issue for a platformer.
These feed into just making the game feel unforgiving, particularly when the path forward isnt as obvious as it might seem, and getting your limited jumps/grapples wrong even slightly leads to a long drop and being whisked back to a checkpoint (at least it has these).
There is a genuine point in the game where the route is not at all visible, and requires hurling yourself off a patform, falling below a cliff, grappling the underside, and swinging tarzan-like down to your destination. Unfair? Perhaps. Unfun? Most certainly. And that's what gets the negative review from me: the game feels like it takes joy in forcing you to use trial-and-error-and-error-and-error to find what works, and then punishes you for being slightly off.
But at least the restore to checkpoint on death is a completely seamless transition. Which is probably a necessity because you will fall into oblivion thousands of times.
If you want a platformer, I dunno, get Spyro maybe, or search platformer on steam, Portal comes up there as well. If you really wanted a grappling hook for some reason...Just Cause has that I suppose."
1625,good
1626,I like the part where I spent 10 minutes shooting up at the sky near the village to get nothing then cry and uninstall game
1627,"I don't know. I didn't like it. The presentation is alright, but grapling to things and jumping is boring, at least in this game. The story doesn't seem very remarkable either and the people who played it to completion appear to confirm my overall impression."
1628,"This game is very relaxing with only a few tricky parts. It took me about 3 hours to beat the game, so in my opinion its not worth full price. However, it was very fun."
1629,I got this game when it was going for free. I really love this game and i have found myself replaying for the third now. This game is relaxing calming and fun. The price is a bit high but its on sale like 25% of the year. Its worth the play. overall score 8/10
1630,wr
1631,interesting short story
1632,its a great story about my uncle but it sucks that ill never be able to see him again.
1633,"Masterpiece, damn shame it isn't longer."
1634,"Too short for a great concept of a game, fun platforming game.  Perhaps add a free-play mode if finished?"
1635,"Fun and interesting game, albeit a little bit short. Would still pick it up, especially if on sale."
1636,"Wow, this was surprisingly good. It seems very low budget and indie but the gameplay is solid.

Many sections of the game are REALLY DIFFICULT but if you stick with it you do get a very satisfied feeling. There is no way I am talented enough to get any of the 15 achievements (again, this game is hard), but a casual playthrough can be done in one night!"
1637,gucci
1638,"The game was amazing.  Although it was very short I felt connected and engaged with the story and characters.  10/10 would play again.  Perfect for speedruns, or light playthroughs for late at night."
1639,"its fun
"
1640,"Very good, relaxing game with such a good story. You will not be disappointed if you buy for sure."

1645,IT GOOD
1646,the commentary channel's must have for gameplay in the bg
1647,"I personnally found the game extremely nice, i liked the graphics has much as the story the only thing i didn't like was how short it was i felt like they could of made the storie longer. Well i hope that they will make a follow up, maybe about the kid of the main character going into that world and meeting fred or how things changed since last time. 
"
1648,"Paid ¬£2.84 - Completed in 2.4 hours. Enjoyed the game.

I would have loved to have seen more complexity and length within the platforming sequences. Apart from the ice caves a lot of the platforming was limited to 1 or 2 swings before landing to reset and off again for another 1 or 2 swings.

1650,"Got this game during the week it was free. Was looking for a game like this for a while so I said why not. Really amazing game with an interesting story that will keep you hooked, I finished this game in one sitting. The biggest downside is that it's really short. Other than that I have no complaints."
1651,"It's really fun, lots of parkour."
1652,"An amazing, honest and yet challenging game. Short - but no 'walking sim' should be long. This game utilizes a medium of storytelling with such skill and grace that it is sure to be the inspiration for a new age of visual novels. Don't hesitate to support rich and meaningful content like this."
1653,definitely kek
1654,"very nice game 
dont take long to finish it"
1655,trust me you dont wanna know what he did
1656,"I was scrolling through steam sales and found this. It really appealed to me with the visuals, soundtrack, and storyline. I can say that the game did not disappoint and was probably one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played! It took me about 6 hours to complete (mostly because I struggled to do Maddie's challenge), but I also spent a lot of time just looking around and enjoying the views. Truly one of the prettiest games I have played in a long time. I highly recommend buying this! It's very well made! The grappling and jumping through chasms, skies, and floating rocks becomes fun and satisfying. A solid 9.5/10."
1657,"This is one of my favorite games, its so pretty and the levels are just challenging enough. Its a good short game that I've played a couple times over. If you havent downloaded this game you should"
1658,"It is an OK game with great story. However, you will think it is a simple until the end. Approx. 4 hours of gameplay should be enough to do so. It should be tried"
1659,"Short, but very nice and atmospheric."
1660,"A Story About My Uncle is a bad game.

Although is kinda fun at the start, the game develops poorly its elements and, even when I pushed to end the game, there wasn't any satisfaction and I don't know if it was because of the bad ending or the high difficulty of the last levels compared with the first ones.

The last biome (idk how to call it) is the most ugly of them all but it's the most with the most difficulty and where I spent more time.

You can buy it on sale if you wish so, but for me it was, honestly, a waste of money."
1661,"Short, but memorable."
1662,"quick and very mellow, replayed several times."
1663,"Good little indie game to get if on sale, I suppose. The grappling feels cool but that's about it. Visuals kinda suck and story is extremely short (barely 2 hours long).. I'd give it a 6/10
Really short and could've used some more work. Not a difficult game at all."

Release Date : 28/May/2014

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer taking place in atmospheric caves and floating rocks high in the sky. The main character makes his way through the various puzzles mainly using his grappling device trying to find his missing uncle Fred.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The main feature of the gameplay is the grappling device that is used to get through the various obstacles. It is a non-violent first person shooter that focuses on jumping, and a lot of grappling. Sounds like it's repetitive but it really is not as it is a lot of fun jumping high and far in first person.
[8.5/10]

[h1]Story:[/h1]
While telling a bedtime story to his daughter about the Adventures of uncle Fred, the narrator finally tells Fred's last story in which he never comes back, so the narrator takes control from this point onwards becoming the main character of the game, while you take control of his actions trying to guide him through the various trails in your path to finding uncle Fred.
[9/10]

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
This is a low budget indie game released back in 2014 but it really doesn't show. While it might not be a jaw dropper it definitely looks nice with good quality textures and lighting in a very atmospheric scenery.

[8.5/10]

[h1]Performance:[/h1]
Not demanding at all. Most computers can run this with no problem at all. Doesn't need a lot of ram or a very good graphics card. No need to get technical here, I'm confident that it runs on every pc that can install steam :P
[10/10]

[h1]Price:[/h1]
Very cheap. It is the price of a carton of milk! You can find it for about 3-4 euros during most times of the year and not limited just to sales.
[10/10]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is an atmospheric, narrative, non-violent first person platformer. But most of all it's very fun and very cheap. Recommended for sure!

[h1]üìâOverall rating: 9 / 10 [/h1]

1678,n mbnhb
1679,AHH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN!!
1680,"7/10
A short, but fun platforming game, with a nice story played out in the background (that epilogue though!)
Time trials, collectibles, and achievements offer some more play time, but I opted to forgo that. 

The levels climb in challenge as you make your way through them, and present a fun challenge.
I will say I did find some of the mechanics to be inconsistent at times, but it was nothing game breaking. 

Overall, ASAMU is a fun rainy day game well worth the price."
1681,"There was nothing memorable about this game, other than me wanting to chuck my computer out a window. The story was lackluster and the game mechanics were frustrating to say the least.  It was so easy to fall short of your jumps if you don't time them perfectly. So this game gets a big fat middle finger from me."
1682,"A great, peaceful, & relaxing platformer with a simple story. My only complaint is that I it's a really short game. You could probably complete the game in about 2 hours and get all you'd need from it."
1683,"Despite the characters being more than a little terrifying, it's a very nice story game. Controls are nice and really fun if you're playing normally.

As an achievement hunter, however, a huge problem is time trials. Gold on every level is required for an achievement and the levels clearly were not optimized for it, even though the required time to beat is super short. ""Go fast"" isn't entirely possible for a normal person considering the controls are only fun when they feel like it. When you super leap into a random lamp or tire that sends you flying the wrong direction, you've lost precious seconds and likely the gold medal. Not to mention, restart from checkpoint KEEPS WASTED TIME, so if the game ejects you into the water or void like it's guaranteed to do, jumping back to the checkpoint won't set your time to what it was when you hit it, which is wildly unfair when you can get screwed over by things entirely outside of your control."
1684,"This game is beautiful. Short enough to beat in one to two sittings, pretty smooth controls and movement, great pacing, and a story that has a few hard hits for a mostly innocuous game."
1685,"I just love it.
100% worth the 12‚Ç¨"
1686,"a very good game, full of emotion at the end no matter how many times ive beat the game now.. i bet theres such a deeper story behind who maddie could have represented in the dev's life. rip fred"
1687,Great game could use some work and isnt any triple A title but I enjoyed it and the visuals
1688,This is the best platform game i have ever played. Even 6 years after it's come out I still absolutely love it. I would highly recommend to anyone even slightly interested in this game.
1689,Good Game.
1690,"This game was great! Honestly I feel like I'm awful at parkour games and even I was able to finish this one. It took me a lot of trial and error but the game was fun enough to keep me from giving up. I can see how speed runners might enjoy this game because there are many ways you could go about taking paths. Even if that's not my cup of tea, I think there is a bit of fun in this for everyone. It even makes me wish we could know even more about his uncle after the fact. So if you want something with an interesting story, beautiful areas and the need for at least a bit of skill, this is a good choice to try out!"
1691,"Overall a very enjoyable and relaxing little experience-the gameplay is fun-the game looks good, some scenes really make you go WOAH !-story is cute and kinda touching-voices are soothing and the music is very chill-too overpriced for what it is, you can finish it pretty quickly without even trying to and it has close to no replayability, would be nice to buy it on sale or get it on a giveaway like I did a long time ago"
1692,"I like the game, fun some difficulty."
1693,Sick Story. 6 ish hours of playtime.
1694,"The campaign is decent, even if the story is a little meh."
1695,The only game on Steam that needs a sequel (or prequel).
1696,"I got the game when it was free for 3 days, They did a good job and all but for the price... its not worth it. Its about 2 hours worth of game when I was not trying to go fast or anything, Other then that the game is great I would recommend if it was an hour or 2 longer."
1697,"A very fun and interesting combination of very fluid first person platforming, along a few engaging walking simulator segments."
1698,very good
1699,"A Story About My Uncle feels more like a demo or development practice than a real full game.

AESTHETIC:
The artwork is okay, the environment feeling unnatural and more like a combination of random assets. Music could have done a lot for the aesthetic however there is little to none so you're often quietly platforming. You never yourself speak or make athletic noises even though you're flying around like Spiderman, so the most sound you'll hear is the storytelling between father and daughter which is the backdrop for the game.

This feels like a rather pointless aspect as the story isn't affected by its telling of cringey writing and voice acting. The story isn't even about his uncle, its about finding his uncle and once he finds him the story ends. You play as the father when he was a kid in first person mode, with no lines of his own except by hind sighted adult voice, so the only thing that makes you feel like you're a kid is that you see things from a shorter perspective making it so might as well be an adult midget. I don't know why they didn't make this game third person so you could the kid doing his parkour and there's even a part where someone rides your back so that would've been cool to see too.

GAMEPLAY:
A Story About My Uncle is a vertically abundant platformer with low gravity but no restart button, so you spend a lot of time waiting for you to fall when you've made a mistake. The game is short and somewhat challenging but lacks a flow of ideas so it often falls into repetitive gameplay. There is one living obstacle in the middle of the game which serves as a pretty cool boss level that changes up the rules, however it is a one time deal and lacked the further additions that it sorely needed.

FINAL WORDS:
This game has some good ideas but lacks the polish needed to be recommended. Do away with the storytelling backdrop, add a voice to your character, sprinkle in some lively music, design more unique levels, and you would have yourself a short-and-sweet type videogame."
1700,Great game
1701,i dont have a real uncle
1702,I also have some stories about my Uncle you wanna know?
1703,it good
1704,[h1]Fun and Peaceful with a Hint of Challenge: 8/10[/h1]
1705,"I love this game. But unfortunately, the story is too short."
1706,what an absolute hidden gem
1707,want more.
1708,residentsleeper
1709,Immersive atmosphere
1710,Good game. Cant really say more. Beat it in 1.4 hours
1711,"CONS: From time to time you will still glitch into a wall

MIXED: It's short, but very replayable in a time trial mode (or if you want to do achievements) so it kind of balances itself out.

PROS:  Beautiful Story, Beautiful Atmosphere, Great Platformer, A lot of Fun.

TLDR: If you like platformers, and like me you are striving to always get 100% of everything, definitely get this. 
"
1712,It has nice atmosphere and graphics. I didnt see any bugs. Some parts are challenging a bit but not that hard play. When I got stuck story got little boring. But after all its a good game. 8/10
1713,I like death and giant worms also rage quitting if you're like me play this game
1714,"It's a first person grappling game. buy it
10/10"
1715,"Short but oh so sweet. The movement works seamlessly, the story is beautiful. There are next to no complaints I have for this game. sure the graphics aren't AAA standard, but they function well enough for the purposes of the game. A great combination of momentum platformer with mild puzzle elements and an engaging, emotional story makes this one of the most enjoyable short games I've played. For replayability, it has time trials and achievement hunting which will add even more engagement to the already beautiful game."
1716,"Hi-rez physics based FPS.  You are a boy whose mad scientist uncle has gone missing.  There are notes and equipment that indicate he's disappeared into another dimension.  Use his power suit and grapple gun to go after him and find out his story.

A review I read described this game as the most motion-sickness-inducing game on the market.  When it was available on sale for a dollar, I was like, ""Challenge accepted.""  I suspect there are more-motion-sickness-inducing games out there (but then, Antichamber does it for me), but this game did deliver.

You have boots that can jump high and a grapple gun that can latch onto certain surfaces and hotpoints.  You are navigating a vast rock-enclosed cavern, swinging Spiderman-style from hotpoint to hotpoint as you try to find out where your uncle went.  On the way, you follow the trail he left of research notes, equipment, encampments and occasionally disenfranchised people.

Between the acrobatics the story is somewhat point-and-click.  There are puzzles to solve and people to encounter.  Some of the puzzles involve finding the people you need to encounter, which means if you lose track of the landscape you can get yourself stuck plotwise.  The story isn't bad, though I think I might see what the ending will be.

Wonderful value for a dollar.  I heartily recommend looking for it on sale.  And not playing too soon after eating."
1717,Short and memorable
1718,its good
1719,great game
1720,Pog asf
1721,Good game play it now. Beautiful and fun uhh yeah mhmm yep
1722,"Solid game. Finished it in 3 hours which felt about right. I think it could have used a little more challenge, I didn't feel like I was being really pushed until the last 15 mins or so. I had more trouble deciphering where to go than actually getting there. But the platforming is solid and the mechanics feel right."
1723,A short simple game that I really enjoyed my time with!
1724,"I think this is one of the best games i ever played, it have a great story too"
1725,Satisfaction limit reached
1726,Fun but short game
1727,"The story is AWESOME, so is the gameplay."
1728,Los escenarios son hermosos y es bastante adictivo
1729,its a very good good for gamers who like parkour and adventure. I wonder if it possible to have a multi-players then it will be great.  :)
1730,nice
1731,Mouvements are too approximative. Become boring real quick. Original but not fun.
1732,7.5/10
1733,"controls are dogshite, half the time they dont even work properly"
1734,"Can't relate to this game at all, the only stories I have of my uncle usually end in tears and authorities becoming involved"
1735,Very Short but Very good
1736,"I've always had this game in my library for some reason and it never dawned upon me to try it out so I DID. The game is just FUN. Exploring the enchanting world with little to no expectations, I was impressed by the fluid controls that never failed to leave me in awe. This game is just constantly fun, refreshing and it poses the absolute best way to teach gamers the fundamental controls to travel across the world. The graphics is not the best but it didn't matter. I loved how the story just flows, like the gameplay did and it's just so relaxing to take all of it in and EXPLORE. Just play the game if you have it in your library and try it for yourself."
1737,"it's a good game, need to explore on your own.
I recommend this if you are intrested in adventure/exploring type games!"
1738,"[h1][u]A delightful bedtime story[/u][/h1]

[h1][b]Overview[/b][/h1]
[u]A Story About My Uncle[/u] (ASAMU) is a first-person platformer set in a world picturing how wild a child's imagination could get. A world of gigantic floating rocks coupled with a charming story, odd-looking creatures, and somewhat gravity-bending abilities to let you turn everything upside down.


[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
üî∏The game focuses on the narrator as he tells a bedtime story to his daughter about Uncle Fred and his adventures. It's about the story when Uncle Fred didn't return home after his last adventure. The player takes control of the narrator in his youth searching around Fred's lab for clues when he finds a mysterious suit with many abilities. Now that the young boy's confidence is boosted by wearing the suit, he decides to go looking for his uncle in strange lands.

üî∏The story itself is a gentle one, occasionally filled with objects and background details to investigate so you can pick up the backstory. Many things will remain in the dark until the game is finished. That's when a major plot twist theory comes to the player's mind by piecing together the small hints you were given during the narrative. However, the characters aren't fulfilling. These half-frog, half-child creatures aren't developed at all. Maddie, who seems to be close with Uncle Fred, is sweet and fun but she only accompanies you for a short part of the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2221462204

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b][u]Abilities & Movement[/u][/b]
üî∏ASAMU is a non-violent platformer by all means. The game slowly brings in new abilities and mechanics so players can be accustomed to at their own pace. Abilities such as power jump, power leap, grappling hook, and jet-propelling boots make traversing an absolute joy. A fully charged hook can be shot three times before it needs recharging which is done by landing anywhere. Later on, you can earn extra charges mid-air by zapping glowing crystals so you can whizz about for even longer without landing.

[b][u]Design & Exploration[/u][/b]
üî∏You will follow Uncle Fred's trail across five locations. You may wander a grand landscape mostly divided into many smaller platforms and grapple opportunities but in fact, they're just bottomless pits with gigantic floating rocks that don't offer many variations in level design. Albeit, each location has some collectibles to unlock time trials. Story objects are a must to find to have a better understanding of the plot and several well-hidden Easter eggs and writings to decipher that probably wouldn't come to your attention the first time.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2221471832
[b][u]Platforming[/u][/b]
üî∏This section revolves around crucial timing and finding that perfect spot to launch yourself into the air. The game starts with simpler, forgiving, and easier jumps. Then it widens the gaps between them, introducing moving or collapsing platforms and keeping you in the air for a longer period to force using the hook wisely. On later stages of the game these jumps become more of a ""trial and error"" situation, signing your death certificate over and over until you luckily get past it or watch video guides. However, dying in ASAMU has no penalty and you'll respawn immediately at the last checkpoint.

üî∏[u][i]In addition to collecting all items, the story can be finished in 4 hours at a leisurely pace[/i][/u]üî∏
üî∏[u][i]100% achievement playthrough takes ~10 hours[/i][/u]üî∏


[h1][b]Graphics & Sounds[/b][/h1]
üî∏Everything looks sharp when leaning back but as soon as you get closer to the monitor, the countless number of cons will burst your bubble. Poor quality textures and effects are all over the world. Vegetation, cave interiors, the village, and all characters except Maddie and Samuel, have many sharp edges around them. Even Uncle Fred himself who is in the center of ASAMU is suffering from the low-polygons issue.

üî∏In some parts, ASAMU feels like it's straight out of 2004 but to be fair it also looks astounding in the chasms, village, and star haven chapters. From an underground village made out of humans' detritus to towns built on giant floating rocks up in the sky and shiny ice caves. Devs managed to bring life to the game's flawed world by creating a colorful environment full of small and big details.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2221462685
üî∏The voice acting crew had some memorable voices on board. Maddie's voice is joyful all the time and the narrator's is like a Swedish version of William Shatner. The music works just fine hand in hand with platforming sections but it isn't something I could write a several-paragraphs-long text about it. There are also noticeable grammatical errors and mispronunciations both in texts and voice lines in the game.

1739,"The game mechanic is pretty fun to play, map can be too dark sometimes and even though the game has a linear map, it can be confused to look for your path. Nothing much to say about the story or graphic, they're  on point I guess. Overall 7/10."
1740,Short Sorry (~3hrs) but 100% worth a play if you can pick ir up on sale
1741,This was a very beautiful game
1742,SPIDERMAN WITH ELECTRIC GRAPPLEHOOK
1743,"This is by far one of the best games that I have ever played, would highly recommend to anyone."
1744,Amazing graphic and short heart-warming story. Best one I ever had.
1745,amazing storyline
1746,"The game is slightly to hard for me. And i can imagine its way to hard for many a player. I sorely needed a way to slow down time, to aim better, to have more room to work with. The game should have a easier setting. Eventually after many a death i just became to frustrated and gave up. Never knowing how the story will end. Its a fun experience at first, but eventually its just aggrevation running rampant."
1747,"Really fun a and relaxing game, great for playing at 2 am"
1748,Way better than I expected
1749,"this game has good feels.

its like chicken soup for the heart, jump in your magic super jump suit and go fin your uncle.

9/10"
1750,Short but sweet game. Calming to play
1751,
1752,"I would not call this a masterpiece but is a good way to spend few hours. The game itself is just a platform with almost the same mechanic through all the game. but the storyline is nice.
good price for it is in my opinion under 10$"
1753,"Summary
-------------
I got this for free. I would not pay money for this game mainly because I didn't enjoy the game play.


While there were aspects of the game I liked, I got tired of the game play pretty quickly. While I enjoy playing games like Super Mario Brothers for hours, which is also a platformer, this game for whatever reason feels one dimensional and monotonous. While there are nuances to how you can move, there are basically only two things I'm doing - grappling and jumping.

The game is also non-violent (i.e. devoid of enemies) which makes the game less interesting.

Things I liked about the game:

- Nice art style, especially the character models.
- Enjoyable story telling

Things I didn't like about the game

- The world is pretty barren
- Graphics doesn't really pop
- Although the game presents itself as an adventure, all I'm doing really is jumping from rock to rock
- The game play can be a little frustrating and repetitive"
1754,"This game feels like an old children cd game with slightly improved visuals. It's worth playing once if you want to spend time challenging your precision in parkour-like games. But if you do want to try it out, wait for a price off. it might be disappointing for this price it has. 
As for me tho, I recieved this game for free and did spend some nice time beating it and getting achievments. With all my respect to the devs, I do only recommend it for low price or free times. Do not for the full price."
1755,Not bad
1756,"Incredible game. Smooth, relaxing but also fun gameplay. Story was amazing and told by an incredible voice actor."
1757,An interesting and sweet story. Fun game mechanics although sometimes it can be infuriating. Overall a nice short little game.
1758,"It is an amazing story game with amazing graphics, a good story, and you can find it to be really fun"
1759,"Where can I play it?: Steam and GOG.

Main Review: A Story About My Uncle is a first person puzzle platform game about a father telling his daughter a story about the time he went to go look for his uncle who had disappeared. His uncle is a world famous inventor and explorer and while searching through his stuff for clues on where he might have went you stumble upon some equipment that allows you to jump and grapple between platforms. You also discover the entrance to this unknown world where you will be using your jump and grapple to go deeper as you look for your uncle.

 

This game is a lot of fun and fairly easy for about two thirds of the game. The last third is actually pretty difficult and led to a lot of mess ups and cursing out of my mouth so make sure you get the mechanics down good before you get too deep into the game.

 

I originally tried to play this game about a year ago on a different non-gaming laptop and go about 40 minutes into before I needed to stop. The graphics are pretty good in this game and I would just lag a lot making myself die a ton and overall making the game not enjoyable. I'm glad however I talked myself into replying the game now that I'm using a better rig. The graphics are beautiful and their are many different a unique worlds that you explore as you progress.

 

The story is ok. It threaded throughout the gameplay but there isn't a ton of it. Enough to keep you going as you play but nothing groundbreaking for fascinating.

 

As you play through the game their is upgraded equipment that you find to enhance your abilities like being able to grapple more times or even other stuff that I wont mention so you can find out on your own! There are also hidden collectibles that you can find throughout the map if you listen closely for the sounds of a typewriter being played.

 

Once the game is beaten you are offered extra things like time trials or different modes. I tend to not go back and reply games right after I beat them so I didn't give these a try but the concept is pretty cool. This game definitely lends itself to people who enjoy speed running aspects of games so if you're into that you're gonna love this."
1760, -_-
1761,"good story, nice gameplay, mediocre textures, you also get to have a frog person on your back for a good chunk of the game :)))))"
1762,I have a story about my uncle but it involves much less grappling adventures and much more inappropriate touching
1763,"Fun background game. Saw it in a ton of commentary channels and just had to get it for my self. The little alien girl gets annoying at times, but other than that fun to just fly around.
"
1764,a great game
1765,m
1766,i have lots of stories about my uncle
1767,"Very fun and whimsical, its a straight forward game that can be completed in only a few hours. the story is cute and the gameplay is wonderful."
1768,"The art style/world and graphics were really nice, and the mechanics and platforming of the first 3/4 game are just super fun and rewarding.

The final part tho: I rage quit this because of the ridiculously difficult and unforgiving final part of the game, requiring precise mouse movement and long combinations of moves. Sometimes the valid area for placing the grappling hook is miniscule, and if you are at the end of a level that requires +8 precise moves and you're positioned a tiny bit wrong for that final valid grappling hook area... let's just say you'll be replaying that part many, many times.

As a very casual gamer, while it is rewarding to clear difficult levels, replaying the same level tens of times over and over again ultimately isn't why I play games.

So I recommend this for the atmosphere, mechanics and art style of the beginning to mid game, with the caveat that the end levels imo were too difficult for a casual gamer."
1769,"I wish the game was longer, only cop it if you're willing to replay. fun af tho"
1770,super short but it has really cool mechanics and it's fun to replay
1771,"Relaxing nice game with nice grapghic and physics.I get it free somewhere...Only thing i dont like is jumping,but htis game is full of it..so i can not have like this game..But it is nice :)"
1772,Awesome game! Super fun and an overwhelmingly story! Don't miss that jewel!
1773,"I finished this in 3.5 hours but it felt like a whole day. It had interesting mechanics but after a very short time, it became laborious and gimmicky. The voice overs were horrid and the story was uninteresting as there was never an inclination for me to care about the characters in the story or finding this uncle which is the whole point. It really just felt like several maps designed for speed runs with a haphazardly made story to tie it all together."
1774,1st Person platformer with a pretty unforgiving physics engine.

1780,I now know how it is to visit the house of a cool uncle.
1781,"TL:DR Very short gameplay, but very much worth it for the story

I am writing this review just after finishing the game. I cant remember the last time I've been so heavily invested into a campaign. It was truly a heart touching story. You'll meet so many people on different chapters, and you'll think to yourself ""meh its just a side character."" but as you progress further, you kept getting reminded of that character and how he/she is influencing your moves even two chapters later. You bond with everyone, remember them, and do the good deeds in their honor and memory. 

The loneliness you feel for the majority of the game never gets boring, rather immerses you into observing your surroundings. You'll have to just skip rocks essentially for the better half of the game, but the open skies, tiny villages, ice caves, along with soothing background noise will never let you feel bored. The environment on this game, is just something you want to experience

I'd suggest this to anyone who want to just spend the most calming and peaceful 4 hours of their year. This game, was truly a heartwarming experience.

I miss you Uncle Fred"
1782,leafy backround
1783,"This game was fun, especially with the story. -- Platforming is of course difficult, but still quite interesting and unique!"
1784,"A good game, Much quicker than expected. Fairly wholesome, a bit cliche at some points. I wouldnt really play for the story. I found out about the game because lots of youtubers play it in the background of their videos. Decent replay value with collecetibles that offer new ways to play."
1785,when i swing i feel like a monkey and it is truly one of my favorite games monkey/10
1786,"Great game, cannot recommend this one enough!"
1787,Enjoyable.
1788,fun
1789,"The visuals of this game are pretty good (except for the people). I find most of the game calming, just not the harder parts. It's a nice and simple game."
1790,"Noooo uncle pleasee, i don't want to go to Brasil"
1791,Uncle has frog fetish.
1792,it was a good game. Short and some of the puzzles were a bit harder then I thought they were. tons of trial and error but touching game. unfortunately not really a ton of replay value so uninstalling it now.
1793,"This is a simple game with a deceptively simple game mechanic. Navigating through the levels is so enjoyable it isn't even frustrating when you end up doing the same bit ten times before getting it right. It's simply that much pure fun. It also weaves in a really nice, little story."
1794,Only about two hours of content but still enjoyable.

1797,its ok
1798,"It's alright, a pretty short, pretty simple game where you grapple around while being told a bedtime story."
1799,very nice
1800,"Short, sweet, hella fun. That is all."
1801,enjoyed it.
1802,This game is 6 years old and it still looks and plays extremely nicely. It's easily the best parkour-based game I've played. The movement is super smooth and satisfying.
1803,"I won this game in a raffle on a twitch stream.  I had never heard anything about it and didn't look anything up before playing it.  I enjoyed the music and the story, which I believe is the intention of this game.  The gameplay is not difficult.  I actually really enjoyed the narration and I wish there was a bit more in the game.  Overall, I would recommend this game to others."
1804,"The creatures creep me out.

Good game"

1807,I Actually Enjoyed This Game Its Good To Just Chill And Play This Game And it Has A Short Story Too 8/10
1808,"Overall, the game was fun. I feel like the puzzles and story were great except at the end. The story got stagnant. There was no progression and then it threw the ending at you, which was a bit anticlimactic in my opinion. To leave the plot ambiguous with no spoilers, I feel like the ending should've been harder and more risky. Not worth the $15, but definitely worth the play. I think I got this in some sort of bundle, so I'd try to go with something like that to save money."

1810,"One of the best games i ever played. Very good ending, overall a great game with great mechanics and history.

The only bad thing is that the game is very very short, i completed it in 5 hours."
1811,"first hour or so was fun jumping around, meeting some NPCs and so on, but slowly it became very repeating. sometimes is not realy clear where to jump at firs, sometimes the jumps are just hard to make. in the end its very, very boring. cant recomend."
1812,"The story was amusing. Unfortunately, it is just too short. The ending was quite disappointing. After protractedly venturing the strange floating islands looking for someone, he told me to leave just after a very short chit-chat. Could use a proper ending. The well-turned graphic is very indulgent. NPC --frog people-- texture is horrendous.

1815,"- Very fun first-person platforming
- Nice little story
- Interesting storytelling

- Takes only around a couple hours to beat the game
- Story can often feel like it's interrupting the game
- Questionable voice acting at times"
1816,"When [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty]Rick[/url] goes missing, Morty steals a power suit and enters Rick's Trash Can Dimension, where Morty is too naive to realize [spoiler]an sentient species was uplifted from amphibians purely to separate out the recycling[/spoiler], so Beth would finally shut up about it.
Five stars for portraying sociopathic misanthropy through the hero-worshipping eyes of a child.

In terms of gameplay, Faith has stolen Rico's grapple-gun.  Grapple to the ground to slow down!
That's the only string to its bow, but it's a fun string, so why not?"
1817,platforming wasnt that fun
1818,"I found this game by googling ""game with hand as grappling hook"""
1819,"weird frog people, but nice story"
1820,"its ight, gets boring fast but looks good enough to keep you intrigued."
1821,Good Game.
1822,just fun flying around
1823,"Short ,but sweet platforming experience with a memorable story.  Pick it up on a sale"
1824,gud commentary backround
1825,"This is an AWESOME game with great story, beautiful gameplay, and dynamic mechanics. My only complaint is that it's difficult to get some consistency when jumping around rockier or dark areas."
1826,"A Simple game but once you start chasing the extra secrets, you can start to have some real challenging fun, they've put a lot of work into the out-of-the-way"" stuff. so if you see a branching path, Take It! have your own adventure along the way."

1829,Yes
1830,VERY HOT UNCLE
1831,"Smooth gameplay, stunning yet simplistic visuals, and compelling story. I'm comfortable saying this is the best game I've ever played. Well worth full price, and I managed to get it for just $4."
1832,"do you think the frog girl gets embarrassed when she excretes mucus on the main characters back sorry if this offends anyone but i thought it was a funny thing haha

and i would like to know if any of you have any pics of her excreting mucus while she looks nervous or embarrassed i just want to see it for a few laughs haha

another thing i am wondering is do you think the mucus smells haha im just courious for laughs haha"
1833,good i think
1834,good
1835,"cool game, finished it like 5 times so far"
1836,fun! very short though - took me 2 hours
1837,Map at the start of the game did not have New Zealand
1838,Damn this game made me shed a tear would recommend
1839,"Nerve wracking, infuriating and hard, those three words describe the game perfectly. The story is good but the game is a bit glitchy at some parts but overall good.
P.S if you get any achievements you are either a tryhard or a completionist"
1840,this game is epic
1841,good
1842,Beautiful game with great movement
1843,very calming
1844,Floaty platformer with lightning grappling hooks and icelandic smurfs.
1845,Great for an indie title - game is fairly short taking approximately 3 hours to complete but the mechanics are well-implemented and easy to understand. Would recommend buying on sale.
1846,"mechanics are cool but a bit frustrating, the only thing pushing me to continue was knowing that the game was pretty short so I could finish it. I wouldn't play again or really recommend it to others"
1847,"Cute little game, quite engaging but I like the original concept!"
1848,its good
1849,"3 hours
lol"
1850,Leuke game
1851,Great game.  A little short but the story and the platforming are really worth it.
1852,"i did played it... yeah..... but with a gun on my head....












i mean i was curious about the ending...
































no i was not he is still here HELP!! call 911"
1853,"Fun game, very floaty and easy to use controls. Nice story. I only got stuck a couple times but could get out using the abilities, and didn't have to reset. The free ones and this are very similar, except this game runs better and has better atmosphere. I would recommend you play this game."
1854,"Its pretty cool, aged well."
1855,Just buy it bro
1856,i wish there was a maddie mute button cuz that bitch annoying af
1857,"An excellent game which is worth the price. It's only for a few hours (about 4 hours during my 1st playthrough).
The story is pretty interesting, and it's a fun and relaxing game (other than a few scenes near the end which imo is a bit harder) but overall a fantastic game!"
1858,relaxing gameplay and a beautiful story/ atmosphere
1859,FRED
1860,"fun and challenging game, its quite short but worth the price. Would recomended"
1861,"This game is amazing. Beautiful visuals, gripping story, and challenging gameplay. This has to be one of my favorite platformers by far, and my favorite indie game ever."
1862,"A Story About My Uncle creates a beautiful world that is such a thrill to run around in. Grappling across vast distances and jumping from great heights is extremely satisfying as the ground cracks beneath your feet. Most of the story has a serene feel and your exploration is rewarded through the objects you find. There aren't many characters since the game is only about 3 hours long but what they represent is what matters here. Beyond the story, there is replay value that comes from the time trial mode which challenges your platforming skills. If you are looking for a hidden gem in gaming, then put your rocket boots on and take your greatest leap! Game on."
1863,A great short game for anyone looking for a simple single player story game with great game play mechanics!
1864,Outstanding scenery which includes a decent obstacle gameplay
1865,"This game is exceptionally beautiful. The entire scenario of every area is so unique and everything out of the dark is just breathtaking to see. The story, although not the most complex or though out, is wholesome, emotional, specially the end.
The mechanics are interesting and adds a challenging portion to the game that is more than unique and intriguing. Lots of trial and error, but I think that's part of the fun of exploring the mechanics. 
Coffee Stain Studios really surprised me with this one and I can't wait to see what else they bring even similar to this. My congratulations to all the team and everyone involved."
1866,Uh Epic game get it!
1867,"I got it for 1‚Ç¨, it¬¥s a relaxing platformer. Really nothing special but got it¬¥s charm and worth up to 5‚Ç¨ so wait for a sale."
1868,"my uncle was cool, he had FOUR soda machines"
1869,nice
1870,The game itself is good and short. Wouldn't pay the full price for it.
1871,"(This game was a gift from a friend)

[h1]The Good[/h1]
‚Ä¢ The environment of ASAMU is actually really pretty. The textures are attractive, the 3d platforms look really organic, and it's just overall well-done.
‚Ä¢ The grappling mechanic is pretty neat. The physics tied to it seem to be relatively sound most of the time, and it seems relatively unique.
‚Ä¢ The story is sci-fi and told as a bedtime story about the narrator's past. I thought the framing was pretty neat.

A pretty small list unfortunately.

[h1]Everything Else[/h1]
‚Ä¢ The Voice Overs are absolutely horrendous. It sounds like English is a second language to literally everyone who voiced this game, and it [i]sounds[/i] like they're reading from a script with all of the weird, out of place pauses: like they had to take a moment to turn the page in the middle of their sentence.
‚Ä¢ The character models are rather ugly. They remind me of late PS2 era models. While I'm not a stickler for graphics, it definitely makes a game that's poor in other areas look worse.
‚Ä¢ The ending is lackluster. I expected more after this ""long"" journey of searching for your uncle, what you get is just disappointing.
‚Ä¢ The game is both very linear and yet difficult to find which direction you're going at certain points, especially when you're supposed to jump into a chasm (which usually kills you) so that you can grapple onto the ceiling of a ledge below you to continue on.
‚Ä¢ Some of the Time Trial expectations are INSANE, and probably impossible when using a controller.

I'm probably missing some, but in my opinion the bad outweighs the good way too much for me to recommend this game to anyone."
1872,good game if you like cs surfing and or flying

1880,got it for free wasnt dissappointed
1881,actually a good game
1882,Design is absolutely terrible.
1883,good
1884,great story
1885,"I'd give a neutral review if I could.

The game is pretty, and kind of relaxing, but everything else is kind of bland.

The story, the characters, the motivation, even the scenery itself. I played for about 40 minutes and it just didn't catch my attention or imagination much.

I'd give it exactly 5/10, it's just not for me."
1886,"A wonderfully enjoyable experience, mostly tight controls with beautiful visuals even on lower settings only with the occasional frustration. The game isn't perfect, with the sometimes confusing directions, but never to a point that the game stood out too negatively. Despite those however, the game delivers a heartfelt story with well designed grapple-based parkour to accompany. Would definitely recommend to my friends had they not already played it."
1887,"my uncle was a great guy until i found out he wasn't


"
1888,"Good story and very enjoyable gameplay. For a free game it was beyond my expectations. The story didn't last that long, but it was worth my time. I'd recommend it 11/10."

1890,Good game
1891,"Amazing Game
"
1892,"Fun Game. Great Story, If you like puzzles you will like this game"
1893,"Starts out fine and rather charming too in the first zone.
Save points are plenty, you can see where you jump and there is generally a fun time.

Then as you progress through the zones things slowly start to go wrong. Starting in the floating islands outdoor zone.  

Jumps become longer and longer, and more extreme combos are needed. ""Okay"" you think, ""must be near the end game, so that's why"" and muscle through.

Then you hit the last and largest zone. The ice caves. And ooooooh boy things go wrong there until they simply break plain down.

Save points go missing, often 2 or 3, and jumps become abusive.

Many of them requiring blind jumping where the player has no idea where anything after the first grapply point is and their length suddenly increases to 3x or more the number of combos required until then.

It is clear the designers had no idea when to stop or what to do.

So instead of wrapping up they simply copy + pasted jumps to be 3x longer and with no save points.

Being stubborn I hung in there and fought through 95% of it. But eventually my patience gave up and I had to ask myself if this was fun or served a purpose anymore.

Answer was a NO. 

So decided to view last 10 mins of the game on youtube and spent an August Saturday in the sun instead.

Real shame. 

It was such a nice game until it went over the edge."
1894,"Beautiful storyline and graphics, 100% worth it. I was immersed in a fantasy world while playing this game. It was just spectacular."
1895,Not bad as a free game igot it when steam drop it or humble bundle i think  if u have it maybe try it in free time
1896,Youtube made me buy this.
1897,"Great story, great visuals, very fun gameplay. Little bit short but i still think its worth the price"
1898,Thanks Leafy for this game wow this game is fun
1899,a good single player indie game with an interesting and catching story
1900,Such a short and fun game to play as long as you can handle platforming. For myself the highlight of this game was actually the final level where i noticed that there exists a lot of shortcuts in that level which is true for multiple levels if you dare to test the limits of characters momentum.
1901,Very cute story with a good platformer feel. I love this game and will always come back to it!
1902,its a really good game with a great story I highly recommend getting it
1903,"Boring and repetitive platformer with nothing more than grapple, superjump and rocketjump. Worse thing is, if they added combat, it would be worse. Dated graphics, awkward voice acting, lacklustre effects, hardly any graphics settings and uninteresting story. Save your time and your money - buy a different platformer."
1904,very good game I recommend it.
1905,Shit checkpoint system
1906,Csgo serf
1907,7.5
1908,goods stuff jump and grappl
1909,best parkour game out there 100% recommend
1910,"Solid game that has challenging parkour that is also enjoyable, also has an decent story."
1911,"A short, but fun game that can be very beautiful at times.
Gameplay wise, game is all about movement. You play in first person using a combination of a grappling hook (not purely physics based), some augmented jump abilities and one other movement mechanic that you unlock later.

I found this game quite satisfying to play, I particularly enjoyed it at the end of the day as a way to unwind.

Difficulty: easy-medium.

This could be a good game to follow from Portal to teach beginner mouse users how to aim."
1912,"Amazing game, truly beautiful and captivating"
1913,It is impossible to know when a grappling for a rock will work and when not (I played on Mac so maybe PC-Mac difference) but is very frustrating since this is the core mechanic of the game.
1914,"very good i wish i had a uncle 
"
1915,"fun to jump around with, bad story but cute character conversations, makes me wanna be an uncle"
1916,Exceptionally fun 3d platformer
1917,"Great indie platformer, and that's coming from a guy who doesn't usually like platformers. The game is quite short, you can finish it in 3 or less hours, the jumping can be a little janky at times, but is usually quite good. The story is very engaging, and surprising good for a platformer. I would give it a 7/10"
1918,fun
1919,"A short game, sometimes glitchy, but a very good game.
The story is sad, amazing and breathtaking. The story does not need to be long to feel like a life-long adventure.
I'd recommend to buy this, but i wont force your choice.

For those who have just bought this game and haven't played, 
you're in for a world of mysterious and amazing adventure, pal."

1926,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME.GOOD GRAPHICS AMAZING STORYLINE EMOTIONAL RELAXING OUT OF THIS WORLD NO JOKE
1927,Very good game in my opinion.
1928,Nice short story
1929,"This game may be short but you can play it again and again and still have fun, i do wish there was a community workshop so that more levels of the game could be made."
1930,"I enjoyed A Story About My Uncle. It was inexpensive (2 - 3‚Ç¨ or so) and offered a sufficiently challenging experience despite the mechanics being easy to take up. The game is very accesible to new gamers, which I think is good!
The art style is appealing and the environments and story are very well designed. It's a short game, but I feel like it's the perfect length. I didn't experience any game breaking bugs, but some of the grapples between windmills or similar can get frustrating ;)
Without striving to complete specific challenges I spent about 3 hours in game. I suppose that's an average duration to complete the entire story.

#goatmode"
1931,Art style was gorgeous. The story was very sweet and wholesome. The lighting was amazing and the the game play was relaxing. Highly recommend!
1932,"Very enjoyable, but a bit short. I think I finished it in about 2 1/2 hours. I can definitely recommend this to anyone, unless they hate platformers. It's got a lot of freedom of navigation, and an adorable companion for 2 of the chapters. There were only a couple places in the ice level where the game forces you to slow down and take one path. Other than that there's many ways to get through each section."
1933,"I discovered this game when I needed it most, and it's always going to be one of my favorites. I'll keep this short. The story is simple but acts as a backup to the immersive gameplay and soundtrack. You'll finish in less than 2 hours, but the Time Trials mode gives you medals and neat bonus features as you get better. There's real skill involved in the gameplay, too. After more than 2 1/2 years of owning this game, I still, to this day, hop in and just let the atmosphere heal emotional wounds and immerse me in a really beautiful place. It's worth your time."
1934,Very fun with good story. pretty short though. casual run ~3 hours
1935,very good game
1936,"The game has beautiful dreamscapes and the movement is fluid. The story is kinda nice. The atmosphere is relaxing and chill.
Definitely worth a buy if on sale, as the game itself is pretty short."
1937,"MUITO BOM,MDS"
1938,"A Story About My Uncle is all right - Neither terrible or great.  The grapple mechanic was pretty cool, and the environments were decently pretty, but the story was basically non-existent and the pacing was definitely rushed.  The controls also took a lot of getting used to.  Honestly, there wasn't a lot of substance here."
1939,Awful leap doesn't work 90% of the time. It makes the game awful.
1940,Beautiful game. Thoroughly enjoyed
1941,iz good
1942,"Good game, a sequel would be nice."
1943,"I like this game and I want to recommend it but... it falls flat in so many areas. 

So pros; fun platforming, relaxing, simple to follow along and challenging while not being overly hard. Despite this I feel there are a lot of areas that this game just doesn't measure up, I went into this game with zero expectations having never heard of it before and felt like I was constantly waiting for the 'fun' bit to start. When you first receive the jump and the grappling hook I got really excited as I thought the game would then start building on the pretty solid movement system, however what really happened was that I got one more movement item and then the game was basically over. Maybe I'm spoiled by playing Ori and the Will of the Whisps but the amount of options for movement felt like it fell way short and like it had the potential to become so much more. This is also in my mind the best part of the game, which sadly means the rest just wasn't that great. 

The story was very very flat and predictable and I didn't really get an emotional connection of any kind to this 'Maddie' character. The reunion with the Uncle was boring and went pretty much exactly like expected, I feel like the story hit way too many over done tropes, like the disapproving elder and *Spoiler* Maddie choosing to stay with the strays, which you could see coming a mile away. This isn't to say any of this is bad rather it was just quite lackluster for a supposedly story driven game. Part of this I feel like is due to the fact this game is just so short you really don't have much time to get connected with these characters, I really thought there would be some sort of follow up as the ending happened so quickly I didn't expect it at all. 

Some more things, the models aren't great, but that didn't really break immersion and the controls felt a bit slippery at times as well. Not much lore, felt like the world could have been explored a lot more. Also at one point the game rewards you by giving back an item it took away from you, which was just plain frustrating. Also voice acting is hit and miss.

This feels like the sort of game which would be great with a sequel that builds on the foundation they have here, however for $20 I just don't really recommend it. It felt like it just never quite reached the atmosphere it was trying to create and has weak replayability. Final verdict is to get it if it goes on sale and you want to kill a couple hours of your time, but don't expect anything groundbreaking."
1944,This game has the best story I've played so far after Titanfall 2. I highly recommend this game and you will NOT regret listening to me.
1945,Wonderful story and great gameplay :)
1946,Good but short. (2 hours on my first playthrough.)
1947,Like premature sex. Gud but short.
1948,"Honestly amazing story 10\10
every 6 months or so i replay this game, i cry everytime. im not joking, EVERY TIME"
1949,"Leafy played this
I play it
You consider playing it
play it"
1950,This game is so cool with an amazing backstory
1951,Fun
1952,i like v much it good game :)
1953, a first person platforming adventure game with good controls and great world building. 15$ might be a bit much for 2 ~ 4 hours of content but this is definitely a steal if it's on sale
1954,A story about my uncle is a wonderful game as you can see i have put up to 20+ hours in this game because it is so fun. Even after completing the game there is so much to do i recommend playing this game on a rainy night open the window and smell the breeze of the nice water mist with a hot glass of chocolate milk and japense lofi in the back. This game is so calming it helps me think clearly love this game would buy 10/10 again!
1955,Not accurate with my story about my uncle
1956,laser go burrrrr
1957,"Amazing short story line, but endless replayability in the stock form and in speedruns."
1958,"Awesome indie game, i just play all together and i finished that. One of my favourites"
1959,"Great little game, With a great story. The graphics are a bit dated but don't let that stop you. You'll enjoy this!"
1960,I wish this was the experience I had with my Uncle
1961,Takes about an hour to finish but its pretty fun
1962,"I wish more games were like this one. Sure it's kinda short, but the gameplay is super tight and the aesthetic of the game is really pleasant. Music is pretty minimal and fits the game well, some songs remind me of the Dustforce soundtrack. My only criticism is that I feel like one more level for this game would have made it even better. At the end of the day, this is joining the ranks of Dustforce, Noita, Hotline Miami, Fez, Binding of Isaac and a bunch of others in my favorite indie game folder. I definitely recommend it at even $15 if you're into skill based movement. I really hope the developers make some kind of sequel or something that uses these mechanics because they're super fun."
1963,"There is a lot of good aspects to this game, the actual use of the grapple is interesting and overall fun. I did however, find the natural progression a bit odd at time not always being 100% obvious. Also I am a little annoyed that all the achievements bar one (I think) are outside the storyline and instead in the time run game mode. Not essential but I would have liked to get rewarded after each world segment. Recommended to buy this game when on sale as it was quite fun with a couple of easter eggs.
7/10"
1964,"Very original First Person Platformer with very nice mechanics, good graphics, good performance. good 32:9 support, nice story, voice acting, etc.

You should at least try it."
1965,"I spent three hours of my life playing this and it made me leave my first ever steam review.

Fuck this game and it's shitty ass ending."
1966,"It feels like this game was made for speedrunners. Anyway, it's good to play for 2.5 hours."
1967,Very interesting movement and gameplay for a platformer.
1968,"fun game. little short, but fun"
1969,yee
1970,Very well made.
1971,Very short but a lot of fun; the underlying message adds a whole new perspective. Highly recommend.

1975,"i strongly reccomend this game if you are looking for a short adventure, with a bittersweet ending,"
1976,poopbutt
1977,"i speedrun it every day
"
1978,"Found it in my library and didn't remember where I got it from, so I just installed it.
Storytelling is good and gameplay is fun, although I got stuck in a few spots.
Graphics look very dated and it isn't that long so I really wouldn't recommend it at full price."
1979,"I played it through in 4 hours of streaming.. so you can probably do it in 3, its a parkour game where you use mouse clicks to jump.. so expect many runs into the void as you try to big jump with the spacebar :P
But that said I can see that this has quite a high replay value, most levels look to have multiple routes (tho some just have corner cuts) and the time trial mode is a fun run through the story levels
Graphics are not the strongest part of the game, but that's cool

"
1980,"Great little game, With a great story.

"
1981,"very good game sad tooooooooo
"
1982,"Really good game, love it. but they should add VR-support, i would even pay for that"
1983,Amazing story. Very immersive gameplay and very interesting and novel movement mechanics.
1984,The gameplay is very fun and fluid and the story is decent too
1985,"Game is fun, challenging, and a very nice experience. Completed the game in 2 hours tho so playtime is a lil short."
1986,I like it :) Really chill game with nice gameplay.
1987,"Subtitles don't work, was continually forced to sit through sections that I couldn't interact with."
1988,"This Game Is So Much Fucking Fun, And It Has No Fucking Dlc's That Cost So Much Fucking Money, This Game Is Worth The Fifteen Dollars, this game is a 10/10, But If Your Not Good At Finding Your Way Around Maybe Stick With A Guide But Other Then That This Game Should Be Pretty Simple And Easy And Most People Shouldn't Need A Guide, But This Game I Would Recommend To Most People"
1989,short but was very enjoyable
1990,is good
1991,game mechanics are really fun but leaves a lot to be desired in length. there is time trials with all the different maps throughout the game which is kinda cool. definitely try and pick this up on a sale if you can as i feel that its way too sort of a game for 15 dollars.
1992,chill game
1993,Really fun but too short
1994,I was lucky enough to get this whilst it was free. It is quite short but the grappling and jumping is just really satisfying. I'd say wait until its on sale for under a fiver if you have a platforming itch that needs scratching.
1995,"Short and sweet. Although, I got it when it was on sale for... uhh.... 5 bucks, I think?? Do not buy it at full price, it's honestly not worth it at 15 bucks. Wait till it goes on sale for 5 bucks, 10 at the max."
1996,Great game with nice story. I played it multiple times and I am gonna do it again :)
1997,good game.
1998,"An incredibly short, but decent story with incredible movement that I really enjoyed.

Is it worth $15? No. There's only a few hours of story and I don't really see anyone wanting to replay it. If it's on sale, go for it."
1999,"Short but sweet. I really enjoyed playing this game.
Pros: Story is great, world is beautiful, mechanics are simple and great, levels are challenging enough especially if you go for achievements.

Cons: Almost half of achievements are related to grapple usage count, but there is no such indicator/counter in-game, I find that really bad."
2000,"Completed the game in 2 Hours, and let me just say... I had a blast.
I love games that let me jump and do all sorts of things like Mirror's Edge, but this was completely different.
I sometimes stopped just to look at all the small houses and villages floating on these big islands.

This game is truly a masterpeice, the story of the game is so cute. You're re-living the story that you as the father is telling your daughter before she goes to bed. You're telling (as the game's title) The Story about your uncle
The game is basically you (dad) when you're young, is trying to find your Uncle in this world that he created.

it only took 2 hours to complete it but it felt like i was on a never ending journey.
It felt like I played the game for 7 hours, and i never got tired of it... Except for when i was spending like 20min trying to win Maddie's stupid challenge.

Summary: If you just want a good game with a cute and good story then this is a good game for you
10/10 in my opinion
(I would rate it 9/10 bcz the NPC'S walk so stupidly but i'm fine with it bcz it is kinda funny)"
2001,funny
2002,NICE GAME
2003,"pretty nice parkour is fun a couple puzzles were challenging but never impossible a lot of commentary youtubers play this in the background, its a good game would be nice if they released a 2nd one bc this one is so short. the character face models were kind of gross but you have to understand this was a student project at first so im shocked its this good. its got longevity if wanna speed run it."
2004,Chill game to play when bored
2005,My sister gifted me this game as she had loved it so much years previously.  I really enjoyed the flow and gameplay although there are some rage-quitty moments!
2006,The game was honestly really really good. The graphics looked really well done and I enjoyed playing it despite some difficult challenges. The game isn't too long and I finished it in under 10 hours
2007,"This game is really really good. It may not have fight scenes or aggressive gameplay but that's the point of this game, it's the most relaxing game I've ever played, and the story is so wholesome. You just swing and grapple on to things satisfyingly to the end goal. If you've ever imagined what it would be like to swing on things like spider man this is your game xD
"
2008,Short but fun.
2009,good
2010,this game sucks so bad. I recommend :)
2011,"I wish grappling hook was better made. On land range seems to be 200km and accept any anchor point, but when you are actually using it it's like max 1meter + wont stuck to anything."
2012,bruh
2013,Short and Sweet
2014,"Great story , fun to play but too short . wanted more of it :D"
2015,"Blew through it in less than 2 hours, and the platforming would sometimes feel a bit more annoying than challenging. Probably a good portion of my 2 hours was just trying to explore a little and see if there was any interesting lore to find. I was waiting for a bit more story throughout the game, but it's short and simple, though I may have just had my expectations a bit too high. It's certainly not a bad game, but I don't think I'd recommend it to a friend unfortunately.  They threw in some interesting platforming mechanics, but I didn't feel like they really capitalized on them enough."
2016,A game of jaw-dropping beauty and relaxing gameplay. Absolutely would recommend it!
2017,i jump with stuff out of my hand good game 10/10 would play again
2018,"Cool game, similar to Mirror's Edge."
2019,¬≠
2020,yessir
2021,good game
2022,"Very short, pretty good. Reminded me of Portal, but with a grappling hook and high jump boots. It was quite relaxing playing and relatively forgiving for mistakes with frequent checkpoints. Easy to learn controls.
There were some frustrating parts that I had to repeat numerous times to get right, especially ""maddies challenge"". 

Overall, very good game. Good graphics, good sound, considering the age. Love the narrators voice.

Highly recommend to buy on discount!"
2023,goood
2024,The definition of nostalgia
2025,"Came looking to just blow some time on a random platformer, stayed for the nice story. 8/10 Solid 2-3 hours worth of gameplay."
2026,"Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can"
2027,"Great game! 100% recommend buying it. Don't pirate it, the devs really deserve the money because although this game is a bit short, it is definitely worth the money"
2028,leafy brought me here
2029,"Very interesting concept, touching story & fun gameplay. One gripe is that it's a bit too short. If you enjoy speedrunning there is a mode specifically for that which could add some replayability."
2030,a very interesting platformer with a good story being it told as a bedtime story. i've enjoyed it pretty well thus far and look forward to finishing the title as time allows
2031,Really enjoyed this game. Beat it in 3.4 hours. Story was pretty basic but enjoyable. Fun game to kill a few hours. Really unique gameplay.
2032,I didn't mind the short story. The level design is amazing. Would probably get more playtime if community maps were available.
2033,"Lovely story, smooth gameplay, gorgeous environments. If anything, too short.

Glad that the autosave is so good, otherwise I would hate this game."
2034,"A short, first-person platformer with a single mechanical gimmick (a grappling beam) that you use to leap and slingshot from floating platform to floating platform. As strong as this central gimmick is, there are too many significant issues to make it a completely enjoyable experience.

The jumbled story, such as it is, is more of an annoying and unnecessary distraction from all of the jumping and swinging. And across its short run-time, I spent more time fighting against the game's physics and world geometry than I did having unencumbered fun. 

When the game works, it feels fantastic; unfortunately, there are simply too few of those moments."
2035,"Wow, a compelling narration-driven story that left me wanting more. Very short considering I completed it in under two hours, but it's due to how well the environments and accompanying gameplay were designed, with careful consideration that guides players to get creative. No ""puzzles"" were ever too tricky to figure out, and the first-person movement feels very free. Despite a lack for much replay value, game does not disappoint."
2036,"I would describe this game as beautiful, in all the ways that can be applied. Short and easy (only took me less than 3 hours to complete) but well worth it, and this is coming from someone who doesn't play many singleplayer games anymore; it reminded me of the nostalgic feeling of games from the ~2004 era like Prey, Half-Life 2 and the like."
2037,"It was a fun short parkour game with a nice and interesting story.
If you want to relax play this game, you will not regret.
"
2038,"- beta
- Bugsy Melone"
2039,GOOD
2040,"While the npc models and animations are a bit dicey and some parts of stages don't have proper clipping the gameplay is great and the short story, while not enthralling, is decent too."
2041,"[h1]Grapple through the Floating Islands[/h1]

A Story About My Uncle is a indie puzzle platformer about a Nephew who narrates to his daughter the time he had to cross into another world to find his lost uncle. Grapple onto ledges and rocks which gravitates you and traverse multiple levels of beautiful landscapes mostly involving levitating rocks and floating islands. It's great fun as a puzzler with a short and sweet story.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Lovely Graphics
- Fun Gameplay
- Five distinct locations with a starting and ending story scene
- Fun Bonuses
- Cute Story

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The story is relatively short, you'll have moments in-between puzzles to have characters talk and so because of that if you can speed through it, the average length is 3-4 hours. Which is nice but i would've preferred to have a couple more chapters or at least a level designer so we can make our own puzzles.Also on replaying the levels i wish there was a way to skip dialogue scenes.
- The voice-acting for everyone else is fine, but i've noticed the main character you play as is a bit weird in areas.
- Spoilers for End of Game [spoiler]The epilogue part of the game is rather quick, it's essentially you finding your uncle, he spouts how he created the frog people, and then he tells you to leave. It's rather weird considering you spend the whole game trying to find him and you're instantly out. And on the otherside, there's an after credits scene where you have to walk through the uncle's laboratory and it's just exposition for a heartfelt ending, but for how short the game is, i never really felt it.[/spoiler]

[h1]My Rating: 9/10[/h1]"
2042,Great game. Very satisfying to just swing around and the game has an acceptable story too. Very fun and would definitely recommend.
2043,very good story game
2044,A great game with a great story it's too good for it's price and I'm sad that they didn't do a second game to continue the story some bugs but won't affect gameplay 9.5/10
2045,its basically budget spiderman but its good
2046,Good for some music and chill. Story is meh but the 'swing' mechanics are satisfying.
2047,leafy
2048,"The gameplay and base mechanics are super fun, flying around grappling to things and the puzzles are pretty cool. The story is pretty simple and straightforward with not a ton of depth but the gameplay and parkour makes up for it. I ended up refunding it for 5 bucks because I finished it in about an hour and a half. If this game had a way for people to make maps or create levels it would be way better. I recommend it because even if it's short the gameplay is amazing and super satisfying. I think the price is a bit high, like I said if there was some short of workshop integration it would be way better.

TL;DR extremely smooth, satisfying gameplay, story and levels are pretty short and game is over before you know it. Still enjoyable though"
2049,Is a short game but very pleasant to play
2050,Fun little parkour type adventure with pleasant graphics. Playthrough takes rougly 2 to 3 hours and achievements give nice challenge if you want to continue playing.
2051,"nice game, wasnt for the story, rather gameplay"
2052,"i've heard ""i bet you cant do alll this without you grapple hook."" 84 times."
2053,it feels so good to just swing around

2055,"As a grappling hook enthusiast I was just looking for more grappling hook games to play, but wow. The story is very sweet and just what I needed right now with all the stress of college. I'll give this a solid 10/10 if you are even thinking about getting this game just do yourself a favor and get it."
2056,"When I originally bought the game, I only had a laptop that would blue screen and overheat from trying to run it. :( 
Eventually I built a desktop and was finally able to play it through to the end. The story is adorable and really captures your imagination. The parkour parts did get a little frustrating at times and I was on one section for a WHILE, sometimes failing at parts I had already passed, but I didn't want to use the upgrade cuz Maddie challenged me and I will absolutely take a double dog dare in a video game. On that note, I love Maddie."
2057,"Fun and heartwarming game, loved it!"
2058,cool
2059,"I'll start with the fact that ""A story about my uncle"" is beautiful, it's a big and wonderful world and you want to explore it. The details in this world makes it even better. One of these details are the notes that you find laying around. They explain some miner things about the towns and about Fred and i think this gives the world so much more depth.
While we're on the subject of details, why would you make a alphabet that's fake? I'd love to learn it and read the different things that are spread out threw the world. I mean they even have a book in the game that says witch letter is witch, but every time i tried to use it the sentences didn't make sense. Another thing that bugs me are the frog creatures, there modelling is so bad in comparison to the rest of the game i wish they could use more time on them. They have big eyes that stares in to your soul and it ruins a lot for me. Because of this the towns feel un-lively and deserted. And i can't forget about the hair on some of these characters, it looks awful, it's if you just put a mop on there head and said ""done"".
Enough about the astethics , what's the story? Well the story is pretty simpel, you're the nephew of an adventurer called Fred who hasn't been seen for a while. So you go to his house, only to find out he's not there. You also find a suit and because you're a brat who doesn't respect others property you put it on. Then you continue to his lab and end up on a platform that sends you to a new world. Your mission is now to find Fred your uncle. I like the story, it's simpel with somewhat of a twist at the end that i won't spoil, even tho i'm not sure it's even a spoiler. I do have a problem and it's not as much as a problem with the story as the voices and the dialog. The dialog is so akward at some times. It feels so false and forced. The only voice i enjoyed was Freds voice. It fitted him pefectly and so did his dialog.
The gameplay is pretty straight forward, but so much fun. The main mechanic in this game is that you got a suit that can shoot a beam at almost any surface and you get sucked to that surface, but once you used that one beam you got none left until you land on solid ground. You can upgrade it to have 3 beams. It's a really fun mechanic that doesn't get old. Now this isn't the only thing to keep you occupied, we also get a jetpack upgrade later in the game that lets you fly for about 20 seconds in one direction. When you use the jetpack you get the greatest feel ever. It's kinda hard to explain, but you feel like the most awesome kid in the street.
All in all this game is great and it'll probably last about 3 hours for players that's good at first person platformers and 5 hours for newer people to the genra. It also has a time traile mod that gives it a little replay-value."
2060,"A great game. After the story line (which is great) , you can do time trials on certain parts of the story.

100% recommend.

*Friendly advice , do the time trials while listening to lo-fi music*"

Really good, relaxing (non violent) game, with chill piano music and really interesting gameplay that certainly got me hooked. Is it one of the best games i have ever played? No, but i will surely cherish the memory of playing it.

-CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 2.80GHz

2062,:()
2063,Fun and very playable game.
2064,"Unique movement, challenging levels, and a good story."
2065,good relaxing game
2066,Annoying gameplay. Character models look awful. Environments are decent. Bonus cringe: the companion is a young girl who is inexplicably great at science and is oppressed by a patriarch.
2067,gut
2068,Can beat this game in under 2 hours refund friends :)
2069,"Wanna play a game where you get slingshotted around a map and tossed into a the void like a chaotic rabid animal?

Well look no further. There's a great story behind this Indie game as well as amazingly smooth gameplay. There area also collectables that unlock something which I never got around to doing myself. But other than that great game to play. It takes a few hours to complete. But there is so much to explore on different routes. You also have the chance of doing speedruns for this as there is a community for this. 

Worth a buy and a play for the story alone.

2073,"Good game with a touching story.

Great value Spider/Iron-Man tells a story to his daughter before sleep about his one and only Uncle Ben and how he traveled across the world using his Spider Abilities.

also [spoiler]frog[/spoiler] people :o"
2074,that uncle was dope
2075,Leafyishere
2076,"Good for background, beautiful story and graphics, epic gameplay"
2077,"different and good, wanted more from the story but the gameplay is great"
2078,Fantastic views i was just wondering if anyone could tell me why there's so many red lines.
2079,amazing and chill game
2080,"The game is both relaxing and satisfying to play. The story is also very nice. The controls are easy to get used to, and the overall difficulty wasn't high at all. 

Rating: 8/10"
2081,Nice and short game that is very fun and relaxing. Movement feels great and is very polished as should be in this type of game and the story is also quite good. I didnt find any area particularly too difficult or too easy. Pick this game up while its on sale as its quite short only taking me 2.5hrs to finish but still a game I would definitely recommend to play.
2082,its alright but its pretty impossible to play without a mouse :< sad
2083,"great story 
great fun to play 7/10 
lovin it"
2084,.
2085,"It's a uhh 
It's a game, i guess."
2086,This is a great platformer that is very charming in how it looks and feels.
2087,"A Story About My Uncle is a beautiful story adventure game. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good genuine kind and wholesome story. That being said, the gameplay is also very fun and it does not get old!"
2088,"As a busy man I like short games like these, it has a slight difficulty progression throughout the game but there's nothing crazy."
2089,"Yeah this game is dope as hell.

I find a rock; grapple. I see a ledge; grapple. I want to get over there but it's really far away; grapple.

Levels are so well built with a nice combination of ""I have to be sick and snipe this rock to make it to that platform"" and ""How can I perfectly plan my path even though there are so many options?""

And some levels are just so whack like you look out and you think ""Oh that must just be a background texture there's no way I can make it over there"" but then you make it there in ONE JUMP because the game forces you to just absolutely SEND IT.

Sick game. Highly recommend."
2090,"There were a couple parts I liked. The game's biggest strength is that it looks amazing. The gameplay is pretty straightforward but has enough variety to keep things interesting.
The whole time I was playing I felt like I was because I had to, not because I wanted to. The little bit of story that's there wasn't nearly as emotional as the game thinks it is.
Overall, wasn't the worst way to spend a couple hours and it's another game in my library I've gotten through, but there are better games out there."
2091,movie
2092,hey it's pretty cool
2093,"Nope. I had high hopes for this, but it's a slog.

For a game that features gravity-bending equipment, it feels surprisingly slow. The reason is that the pace crawls and comes to a complete halt in the, shall we say, ""more demanding"" jumps, where you have to contend with the physics constantly. The level design that reminds me of some weirder fan-made Half-Life maps messing about with the long jump module doesn't help. It's all about massive gaps and some floating rocks in the distance that you have to Spider-Man your way onto or past. It's linear, repetitive and demands some real trial-and-error, assuming the physics don't crap out. I get what they were going for and it's far from an impossible game to complete, but after a while, it fails to engage. 

Same goes for the story, at least what I played of it. It goes for a fantastical, whimsical angle, but just because the premise is a dad telling his kid a story, it doesn't mean the story has to read (or sound, in this case) like a children's story. 

And why is ""non-violent"" listed as a feature? Is this a Christian game?"
2094,"Lets be honest,i only wrote this review to get awards

2095,The story and the narration are fantastic. Extremely immersive and quite soothing to play. Highly recommended!
2096,"This is a great game to play in a couple of sessions, but some parts are very difficult and will take you many tries before you even figure out what you need to do. The parkour is great, but the story... isn't as great. In fact, there isn't too much story to it at all, and the ending will most likely leave you unsatisfied. But if you're here for the parkour and the different mechanics this game brings with it, you'll most likely enjoy this game."
2097,"5/10: Stunning visuals and cute story; awful journey.

So, your daughter asks you for a bed-time story, so you tell her about the time you went on a daring adventure to find him and the strange folk you discover along the way. Cute right? It is very cute! Just cute enough that I came back to play the game a few weeks after rage quitting less than an hour into my first attempt.

But the journey is so frustrating! As you can tell, if you've seen the trailer/artwork, the journey consists of using a grappling hook beam to pretty much swing from one point to the next. 
But the in-game mechanics makes it quite difficult.
You have to time your jumps, grapples, swings, and boosts just right but you could still fall if you don't finesse your landing using the d-pad.
So you fall. A LOT! And though there is no real way of attempting to save yourself once you have mistimed your attempt (until late game)... you have to watch yourself fall for a minute every-time. 
The falling would not be so infuriating if you reloaded from the last check-point immediately. (My play-time says 4 hours, but at least 3 hours of that is probably just falling.) 
And it's really easy to get lost! The game would have benefited from a overview camera so you could always know which way to go because sometimes the path forward is below, or around the corner, so you don't know unless you leap for it and ... FALL...
And after all that, there's not a satisfying ""whoaaa..."" ending. It's just... sweet.
I liked it but I am still disappointed."
2098,"i have this odd friking bug, Where i shoot a stone so i can grapple around, but it uses 2 power pellets or whatever it is, Anyone know how to fix this?"
2099,I recently tried playing this game again and I just beat it. The start is pretty fun but the final levels have a large increase in difficulty which made me really regret even turning on the game. They are crazy difficult because of the little buildup. The game is still good and I'd recommend it if you got $15 lying around.
2100,This is absolutely amazing with the visuals.. I was blown away on how immersive everything was. Highly suggest!
2101,gameplays fun i guess
2102,"It's a short game. Not the most elaborate plot, but I'm sure this kind of story has lot of apeal for kids.

That said: 
- There are glitches and bugs here and there. 
- The platforming is annoying. (in some places you have to jump to death a few times before even realizing what you're supposed to do)
- Inconsistent check point placement forces you do die several times against challenges you've already beat.

Still, it's playable and somewhat fun. With a little bit more polish it could have been a great game."
2103,Very fun and relaxing story with VERY fun gameplay. 8.5/10
2104,"Fun little adventure, while it lasted."
2105,"Ends a lot sooner than I expected, unfortunately, which left a melancholic feeling that is strangely unique. Even though it would have been nice for there to be more, the result is a good concise 2-3 hour playthrough package.

It's satisfying to explore the limits of your tools and find shortcuts, though the grappling distance and air resistance/gravity can often be disappointingly harsh. Also a lot of the terrain is jagged and acts unexpectedly when collided with - said terrain is usually not necessary or necessarily intended to be used, but it is a small let down. You'll sometimes slide on things you want to land on and get blocked by things you want to jump past.

The achievements are fun, challenging and significant. The only problem is you can't get all of them at once even if you meet the conditions for them, as there is a time trial mode which has its own specific achievement tied to it even though it only removes the voicelines. Therefore it took a lot longer to get them all.

The voice acting isn't a strong point but also isn't terrible by any means. It is more beneficial than not.

Graphically average as well, but manages to build quite a spooky atmosphere especially if you fear large empty spaces like meeee.

Worth a shot but don't expect much."
2106,"best adventure if u have Vertigo than u have to play this game,it will improve your inner strength against vertigo.:)"
2107,"Pretty short story, good gameplay. 7/10 great for gameplay background"

2111,Epic and good story. SOOO worth the price!
2112,Pretty short but it's very cheap on sale. I enjoyed the vibes
2113,Really great game.
2114,good game about grandpa

2116,really good game makes me wanna kms sometimes but good game
2117,a Great Game l give it a 9/10
2118,Esta divertido. Acerca de la historia... me gust√≥.
2119,best game
2120,"It's nice, but short."
2121,this game very fun and cool
2122,"This is an interesting game, its fun and pretty exciting.  As you traverse your way through the mysterious world in search for your uncle, you find so many beautiful landscapes, calming music, and most importantly, the story about your uncle."
2123,"The gameplay starts off pretty fun, allowing you to grapple around like spider-man, but quickly becomes stale as you realise it's exactly the same throughout the whole game. It gets even worse when they give you rocket boots that can save you from almost any sticky situation.

The voice acting is not compelling whatsoever. I was honestly happy when one of the main characters decided to stay behind because it meant I didn't have to listen to her any more. The main narrator lacks any capacity for emotion, and the other few voices are just plain annoying.

The story is lame and a huge letdown. When you finally find the uncle, you see him for about 2 minutes and then he literally yeets you back home. There's no meaningful interaction between the characters, no hugs, no nothing. Just him talking about his research.

The whole game teases you by introducing new, mysterious scenes, and then not giving you any reason to sit down and explore. You arrive to a new area, think ""wow this looks amazing!"", and then swiftly move on to get to the next area. The graphics are pleasing to look at, but the frog creatures are hideous."
2124,"Its short and sweet, but not worth 13e, cause the games like 2 hours, maybe get it of sale.

4/5"

2126,its a quick adventure that literally is just completely enjoyable no matter your skill level
2127,Bad
2128,"This game is fantastic, if you really enjoy story games with fun and engaging movement abilities this game is very much worth the price tag."
2129,"I got it some time ago when it was miraculously free and finally got around to playing it now. It's quite a short game but it is enjoyable and challenging, when you want to get the achievements. It literally had my palms sweating on multiple occasions and has a potential to have you rage quit at times but overall recommend it, especially when on sale."
2130,"It's a 2 hour game to finish, more if you're keen on repeating levels, getting achievements and speedrunning. Which I doubt, as this game somehow fails to give that cool feeling of speed and flying through the air.
Something's just not right about that grappling hook and how it looses momentum, by more pulling to, rather than swinging from the objects that were hooked.

Buy this on some promotion for 5$ and it might be worth the money."
2131,yes
2132,i enjoyed the game however it took a lot less time to complete than i thought it wou;d
2133,It's a good game with a nice story
2134,"Really fun game to play while tripping, also works on low end systems surprisingly well."
2135,Pretty nice 3D platformer - also quite challenging
2136,"Shorter than I would have liked, but good game. Beautiful graphics and relaxing game play."
2137,"It was a fun short game with a nice story.

It is not too hard, the controlls are perfectly fine and easy to learn.

You could kind of call it a  sci-fi parkour game with narrative.

To me 7.5/10

"
2138,"[u] [b] Warning! [/b] [/u] This review is going to be very salty!

This game is one of the worst games I have played recently. Might actually be the worst game that I actually played. Save yourself from this horrible disgrace to the videogame industry! It's hard to hold myself back and not say nasty words in this review, because it's insulting how bad this is.

I was expecting a game with cool gameplay mechanics and a stunning enviroment. Well the mechanics are kinda week, often boring and frequently infuriating. The enviroment is okay, I guess. They sadly managed to include a story in this game, they shouldn't have since it's garbage. The whole story feels like it was written by a 9 years old girl who wrote it for girls her age. I felt like I was playing a kids game but even games meant for kids aren't this cringe. Every dialouge was so cringe, I just walked away while the characters were talking because I just didn't want to hear it and didn't really care either. The character animations are another thing, even amatuer workshop mods have better animations. This game is a lot stronger where Maddie is not there. She is so annoying, she made me want to delete this game, even when I saw her for the first time.

The level design wasn't all that great either, which is inportant in games like these. Sometimes it's not so obvious where you have to go, you can figure out kind of quick but it could use some work. The bad level design is most obvious on the final level. I'm not even sure if I went the right way but I somehow got through. 

In the case of bugs. There is a lot of bugs, even though I didn't look for them. Lots of enviroments have no collison, but you can easily fall onto them, or rather fall through them. 
I have also found a bug that basically softlocks the game and has been in the game since forever. THE DEVELOPERS DON'T CARE ABOUT FIXING BUGS! Most levels can be obviously beaten in ways that they weren't meant to be. It's obvious they tried to stop some exploits but they just didn't care that much. The game is more fun when you exploit it, says a lot about it.

Lastly, I got this for free but even for free it's horrible. Yet they regularly charge almost 13 euros for this. It's not worth the pain.

Please don't buy this."
2139,"Ok,good game!"
2140,This this is a great game! this is a nice calm game and it has a short but yet rather sweet story that i just love.
2141,"game good

2142,"Its short and sweet, but the atmosphere is great and gameplay can be challenging but fun"
2143,very fun and relaxing game
2144,I miss my uncle...
2145,"A Story About My Uncle is a short, narrative focused 3D platformer that has a lot of heart. When you start the game you'd be forgiven for thinking that you were about to start playing a 'walking simulator', which would be fine, but in fact its a bit more than that. As I mentioned, its a 3D platformer that involves slingshoting yourself around caverns and cliffs while you take in a whimsical story. The platforming is surprisingly good too. 3D platforming is notoriously difficult to make satisfying rather than annoying and yet, aside from a few excusable hiccups given the small budget and team this game has, this game does a good job of it.
The story is charming and simple on the face of it, but by the end you'll realise that this game has a little more to say about parenting and what it means. Its nothing shocking or intense, but its a nice layer to add.
That's all there is to say about it really. It performs fine, plays well, and as long as you're okay with a short experience then you should enjoy it. 

Pros:
- Good 3D platforming, which is rare
- Charming story and characters

Cons:
- Some minor typos in subtitles
- Some hiccups in voice acting

7/10

A nice way to spend a couple hours."

2159,Good
2160,"This game was alright. I don't regret my time with it, but I found it a little too short and simple to recommend at full price. This is a two hour long campaign with some interesting but repetitive platforming mechanics, but the main star of the show are the enviroments. This game looks absolutely gorgeous, from the textures to the detail to the insane scope of everything. Each area feels like a journey, and that is the main reason I'd recommend this game. Unfortunately though, everything else about the presentation feels off. The voice acting is sub par to straight up bad, with many lines sounding all wrong, like the VA wasn't given any direction or context for them. And the character models. Oh my god, the character models. This was a game released in 2014, and the models look like they're from a low budget PS2 game. The frog people look like they were designed by a child, the worm monster looks just as bad, if not worse, [spoiler]and the one human we see in the game looks like a low poly background character, not the focus of the ending.[/spoiler]Overall, I'd say get this game on a sale if you're interested in platforming and a journey through beautiful worlds, because that's pretty much all this game has going for it."

2162,unerated and amazing plkease buy it
2163,"A lot of fun, good platforming and a good story. 9.5/10."

2165,Not a bad short game. Worth a try.
2166,"!! Received for Free via Humble Bundle Promotion !!

A Story About My Uncle is a wonderfully crafted, beautiful game. Unfortunately, the game's loop gets repetitive
rather quickly. The game makes up for this by adding more ways to traverse the landscapes. The games graphics look rather dated but the story of the game is beautiful and the ending is worth shedding a tear for. The game is rather short, and can be beaten in under three hours.

8/10, Dated Graphics, Good Platforming, Beautiful Story"
2167,pe nis
2168,I think I'd have enjoyed this game more if I haven't used laptop + touchpad to play it. But what the heck... it was still pretty good.
2169,"Gorgeous environments, fun platforming mechanics and a charming story. I appreciate the extra bit of effort that went into character modeling and animation. It's rare that an indie exploratory game has that, and it makes the experience much richer. Highly recommended!"
2170,"its short, its fast pace, its great. this game is worth a shot only taking a few hours too beat. the story is fine i guess but its all about using the stupid rope like thingy too swing everywhere and take in the amazing world. the movement is great it works wonders. 7/10"
2171,"at first i enjoyed this game, it looks nice and the story was good. but when you meet your uncle after all the kinda boring jumping and grappling he says a few things to you says he created the frog people and send you home. within 2 min of finding him he send you home. story just end abruptly, you never go back to the  frog people or get to see maddy again. any story aspects have a strong start but get killed by the badly written and abrupt ending. game took me 4 hours cus about an hour in my save was corrupted. not a big deal but it happened. so a 3 hour game? with the cool start and a solid story at the start im sad this game was so short with a bad ending. glad i got it for under 3$ on g2a.

A Story About My Uncle is a very good story/platformer game with fluid mechanics that give you a sense of freedom. As the narrator and main character, you‚Äôre telling your daughter a bed time story about good ole‚Äô Uncle Fred and his mysterious adventures.

You fly up, fall down and whip around navigating each level with your bionic suit and rocket boots. It‚Äôs really freeing to float and grapple your way through the levels. Your grapple and boots replenish once you hit the ground so you must plan your moves. Gradually through the game you‚Äôll get more grapple ability and the rocket boots. Each time you upgrade, you‚Äôre given a scenario that you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to complete before. It shows you how you can reach new heights and travel farther than before. 

Level design is solid, with all the areas being floating islands and land masses that you must traverse. If (when) you fall, there is a frequent checkpoint system so you won‚Äôt lose much progress. Sometimes it gets difficult to understand where you need to go next but I was never disorientated for long. 

The graphics are beautiful and have a unique style to them. The character models look a little dated up close but the overall world and environment is gorgeous.  

There are some challenging parts that will test you, but when I fell or didn‚Äôt make it, it was usually my fault. I‚Äôm pleased there was no discernable difficulty spike and to me felt like a nice gradual slope. 



[b]Conclusion[/b]
Had a real enjoyable time playing this. Some parts are challenging and will give you sweaty palms, but never felt impossible. Freedom of movement felt great and just wish it was a little longer. A well thought out game with a slightly high price tag. Worth it, but check for a sale.

[b]7/10[/b] Good"
2181,its pretty good the only thing is that it took me less than a day to complete it
2182,"Short and sweet, but wish it was longer. Really fun gameplay, and acceptable story to push you forward."
2183,"Very short game it will take you 2-4 hours to beat but good game

2185,"Picked this up back when the game was free, haven't regretted a thing since."
2186,Very good game
2187,"Get story', great animation, great skill I mean fiture in the game 9 of 10 from me"
2188,"I tried on two separate occasions, months apart, to get this game working. The Xbox Controllers buttons only work for half the functions and unable to start the game. 'B' works really well to quit the game, 'A' works really well on the launch screen to selection options, but does not work on 'continue game' or 'new game.' 0/10, should be allowed to use controller."
2189,"I would be lying if I said I didn't have fun. The game does have flaws, the story and the characters feel a bit empty but the world looks beautiful and somehow, you can feel the team put a lot of love in this production. The first person platforming gameplay has a Portal-like feeling in my opinion, not talking about the puzzles of course, but more the flying part when you need to propel yourself to the next platform. One thing that drove me a bit mad is that most of the time the crystals you use to power your wristband device while flying simply did not work for me, no matter how close I was. Despite this, I don't regret spending some hours on this game."
2190,The only thing i dislike is that the story is short and that there is no new things to explore
2191,Great game already beat it and i am playing it again. Be great if it was VR tho.
2192,"It's a short game I managed to complete it in about 3 hours but it was worth every minute of it the game was just absolutely amazing, the story was just such a happy little story I fully recommend this to anyone who loves story driven games, such a great way to spend a night :)"
2193,It's CHILL
2194,"FUN GAME i found it by watching a play through that one of my favorite youtubers, and got the game a while back. i have played it a little and got stuck. its a fun platformer. 10/10 would recamend"

2196,Beautiful game
2197,very nice
2198,"It's essentially a walking simulator where the player traverses large gaps using a grappling mechanic.

Being able to target an object with the grappling hook typically involves holding down the run button and the super-jump button, releasing the super-jump button before falling into a void, aiming at the object to grapple, pressing and holding down the grapple hook button, then releasing it at an exact moment, causing the hook to release and the player to be catapulted. There's also some rocket boots that can propel the player a relatively short distance while in mid-flight, usable only once before touching the ground.

The problem with the hook is, there's no way to simply swing on a fixed length of cable, and the grapple will always pull the player closer to the object (unless the object itself is in motion). Reaching the object will automatically release the hook, and cause the player to fall. Also, the grappling hook can only be used a total of 3 times while in mid-air. Many of the jumps require precise trajectories and speed in order to avoid falling to one's death. There's also two buttons for jump--a normal jump and a super-jump, where the super-jump needs to be held down for a short time in order to charge up before it can be used.

The videos on the store page make grappling around look fun, but, in practice, its nuances make it extremely frustrating to use.

This game is, apparently, very short, but falling to my death countless times has made me lose my will to progress. My advice to anyone who's looking to pick this up would be to play it before the 2 week return period is up, so if your experience with it is similar to mine, you can refund it."
2199,"jogo muito relaxante com graficos otimos, mas a historia √© muito curta, eu mesmo ja zerei o jogo 3 vezes em um dia, mas tirando isso o jogo √© otimo e vale a pena comprar-lo"
2200,"Game was beautiful and there was much love from the developers. Perhaps the game wasn't for me though, the gameplay was flat, just jumping around. Story was weak. If you are into parkour stuff you will love it think."
2201,"Fun game with increasing difficulty.
Probably one of the best adventure games among the free ones."
2202,skrt skrt ah
2203,üëç
2204,Literally the best game ever created.
2205,"This game was fantastic. 

It had been sitting in my library for awhile, and finally I buckled down to play it. You can get through the story in an hour or two, but its delightful. 

The scenery and graphics are wonderful, the lighting and sound is great, the mechanics were great, and I loved every bit of it. The scripting at the beginning felt a little odd, but once the game started it was perfect. Maddie was adorable beyond all reason, and I'll probably play this again in the future. 

Loved it, it's everything I picture a solid story game should be."
2206,"i loved the characters, views and the music set the atmosphere soo well!"
2207,it very good
2208,swag

2210,Original game. What would i say?
2211,yo
2212,great game
2213,cute little story. pretty game
2214,"Super good and fun  game, easy to run"
2215,"This game is as cool as it looks. You really are free swinging through these huge levels high in the air with nothingness below. You use a grappling system that is designed as a light beam that shoots out and attaches to a point. You also gain multi-shots later in the story so you can swing from place to place without pause and it feels so cool. The shining points of the game are not the puzzle aspects, of which arn't very brain teasing, but the story and exploration.

The Story is heart warming and gentle but also kinda sparse, only having a handful of moments where you have to slow down to interact with some characters and the environment. But the game is still incredibly atmospheric and i've replayed it just to have fun swinging around in the different worlds."
2216,It's a pretty fun game with a new feel for first person. A bit pricey at $14.99 but I really enjoyed the 2.9 hours I spent on it.
2217,"Story is great. Gameplay is great. Controls feel great. Not too difficult nor easy.

Beautiful game, leads you through 5 stages. You can attach all sorts of philosophical meanings behind these and what they represent. The meaning behind the crystals.

To me it seems a little boy went after his uncle who went on his own adventure to cultivate meaning and enlightenment. To get there he had to go on a journey of discovery (1st stage), followed by the people who are scared and stuck (stage 2), followed by the ascent (3), heaven (4), and finally, the frontier (5). As to why the frontier is cold and icy, I guess because it's Fred's story, and not yours (the protagonist's), so it does not feel right. The protagonist must forge his own, but has learned a lot along the way."
2218,"I got this game a while ago when buying some steam keys and never finished it, I picked it up again and I didn't care that this game was in 2014 and that the graphics were outdated, all I could focus on was the story. For the 3.8 hours that I was actually playing this game and appreciating the beautiful and creative landscape all of my stress went away. I would gladly pay full price for this game."
2219,really nice game
2220,Beautiful game with a fantastic story.
2221,It is quite good game with nice graphics but most of the times i am getting so confused what to do in this game
2222,One of the best games I've ever played.
2223,"Very simple platformer with a simple story, there are some parts that will make you go mad near the end as you try to do them, but overall a fun game that shouldn't take more than three hours"
2224,Is a nice and interesting puzzle game. Is very hard to do all the achievements and with time you will become frustrate and hopeless. Has a nice story to ... is like children story.
2225,"I was scrolling my library, trying to pick a game to play; bored as always. Then I saw this game. I got it for free a while ago, and forgot about it. I booted it up, and decided to give it a try. 

I am so glad I did. This is honestly one of the coolest, most interesting games I've ever played. It's peaceful, casual, and an excellent stress-reliever with amazing mechanics. 

Some may complain that it's a little short, and it is, but it doesn't need to be very long. It's fine the way it is. 

This game is an easy 9/10."
2226,"Short, fun experience, the visuals and the narrator give it a good atmosphere.
It manages to be fun without needing any violence."
2227,"I liked all the game. The story is very gripping, the graphics are make a great atmosphere with the platform game elements. I missed some other element (e.g. more animation for the creatures), but I enjoyed playing the game. This game is absolutely worth a try. I played in Hungarian language and that was good, too.
Respect for the creatos!"

2234,"A Story About My Uncle (henceforth refered to as ASAMU) is a platformer (of sorts) in which you use a grappling hook (of sorts) to fly from platform to platform. Clocking in at roughly 3 hours in length, ASAMU is more of a proof of concept than a full game. That's not inherently a bad thing - Portal 1 is also basically just a proof of concept - but for a proof of concept to be worthwhile, it needs to show that its primary mechanic is engaging and versatile enough to carry a whole game. ASAMU, unfortunately, does not adequately show this. While the game has an interesting premise and fun core mechanic, it does not sufficiently build on its core mechanic. Once you've played through the first level, you've seen almost everything ASAMU has to offer.

The first issue with ASAMU is that introduces very few new elements over the course of the game, and the new elements that it does introduce add very little mechanical complexity to the game. For example, part way through the game, you get rocket boots that allow you to double jump. The rocket boots are the only major power up in the game, and so one would hope that ASAMU would use them to introduce new twists and wrinkles into the platforming, such as requiring you to change directions in mid-air. Instead, ASAMU settles on simply making the gaps between platforms larger. You're not required to do anything that you couldn't do before; the rocket boots merely serve as a way to extend your existing jump. Similarly, the last level of the game takes place in a cave rather than in open skies. Some of the cave's walls are coated in ice, which cannot be grappled to. Like the boots, the team behind ASAMU could have used the ice to add new mechanical twists to the game, but they didn't. The ice merely serves to space out the points you can grapple to and the platforms you can land on, just like the open air did in the previous levels. In the same way that you cannot grapple onto empty air, you cannot grapple onto ice.

In addition to (or perhaps because of) this, ASAMU lacks a proper difficulty curve. The lack of mechanical complexity could perhaps be excused if ASAMU ramped up in difficulty as it went, but it does not. In fact, in some ways, the game gets easier as you progress rather than harder. The rocket boots allow you to recover from errors, and the fact that the final level is set underground means you have more surface area to grapple to, not less.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that ASAMU does up the difficulty and complexity in two distinct ways in the fifth area out of five. [spoiler]The first way is the falling block room. In the falling block room, you have to make your way across a chasm while blocks continuously fall from the ceiling. This is the only room in the game where you cannot take your time and plan your jumps, and consequently the room requires a level of quick thinking that is unlike anything else in the game. Unfortunately, the falling block room is only a single room, and then it's back to standard gameplay. The second way is the crystal clusters growing out of the walls of the cave. The crystal clusters cannot be grappled to, but can be drained for energy. Normally, you can only grapple once before you need to recharge by landing on something, but these crystal clusters allow you to grapple multiple times in one jump, provided you can manage to drain the crystal clusters as you fly past them at high speed.[/spoiler] These wrinkles provided the added difficulty and complexity I had spent the whole game waiting for; it's a shame each level didn't have its own mechanical twists like those.

Ultimately, I can't say ASAMU is a game worth playing. It showcases almost everything it has to offer in its first level, and the two mechanical twists it does eventually add in its final level aren't worth playing through the rest of the game to see. For a proof of concept to be worth playing, it needs to showcase that its central ideas could potentially sustain a whole game, and ASAMU unfortunately does not manage to do this."
2235,It is a good game but the story is to short
2236,"this game was awesome 
sotry was good
game play was not hard but not easy
great game i recomand

just try 
you'll see"
2237,"Game looks like it was made in 2003. Production quality of a discount hot wheel. Story is that of a bad of used motor oil.

2238,"Brilliant mechanics and nicely told story, good way to kill an afternoon"
2239,"Adrenalin paled adventure with good idea and nice graphics, but with significant amount of bugs, however short enough to not get frustrated of it.
With some final touch could leave purely positive impression,

+ XEN like environment will never disappoint
+ Refreshing game-play (fast enough, short enough)
+ dubbing 

- Bugs all over the game (falling through textures, getting stuck in blind corners unable to move)
- Feeling of unfinished graphic design

7/10"
2240,"Had fun, but couldn't finish it. Some of the platforming was too much for me in the second to last level."
2241,The gameplay is more than fantastic and detailed.
2242,Leafy
2243,"It's an experience. Not a long-term experience, but a solid 10 hour ""you won't regret trying this"" experience. I loved every minute of it. I'd say that it's at least worth the price of a movie ticket since it's a wonderful game, but again don't expect it to be the new game you play forever because you will finish and you will be sad when there's no more. I seriously hope they make a new one since these game mechanics are too good to let die with just this one game.  I got this game for free during an event, but I'm thoroughly impressed and will throw my money at them if they make me more of this.

(It is possible to miss one of the important items needed to progress, and my first playthrough i skipped past it and got stuck because only had 2 of the thing but needed the third to get past one of the jumps, so yeah I'd call that semi-bug, semi-planning error because I also wasn't able to backtrack to get it so I had to start over haha but it was placed in a pretty obvious spot in retrospect so just don't be like me)

2244,"This whole game was an experience itself. Truly unique graphic design,interesting level design as well. I was overwhelmed for the whole time playing this masterpiece. Just amazing."
2245,‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
2246,"rlly good story and cool concept.
10/10"
2247,"As far as the story stretches, it was fun, however the ending wasn't what I'd like it to be. The biggest thing I disliked about the game, aside from being frustrated dying all the time, was that I wasn't given any achievement for completing the game, most of the achievements are skill based ones. I'd love the recognition that I actually completed the game. Pick the game up if it's on sale, or if you have the cash and the time go for it, otherwise there's far better games out there."
2248,It's cool
2249,the game story is great and the gameplay is awesome
2250,its fun for a bit and well worth the price but the story is a bit weird it really doesnt make sense
2251,coool game i liked it and i really wan't to play it again
2252,yeet
2253,"The good ending from the story about my uncle, unfortunately irl i got the bad ending, the one that ends in the basement ......."
2254,"I didn't like the many cases that required try-and-fail mechanics over and over again until you can do it ""just right"". There were many times that the grappling hook wouldn't work even though I was within range and it was an attachable surface. There is no map so it feels directionless. I had to crank the gamma way up at parts to try to figure out what direction I was expected to go. Overall I couldn't wait for it to be over once I started playing it."
2255,"a boring game with doing the same patterns over and over, do not waste your time"
2256,my monky left me :(
2257,"This is truly a beautiful game. There's one inconvenience that exasperated me, and that's the distance between some checkpoints and the jumping places which lie ahead of them; so that when you die and respawn, you have to run all the way back before giving it another shot. It's extremely frustrating since it may take the average player dozens of attempts to get across to the next platform successfully. This is because timing and accuracy are what determine your momentum while propelling yourself forward, and this sadly reaches the point of absurdity. Why is that? Well, here's what the 5 levels are actually like:

Sanctuary ‚Ä¢ Beginner
Village ‚Ä¢ Easy
Chasms ‚Ä¢ Normal
Star Haven ‚Ä¢ Expert
Ice Cave ‚Ä¢ Insane 

The level design in the last stage caused me to lose my [i]Spidey-sense[/i]. So I decided I had had enough and wanted to be Superman instead‚Å†‚Äîif you catch my drift. Do I regret making that decision? No. Because you soon realize that the story was nothing impressive to begin with. 

It's still worth buying and playing, without a doubt."
2258,"Awesome, calm and soothing game with Parkour!!!"
2259,It is a nice game
2260,Not bad. 6/10
2261,"I'm not going to lie. I like indie games and I love story games. This is cute, even if the models are a little janky and move a little too far into uncanny valley for me. The first half of the game is fairly nice, with a good tutorial, decent controls, and a lot of varied environments. 

Please note: This game gave me more stress and frustration than Divinity Original Sin 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 Expert. Why? Controls are janky and unsatisfying and the checkpoints are too infrequent. The Ice Caves in particular are so meandering you don't know where you path is or where to go. Controls are really really clunky sometimes, especially when you hit a rock you're grappling and slam into it, stopping your momentum completely. Controls are also awful when you accidentally go flying too far off the platform. A hang glider like Breath of the Wild, or even a mechanic where you can grab the ledge of a nearby platform would have done WONDERS. This is why AAA platform games have that feature- so you don't feel frustrated for the 30th time when you accidentally slide off a tiny platform and just wave goodbye for 1.5 seconds as you just fall and wait to restart. 

Due to the poor controls, although fun and a very lovely light story, the story isn't worthwhile enough for the frustration. I really wanted to like this game, and in the end, I did, but not enough to make me want to finish it."
2262,"Grappling Hook; The Game

Actually pretty damn fun at the core of the gameplay, but most everything else is either meh or bad. Story is alright, the environments are good, but all of the character models and voice acting is horrible.

Also the game is super short. 2 hours to completion unless you suck at grappling hooks.

I still turn it on from time to time to get some of that glorious grappling hook action. Get it on sale."
2263,Had this in my library forever and finally decided to finish it. The game has very very unique platoforming though sometimes it doesn't work very well. The game is short but I suck so it took me around 4 hours to complete. It's fun but after a while it feels tedious imo. I'm going to recommend it but take these things into consideration.
2264,"Damn, that moment when you are with your uncle alone"
2265,"It is a fun and portalesque platforming (and walking simulator) game. The visuals were really good, setting the mood for each level.
The gameplay at first was fun, but can feel quite repetitive - especially the last level, it seemed endless. Similar games, such as Valley, did not make me feel that their gameplay was repetitive. 
I think that sequel with more game mechanics, which would also expand on the interesting lore of this game, would make a better game than this one.  


"
2266,Great game.
2267,The story is fine and I love it's mechanics. Maybe too short (took me 2 hours to finish it) 7.5/10
2268,"Great game, great lore, great everything."
2269,"""I bet you can't go through this part without using the grapple hook!""

Girl, hold my grapple."
2270,Great game. Amazing art-style and a calming soundtrack. Amazing landscapes and level design. Love the parkour.
2271,its neat fun to play
2272,"I'am pretty sure that the developers meant well, but i didn't enjoy the game very much. I really can't see why it has that many positive reviews. It isn't bad by all means, but it just falls flat in nearly every way possible. The game tries to be some sort of a hybrid. Like a ""story-driven""/platforming/exploration game, but it totally fails in 2 of these categories and even somehow in the other.

1. For a story-driven game the story is just a total blunder. It's not interesting at all, there are no surprises, nothing you haven't seen before. It's just one of the most basic stories you can imagine.
2. For a exploration game the world is very beautiful to look at, but the game-world itself is tiny, extremely linear and there is not much to see, or to explore.
3. NPCs are just plain boring and the textures of them look like something from 15 years ago. They don't add any kind of atmosphere, nor any depth.
4. I never got a good ""feeling"" while playing the game. There is no atmosphere, nothing to really look forward to. Just tried to rush the puzzles and see if there is anything at the end. But it was just merely disappointment waiting.
5. The platforming part, which is the main focus i guess, is pretty cool at first, but also very linear, not really unique in 2020 anymore and gets boring pretty fast.
6. No more than 3 -5 hours to get through the whole game and there is no real replay value. 

I got it for free, so i should not complain much and the review might seem a bit harsh, but i just expected a little bit more than that. Well, the game is 6 years old and some things might be more interesting right after the release, but i really can't recommend the game at full price. But if you like 3-5 hours of platforming, you can get it during a sale i guess."
2273,"THIS GAME HAS A VERY FUCKING AWESOME STORY
"
2274,"The game is fun, but gets boring pretty quick. Sometimes it is just too much of the same or too long (make one mistake and do a whole part again). I would still recommend it for a nice night, but don't expect to be sticking with it. 
The graphics for the environment are absolutely gorgeous and the general vibe is great, but I must admit that the 'villagers' look awful. Also this game gave me headaches, possibly because the controls annoyingly glitch sometimes, so it wasn't expected where I went. 
I didn't do the speedrunning bits, because I had enough of the game, but I presume it can be a cool addition for some players. 
Recieved via Humble Store giveaway. Would not pay 12‚Ç¨ for this, but would be great for a lower price."
2275,"Great game, it's a great experience, really calm.
Felt like a child daydreaming once again! Recommended :)"
2276,"Give me back my money. this game is a fucking trash, horrible, everything about it. Mostly the gameplay. If that shit would be never created, that would be a favor for the world of gaming. Totally remove it from steam."
2277,"Cool short game with nice parkour, cool landscapes, and a great ending"
2278,"Short and sweet game. The level design and the grappling mechanic work against one another in a few small areas but for the most part the game is good. It could have greatly benefited from a vaulting mechanic to combat the problems posed by level geometry. Also, the grappling mechanic could have been done like a physical rope as seen in the Tomb Raider games instead of the blink mechanic done in the Dishonored games. But yeah... nothing much to complain about for what you get at that price and to top it all off, it can be completed in one sitting."
2279,Short but interesting puzzler.
2280,This game is amazing to me. It has amazing platforming and the controls are just fine. The story is also interesting and it allows an entrance to a brand new world. The overall layout of the environment is truly amazing as well!
2281,"Short and sweet! Very fun to play, very forgiving but still challenging platforming gameplay. It only takes a few hours to complete, and i am an awfully slow-paced player, so it's a perfect game to pick up and play any time you just want to do something different. A lunch break game if i've ever seen one!"
2282,"Don't remember how I got that game but it was great. It's hard to get back into once you finish it/haven't played it in a while but it was so worth doing in the first place. The gameplay is really satisfying, the universe is pretty enough and the story is really sweet. 100% worth it."
2283,A good game with a good story. Worth every cent!
2284,"A bit janky, granted it might just not be my cup of tea, although I do love movement based games. You might catch a whiff of Q3 Defrag and a little bit of Mirror's Edge spice here and there, but wrapped in a weird artsy indie walking simulator kind of package, with incredibly annoying characters. If I could, I would put my thumbs inside the eyes of those dumb blue Avatar aliens and squeeze all life out of them. Recommended if you're in elementary school or have an empty backlog. Not bad per se, but eh, time's a-wastin'."
2285,Amazing game. Good graphics and really good story
2286,"It's a great game.  Good story, exceedingly atmospheric, and great mechanics.  It is just difficult enough that you feel real accomplishment getting past a spot that you'd been stuck on."
2287,"I have been ignoring this game in my steam library for a long time now, and I figured I would play it and see what it was about.

A Story About My Uncle is supposed to be a parkour/story game that tells you a story about the protagonists uncle.
However, the game massively fails on one of those parts. If you guessed story, you guessed correctly.
To be fair, the story is decent and engaging until the part where you meet the first NPC of the game.
After this, it all falls apart.

There will be spoilers to further clarify what I mean by why it's a bad story. But first, let me sum it up in
the good old + and - department:

+Parkour is okay, the beam is a interesting mechanic.
+Landscape wise, it's pretty well put together. It's mysterious and engaging, like something out of a childrens fairytale. The closest I could compare it to in terms of vista and wonder would be Morrowind, but far more orangy/blueish.
+The story has a good hook in the beginning. Even if I did say the story is shit, it atleast knows how to hook the player. Shame it finished so badly.

-The NPC's in this game look like something out of a bad 90's cgi, and at best early PS2 era graphics. For a 2014 game, this is simply unacceptable. The light reflects fuck all on the NPC's too, making them pop out way way to much from the enviroment they are in. I did also spot plenty of NPC's who have the black eyes, and not intentionally black eyes. But the kind you get from when the game devs either don't give a fuck or when textures are corrupted.
-The character designs for the ""race"" you meet in the game is goddamn awful and bizzare.
-The game is far to short, I completed this in 2 hours and 30 minutes. The story seriously should have been atleast thrice as long as it could have had potentional had the devs given it more time.
-The controls for the ""boot"" ability was god awful.
-There's a reason why every single GOOD 3d plattformer display a shadow of some sort under the player. This gives the player a visual indicator of where they might land. In this game you can forget that. It's jarring.
And a personal - for me: I get why the character might have to be a bit floaty. But I like tighter controls that allow you to stop far faster midair.

And without further ado, spoilers where I explain why the story is bad:
[spoiler]
You are the dad of a child telling your kid a story about your uncle and what happened to him. The first 20 minutes or so are interesting as it builds up who the uncle is, and you do get hooked into finding out what happened to the uncle. Shame then that the most annoying brat on earth had to show up.
Maddie is your typical angsty little teenage shit who wants to ""find herself"" in the world, because she feels unaccomplished in her village. The meeting you have with the elder is so fucking cringe because like a typical teenager she turns the edge up to eleven and storms off. I genuinly wanted to turn off the game right then and there because the trope has been done to death already and this was a particularly bad execution of said trope.
For around 30 minutes you have to carry her on your back, there's zero time to form any sort of connection or reason to give a shit about her when you finally move on. In the most predictable twist ever, she decides to stay behind in Star Haven instead of following you for the rest of your journey. Good riddance I say because the VA was... take your nails and scrape them on a black board and you get it.
I was able to read her like a damn book and I knew almost right after I got her past the worm that she would fuss out and stay behind. IF you intend to write a twist into the story. DON'T DROP SO MANY DAMN HINTS!

You continue onwards to the ice cave, where the game get's moderately challenging, but nothing tough (this game errs on the side of easy). You continue on and find more hints of your uncles path. And then you meet him.

To say that the reveal was boring would be the understatement of the century. The uncle is clearly autistic, and in another very predictable twist. He reveals that the way home is only gonna last for 1 person to go trough. After some predictable soiboi cries from the protagonist, he sends you off and the credits roll. You then end up in a post credits scene where you walk trough the home where the game tries to shoe horn in again how emotional it is. But due to the lackluster buildup of the story (and again, being far to short) I felt absolutely nothing.

I felt nothing for when maddie stayed, I felt nothing for when the uncle stayed behind. And the talents of the VA for the protagonist is honestly wasted on this game. As he was the ONLY character in the entire game who's voice and emotional tone was somewhat semi-belivieable and had any ""trying to make this story NOT suck"" behind it.
[/spoiler]

I cannot recommend this game due to it's absolutely lackluster story and fleeting buildup of characters and the world. Half this game is missing. It's very clear that the majority of the budget went into gameplay and landscapes. Not neccesarily a bad thing mind you. But NOT when it's supposed to tell you a story. I'd rather honestly have had no story at all, atleast then I could have gone into this review making that point clear. But I can't. I'm genuinly pissed because the story hook in the beginning of the game did make it seem promising.

Get the game on a sale or sail the seven seas. It's not worth it's full price. Not by a long shot. And some generic collectathons and edgy ""meme"" references will not change that. 20%? Get out of here with that faggotry. It also broke the immersion.

I also want to add that people who call the ending emotional or some variation of ""good"" are among the most basic simpletons I have ever encountered. To set your standards for a story that low is appaling.
"
2288,super duper game
2289,"YES I RECOMMEND GOOD GAME FUN MECHANICS
"
2290,"A good game if you want to lose a couple of hours swinging like a jet-propelled simian through a beautiful landscape, intermingled with some story, peppered with spot-on music."
2291,Very chill and atmospheric few hours of gameplay. Well worth it.
2292,really good game :) you should try it ! challenging tough ;)
2293,"This game is well worth the purchase. I bought this game back in 2018 because I saw it in the background of a YouTube commentary video. At the time i was disappointed with the simple game-play and I was a dumb dumb idiot kid, and I still am, but less now. I didn't understand the story at the time, largely due to its very simplistic way of storytelling and at the core of this story, it is very simple and beautiful because of its simplicity. I think that the simplicity of the story is why i couldn't grasp it. Very beautiful, simple story, with great game-play."
2294,it is amazing
2295,This is just an incredibly charming game. It didn't blow me away or anything. I just enjoyed myself all the way through and i'm glad it's not too long.
2296,leafy game
2297,its pog
2298,"Fun gameplay, challenging achievements"
2299,Ruim
2300,yo
2301,woww jus twow
2302,I love this game :D I just started and it's running quite well on my absolute potato of a laptop! i am on a very low resolution but i'm having fun
2303,"got this game before it was 15$, its not worth 15$, its fun but was way too short.  tthis was a free game that became 15$"
2304,"Sure it's pretty but good fucking luck seeing what your supposed to be grappling to. a lot of the times you fall it's because you just barely had the angle wrong and your grapple refuses to reach just that tiny bit farther to let you grab the next anchor point. If you don't have the angle perfect you're going to smack against something, try to recover only to find out everything is just barely too far away to grapple to and fall. Sure the story is good but the game itself is just annoying."
2305,"It's not a terrible game, I had fun at some points, but overall I just didn't like it.

Biggst complains:

- Sometimes, it's REALLY unclear where to go. Then the game punishes you for trying to do a jump in a way that's not intended (but looks totally possible), either by killing you,  or magically stopping your jump.  Things should feel more organic.

- Some mechanics felt unreliable (I haven't read about other people complaining, so this might be just me, or playing with keyboard and mouse)"
2306,"its a pretty good game, can get rly hard at some times"
2307,good and quick
2308,"This game is amazing, it's challenging but not impossible or rage inducing. I've been playing for 4 hours and still haven't completed the game, that might be because I'm bad but i'm enjoying every minute. The graphics are (i think) impressive and they have both voice overs and subtitles which is nice. I really like the soundtrack and whenever I turn this game on to play I always turn whatever music I'm listening to off so I can hear the game"
2309,amazing game and good story
2310,A short story with good navigation system. We need a sequel
2311,"feels fun but clunky controls, you can tell its old"
2312,"Great little game, full of fun puzzles and physics based problems. nice little story and fun artstyle
would reccomend."
2313,"Short yet fun game.
"
2314,"I will be honest, this is one of the best games I have ever played. The game play is fun and challenging. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the story was powerful. The lack of coverage this game has gotten is disappointing and the fact that the game was from 2014 is sad. The only complaint is that the game is short (about 3 hours) but that is a small price to pay for such a beautiful and powerful experience."
2315,"The platforming is pretty fun, which is a rarity for first-person games. I can't say I felt all that impacted by the story, but I can see how someone would like it. The environments are atmospheric. Overall a nice little platforming-adventure."
2316,"awesome game but fuck that dumb bitch and her famous lines ""told you couldn't do it"""
2317,gud
2318,"Well, I honestly wasn't expecting much from this game, but what an experience. The atmosphere is fantastic, the story is fantastic, the ambiance is fantastic, the sound design is fantastic, music fantastic, and gameplay? fantastic. I'm generally pretty good at orienting myself in games with complex maps but this game just makes you loose the concept of spacing, sometimes you just look back and you think ""where am I? how did I get here?"".
hey devs, thanks for linux support :*"
2319,"lovely little game, beautifully drawn and a nice challange. Recommended 2-3 hours of content. Mostly jump, run, grapple and jet pack."
2320,"Honestly a lot better than I expected. A good, simple story with some great physics based parkour. Give it a try, as it should only take and hour or two to complete."
2321,"It's good but short, I've beat it twice now"
2322,Games that use platforming and exploration as the method for story telling should use this game as their benchmark
2323,"My feelings on this game is MEH. 
I've been putting off playing this game: indie games with rave reviews often fall flat for me, ""A Story About My Uncle"" was over-hyped as a gripping story with great gameplay mechanic in a fabulous world.

Pros:
- The World is cute. But there is no opportunity to explore it and interact with it - it would have been nice to understand a bit more about the World.
- Graphics, for a 2014 game, it ain't bad.
- I got it for free last year, thx Valve.

Cons:
- Repetitive gameplay and puzzles, they ain't even good for the brain. They largely consist of jumping, grappling, beaming some crystal to get more grappling juice so you can grapple some more. Ultimately, you'll get closer to the checkpoint and then the physics will f**k you over or you clicked a little too slow and you gotta do it again.
- The Physics. I couldn't quite work out how the physics was. Sometimes you'll successfully grapple and swing in the direction you want but sometimes you grapple and swing into a rock or you swing too slow.
- Level Design. It bounced between extremely linear and confusing - that last level ""Ice Caves"".
- Level Difficulty. Again, bounced between super easy and difficult. One moment you'll be doing some simple jumps and now there's frikkening stalactites that you will have to grapple, they also sometimes break off and the physics will sometimes frick with you so you don't get that crystal beam recharge.
- Graphics. You find yourself questioning why the character won't grapple on a surface that looks totally grapple-able (damn windmill thingys).
- The characters. I didn't care for them at all, probably not helped by the bad voice acting.
- Lack of narrative/story - where's the story, the lore? You are literally dumped into this world to find uncle - nothing is really explained. When you find uncle, you are rewarded with a try-hard to be sentimental and emotional ending. The ending was bad, unsatisfying."
2324,OkayChamp
2325,great game
2326,breathtaking
2327,"If you like some nice and beatiful story with some cool jumping, this game is just for you."
2328,":)
"
2329,"This FPP is definitely a gem that should be enjoyed by more people. I had initially known about it, because LeafyIsHere used to use it in his videos for background gameplay. I didn't think much of it when I got it for free on one of those ""Download Now and Keep Forever"" steam sales. This game is a short 2 hour experience if you don't go for achievements, but it is well worth paying the $15 dollars for it. The graphics are mesmerizing and the story is beautiful as well. Definitely a game that you should buy right now and support the developers."
2330,"Short and sweet.
A simple parkour game with a good story great if you have a spare hour or two."
2331,holy fuck this game is so amazing. the feeling you get when you play is something else
2332,"A Story About My Uncle is a rather short and easy game (finished it in ~3 hours), but it has a great atmosphere. Good game to relax and calm down."
2333,Good Gameplay + Good Story +  Awesome Atmosphere. It really feels like an adventure.
2334,good solo game.
2335,"A Story About My Uncle is simple and beautiful game, but sadly, a really short one. At the time of writing, I have finished it in about 2.2hrs.
The main mechanics are simple, you grapple from place to place while admiring beautifully created worlds. The game throws new mechanics that are short enough not to get boring, yet too short to be fully explored.
The challenges aren't exactly hard, although you can get a bit lost sometimes, and a couple of times, I had issues clipping through the floor of some area I wasn't supposed to go.
It's all woven through a story that is (also) short, doesn't make much sense but is a bit heartwarming.

All in all, it's a good game, but do wait for it to go on sale or even for free like I've got it."
2336,Short but sweet.
2337,<3
2338,rinse and repeat platforming with soppy story tacked on.
2339,good story and good grapichs
2340,"Very repetitive game play which might appeal to some.  I played through several different environments until I had almost reached the village of the ""Strays."" I simply got tired of it, doing the same thing over and over again, falling and falling over and over again.  Like I said, it might appeal to some, but even though this was a free game (thank you Valve), I may never finish it."
2341,"Interesting gameplay, beautiful visuals but in my opinion a bit of a sad ending."
2342,Beautiful
2343,Really relaxing game! I love it!
2344,Really relaxing and can be played on low grade pcs.
2345,Its a very ice story and a good movement game (got this free from steam)
2346,yes
2347,Really enjoyable game. play it.
2348,"Charming, 2 hour adventure through a wonderful land with cool mechanics and amazing parkour.

Is there anything else to say other than ""You should try it""? Not really, but give this game a go.
The story is super interesting and gameplay itself is pretty unique and fun."
2349,"While not a very long game I really enjoyed it. The game play is for the most part really solid (except in some areas) with the story being short and sweet. It's a relaxing game, i would recommend to everyone, even if they only try it once. There is lots to see in the game with the graphics being very good."
2350,great story great gameplay i love this game <3
2351,"Brilliant game 

Beautifully crafted.

Has a really amiable ambience."
2352,Good game mechanics
2353,"A bit short, and the animations and voice acting are a bit wonky. But overall, a pretty fun experience!"
2354,"Great game!  I wish there was more story, as I finished the game within 2-3 days.  Lol.  Really fun, it's an interesting plot and is very cool!"
2355,Hikaye sunumu daha iyi olabilirdi ama yine de eƒülenceli mekanikleri var.
2356,"It's ok. Shallow story, cool platform, short game. Get on promo."
2357,Very good game with cool ideas
2358,"this game is great! i have audio issues, but those are entirely due to my settings. i would much rather have fullscreen and good graphics than audio. 10/10 on story and controls"
2359,"An extremely cute and enjoyable game.

I completed it within 2 hours but I enjoyed every moment of it.
I loved the music, the voice acting, how fluid the movement felt, and the atmosphere.

The only ""issue"" I have with the game were the models of the frog people but aside from that small thing, a solid game!


I'm not a fan of parkour games usually but this broke my expectations."
2360,Playing this game again reminded me what a fun game was. It was so cool being able to swing around and stuff. Kinda disappointed at the end because i expected a choice to stay and not leave but overall would definitely play again.
2361,fun game
2362,extremely fun parkour grappling experience
2363,gulag
2364,It's a fabulous game. Very interesting. Short but worth it.
2365,good
2366,"Short, but very good game."
2367,its ok but why spend $15 on this game. its like 2 hours long
2368,pretty cool calm game to play when you're bored
2369,"A game with a decent core mechanic, other than that it has a few other good ideas all of which are executed in the worst way possible. The story is embarrassing, the acting is horrible and the art design is downright ugly. It's was honest attempt from Coffeestain studios, but this game is so bad that I legitimately thought this was their first game; Upon looking it up, I discovered that it is actually their 5th game. It's clear that effort WAS put forth but the final product is something that I can't recommend anyone play.
Overall: 3/10"
2370,amazing game. played it all in 1 go and its one of the best games ive played in a while
2371,cumshot
2372,"Very simple game with a very simple story, but I really enjoyed it.

It's quite short though."
2373,Yas queen
2374,"very good game :0
"
2375,"A Story About My Uncle is fast, fuid and fun. As a story it successfully springboards off traditional adventure fantasy and vaults off elsewhere. The two converge into a unique platformer with real heart."
2376,Had this in my library for a long time.Dont know how I missed playing this amazing game before.It is a really charming parkour game with a simple heartwarming story.Loved it.
2377,Ok.
2378,Bok gibi
2379,"Little to no story, wonky physics and level design taken from free logic games where every few minutes you learn new thing and you have to use it all the time after that."
2380,It's amazing
2381,Very nice story!
2382,Good game !
2383,"This game is a very fun parkour game, with a nice ending, but its really short. I beat it with 3 hours playtime, while not being at the computer for about an hour."
2384,ITS A GREAT GAME SIERISLY
2385,"Great story and the flow of movement is fantastic, would recommend 11/10"
2386,"Apart from a few incredibly hard sections that require 100% precision and dodgy latch controls in a few sections, this is a really fun 3D platformer."
2387,"lovely game, good mechanics and creative world, this game is like a dream that you only see once in your sleep and everything about it is awesome. if you want to just have a new experience and try something new, you should try this game.
i did get this game for free but i didnt know about this game and if i would, id surly got it. maybe when it was on sale with off but then again im just talking about the experience and if you like this kind of it then it is worth paying for."
2388,"like Spiderman but with fish people - 8/10, would swing again."
2389,"This game is just gold. The amount of secrets and things you actually have to look close into to understand them is...OH GOD...For the people who are considering to buy it, do it, you will not regret it, my only advise is to look very closely at every poster or newspaper you see. The only downside to the game is that it's way too short."
2390,Very beautiful game with an amazing story!
2391,The game is fun but frustrating or im just shit
2392,7/10
2393,"Story about 3 hours, 2 max if you didn't really explore every nook and cranny.

The story is good, and heartwarming.
Best done in one sitting, cuz the mood is kinda gone and the ending is not really impactful if you play on multiple sessions.
Spoiler free, the story is about a man telling a bedtime story for his daughter, of (searching) his uncle thru kind of fantasy settings, cue the title.
Gameplay is somewhat good, 3d platforming that have you traversing between the floating rocks was fun, even better when you got the rocket boots. Difficulty is bit easy, unless you impatient person.
Not so much replayability unless you wanna get the achievements.
7/10"
2394,"A nephew's bond with his uncle and going so far to find him by exploring different realms and stages that are simply mesmerizing. The beauty of this game is the art for the landscapes and the design of each stage, very unique of its kind. The characters can make gamers connect with them even with little dialogue because of the storytelling and the amazing work done by the voice actors. The mechanics might feel difficult at first but it can definitely feel challenging with its fast pace and quick timing gameplay to tackle the obstacles and with you trying to beat the achievements."
2395,"Best bedtime story ever i heard, it id such a great indie game, short and sweet. Manipulation of the three dimensional environment, nice story and very atmospheric/well done graphics makes this a unique and very enjoyable experience. Figuring out the game's puzzles is very satisfying. Definitely worth it if you are looking for a change of pace from your regular games."
2396,This game gives u a chill vibe
2397,"this game is just a simple platformer. it wont leave you ripping your hair out from how hard it is, the story is incredibly simple but somewhat compelling in its simplistic way. the movements are incredibly fluent  and the game itself plays like butter. Other than some character models the game is gorgeous to look at and it's like jumping and grappling through a giant world of beauty! i highly recommend everyone play this game if you're looking for a fun way to pass time. i also highly recomend you beat it in a single session. it toon me less than 2 hours to beat but i thoroughly enjoyed every second."
2398,Splendid
2399,The best game ever I've played in my life. A beautiful game that melts together your emotions of nostalgia that comes from your childhood and an incredible story finally stringed together with an amazing gameplay that feels so liberating.
2400,This game is such a... such a good game like for real
2401,"Great bit of parkour, story is good. Listening to the dialogue is pretty calming while flying through the sky at 5mph. This game is perfect for just chilling out, putting on some low fi, and having a great time."
2402,csgo surf on steroids
2403,"A Story About My Uncle:
A small story-tale an adult man narrated to his daughter about his unlce, such a beautiful game that can drive u in a whole fantasy world in just few hours gameplay."
2404,this game was beautifu and the graphics were good
2405,Played for the story and It had a heartfelt ending regarding his uncle.
2406,"Overall a good indie game. The most interesting part in A Story About My Uncle is this sensation of freedom when you fly from one floating island to another: the maps are huge, and given the different features available (grapplin, jet-boots, power jumps), there are a lot of possibilites of going around the levels without always strictly following the indicated path.

Although I liked the game, I must point out several problems that made the experience a little less enjoyable:
- there is no consistency in the interaction with off-track elements. Some of them jumped on and even hide collectables; some others, although seemingly at similar distances, are full of clipping problems when will make you slide down them when you try to land on them.
- some bugs can get you stuck in walls or cliffs which you cannot leave anymore. Then you have no other choice but to restart from the latest checkpoint.
- The scenario and storytelling are quite useless, and the end of the game feels unsatisfying.
- Last, the game is short (3 hours long, probably less if you rush) and the play time is only artificially inflated by the presence of achievements, each of which will demand a certain investment of time, as they are not so straightforward.

Good but not awesome."
2407,bem legal
2408,"Simple, short, thoroughly enjoyable. Nice graphics and a all round great platformer with some challenging bits."
2409,yes
2410,"An unforgettable experience. It flows very well with some good music in the background, darkness outside, rain and many thoughts. A game that really calms me down and transposes me into a spiritual world."
2411,leafy game lol
2412,"<3
"
2413,this game is really chill and fun so during these hard times of boring ass quarantine i definitely recommend it as a time killer
2414,"Fun to Play. Great story and great atmosphere. I Loved the narratives.
Also quite short and has no deep gameplay mechanics, but totally rewarding to play a few hours on."
2415,"Fun parkour gameplay, can at times be hard to tell where you're supposed to go.  Very linear.

Terrain models are good, Character models are poor even for 2014.  Not helped by the lack of animation - outside cutscenes, characters are motionless, and NPCs can't be interacted with."
2416,good
2417,okay game
2418,"Sweet story, good platformer. Can be a little hard imo in some sections, but overall it was a good experience."
2419,Very good game
2420,Good for recording chill gameplay.
2421,Incredible. A must for fans of Puzzle games and narrative games.
2422,GREAT GAME
2423,"game is good, good story"
2424,Honestly one of the best games I've ever played
2425,"a little short but beautiful, thank you for making it :)"
2426,pretty good game and if your looking for a short but fun game this might be it
2427,"This game was excellent for less than $5!! Some places are literally charging $30 for the customer to test. Insane!
This game has full controller support, nice appearance, good sound, fair voice actors, fair dialog, and is amazingly smooth.
It's not very in depth with figuring some things out and the in game features are very cool and let the user explore quite a bit more than the initial appearance.
Loved it. Thanks, guys!"
2428,"amazing story, ok graphics even on highest setting,last level hard, 


                                                                                           F    L    Y"
2429,Good story and enjoyable gameplay. Don't like the frog people though.
2430,"short story, great movement abilities."
2431,Very fun would play over and over again.
2432,"1/10. My uncle touched me and since it did not happen in this game, it ruined my immersion. but 10/10 if you didnt have childhood trauma involving your uncle"
2433,"A short but decent FPS platformer. The story is just ok. While I enjoyed the narrator  throughout the game, I found myself not really caring about what was going on in the world around me. I was more interested in seeing the next environment than I was seeing frog people hammer crystals. Took me right at 4 hours to beat the main story. If you have some spare time and looking for something to knock out in an evening, this is the game for you."
2434,Awesome game. Ignore the 32-bit warnings in steam. It works fine on catalina.
2435,"very fun game very short though i beat it in about 2 hours the voice acting for the main guy ""Nephew"" is a little dry but overall it was fun"
2436,"not bad adventure FPS game, but does it worth your money or your time? NO I think."
2437,Really cool game
2438,cool
2439,"Beautiful Storytelling, Fun Game Mechanics and Relaxing Environment is the best description of this small gem of a game."
2440,Very fun gameplay and good story
2441,"WTF did i just played lol

i was not expecting this game to be this AWESOME !!!

+ GAMEPLAY
+ EMOTIONAL ENDING
+ BEAUTIFUL WORLD"
2442,It's the Garry's Mod Spider-Man SWEP simulator with frog people!
2443,I love this game <3
2444,Yes
2445,It's a great
2446,"Loved everything about this game -- I really felt like I was soaring through the air, and whatever occasional frustration I had with landing some of the jump sequences correctly was outweighed by the beautiful visuals & a feeling of success. I also appreciated that checkpoints were spaced out pretty fairly, so I didn't end up redoing too much of a section (with a few exceptions). Would definitely recommend!"
2447,It looks like the future horror but I LOVE it! Trust me and get this game.
2448,"Overall its a good game. 
The world and the atmosphere was beautiful even the graphic is outdated (this counts specially for the character models).
Due to the short game the story is not very deep. You get to know some of the world and his characters but there had way more to offer. The only important and interesting characters are uncle Fred and Maddie.
The gameplay was really enjoyable but sometimes frustating cause to some bad feedback when you can hook or collision bugs.
Because its relatively short and the story lacks of deepness i would recommend it, if you get it for 5‚Ç¨ or less"
2449,"I have just finished the game.. i literally respect to the people who finished this platform game in 3 or 4 hours.. Like WTF bro?!  The idea is cool and looks really fun... but grappling was so challenging most of the time that i literally forgat having fun while playing.. i wish it were a little bit less challenging so that i could have fun with the grappling device and the story.. would recommend to the people who are the fan of platform games.  Yet, if you are a fan of games which have nice stories like me, and intent to get the game for this purpose.. just NO. I dont think it worths it."
2450,Its pretty good but the devs could have allowed custom maps and stuff cus the game is really good but it only has about 3 hours of gameplay
2451,"it good
"
2452,Just wonderful!
2453,It was short but the story is beautiful and there is a deep meaning behind all of that. you gotta be carefully looking at your surrounding because there's some lore laying around. I LOVE IT!
2454,very nice
2455,"It's ok. it was mostly good, but the ending was really underwhelming. Also, I totally thought that huge whale thing right before you enter the tunnel that Uncle Fred is in would be the final boss or something, but no. That was really disappointing. Other than that, really fun and a pretty interesting story."
2456,"I'm not fully sure why it says i only have .1 hours on record, but I've gotten quite far in the game. It's a great game, and i dig the grapple hook type mechanic it has, although i wish it was a bit easier to judge disatnces. Maybe the cross hair changing color if you can grapple onto something. If there's any sort of sequel or whatever, i would love a game with not only grapple but repulsion and wallrunning. Great game, check it out."
2457,"Disclaimer: Most of my playtime on here is idle from leaving the game running. I didn't play nearly that much.

ASAMU is a platformer with a grappling hook mechanic. A lot of people praise the movement, but I hate that there are 2 different buttons for jumping depending on the kind of jump you are doing. I found this control scheme really off-putting from the get go.

I've also seen a lot of people praise the narrative, but I found the bit of story I saw and the voice acting to be pretty uninteresting.

The real nail in the coffin for me though is that it feels like it landed too much in the middle of 2 styles of game: speedrun platformers and mellow exploration games. There's too much trial and error from missing jumps or the link to be an enjoyable exploration game, but the pacing is way too slow to be a speedrun trial game.

I'm sure there are things here to enjoy for many people, but I just couldn't get into any aspect of it and would rather play many other games."
2458,Great experience. Good game.
2459,"i found this game boring, but that is just my opinion."
2460,Fucking Poop
2461,Unique game mechanics badly placed into levels of try and repeat where the hell to go....
2462,I don't know but sometimes this got little irritating but interesting game though!
2463,It's a nice game - doesn't really have any replayability though.
2464,there is nothing special
2465,"A Story About My Uncle is a very polished, good game. This is predominantly due to its incredibly strong and unique movement. It has been the most enjoyable movement-based game I have ever played, rivalled only by titans of the genre such as mirror's edge. The story itself is fairly weak, but not necessarily bad, it's a fairly simplistic concept, but the execution and the way the objective is completed, is where all the enjoyment comes from. In addition, the graphics have aged incredibly well. The shaders and lighting look amazing for a game released in 2014. Even the textures look pretty good, and the game runs very smoothly. In the graphics  department, the only flaw I can find is with the character models, which in 2020, look pretty bad, but as I have mentioned earlier, the emphasis really isn't on the story, and the rest of the game looks borderline phenomenal, especially when you consider this game was released 6 years ago.
Overall, I highly recommend this game for people seeking a several hours of some of the most enjoyable, unique movement in any game. Due to it's emphasis on the movement, I can definitely see a lot of replayability with this game and I intend to play it again at some point in the future."
2466,"Yes
"
2467,would pay to play
2468,"A really good game overall. It is incredibly immersive and the background music is just what it needs to do that. Additionally, the story is one to make you feel sad it ended so quickly because it involves approximately 3-4 hours of gameplay. And, of course, it is worth the money to buy it, because it will leave you with a very positive memory of it and is one not to forget!"
2469,"This is not a review, this game is free when I get it, I will play it and give a real review"
2470,Sent me to Big man Tyrone worth the money just for that
2471,tdfcv
2472,"Rich atmosphere, but I thought the story and platforming were both uncompelling.  I beat the game with under 3 hours of playtime, so that leaves me feeling like the value wasn't there for me since I don't intend on replaying it."
2473,GOOD!
2474,"This is an amazing game, a very heartful and warming story made into a platform puzzle game, it can be completed under 3 hours but i didnt got any achievement, so the replay value is also good. For some strange reason i fell empty upon completing it. Good job for the developers!!!!"
2475,"leafy is here played this game in his videos and was how I heard about this game

It is a good game with some Challange, it's not a very long game it took me about 4 hours to complete

it was hard to run the game because of some technical problems with multicore cpus in the windows version of this game
it ran better on my thinkpad R500 just because it has a core 2 duo.

but on my fx-8350 it ran terrible on windows so I tried it on linux and it worked.

it's a great game but I had to use linux to play it.
"
2476,It's a good game
2477,"Dear devs, please learn the difference between a difficult game and a poorly designed one. Hint: add handicap options."
2478,Cool story and game play.
2479,"A Story About My Uncle is a rather short (I finished it in about 5 hours), but also an amazing game with a bittersweet ending. Yes, it gets really hard sometimes, and you will most likely range quit at times, but don't fuss - the feeling of accomplishment after completing the difficult bits is just wholesome. Grab this game when it's on sale and give it a go!
"
2480,Great game worth buying. It has made so much with so little.
2481,the story is realy good I love the level design highly recommend to play
2482,"ggoood

2483,It is awesome. Great story. Great narration. Great Great Great Great Great. Awesome graphics. I love this game so much
2484,It was ten hours of fun and lots of vivid dreams of falling!
2485,"Quite fun, although I wouldn't pay more than a few pounds for it."
2486,Fun game
2487,This game is perfect for a few hours of boredom. 3hours of awesome gameplay and the story is very well put together and hits you in the right spot nearly cried tbh. 10 out of 10 rate this game
2488,i like it its fun
2489,fun
2490,"I guess a game to compare this to would be Mirrors Edge, although I would say this game is much shorter, easier and more fluid with its mechanics.

Gameplay-wise I thought it was really good, all of the different ""gizmos"" you acquire through the game make for some interesting combinations when trying to traverse the platforms and levels; although saying this I didn't think the combinations weren't used enough and most of the time you only needed to use one or two abilities at once. 

The game was a visual treat, the lighting and the graphics were stunning, the caves being a standout area, which made it a joy to progress through.

The story and voice acting were fine, the narrator was probably the best out of the bunch. The ending feels like it comes out of nowhere and I found it pretty anticlimactic, but it didn't detract much from the rest of my experience.

Overall this is a very good-looking and easy to pick up game with a decent story. If you want to play through a very chilled out platformer in a couple of hours without much challenge, you should enjoy this."
2491,Hell ye
2492,"Fun mechanic, definitely recommend playing with a controller."
2493,"good game
"
2494,"Great game, really good story but I wish it was just longer."
2495,Fun game. Definately worth a playthrough
2496,Cool game. Ends before it gets the chance to be repetitive.
2497,y
2498,"The ending is brief and so emotional. 
btw, I really want to drop Maddie when she said "" I TOLD U SO.""  LOL
"
2499,"Game takes less that four hours to beat, This is an adventure game with zero combat. i'd still recommend this for five bucks in a heart beat."
2500,It's really good but the characters look like fat reduced shrek but 5x smaller lmao
2501,"It's time for a bedtime story. Hark back to days far gone as you grapple into caves, floating islands, and the interior of a mountain as you find where your uncle Fred has gone off to this time. It's a sweet story that simply feels nostalgic. The game is, at its core, a platformer that has all of its movement mechanics meshing oh so well with each other. Latch onto things with your grapple hook, leap high into the air using your suit, and spring forwards with a pair of rocket boots that accelerate you into the air to feel like the world bends to your will. And yes, while the visuals are showing their age, the environments can still be enough for that wow factor.

2524,yes its really good and the story is nice
2525,a good game enjoyed it but had annoying glitches it was still enjoyable
2526,"Narrator's voice acting was god awful. Very wooden, stiff as a door."
2527,"Short and sweet game, worth a shot"
2528,I enjoyed it! Not too challenging. Cute story.
2529,"This game is really cool, the emotional development for characters is really capitalized and the gameplay and mechanics are amazing and aren't buggy at all. I love the different upgrades you get throughout the playthrough, adding to the mechanics and making it refreshing constantly. I wish the game was longer, or had more content, because I beat it in just under 3 hours of gameplay, but those 3 hours were so fun. Def worth the pick up, especially if its on sale."
2530,Fantastic game to just escape from reality for a while and feel like you're in another world
2531,"What a good game this is.
The platforming gameplay is simple yet exhilarating (sometime confusing),
The story surprising me with decent writing pair with emotional life thematic in it.

Definitely worth play it through to discover the charming unique world. (A must buy when the game on sale!)"
2532,"So... is this game good? yeah, its pretty good. it has a lot of bugs and grapple mechanics are off and weird but the games doesnt require you to have good skills in order to pass it. first time playing the game and in just 2h playtime i finished it. im not really that skilled in first person games. i just played skyrim.

even tho the game has a nice new view on acrobatic gameplay, it felt pretty empty. very basic and it felt more like playing a costume made sandbox game by a random person (like playing Warcraft 3 costume made maps) than an actual game itself. the story was lacking and overall the game didnt feel like a finished product. right now its on sale and costs only 3$, and thats what its worth. i would never recommend this game for 12,49$"
2533,Loved it tbh great adventure and good story the only real problem I wish it was longer but especially for the sale rn I would say its worth it :)
2534,"blasted through it in a couple hours
still heaps cool though.
and only a couple dollars.
rad
"
2535,"Tried on a friend's pc and absolutely loved it, however when i bought it for myself the sound wouldn't work. Seems like a simple fix, so I go online. Great, other people are having the same problem! Wait- there's no solution! Gotta love when developers put no effort into fixing their broken game."
2536,good game!
2537,"This game is genuinely good.  I used to watch some gaming YouTubers, and I saw this game come up only rarely.  When it did appear, though, I was always happy to see it.  The game's story is very interesting, the graphics and details are very cool to look at, as well as the art style.  The gameplay is nice, and I wish it lasted longer, because the game itself was fantastic."
2538,"It's a pretty game, decent mechanics, nice environments. It's a decently fun game, but I gotta say a few parts are downright hair pullingly frustrating. The windmills, mainly. Damn those windmills. These types of games are best when it's one platform to the next. Here, I could spend around 20 minutes on one jump. Like everytime at those windmills. It's only like once a level or so they show up, but it did spoil those levels a bit for me. The jumps can be a bit weird at times, too. I found flinging myself from platform to platform to be a bit awkward.
At the start of the ice level too, the part with the like 40 floating blocks. That was awful. There needs to be more checkpoints. Especially before the annoying as hell jumps I have to try 30 times to do.
Or maybe i just suck at this game, idk.

So like 7/10."
2539,Cute little game thats short and sweet. it had a nice story and great gameplay! Would definitely recommend playing it at least once.
2540,"A good story, but a predictable one. Gameplay is good but I often get stuck between the rocks an can't get out even if I jump, the only way out is to grapple or power jump. Recommended for people who like puzzles and fast-making decision. And the frog people freak me out! 7/10."
2541,game slaps
2542,"interesting gameplay, fun plot"
2543,great game
2544,"Pretty cool, kind of short. Would recommend at a discount.
"
2545,"noice
"
2546,"This game was very fun, although I do wish it was longer it was a fun ride."
2547,Every kid's dream of flying
2548,At first I thought it was similar to Shower with my dad simulator. Good game to fly away from your problems
2549,I saw Leafy playing it and thought it looked cool. It has some interesting platforming mechanics but is very short. You could beat the game and then refund it if you wanted to.
2550,"What is this:
A lovely little 3D adventure/platformer game
Mechanics are essentially the Hookshot from Legend of Zelda as a form of transport

Goods:
Lovely art style
Pretty decent story
Mechanics are rather enjoyable

Bads:
Very short (I beat it in less than 6 hours)
The mechanics will get absolutely frustrating as you have to point and click to activate the grapple

Conclusion:
Currently priced at $12
Get it on sale and you'll get your money's worth
Appropriate for all ages"
2551,Yes but only on sale. 15$ for 2 hours of game aint it. Buy on sale
2552,"A Beautiful Game
The story was good and so was the gameplay. The controls were a bit buggy at times but it's forgiveable. I do wish that the ending was a bit more satisfactory though. You work so hard to finish the (very frustrating) end level and then the ending is meh. Otherwise it was a beautiful game."
2553,"Once get to learn  the movement mechanics of this game, it's so exciting. Can't even imagine how great this would be in VR. I was getting stuck a few times inbetween the rocks. But nothing to write home about. Definetely recommending this."
2554,"A Story About My Uncle is a phenomenal and fun tale about adventure told in the perspective of a bedtime story. It has a wonderful feel of excitement and of the unexpected, while still remaining charming and all-the-more entertaining. The grappling, boosting, fast-paced parkour challenges are set in beautiful fairytale-like landscapes of floating islands and forgotten civilizations, and the few characters that possess dialogue are likable and will make you smile from ear to ear. The story and courses are short, but offer a lot in themselves while also posing a fair few challenges amidst a whimsical feeling. I highly recommend this game to anyone who considers it, and when it's on sale, it's a no-brainer."
2555,The game is really good and I wish there would be more to the story. The level design and overall mechanics are fantastic and I had a lot of fun playing it.
2556,"Love it!
but some part of the level is hard because it is not clear on what should the player do that i must go look into the community answers alone to know what to do
but overall it's fun and contain a lovely stories
"
2557,.
2558,"Enjoyed playing it a lot, even if it was quite short. Would love to see the explored more."
2559,Amazing game. Endless fun.
2560,Very good game and narrative a quick play for the story and its so fluid its a good platformer
2561,"Not really a game per say, more of a tech demo or proof of concept of movement mechanics.

The ""game"" consists of a series of linear levels that have you to jump, swing, and rocket boost your way to the end. I don't think there is anything challenging about the game, just a period of adjustment to get used to the mechanics.

There is a basic sci-fi story tying the whole thing together, but it's nothing to write home about.

I cannot recommend this as a ""game"" anymore in the year of our Lord 2020. These movement mechanics might have been enough to sell a game in 2014, but not anymore. The original Titanfall came out 2 months before this game, and that tied excellent movement mechanics with an actual game. Now, there's Titanfall 2 which has an excellent story along with industry-standard gunplay and movement mechanics. In addition, that Spider-Man game on the PS4 has hours more jumping and swinging than this game and an actual gameplay and story included.

That being said, it is still a relaxing experience that lets you easily kill a few hours. It's a polished product, but you should never buy it at full price. If you can snag it under $5, it's well worth it. Otherwise, save your money for a rainy day or a proper full-length game."
2562,"Cara, esse jogo √© incr√≠vel, fiz uma run mesmo pq tava com pregui√ßa de zerar 100%, quase chorei no fim cara
S√≥ incr√≠vel, RECOMENDO (Dude, this game's wonderful, I made a run cause I laziness to finish 100%, I almost cried in the end. Dude, just wonderful, I RECOMMEND)"
2563,"Fun, although next to no replay value.

At least play it!"
2564,good if you get it on sale
2565,Short game that's absolutely worth your time.
2566,"good GAME, but it only takes about 3hours to beat"
2567,"it good
"
2568,"Short and ridiculously sweet, but it packs a genuine sense of wonder. I only wish it was longer!"
2569,"Awesome platform game with smooth, easy-to-use but hard-to-master mechanics and an interesting atmosphere. Highly recommended for fans of Portal or other platform games who aren't too fussed with a bland narrative.

Oh yeah - fuck Maddie's Challenge that shit took much longer than it should have. If you encounter it, prepare for some frustration."
2570,"If you buy this game is pretty much for the story and, from a MMORPG player, I LOVED this game and story."
2571,Very annoying checkpoint places and jumping dynamics.
2572,its free real estate
2573," great story, fun gameplay"
2574,Short and sweet. Fun little swinging game. Animations are really outdated though.
2575,should have guns and enmy in the game
2576,the most beautiful game i ever played
2577,good for time pass
2578,"An okay game, a bit frustrating at times, but if you like a challenge it's for you! Story is not that great. All in all an okay game."
2579,Good game it was really fun to play with a good story too
2580,love it
2581,"I've only played this game for five hours; however, that five hours was enough to beat the entire game. This game is very short but is very fun for someone who wants to have a good time and likes parkour games ! This game is full of never dying fun, and story lines that are extremely entertaining, and interesting character ! Sometimes basic story is all you need to have a great time!"
2582,Saw leafy play it. Very well made game.
2583,very good
2584,"That last level was a fucking bastard, seriously some of the toughest platforming I've done in a long time."
2585,So good game and easy
2586,"Great game but the story is too short,it's just game for few hours."
2587,Nice little satisfying game.
2588,"Short game with an uninteresting story but the gameplay is fun and enjoyable, good if you want to be a commentary youtuber And tell kids to drink bleach"
2589,When they took away my rocket boots I almost uninstalled.
2590,Fun.
2591,fun but short
2592,"The game freezes, crashes for me and the sound/music doesn't work on my gaming pc. I don't know how to fix it so, I'm sorry... I can't recommend this game"
2593,I recommend this game to everyone who likes puzzle games or platformers with cool storyline. it was a bit short and the ending is not the most interesting one but overall great experience
2594,Don't know when or how I acquired this game but I am glad I did. Its a short game with fun game play. The levels are all unique in their own way and all spice things up with a new mechanic. Its a perfect way to spend an afternoon and not be too invested.
2595,"The game freezes, crashes for me and the sound/music doesn't work on my gaming pc. I don't know how to fix it so, I'm sorry... I can't recommend this game."
2596,ugly blue autist with stanky blue feet came up to me and i accidently puked on keyboard and monitor
2597,"This game, while it has great level design and graphics, as the worst gameplay ever. The gameplay seems bugged and is plain unfun. Seeing how many people praise this very aspect makes me feel like im the weird one, but really, its extremely slow paced for a parkour game, and when I finished it, I was just happy that I wouldn't play it. The devs seem to have a lot of potential, but the gameplay in this game is just horrible."
2598,This game was pretty good had a fun time
2599,Really fun game with a cool story.
2600,"pretty fun, nothing special. like the art style and there are some very creative level designs. get it on a sale if you can."
2601,The gameplay alternates between having a lot of fun zipping around and some frustrating bits because of hitting objects/leaps of faith/oddly placed checkpoints. You won't dwell too hard on those issues because it's short enough and the atmosphere is quite nice and calming.
2602,is good game if you like  the  puzzle games
2603,Such a simple game that was executed so poorly.
2604,"Amazing gameplay with an amazing story.
I'm so glad that I played this game.
At the final, it makes me cry a bit!
Good job, nephew!!"
2605,"rally great game even though some of the parkour sometimes lack a bit of depth they are really well made and you almost allways understand what the game want you to do by just looking at the path unfortunately the game is sooooooo short like you can basiclly finish it in a day and not even if you r a speedrunner or anything just don t pause during the playthrough and don t care too much about the collectibles and you are done it is truely to the point that i was struck when i came to the ending i was like ""is this it ?"" even though there are some replayablity since there are some alternative path and u can basiclly finish the game without landing too much when u finish it you can easely give it another go and with the experience of the first playthrough you can go so fast and do so much cool shit it s even better than the first time u went through anyway i wouldn t recomend it on it s base price puerly because of the playtime but anything under 10 bucks is a must buy"
2606,"10/10, great story and optimised really well"
2607,"(Below comment is written in rage. Apologies in advance for the developers who worked hard for this game. Though I find it difficult to sympathize the creators of sth. that took both my money and good mood.) 
Most irritating and frustrating game ever. The ""spiderman"" mechanism looks unique and cool at first, but gets old quickly. The plot is plain (you look for your uncle..), character is (yes there is only one main NPC) lame, the only supposedly enjoyable feature should be the jump & swing thing, and perhaps the nice 3D view, which appeared in perhaps 1/4 of the game. However, in many parts of the game the process becomes unnecessarily frustrating. The surrounding in the cave levels is too dark to see anything, and the routes are confusing. The range of the grapple is also difficult to determine. Imagine you are spiderman, up in mid-air, and suddenly find your spider silk just inches short to reach the next holding point, then you start falling, then you start over, and over, and over again. This is what you'll experience mostly in the game. Honestly, after falling 10000 times I simply don't care if ""uncle Fred"" is dead or alive. 
And the set-up of the game... giant floating stones in the sky and blue-skinned characters... sounds familiar, huh?
The game could be useful for parents though. Make your kids play this game if they don't want to do homework/chores, etc. It is absolute torture. Life in self-quarantine seems much nicer and easier after 1 hr of game play. 
Seriously, don't do this to yourself."
2608,It is a fun game to play if you like to have an adventure.
2609,"[h1]I always leave my pc specs in the bottom of the review[/h1]
It‚Äôs an interesting little experience, the platforming sometimes is great, but it also gets repetitive, [b][u]the grapple device is a very fun mechanic[/u][/b], there are some fantastic set pieces, and performance was good, [b][u]however[/u][/b], the story was very uninteresting, the music didn‚Äôt felt like anything extraordinary, and [b][u]the game is too short[/u][/b].

Graphics Card: Nivida GTX 1660ti
Operating System: Windows 10"
2610,"This is a great game. Not only does it have excellent gameplay, but there's also a nice story and a beautiful environment. If you like 3D platformers or parkour games you should play this game."
2611,cool spiderman simulator
2612,Chill.
2613,Great story telling
2614,"very interesting game, i bough this game for 0,38 usd, with big discount
"
2615,game good
2616,blue
2617,"see my time played, thats the whole game, and i took my time. Its a 2 hour game realistically. Good game, no where near $15 however. No real replay value I can see. I got it when it was being given away, otherwise i would wait for a really big sale.  I guess it depends how much you think 2 hours of mediocre fun is worth."
2618,"A short story but very good. The story is told as a bedtime story by a father. Ideas are transmitted just as a father would like to teach his child what a loss of a dear man is, what is a hard choice, what is a sacrifice, what is good and what is bad.
The gameplay is quite interesting(based on ""swing"" technique), complemented by the charming landscapes you can admire. Exactly what you need for a boring evening. I recommend."
2619,Noice!!! but very short story
2620,"I got this game as a gift and thought i should play it through, because I really like games that have a great story. To be totally honest I really dislike the game. Hate is a strong word, but truly dislike. It took about 3 hours for me to finish this game.
The ambience was truly great and enjoyable, so were the characters and narrative. The problem I have with this game though is that most of the platforming got repetetive quickly. I got stuck a lot and because of that grappling device I accidentally skipped a part of the storyline in the ice caves. Consequently I didn't know what I had missed and was lost but surely I wasn't going to replay that part. 
As part of the game, it's like a continuous stream without many cutscenes, therefore you can see the path you took to get from point A to point B and backtrack if you want. Well, on a few occasions I accidentally skipped or somehow fell on to other platforms during swinging and therefore missed yet again some more narrative. Then got lost, tried to move forwards but found myself in the same area I had just come from. I really wanted to quit many times.
The ending, which in fact was the only reason I played til' the end, was disappointing to say the least. The frustration i had to deal with just to see the ending didn't pay off. I'm just happy that it's over.
"
2621,"very good parkour game

like spiderman"
2622,"Okay,the game is not very long,like 2,5 hours to finish but the story line is very nice,you can play the game on a low specs PC and it doesn't require much space ,like 2,3 GB.
 Graphics are very well done and the game is unique just because of the atmosphere and the gameplay.
 The game is worth the price and i recommend it."
2623,"This game is absolutly amazing. The story is adorable, the game play is extremely fun, and I find myself coming back to it very often. My only issue is that its very short, but it is completly worth the price. I left this game only wanting to see more of it, so hopefully a sequel is eventually produced."
2624,"Pretty good game.
I like the sensation of flying and climbing
Short, but with a good history.

"
2625,Good story
2626,"Honestly one of my favorite games. While it is short and the animations and models are clunky, the gameplay is excellent. The story can be a bit awkward at times, but can be a true tear jerker. Really wishing they had an option for custom user made maps, seems like a great opportunity for replay."
2627,"a short little morsel of parkour fun
map design is nice and stylish but the layout isn't ideal 
story is decent
the name is a little bit suspicious 
get it on sale if you've got nothing better to do
"
2628,"Its too short buts its one of a kind experience,Check this out if you have some spare money and want some satisfying and relaxing gameplay experience"
2629,"Great game, lovely, and so calm and peaceful and relaxing! Don't hesitate to buy this game if you're looking for some peaceful parkour time. I hope workshop and custom maps get introduced to this though."
2630,epic
2631,"I enjoyed my time playing the game unless it was too short, nice lore and I loved the characters. Some minor bugs, one of those help me in a certain way in a level."
2632,"Recieved game for free about a year ago, finally got around to playing.
Chill game, Grab a pot of tea n a game pad, kick back and relax. 
10/10 would fall off rock again!!"
2633,"It is a short game but nice one. Sometimes you feel that this part is so easy, sometimes you feel that this part is so hard to pass and it makes it a little challenging and I love the way I should travel through this little amazing world. The animations are scuffed but they are beautiful in their own way and the voice acting of the characters is perfect. The only bad thing in my idea is that it has short story."
2634,good game
2635,"fun concept, fun story, just very short. 7/10"
2636,7/10 - Good
2637,Short - Fun
2638,11/10 would play again
2639,"A unique platform game with clever ideas, imaginative gameplay and a well-written story. Once you put on that suit and are launched into the sky; you begin a journey that will have you smiling throughout, even during the challenging moments. ‚úßŸ©(‚Ä¢ÃÅ‚åÑ‚Ä¢ÃÅ‡πë)"
2640,Short game very fun 9/10
2641,"good mechanics. good controls. great graphics. a little short, but there is lot of replay value"
2642,"An amazing game that I purchased years ago, only to forget about, The mechanics are decent, and although perspective can be a bit confusing, this is a minor point when the rest of the game works so well. The dialogue is very simple, but the story is incredibly deep, especially as you look more into the ending and how the game all has worked out. It is short, and could be completed in one or two sessions, but that works more to promote the nostalgia and atmosphere of the game. Even past the story, the area in which the game really shines is in the art. It is incredible, always with new, distinct areas, and you feel incredibly immersed in the amazing world. The only non-immersive time is when your character sees some of the other inhabitants in the world, as aforementioned, the dialogue can be simple. However, this is minute, and I highly recommend this game to anyone who may have stumbled upon it."
2643,Enjoyable game but a little short
2644,"Good game, but I hate it! The last level was frustrating."
2645,This game has hook and I love hooks!
2646,fun short game
2647," It's a parkour game with some story and an alien world to explore, and it was a pleasant experience for the most part.
+ The gameplay was satisfactory.
+ There were beautiful places to explore.
+ There was a secret language you can decode.
+ Was able to complete with controller.
+ Finding unlockables allows you to customize beam color and add funny goat sounds.

The negatives:
- Minor glitch here and there, like getting stuck or bumping into some walls.
- Checkpoint locations could be frustrating at times. Some were after a couple of jumps, while there were those which took quite the effort to get to.
- It was hard judging distances at some locations. Maybe there could have been some kind of indicator or something for the distance/hook range, e.g. on the crosshair.
- The grappling hook could also be frustrating to use as you had to activate it once in range, and not a second earlier. If we could hold the button and have it trigger as soon as it was in range that would have been great. I missed a lot of opportunities because I couldn't hit the window in which the target was in range."
2648,very atmospheric and a perfect game if u wanna just relax with some lofi music
2649,Extremely fun exploration game with some cool mechanics and a good story. definitely recommend if you are looking for a relatively quick single player scifi story!
2650,Damn good.
2651,"casual game. I really enjoyed it, although I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit longer"
2652,"ok story line. great game for people changing from console to pc that are interested in basic shooter games like csgo, pubg, ect. its nonviolent good for kids too. the story i can see boring for some but the gameplay is i would rate 5/5 for everyone to enjoy"
2653,"Small but beautiful. Cool little story with nice voice acting. The gameplay was nice, sometimes the levels where easy but mostly hard."
2654,Cool
2655,
2656,"The game is the fun, grappling is smooth and exciting. The story was cool, great game to kill time."
2657,"quick 2 hours adventure, gud"
2658,"One of the most relaxing games I've ever played, only con is that it is too short when you take story into account. Nevertheless, a game well worth the money"
2659,"Jumpy and pulley, very nice 57/4."
2660,Amazing adventure and mysterious game ever!!!!!
2661,stupid it has very little uncle
2662,autistinen ja paska lyhyt peli :D
2663,I really like this game
2664,"Great game, there are some frustrating moments, but generally it is not too hard. Concerning bugs, i got stuck and could not move several times and had to reset from a checkpoint, but that did not took much from an overall enjoyment."
2665,"Got this game For Free,I think from Humble Bundle and I thought it was some ""eh"" game,but since this Corona Virus bs,and the fact I don't have anything else to do,I explored my Library in search of games I've got,but haven't played YET.I found this game and I was like:""Meh,why not?"".So I installed the game,started playing and was already blown away by the visuals,I mean the game isn't that hard to turn,but OH MY GOD DOES IT LOOK AMAZING.So it's a + on Graphics.Now,the Story.I honestly thought that this game won't have a Story,and I thought it was only like a Platformer-type game,but again,I was wrong,Story is simple,but it sucks you in (well it sucked me in,at least) and so far I really like it.It's a + on that front.Now the probably most important part of this game - The Gameplay.The Gameplay is easy to learn - but kinda hard to master,don't get me wrong,the ""normal"" gameplay is pretty easy to master,BUT,and a huge BUT,if you want to complete some in-game Challanges/want to get Steam Achievements,you'll have to do some H A R D stuff,well it was hard for me atleast...Now for my total score...:

~I give this game 10/10,would search for my uncle again

And when THE FUCK DID I PLAY FOR 5 HOURS ALREADY?!?!??!

TL;DR:
~Amazing Visuals
~Nice Story
~Gameplay is fun
~Provides a bit of a challange for completionists"
2666,It's one of those games that you boot up when you're bored and are craving something relaxing but still challenging.
2667,"one of the shortest games i've played in my life, but I felt so content at the end of it. I really wish there was more to this cause I found myself sad after the last scene and wished you could go back as an adult. Great game even though the character graphics look like some shits I take. Please make a follow up as an adult."
2668,vary pretty relaxed expirance
2669,"This game is a gem, it truly is. Really interesting story, environment, and mechanics. It surprises you at times, and it exceeds expectations.

Graphics: It is gorgeous, the environment looks absolutely stunning, however some of the textures, specifically on the characters are below stellar. Overall, a beautiful game.

Sound: Sound is very dynamic, and really brings you into the game and the environment. Excellent sound, and very minimal implementation of music.

Overall it is amazing, a great story, environment. Only complaint is how short it is, I finished in almost 3 hours, and you could do it faster. A definite buy on sale, but at full price I would probably hold back on."
2670,Great game if you like platformers
2671,"short but really good story. 10/10 WILL play again
"
2672,This game is amazing
2673,meh
2674,"what a great game a relaxing parkour story aventure love it 7,5/10"
2675,Interesting parkous game.
2676,Really loved the game. The best bed time story ever!
2677,Very cute game. Story could have been expanded on but for a small indie game this is pretty good. I appreciate the ultrawide support. The regular price is pretty high for a game that only took me about 2 hours to complete. Get it on sale or in a bundle for sure.
2678,It is a very interesting game
2679,"A fun interesting game, up to a point. The game play consists of swinging from place to place, for the most part, exploring, and trying to learn what happened to your uncle. 
The visuals are very nice, and the game pretty gentle, but a few hours in I found that I needed to go on-line and look at cheats to advance,m and that ruined my fun. I reached a few points where I simply did not see where I needed to go to advance, and when that is all the game is, that is pretty important.
Still, I give it one thumbs up, I enjoyed the hours I played it, and exploring the world the game designers created was enjoyable."
2680,"it's short but it's a relaxing experience

asking 15 is a little much for a game this short so get it on sale"

2687,fucking wholesome and good shit my dudes
2688,"interesting story, well done levels, and smooth movement."
2689,"Honestly, a pretty good game. The puzzles in my opinion were a bit simple and only took 1 or two tries to really get through any of them. It's short and albeit simple, but the story ended a bit abruptly. A couple mechanics, especially the eye monster was only used once in a relatively short course. It felt like new mechanics were introduced, but forgotten of in latter sections. This doesn't mean the game is bad by any means; however, it felt like the new mechanics were relatively short in scope."

2693,"I picked up this game a long time ago on a giveaway, but had not played it until today. Overall, it was a great experience. A nice story, and fun to play through. Some specific areas were a little bit confusing, especially on the last level, where it was not entirely obvious where to go next. In general, I would definitely recommend picking the game up on a sale, but being as short as it is (I completed it in 2 and a half hours), I really cannot in good conscience say you should get it at MSRP."
2694,"Beautiful stories and graphics, but why no achievements for finishing the story mode? I really feel like I deserve some lol"
2695,"This game is probably the best game for someone to play who has 2-3 hours for an experience that has a mix of a great story and some challenge with it. Has some freedom with exploration, but for the most part is very simple to follow and is just a chill experience to play this game. Best game for just relaxing but still feeling some challenge."
2696,It's a lovely game. Haven't played something like this in a long time.
2697,Short fun game with replayability and Linux support
2698,"Very Short game, could easily be completed in 90 minutes. Overall fun gameplay, nice story. Some of the animations and textures are dreadful and it can be rough around the edges, but still manages to be a pretty game with some diverse sections. 

7/10. 

Get it if its 5$ or less."

2711,"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
its good."
2712,"The store page is a complete lie. This isn't an adventure game. It's a walking simulator with some platforming. There is no exitement and no exploration. It's dull, tedious, the pacing sucks and the story is so light, it's like the AC in the background. This has no replay value whatsoever. And the graphics are out of date for 2014.

If you pay more than 3 bucks for this, you are crazy."
2713,"Fun, relaxing game. Great way to relieve stress."

2715,"This is a great little platformer. It, admittetly, is short(2-4 hours), but it's unlike anything I've played before."
2716,PARKOUR !
2717,"i enjoyed this game, though i only have 2 things to say about it:
1. the story is ok; it's not the best story you'll ever experience but it's good enough to keep you playing. it's also short (you can beat this within 3-6 hours, depending on whether or not you're an achievement hunter), so don't expect to be playing this for a long time.
2. the actual gameplay is pretty fun. it's comparable to portal, as in you're solving problems with a gadget. the major difference between this and portal is that the gadget this uses is a grappling hook, while portal uses portals.

i got this for free from humble bundle a while back, but if i were to buy it i wouldn't pay more than $10."

2722,"Momentum is not intuitive, and when you're on the ground it's never clear where you'll reach (be it with jump, grappling, boost) so you have to keep re trying the same sections over and over again, without being sure if you're doing the right sequence of tools/platforms."
2723,"Great game to relax.
Cool story with a great atmosphere. 
It's not hard to play but I still enjoyed it.
And btw.. Parkoooour

It's a little short though, but all in all I'd recommend it."

2729,"Played through the game twice, don't know why it says 1.5h. If you like the feeling of adventure youll love this game. It has very fun mechanichs and a cute story. The game is pretty short but it never feels stale and always exposes you to new things. True ""Bedtime-story Vibe"""

2732,"I haven't really played much of this game. I review this long after I gave it a rest. The whole story gives me the same feeling as The Stanley Parable, touched with a little bit of Pokemon. The childlike innocence feels as if it hides a greater threat, and one that you must surmount in order to find your Uncle. I've not beaten the game, but I'd love to."

2737,"This Game has an amazing and intriguing story, I will not spoil anything but you should play this game! Loved playing this game on my channel!"
2738,Stupid kinda but fun.
2739,"Altough it was a short game, It's still very fun. With excellent gameplay and mechanics and beautiful scenery and story."
2740,I loved it! wished the story would be a bit longer tho.
2741,"So simple but still so much fun. around every corner there was something beautiful to see. perfect form of less is better. some parts where a little stretched out, but the game design in general was good."

2752,"Just a great game...play it!
Just a little short tho but it has been a blast!"
2753,"The game is shit. you cant enjoy its main platforming without stopping for a unskippable ""cutscenes."" The cutscenes aren't even good either the animation and look for characters is just laughable, everything looks like it was made out of shitty rug material. The only decent parts about this game is the music and the gameplay. Don't waste your money on this."
2754,"This Game is propably one of the best Games i have ever played. 
I took hundreds of Screenshots, because of the beautiful scenery. 
It is such a well done Game with so many Details and tiny easter eggs. 
The Story it tells is unbelievable and i almost cried in the end. 

I Love this Game and it will be one of my favourites forever.
I do recommend this to anyone who is searching for a Game that isnt that easy, 
but still not that hard to master. The Ingame controls are easy to learn and even easier to master.

I¬¥d just wish there would be more Games like this one on Steam. 

"
2755,Sooo relaxing if u put lofi music on toooooooooooOOOOOOOOOO!
2756,Very good for relaxing. Also good story.
2757,"Short game exploring one main mechanic (grappling hook), decorated with pleasant visuals and story.
Pleasant is also the best word to describe my time with it. The game is not too hard. Considering that it has one main mechanic, its length is also ideal so you are not bored with it. Only a little challenging, not frustrating.
Pleasant experience."
2758,"This is a wholesome af game, quite short but definitely really fun to 100% and play the time trials. Mechanics feel good and fluid and overall, quite a chill game to play while listening to music or watching a podcast."
2759,"Small but beautiful. Cool little story with nice voice acting. The gameplay was nice, sometimes the levels where easy but mostly hard."

2764,a piece of shit
2765,"What can I say, it's a great game.

I wouldn't say it has the best replay-ability, but I have gone through it a couple times.

I love the art style, the gameplay is great, the story is unique and interesting (I challenge anyone playing this game for the first time to guess what comes by looking at books, notes etc.)

All in all, good game, if you like adventure, a good story and sometimes a decent challenge, then this is the game for you."
2766,"I haven't played this game in a year. So take this with a grain of salt because memories are funny things. This is as much a review (if you can even call it that) as well as a thank you to Gone North Games. Thank you for making one of the most wholesome, relaxing, engaging, enjoyable games I've ever played. Lots of game companies could take a lesson from your book.

Most games I play are violent, and I'm fine with that. But sometimes, stepping back and losing yourself in a beautiful fairy tale world full of gorgeous locations, fun people and absolutely no threat of violence...it's soothing. I would recommend this game to literally anyone, even though I know it won't appeal to such a broad audience. For about the cost of a single movie ticket and a drink you will get a roughly equivalent amount of enjoyment (I've seen people who beat this in two hours, I have only four on record which shocked me as it felt like 10-20).

I really can't gush enough, I've spent tens of thousands of hours gaming. Only four of which were spent on this game. Yet I'll remember this game fondly for a very long time, way past the point that other titles have faded to dust in my mind. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2767,"ended way too soon in my opinion. absolutely GORGEOUS visuals combined with fun mechanics and a decently intriguing story. also, my cat liked to watch me play so that's a bonus too!"
2768,"The first time i played this was on a pirated version running off a laptop that got me 30 fps max. I'm happy to say that after buying the game and playing through again, that the story is still flawless, and still the most fun i've had."
2769,gg :)
2770,"I have played this game 3 times and I can say that this game is not boring
And it has a good short story"
2771,Very fun game if you love grapple hooks and physics based games. It has a very calm atmosphere for a game where you're likely to die often. Very nice story as well with charming characters.
2772,Short but fun
2773,"Relaxing
"
2774,fun game
2775,its good but not best
2776,uncle gregory touched me
2777,"6/10

Game sucks. It's like a platform game where you can't see where ur jumping and you have to rely on the memory of ur deaths to learn how to get past it. Think of Mario Bros where all the jumps and blocks are invisible. It's a guessing game where each attempt narrows your next guess at success. 

Graphics are good, sounds is nice, voice overs are not bad. Story was written by a 10 year old at best. If the hopeless jumping isn't enough, the physics engine is....well...consistently bad. My main issue is with the 'momentum' variable. Can't remember a game where the momentum cuts off at the end of a swing like this game. At it's core, this is the largest problem with the game...cept for the jumping."
2778,Good
2779,"Stupid-hard if you play with a controller, which I suppose is my fault. Easy at first, and then getting to the later levels it asks you to do moves while physically not being able to move fast enough with a controller to do. Switched to keyboard and felt like a different game."
2780,clean
2781,"3D platforming in first person, now that's a great idea. 
The controls are hit and miss, sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't. The power jumping is a bit of a lottery as well, flying off sideways after releasing a grapple that was pulling you forwards. I got so frustrated with endlessly repeating jumping, that I quit out after finishing the first level and removed the game form my account."
2782,"gud game
"
2783,pee
2784,IT'S GOOD GAME. VERY RELAXING AND TOUGHT PROVOKING. I RECOMMEND IT
2785,"Too short and a bit janky. The game is only about 3 hours long, and there are a few parts that feel unpolished and just plain bad. I only recommend this game if its on sale for like 2 bucks because it isn't worth more than that."
2786,I liked the chill gameplay
2787,"For those who still fly in a dream.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009633669"
2788,"Amazing, just... amazing..."
2789,this game made me happy and making me happy during this place in life is hard... good game
2790,"Wonderful Story, No Glitches, 3 Hours Well Spent."
2791,"Well, I had nothing to push me past my first two hours.
Maybe this king of physics-based platforming is not for me.
The game itself has good voice acting, nice visuals, and great physics controls.
Nevertheless, I found the plot to be rushed and there was nothing there at the beginning to make me explore further.
Have to be negative on this one."
2792,"Yes !! Generally platformer games lack a good story but not this one. Firstly as a platformer it is adrenaline booster and challenging. As a story game it has pretty enjoyable story with good voiceover. It has cool graphics and movement mechanics as an added bonus. Its a must have for platformer lovers ! At last kudos to those indie devs, you guys did a great job. Keep releasing , more power to you guys !"
2793,this is  a fun game with great graphics but- the controls are crap and dont even work half the time. i try to grapple and end up falling because nothing happens. play this game only if youre patient.
2794,"Good game, very soothing, much recommend."
2795,i got diddled
2796,A really awesome game with great and fun mechanics to mess with while chilling out and playing the game. I hope for a second game or for it to at least be able to download custom maps because I love the game so much but it's pretty much the same courses when you beat it. Would still highly recommend for someone trying to find a shorter story game with fun gameplay.
2797,"uncle wasnt very appealing toi me, neither was bird child in the caves. not much material to work with for my fanfic"
2798,"The thing that I find the most interesting about this game is how original it is, I mean the story itself is alright. But the thing that is the best about the game is the fact that it's so satisfying and relaxing just to play the game. The graphics is pretty well done 8/10."
2799,Interesting so far.
2800,"fun game, great little story"
2801,super good I would absolutely recommend this game

The childlike innocence feels as if it hides a greater threat, and one that you must surmount in order to find your Uncle. I've not beaten the game, but I'd love to."
2806,"A small game with a simple history. But enough to want to reach the end and discover what did happen. 
Also the game get more challenging at each level. So be careful if a child play with it, sometimes I really get mad to pass some steps."
2807,great game  !! Go for it !!
2808,"buy in sale
play when u have cooldown in CS :)"
2809,"Fun game, but short. Beat it in just under 3 hours, could probably have done it in less time if certain objectives were more clear. If a sequel is made I think it would do the devs good to polish the models of the actual characters up more, because the environments were fine. A potential sequel might also be better off with more levels, possibly 2 to 3 times the amount depending on what the story allows. Music was good, helped sell the atmosphere. Overall I rate it 8.5/10."
2810,beautiful graphics but difficult to control power jumps.
2811,fun
2812,Amazing game but felt way too short and the voice acting was pretty awful at times. If it's on sale for under 8 dollars you should pick it up.
2813,"I Literally Cried At The End!

This game is beautiful! And I Highly recommend it to everyone

Pros!:
+Great Story! (Which I cried to!)
+Great Views And Graphics!
+Great Characters!

Cons!:

-3 Hours of Gameplay
-A higher price (got in on sale tho)

I love this game!"
2814,"I enyoed this wonderul 3h adventure, not worth for full price but on discount its worth!"
2815,Werr nise

2817,10/10 grappling hook simulator.
2818,Good
2819,delicinha
2820,make you feel like leafy
2821,"Not gonna lie, when i first started this game I wasn't expecting anything good other than a story based on his uncle as the title suggests, but when i started to play it i found it quite good, i'm not one to play this type of game often but i would definitely play it again."
2822,"Great adventure game, sometimes gets confused where to go but except that everything is great.
"
2823,"Truly innovative platforming and gameplay. Had a total blast playing through each unique level.

Story had heart, but voice acting was pretty bad.

Definitely worth a play through, especially on sale."
2824,"pretty good, wish it was longer"
2825,"Good game. Weird jump intervals tho. Sometimes the grapple is short on some jumps. Other than that, amazing game. Anticlimactic ending too."
2826,"The idea is interesting and the mechanics are fun. There are a few great levels, but I think the rest could be more engaging. I liked the visuals and the different settings. The story is okay.

I got it at -75% and since it's a rather short game, I'd recommend you get it a discount, too."
2827,Amazing game.
2828,it's very good game
2829,"I paid less than 4 dollars and it still feels overpriced. Bad voice acting, invisible walls, bad controls. It does have a lot of potential though."
2830,"Gameplay very interesting, flying through the floating stones is really fun!"
2831,"I found it on the store by suprise, and decided to try it out.
Boy am I happy now I did. I loved this game, It just touched all the right buttons for me.
Among all the new games that are soo looooong, and never seem to freaking end, this one was a refreshment. Simple, short and to the point. It reminded me of how simple games used to be. An easy to understand gameplay style with a good story.
I downloaded it for FREE, but I would gladly pay money for it."
2832,"A short puzzle/platform game with a very unique way of traversing the levels. It requires some thinking and some patience, but it was an enjoyable adventure over the 3 hours it took me to beat the game. I did not go for 100% completion, this was the time required to complete the levels and reach the epilogue. 

If it is on sale, or free like I did through Humble, pick it up and enjoy. No combat, no action to speak of, just a fun platforming puzzler suitable for all ages. 

7/10"
2833,A+ Rated Game from those from Velociti Entertainment.
2834,"Overall it's a nice game.
I have completed game in 3 hours, but i don't think i'll play this game again.

+Good story
+Good sound effects
+Amazing atmosphere

-Only 3 hours of gameplay (that some people would like)
-A little higher price"
2835,Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. The rich story and graphics are so well done that it becomes so immersive. My only wish though would be to make it longer because it's that good. 10/10 would buy and play again.
2836,Nice story line and very low key game.
2837,"Very challenging game some parts are quite simple but others are quite difficult, Can be a little frustrating when stuck on a difficult section but fun none the less."
2838,great storyline fun game mechanics
2839,"It's a short game, but a paradise for speedrunners and people who like laser-beam grappling hooks :D
The story is simple, but still deep enough to get you attached. There's a decent number of collectible extras which unlock additional modes, if you enjoy exploring the environment."
2840,"Yo, wtf i get this game for free/free to play about 2 years ago and then, it for sale now?"
2841,bruh
2842,"+ Good graphics
+ Good sound effects
+ Good story

- Pretty much no replay value

I guess I should mention that it's pretty short, a few hours maybe, which is something I like.
I've had a few friends tell me it's complete garbage but in my opinion it's pretty good ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
2843,"No. Just no.

The story is interesting but I'd pay more attention to it if I wasn't busy falling to my death every two minutes because the rock I can land on is two inches too far or I don't know where to grapple next."
2844,GOOD
2845,"Great story, nice graphics and sound track. All things consider it's a very good game. Must try at least once. The game could feels like hard sometimes but it's sure is fun!"
2846,8/8 you already know
2847,So much no.
2848,it was pretty cool
2849,"Niko its your Uncle. Why don't you try to find me.

2852,would like to have a part 2 if possible xd
2853,Solid first person platformer. Would reccomend to anyone looking for a good 5 hours of fun.
2854,"Although the game features a short story, it's a damn fine one. Haven't experience this good of a story in a long time and I recommend it to all. The in-game soundtrack and scenery only add to this games already fantastic story. 10/10"
2855,"It's a great game with a great concept, it's just pretty short (Less than two hours to complete the story first time)"
2856,nice
2857,"Hikayesi ve tatlƒ± karakterli ile sƒ±kƒ±lmadan oynayacaƒüƒ±nƒ±z g√ºzel bir oyun/
You will never get bored with its story and these sweet characters"
2858,Such a nice game.
2859,i thought this was a going to be a nice calm story about a nice uncle but instead it is the game that leafy is here would play and i HATE leafy is here because he is a fucking fraud and I HATE HIM I HATE LEAFY IS HERE  hes such a dummy this game sucks i wish it was about MY uncle then it would be a good game but it is not so this game is fucking garbage
2860,"This game had really good movement and mechanics, and a nice story to go through. Two things are unclear to me still, but on the whole I really liked it."
2861,"This game a little bit boring actually. But if you like exploring, see a new stuff, see a blue creature, I recommend this."
2862,"A cozy and wholesome little game that launches you into an adventure. The visuals and sound create a wonderful atmosphere that stands the test of time and is worth experiencing today. The story is short and doesn't develop as much as i would like but i enjoyed it and i think it fits the concept of the game (we are the protagonist of a bedtime story a father is telling to his daughter).
As for the gameplay, you control a suit that provides you with some cool abilities and allows you to traverse the map which consists mainly of floating rocks and islands. They feel fluid and responsive for the most part, but i felt like i didn't have enough control over the movement of my character in the air when i wasn't using said abilities.

Overall, both the gameplay, visuals, sound and story blend well together and create an experience worth your time."
2863,Super nice

2866,"8/10
The story and the puzzle element of the game was really good. Figuring out where to go was a bit challenging but still fun."
2867,"good, i guess? I got it for free, i don't want to hate the game because ti had a sad ending and i don't to feel like bad person,but it was short and even with he sort lived campaign it still was fun and I recommend it to anyone"
2868,"Totally epic game, beat in 2 days"
2869,"Not a big game and a simple mechanic.
The Story is short and simple.
But its a nice relaxing game... I like it."
2870,Good game could've been a bit longer though.
2871,Pretty cool game for when your in ya feelings and wanna chill
2872,The voice acting is not great but the gameplay is very satisfying when you get the hang of it. I love using the grapple mechanic.
2873,"VERY entertaining and worth while! great story, and wholesome ending! definitely worth it!"
2874,"A short 3D platformer with varied game play elements and a ""discovery style story"".  About 2-3 hours of game time, without a great deal of replay value .  Would definitely recommend if you can pick it up for under $10."
2875,Good
2876,"Well, It could be better to be honest, like I didn't enjoy that much the mechanics of the grappling hook even tho It was the main thing in the game, I really liked the boots where you can fly for a little bit. The story was okay, not that impressive, but okay. It was short, too short if I might say, I didn't expect to be that short. I don't know to be honest. I would recommend to people who like short games that would chill, but I didn't expect it to be that short, I wanted a challenge I wanted more mechanics, but yeah. Even tho not so bad, not so good."
2877,"So‚Ä¶ a bit underwhelming at first and In general it gave me a lukewarm kind of feeling. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. Very neat visuals for a 2012 indie development and also a good concept. For most of the game I felt the story was quite childish even if THAT is a part of itself. What got me through it was some of the puzzles that were quite entertaining. I didn‚Äôt relate to the characters at all and I stress this because, although it is a platformer afterall, it has narrative driven aspirations. It has good voice acting and good writing and the final ‚Äútwist‚Äù, although very predictable, it‚Äôs satisfying.
Even if I feel i‚Äôm not happy with this game I can‚Äôt bring myself to give a thumbs down because in the end it has definitely more than 50% approval from me."
2878,<3
2879,"Quite indie, quite pleasant."
2880,"A short yet wholesome story. A tale of wondrous adventure, and the developer successfully created the world. 

The movement was a bit slippery at first, but once I understood the movement it was an amazing journey. Unfortunately, when the possibilities of maneuvering were almost endless, the game ended."
2881,aafaasda
2882,Really short but wonderful game! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the mechanics and gameplay. The game wasn't too ambitious. It knew what it could accomplish and did it wonderfully.
2883,Good chill experience
2884,"A grappling hook adventure with some great visuals. The game also comes with a cute companion that I liked a lot. The story itself felt a bit weak and the ending was lackluster for me. The scenery and setting was far better than the plot in this one. Still it's worth a playthrough. Get it on sale and try it out. Game takes about 5 hours to beat but offers significantly more if you want to 100 % the game since it comes with achievements, collectibles and time trials."
2885,"It is a nice, simple and short game. Nice art direction, too. It is not very difficult, except for one part in an ice cave that took me like 10 attempts. 
8/10."
2886,"It is so fun to just swing around, and the story is good."
2887,"The game isn't bad, the gameplay is simple but very polished; it's original and the story is narrated well and captivating, for how simple it is; the problems are: some advanced sections are quite frustrating because the lenght of the grapple locks on objects doesn't feel consistent, generating some repeated fails; some sections are quite frustrating, but the worst thing is how the story ends. 

It feels extremely rushed and left in the air, like they had to stop it there for some reasons; it doesn't feel  like it gives a good closure, which for a story based game feels very bad.

With a good, satisfying conclusion i'd hold this game with twice the affection i do now. It feels quite rushed, but overall it's polished."
2888,game = good
2889,hot
2890,meh
2891,The only thing this doesnt have is bhop
2892,"tl;dr 6/10. Gameplay lacks polish and it's too short for the story to take effect, but still fairly fun.

I don't quite remember what all the hype around this game was about a few years back. I think some commentary YouTubers used it as background footage? Either way, it makes sense I wouldn't remember because this isn't really something super memorable. I see some people describe it as ""cute"", and I think that just about sums it up.

The gameplay is fine. It lacks polish, making it frustrating every once in a while. More frustrating is the checkpoint style saving; I totally get why it's used in certain types of games, but not being able to quicksave and having to trek the same section over and over to get to the one part you have trouble with can get annoying super fast.

It's a short game, clocking in at around 2 hours. I have an appreciation for games that know how long they should stick around, but for this game that's just a little too short in my opinion. I hardly got to know anything about the world or the characters I'm supposed to care about. Speaking of story, the narration doesn't work that well here. Unlike the narration in Bastion, it feels almost characterless. All you get out of it is hearing a guy describe exactly what you're doing as you're doing it.

Still, I appreciate the art behind this game, and the gameplay is satisfactory. I recommend waiting on a sale."
2893,Very nice and calming game! Great story!
2894,"A short, but very cute and endearing game!"
2895,Its a good game with a good storyline and adventure. But moving around when using your device can be a bit frustrating at times.  8/10

2897,"A Story about my uncle:
[spoiler](got the game for free a long time ago)[/spoiler]

Overall Its a nice game.
The start of the game i was having some fun, but my last hour was meh cose of the same gameplay.
I completed the game in 2h; i liked how the story was told, but the game didn't felt like a game, it felt more like a: ""do this parkour to uncover the story"".

[b][u]pros[/u][/b]
[*]Nice story
[*]Cute world
[*]Lots of things to explore
[*]Some secrets
[*]Runned well on my low-end PC
[/list]

""[b][u]cons[/u][/b]""
[*]Good gameplay but it gets boring fast
[*]No real replay ability beside getting all of the achievements
[*]2 to 6h of gameplay
[*]Had a lot of cliping and invisible walls during my playthrough
[*]The gameplay is fast and sometimes the game slows you down alot
[/list]

You need a ""good"" aim at end of the game

If steam had an meh rating would use it for this game, but its worth its price seeing some of the late 2019 AAA games.
But don't base your though on my trash review."
2898,Grappling hook simulator.
2899,a very fun to play game
2900,"[h1] Old but gold [/h1]

While it is certainly obvious how aged this game is, it is still a lot of fun to play. The goal is to traverse multiple levels of parkour, which his heavily focused on a grapling hook mechanic. Just get the game, try it. It's worth it."
2901,"Well... I did it. I beat the game.

It's ok I guess. Has some ginks to it.

Rather not go back to collect everything though. Not my cup of tea."
2902,"While the game is quite short and sadly does not have a community workshop, its an amazing game with beautiful scenery and fun mechanics. It's Great for a fun couple of hours."
2903,"It's a fascinating story with amazing visuals.  Largely linear, but with your mobility in a 3D world that's for the best.  There's soothing music, rich atmosphere, and good visual story telling.

First-person platforming is not my strong suit, so it's hard to say if movement is arbitrary at times or if it's just me.  Would love if there was a platform grab, so less missing by a short distance.  Other than that, ASAMU is a great game.

"
2904,"This is a pretty good game overall, but it feels somewhat unpolished. There are a few minor glitches and some weird looking animations, but the main substance of the game, the platforming, is pretty well designed. I wish the game was longer and had more depth in the world, the story, the characters etc, but I guess that's more fitting for a sequel (like how Portal 2 was compared to Portal)."
2905,I got this game on a sale and was pleasantly surprised. Its a must play of you like story driven puzzle games.
2906,"It's short but fun. The story is alright but not anything amazing.

7/10"
2907,"A simple but wonderful story of finding your uncle woven into the parkour gameplay. While sometimes it frustrated me during failure, I enjoyed the game for it's mechanics and how well made it is."
2908,"This game may be short, be it is an incredible few hours. The movement and controls remind me a lot of the Half-Life games, but the rest of this title are completely and refreshingly original. The tools you are given can be used in a variety of ways to achieve different feats and reach different areas. On top of that, the world this game is set in is absolutely breathtaking, and you get to explore so much of its beautiful map. I hope that someday we get more of this title, but for now I am perfectly content with what we've been given here."
2909,"Avery chill, short and pleasant game. It takes about 3h even if you are not in a hurry (and suck at platforming like it do). It has a nice simple story with fun characters. If you are looking to spend an afternoon on a easy calm game then I can easily recommend it."

2919,"captivating, great storytelling & immersive"
2920,Cool story bro.
2921,"such a pretty game! gameplay's not extremely difficult but challenging enough to be engaging, and it runs reasonably well even on meager hardware. the story's lovely as well"
2922,"It has a good art style along with some solid platforming. A downside is that the physics of the game feel capped to a certain speed where, you will miss a ledge only by an inch and fall because you're limited to a certain speed. But regardless I enjoyed it."
2923,Super relaxing
2924,"10/10, I said to my self "" Man I hope I am not even half way through this game"" 3 seconds later I finished it :(

Very awesome and relaxing, yet challenging game"
2925,"A short, but really lovely game. I enjoyed the platforming gameplay throughout, despite occasional frustrations. The level design is breathtakingly beautiful in spots. It's a positive, fun, feel-good game. It was clearly made with a lot of love, and it has a warmth about it that I think is rare in games. Very much worth playing, despite its age."
2926,"unique story, fun gameplay, albeit kind of short"
2927,good but short game
2928,"Amazing game.. this is my 2nd review since i just finished the game... well im gonna go over the things i like about it..


THE ''POWERS''':  from the Suit...Was Fun Using them.. and find my way to use them in order to pass difficult levels..

DIFFICULTY: is OK.. i wouldnt say super hard.. but that depends on you.. how you think.. since like i said you gotta use the ''Powers'' in your own way.. i got stuck an decent amount of times.. failed a lot.. in point where i ragequited.. then came back to finish it.

CHECKPOINTS: i know is frustrating losing your progress.. but in this game the Checkpoints are great.. they are not too far from each other..(is good distance..enough for you to enjoy and not getting mad for failing)

GRAPHICS: They did great job on it.. i felt part of the game..(the People look bad tho.. like rly bad.. look the pics up.. tho you see them for a while only.. so dont worry about it)

AUDIO: is good.. voice acting is great..

GAME TIME: would say takes around 4 Hours.. took me 5.9h tho some of it is afk with the game on Pause..

STORY: Is a Wholesome story.. chill.. the voice actor which is ''your character'' says the story to his daughter... about his adventure and his uncle.. so when you reach in some places.. says like what it is and stuff about it! (The voice is smoooth as hell)

PRICE: well is 4hour game.. 12.49EURO.. i wouldnt buy a game which is 4hour long.. for 12.49euro.. im 17 years old so i dont work.. and rather buy a game same price which offers me more .... THO if i could spend 12.49 without carrying i would.. or buy it on sale.. you gonna have fun so ye.. you know what i mean..

BUGS: Never had any

..Well ye i only have to say about things i like.. since is a amazing game for me.. with no flaws..
just would like more content.. or DLC..ow also there is a Time Thing which you do after you finish the game.. like ''BEST TIME'' finishing areas. 

IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY IT.. HAVE FUN MATE!

luv ya"

2930,a nice little platforming game with what at its core has a sweet little story about finding purpose.
2931,"Story 8.5/10, Game play 9/10.
Overall a chill game to play so, 8.5/10"
2932,Is ok game
2933,Is good
2934,"Very nice game, pretty straight forward and quite short to be honest. The core mecanics are pretty simple, the atmosphere is nice. 
I think it would be a great game for VR."
2935,I still have no idea what the hell this game is about but it is good. It goes for 5 hours but it has some good story telling.
2936,"Excellent platforming with good lore, and the narrator sandwiching the past feels a bit like what I've seen/heard of What Remains of Edith Finch."
2937,"A Story About My Uncle is indeed a story about the narrator's uncle, but still is one hell of a game, it was pretty short but every second felt like I was about to find something new, new refreshing mechanics were introduced frequently which made the game really fun. And it does all that while having a great story behind and very likable characters. It is a must play and completely changes the meaning of platforming. GET THIS GAME. NOW."
2938,Very fun game recommend
2939,"Gameplay 
The gameplay is super fun, it‚Äôs the best Spiderman game that isn‚Äôt Spiderman, its not terribly difficult, however there are a few tougher moments, and if you want a challenge the game has achievements that would be a good challenge to achieve.

Story
The story serves its purpose, but its nothing special, I enjoyed it at the beginning and wondered where it would go, but personally I thought it had a lacklustre ending.

Graphics/performance 
The graphics are pretty simple, it looks like a high-res PS1 game, but I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. Performed with no issue on a high end PC, but I can‚Äôt imagine it would struggle with lower end machines. 

Value
I believe I got this game for free from the Humble website, however I would definitely recommend it if it around the ¬£3 mark, I got 2 hours of gameplay out of it, but it‚Äôs a fun 2 hours. 
"
2940,"if you are a noob like me then dont buy this game because its pro is only the mechanincs.
story is empty, the game is short but i still got soo frustrated during the gameplay."
2941,That girl is really annoying but otherwise good game
2942,"Great story, impressive ending and fun gameplay."
2943,"I tried it when it was free.It was like a movie,i liked it."
2944,"Short and sweet is the best way to describe this game. There is a lot of charm in its story and characters, all mixed in with some interesting platforming gameplay that's always responsive and fun to do throughout. It was like playing an bedtime story and worth a playthrough."
2945,i have played a game called eastshade and i really love that game and this is gotta be the most prettiest adventure story mode game i have ever played and beat and i just love the idea that their are these purple or blue or green frog people in the caves and also taking that little blue frog girl maddie along was pretty fun and the places are just so pretty to me for some reason but very good game i got this free for a limited time back in the day so glad i picked it up :)
2946,"Very charming game. Definitely worth picking up if you're looking for something short-ish, fun and a bit challenging."
2947,This made me gay for my uncle
2948,"fun short game, 9/10"
2949,"Outstanding little game.  Nothing flashy, but found myself wanting to play it.  Two or three spots test your ability to get through after a couple retries, but otherwise the difficulty isn't really very high at all.  It's nice to just cruise through the levels, and the simple story is quaint but effective enough.  Great background musical score that is just in the background during gameplay, but if you listen for it it's a nice touch.  The ONLY thing I'd like to see, is cranked up graphics.  1440p w/ all the bells and whistles turned on is nice, but it just feels like if it could be taken to that next step the visuals would be out of this world...  not a complaint though, the existing visuals are very nice and immersive (it's just I'm craving a bit more for some reason)."
2950,"This is a fantastic game. Took me about 4-5 hours to complete.
It is fun and challenging. A wonderful family game. I highly recommend it!"
2951,b
2952,"This a unique platfomer where a boy explores a magical world looking for his lost uncle. I completed it in about 4 hours and those 4 hours were very enjoyable. Yes, I'll give this great game a thumbs up."
2953,nice game
2954,"short, but wonderful experience as a platformer game"
2955,"One of my favorite games. Great story and, while sometimes frustrating,  overall great gameplay. I¬¥ll be keeping an eye on this studio to watch if they have anything new coming out!"
2956,"A brief game that is a bit of a one-trick pony. You grapple from platform to platform and there's almost always only a single path forward that ""works"". If you really enjoy the grappling/platforming you might like this game. I found it just ""okay"", which isn't enough to make me recommend it. The worlds are just too empty; there's nothing going on in any of them. When the FPS platforming works in this game, it is really satisfying. But there's also a lot of trial and error and, unlike some better games that ""reset"" instantly you often have to wait 5-10 seconds after a death to get going again. You don't actually die until you hit the ground, so when you miss a grapple you'll often be flying through space just waiting to die."
2957,normalino
2958,"Excellent adventure game.
Great work!"
2959,noice but this game is hard for me
2960,"very, very good game, it can be difficult, and its a very good game cause it makes you go through puzzles, very fun! its a game i highly reccomend."
2961,This is a wonderful game to just play and relax. Great way to kill time.
2962,ITs amazing i loved it highly recommend
2963,cool little game
2964,"It was a fun adventure, worth every  moment. It was short and great for a story driven game. It was about fantasy and being lost. Controls are simplistic, scenery is beautiful. 10/10 would totally recommend specially if you want them to feel calm."
2965,Fun quick play through.
2966,I love MY UNCLE
2967,yes
2968,"A very beautiful platformer about fantasy and loss. This is a game I would show to my children if I had any. Controls are simplistic, scenery is beautiful, story is conveyed well. I give this game my recommendation for all kinds of gamers."
2969,"A Story About My Uncle is fast, fuid and fun. As a story it successfully springboards off traditional adventure fantasy and vaults off elsewhere. The two converge into a unique platformer with real heart.
"
2970,"This is a pretty good game. I hesitate to say great because of the amount of faults it has. However I need to start off by saying that NONE of these issues have to do with gameplay.

Gameplay is solid and smooth throughout the whole thing. The game feels great whether you're playing on controller or keyboard and mouse. This is a plus if you're like me and you enjoy putting a nice game on the TV and relaxing with a controller in your hand to wind down the night. If you're into that kind of thing, this game is a must have. 

As for the faults, there are a few, but they are all fairly minor gripes. There isn't much to the story (It's very short too. 4 hours got me through the whole thing, and I took my time with it), the voice acting is not great. The animation for every character other than your own is laughable. The other character models are also lackluster.

HOWEVER

None of these things stopped me from enjoying this game to the fullest. The gameplay is challenging in the final stages but not ridiculous, the difficulty increases at a nice pace throughout. The environments are beautiful, with the music complimenting the scenery quite nicely. The animations and model for the main character are very well done. All of this blends to make a seamless experience throughout.

With that in mind I'd give this game a 8/10. It is a solid ride, and one I will definitely replay."

2974,"I dearly love video games that give me a sense of movement, and ""A Story About My Uncle"" delivers. This game lets you hop across floating villages and swing through deep caverns, giving you the power to throw yourself around at terrific speed but never giving you too much control. This wild thrill of mad semi-flight is wrapped up in a charming bedtime story that conceals a hidden sorrow. I think you'll like it."
2975,"Too short for the $20 price tag, clunky dialogue and voice acting. Grappling was good and nice story though."
2976,"Would I recommend it? Definitely! It's great! IF you can get it with a discount. I'm sorry, but if I had to buy it again, even knowing the fun I had playing this game, I wouldn't buy it at full price. It's a bit too high.

2985,"Was on my wishlist as looked similar to [url=store.steampowered.com/app/378610/Valley/]Valley[/url], but got for free from humblebundle.
Finally tried it for few hours: it is ugly overall, especially character models, fire, voice acting, story, it is too dark to see where to walk (changing gamma makes it visible, but also makes everything even uglier), has extremely buggy menu if navigated using controller (it stops showing selected item), buggy in game (like falling animation when you are not standing on flat surface), extremely annoying save points, annoying mechanics. Yes you get a bit of a feeling of falling, but that is it.
I really don't understand more than 90% positive reviews on it."
2986,beautiful game
2987,Awesome Game Loved It!
2988,Atmospheric - Fun - Adventurous  game
2989,"It's not an amazing game, I'll start with that. But it is good. The pacing can be all over the place at points, but I still sort of had a connection with the MC. Sort of. The story, if you're skilled in this game, can be beaten pretty quickly. Looks pretty, the story CAN be good sometimes, and it feels pretty nice to grapple around and such. The real place I had fun was the end level where it expects you to really try to reach the next checkpoint."
2990,gg
2991,"ASAMU is a beautifully crafted game with great gameplay and a compelling story line. The effects of the grapple gun can get you addicted as you fly through the sky, and the overall scenery (especially when you come out of the caves) is beautiful. In one word, I can summarise the graphics of this game as realistic.

The story line can be only described as intriguing. There was a climax inside my brain as every second went passed, wondering what would happen next every time. I won't go into detail at all about what happens at the end, but all I can say was that it was the most disappointing ending that a story could bring. If you only gave me one thing to disagree about, I would go ahead and say that the ending could've been written better. Even if it was written to be more predictable, it still would've been a better ending.

I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story to follow along to, as well as gameplay that is fairly impressive :)"
2992,Neat little game. Is rather short though. Barely took me 2.5h w/o all collectibles. I mean I searched for them but I'm by no means a completionist. Story is also neat. I like the concept of it. Glad I played it. Can recommend.
2993,Short but entertaining
2994,Nice game! Relaxing to play and it has an extrodinary good story!!
2995,"This really is a good game. The story is good, the graphics are decent,, the atmosphere is incredible, and the gameplay is fun. The game is kind of short depending on your skill but very fun and definitely worth playing. I received the game for free but i would definitely buy it again."

2998,A stunning game with beautiful scenery and a great storyline and atmosphere. It is quite short unfortunately so I would recommend waiting for a sale :)
2999,Worth play
3000,nice story and gameplay
3001,Awsome game
3002,"very fun,and engaging would recommend if looking for a fun shortish indie game"
3003,Nice game with nice story & gameplay
3004,Fun story and game mechanics are smooth. Very homey feel every now and then. About to do my third play-through.
3005,i literally bought this game and its making me buy it again like what the actual hell?
3006,funny
3007,All I can say is: I'm very afraid of heights
3008,very fun and cool
3009,"Fun game, takes under 2 hours to beat. The game it rather laid back and i didn't really struggle with any of the levels. Its worth the buy when its on sale"
3010,‚†Ä
3011,"That was a beautiful story. I love the mechanics of the game and while it may actually be a relaxing game, it can sometimes be stressful especially on certain levels like the Ice Cave. I'm giving 8.5/10 overall. Could be improved in terms of content, I feel like the game was a tad short."
3012,"Short story, relaxing game, maybe too high of a price for what it is so id recommend waiting for it to be on sale. 
"
3013,"Cool game. Challeging, misterious, cool story... Somewhat a video puzzle."
3014,The Story was good but some puzzles are hard to solve
3015,"I had this game in my library for a while now, I decided to give it a go because I was bored and ended up really loving this game. Sadly the game is really short and took me only 2 hours to beat without knowing anything about the game. Other than that if you wanna play a satisfying gravity/grappling game this one is a ton of fun with a nice little story to go with it."
3016,"Who would have thought that an uncle of a kid was an inventor, breeder and an astronaut? Well this game sure did! Great work to Gone North Games, i found myself captured in the story and wanting to see it to the end. Lots of checkpoints, a few scary bits but nothing to scream about, i wouldn't consider the game a ""Parkour"" genre however many others would, I like to think of it as a reverse gravity gun from Half Life and a few tweaks from other game ideas.

Great game! Great value! Great story.

10/10"
3017,"Fast, fluid and fun first-person platforming tied together with a warm narrative. Pace slows near the end, though.
"
3018,swoosh
3019,completed the game in 3.5 hours (12 is because of hour booster) its fun parkour game but some stages were very hard specially the ice part
3020,narrator is dead after telling me that 26 hour story
3021,No matter how many times you play it it never gets old
3022,so short its a crime
3023,Beautiful game
3024,"Chill game, good story"
3025,good
3026,"I had heard about this game years ago, and got it in my Steam collection several months ago but I never played it until now. This review comes after completing the main story, and I completed it by chapter rather than all at once.

This is, in my opinion, a simple game. It has a simple story, told by a father to their daughter at bedtime on how the father went to look for his brother years ago and wound up in a different world. It has simple mechanics, using your mouse + keyboard (or controller) to grapple onto different surfaces and swing around large landscapes. It has simple, yet gorgeous, atmosphere and music that (for me, at least) helped me relax during some of the harder sections.

One thing this game does not have are enemies to fight. There is one ""enemy"" at the end of one section, but the big challenge players will probably face is learning how to best use your grappling device. Some parts of this game may take multiple attempts to complete, which can increase your overall playtime. There are also collectibles to find hidden through the levels, and collecting them all will unlock extra modes and artwork.

Here's the short version: If you want an atmospheric game focused on exploration where you can take your time and enjoy where you are, this is a good game to try. However, if you do not like repeating certain areas over and over again you may want to skip this."
3027,Really chill game to play with the fun grappling dynamic. No level got anywhere near too difficult to the point I wanted to quit playing. I did feel like the story ended kinda abruptly though. All in all a fun game with a good story.
3028,yesh
3029,a reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly good game
3030,"Wow, Just finished the game. It was truly amazing. The graphics, story line, character development were all amazing... I really enjoyed the game and super glad i bought it.

"
3031,An amazing game! Any chance you guys thinkin' bout working on a sequel?
3032,"Very good story. I like the mechanics, the grapple and jump. I must say that there are some places where it gets frustratingly hard, then the next part is easy again. But all in all a very good game!

Edit:
The only problem with the game is that the sequences where you approach and talk to ""people"" are unskippable. This makes getting the achievements a bit frustrating."
3033,"finish the games for 4 hours straight, wheewwww.... weird story"
3034,"This is an amazing game. It may be a bit too short at 3 hrs but these 3 hours are completely amazing.
You'll like it even more if you're into Spider-Man as it can be very similar."
3035,"So the best way I can think of to describe A Story About My Uncle is to say it's essentially a ""walking simulator""-type game; except like 90% of the walking has been replaced by high-flying grappling-hook-fueled parkour shenanigans.

In the game, you follow the story of a young man questing through a strange and colorful alien landscape searching for his missing adventurer/scientist uncle. Aiding you in the journey is a special power suit equipped with jump boosters and an energy grapple as your main methods of locomotion. However your number of grapples per jump is limited, so if you run out you can expect a long drop into a bottomless pit. There are other tools and abilities you can also get along the way, as well as various environmental objects you can interact with.
There are no enemies to fight, no bosses or anything, the game is just you vs the environment. However there are various items to find, such as 5 hidden collectibles per stage that come in the form of these weird ""sensor"" devices that look like something out of BioShock. These are fairly well-hidden, but every 5 you collect opens up a new bonus option in the main menu. 

The entire story is narrated to you by the now-adult main character, recanting his adventure as a bedtime story to his daughter. He narrates it piece by piece as you play the game, upon reaching various locations or examining various items. Some context objects are optional and are hidden away, and open up extra little details added to the tale. Overall, the story of ASAMU is fairly decent, albeit a bit on the short side, and while I won't spoil anything, I do wish it could have had a bit more of a resolution around the end. The art design really shines, with the various locations being fairly interesting and colorful. The music is decent enough, but isn't particularly memorable. Sound effects and voice acting are decent enough; I've read some people saying the voice acting was bad, personally I didn't really notice a problem with it.

The grappling hook acrobatics are fun enough- when they work. The physics, however, do not exactly work the way you would expect them to. Your character only seems to maintain any momentum while they aren't currently grappling something; the moment you hook on, it quickly reduces to nothing. When you latch onto one of the games many floating rocks, instead of swinging around like you're holding onto a rope or vine, you instead get pulled directly towards it. This can lead to a lot of frustrations as if you want any decent propulsion, you need to grapple yourself towards it and then let go at the right time so that your momentum carries you past it towards your next destination; however a lot of the time you'll just end up slamming into it face-first and dropping like a rock. It also makes things difficult in areas where you need a decent speed boost to reach a distant ledge, and you'll find yourself falling short and plummeting to your demise multiple times. It *does* make it easier when you need to grapple downwards towards a surface, however, which is a plus considering that you can't really alter your momentum while in mid-air apart from grappling something, making it easy to overshoot your target in instances where you're trying to land on a small ledge or platform.

Lengthwise, the game is rather short, with only 5 levels overall. And unless you're into doing time trials and such, the game doesn't really hold a lot of replay value unless you're a completionist or achievement hunter or something. There are the hidden collectibles, but the bonus options they unlock I don't feel are really worth the effort. 

Despite its flaws, though, I do recommend this game. At the time of writing this review it's selling for only around 15 dollars, which I think gives it a decent cost/content ratio. If you're the sort that prefers action-heavy shooter-type games and the like, you probably won't care for it. But it you're into atmospheric, story-driven 3D platformers, go ahead and give it a try."
3036,"Damn thats a blue ass frog.

13.5/11"
3037,"The game is a work of art of its own world. I got goose bumps when I got through the game. With only 2 hours the game is unfortunately not very long playable, but I liked it very much I want more of it."
3038,"Great and relaxing game.
Fully worth the price.
Stories a bit short but otherwise its fantastic.

8/10 
"
3039,"What I liked about this game:
- very interesting gameplay
- nice landscapes
- great graphics 
- the music is so calming you could fall asleep


What I didn't like:
- the characters are very poor looking

I was honestly okay with the difficulty, even though sometimes I found it kind of frustrating, but it compensates the fact that there is no fighting in this game.  
Would recommend this to someone who likes puzzle games. If you like shooters more, then I don't think you should waste your money unless it's on sale."
3040,The scenery is great & the movement mechanics are amazing!  The creatures look really weird though.
3041,"overall great game, 10/10 in my opinion."
3042,"So this is coming from a guy who is primarily into shooters, flight sims, and the odd strategy or city builder.  This is really fun.  Worth the meager farthing being asked in the steam store.  The physics are good, it's sufficiently difficult to frustrate you, but not crushingly difficult as to make you want to give up.  It really is a fun puzzle platformer."
3043,The best uncle story I've ever heard.
3044,"It's a fun as hell grappling hook game, not enough of those. I wish there was a map editor so people could make their own maps."
3045,A short but enjoyable game. I love it <3
3046,Nice story & gameplay.
3047,"even if its short its realy good
"
3048,I love the story and every aspect of the game. It is wonderful.
3049,"This is such a fun game; if you enjoy platforming in general, this is a fun (and if you challenge the trophies extremely challenging) first person take on it. If you can, give it a go : D"
3050,"Relaxing, yes"
3051,Wow. I suggest you get this game. Great story. Great artwork and feel. and really fun gameplay like yeet.
3052,Good
3053,"Very enjoyable gameplay, and decent story. I only wish there was more."
3054,this is epic
3055,Great game highly recommended!
3056,"I only recommend this game for a specific reason, and that it's a competent jumping puzzle game. Everything it asks to do has been done. The issues however are that it's story is interfering with itself, the mechanics introduced beyond the main skill set are either forgotten, easily ignored, or taken from you. You get rocket boots that allow you to redirect your jump very forcefully. They work, but suddenly the game says they broke until the very end. This also happens when  you're introduced with ice and your grappling is cut down to portal 2 style points of interaction. 

There are so many mechanics you can introduce with just a space bar and directional movement in jumping puzzle games. It seems like the depth it could have had was ignored when they designed the gadgets you actually use in the game. All the rules are there. air gliding, curved jumps, variable jump height, etc. They just take a significant back burner to problem solving when the solution is just jump and grapple. This is easily seen when your companion for half the game asks you to not use your grappling hook to get to the other side of an area. That was by far the only section with any challenge, and it was done by getting rid of a tool. 

Its a fun an interesting game, but as a whole, I don't think that 2.5 hours of game play is worth the asking price. Thankfully it goes on sale for ~80% and the 3 dollars I payed made it worth it. I recommend this because it's cheap and competent. Just don't expect challenge or depth that you could get from jumping puzzles you find in other games like Guild Wars 2 or Team Fortress 2."
3057,"A short platformer, with antiquate graphic nowaday but quite challenging and with a beautiful storyline. Even with a basic graphics, landscapes are really enjoyable to watch.I would surely recomend it."
3058,"grate game, with a good story able to be run on some lower end pc's while being free. it could be a little longer because it's ending is kind of rushed; however, i feel this is because of time constraints or money issues so i can't really fault this on the game. On top of that there is a comunity with mods so that this game can always be intresting."
3059,Jump puzzles aren't clever or exciting in 2019. The story is AYAYA but when we got to 'I bEt YoU cAnT dO tHiS wItHoUt ThE gRaPpLe' I was done.
3060,decent game
3061,I like
3062,Lit
3063,great game
3064,"epic game
very wholesome

9/10

needs more content"
3065,it's alright
3066,Level 1000 Timekiller. Perfect when you're are bored out of your mind.
3067,"A simple and amazing game with easy to use controls which hard to master ,
the game as a whole is short but the intricacy of level design is an experience to be enjoyed
and a challenge to be skillfully beaten, enveloped in a wonderful story



P.S: this is very much a first-person game , dont be an idiot like me and use a controller,
its maddening , i was in the last part of the last level before i realized it .

HAPPY GAMING!!"
3068,Ok game
3069,Synopsis: Uncle Fred is a sadist who loves bottomless pits.
3070,This game is awesome !
3071,"Short and sweet, great gameplay and story."
3072,"Great game with beautiful scenery. The story was short and rather simplistic but had a certain charm to it, similar to a well-written children's story. The gameplay and atmosphere combine to make an extremely unique experience. I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you enjoy first-person platformers"
3073,"One of the most enriching, story driven platforming games I have ever played. I love the satisfying feeling of the smooth gameplay of swinging from one floating stone to the next. The quest of the story was the best part of the game (in my opinion) the characters of the game truly contribute of it's overall satisfaction.This was truly an experience and i highly recommend others to play it."
3074,"I found this game oddly satisfying. It's pretty short, but it contains collectables increasing re-play-ability. There are some challenges as well in game, pushing you to alternate your play-style, so you don't just use of the rocket-shoes and grappling hook glove.
I don't know what I thought of the plot, nor the ending - a bit - disappointing? It's a lonely game - NPCs are close to mute - However visuals and fun game-play make up for odd ending and NPCs. Is it on sale? Get it, play it (in 6h or less). You won't regret it. Not sure if I'd recommend it at full price tho."

3076,"Game is short but the gameplay and unique story are gripping. Despite the mechanics sounding simple, swinging and jumping, every moment felt like a new adventure or puzzle waiting to be revealed. 10/10 it's a great game and the team that made it should be proud."
3077,"Good story line, different game mechanics, could be longer."
3078,It has beautiful graphics and great views.  Gameplay can be a bit difficult at first minutes. The story could be a little longer.
3079,It's decent
3080,Could be longer than that but still very good design.
3081,"This is a beautiful game, full of wonder and adventure. It may  be short, but please, take a look at it. You'll love it, I just know it."
3082,"Words can't describe the experience you have on this game, some frustration but in the end the sense of joy that over comes you is a strange but satisfying."
3083,"This game randomly appeared in my steam library for free, I believe. No idea how I got it, but I am glad I did. I played straight through it in one sitting, and spent less than 2 hours on it. It is a very relaxing game, with an pleasing, albeit simple story. The mechanics are fun and easy to follow, and the grappling hook is extremely entertaining to use. The path is laid out for you clearly, but there are definitely other paths you could take. I felt that I definitely didn't use the mechanics to the full advantage lol. The visuals were stunning, between the massive caverns you explore, to the great open air city. It is a quick, pleasing game with a satisfying ending."
3084,"I really wanted to like this game. I think the developers had good intentions, but I can't recommend it unless you're into masochism. The graphics are decent and the story is simple and easy to follow (if a bit odd...) but the mechanics and gameplay are HORRENDOUS. This harkens back to the dark age of video games where it took you numerous tries (and hours of frustration) to get to the next stage, or to beat that super hard boss, or to get just the right combination of moves at just the right time to get to that insanely-difficult-to-reach item. The grappling effect in this game is really cool in theory, but it doesn't follow basic real-world physics and that makes it really, really, really hard. Especially towards the end of the game. I personally got fed up with it and didn't finish. If you like a challenge (and screaming expletives at your laptop), then go right ahead and buy this game. But if you're looking for something more laid back, then save your sanity and buy something else."
3085,gr8 game
3086,real good

3088,"The game is pretty chill. Relaxing game and the platforming is pretty easy, definitely liked it."
3089,very good
3090,it cool
3091,Short and sweet. A great indie game
3092,"A nice little first-person parkour game. The game is a little janky - the controls were a bit frustrating at first and the writer is evidently not a native English speaker, but overall it was a good experience. Once you get the hang of swinging and flying from place to place, it's a lot of fun. The story was nice, and the length was just right, with more content available if you want to go back and play faster, or find the collectables."
3093,chill game
3094,"A nice short game with satisfying movement mechanics. Art design is neat, especially in the middle of the game. Mesh collisions can be infuriating sometimes though."
3095,"What an experience! Took me 3.2 hours to play, but packed with experience. I would definitely get it right now on a sale!"
3096,Short game but it has fun 3d platforming and heart
3097,"Amazing game, detailed story, fun puzzles, character builds very good.  Wholesome, one of my favorite story games to date."
3098,"Fun mechanics, neat story. A bit short."
3099,"It's pretty cool, Fred is a big nerd though. Tell him to get a better sense of fashion"
3100,"This game is amzing <3
- Beautiful story

- Awesome audio and gameplay 
it's only prob is that it is short but honestly it's a fun game

You are playing as some random nobody dude whos looking for his uncle because uncle is an adventurer and hes been MIA for too long. You sneak in to his old rusty office, yoink that power suit and go do some dope platforming. 

The game starts of bad because you are in dark ass caves, you will find a cool village with people that look like they are from the movie Avatar if it was made on 250 dollar budget. After you say goodbye to the ugly folks you make your way out of the first cave and the adventure can begin. 

Dont expect anything epic, just you and your right hand always stretched in the front."
3102,"it has a really deep story, sadly it doesn't last very long but that's because of how fast paced players play plat formers, I think you should make another game, did real well and it was a great game
"
3103,its the good leafyisHERE gaem!
3104,"If you need to burn several hours while at an airport, this is the game for you. 
The game is short, novel, and unique.
Unfortunately, the title of the game reminds me too much of the story involving my uncle, which is currently sealed in court documents."
3105,"sicc
"
3106,uhhh good game
3107,"A Story About My Uncle is a short game but a great game. If you can get it on a sale for $3 I'd definitely recommend picking it up. Think about it, you can either buy 3 candy bars or buy a rich 2 hour experience."
3108,its fun
3109,"I may have received this game for free (with 9 other games that mostly suck), but if you are looking for a game with a rich story, this one is perfect for you. No joke.

Even though, throughout the main story, you encounter 5-6 characters (which you can interact with), the game is really sad in a way. Imagine losing one of your family members in another dimension you can't go through. (even though at the end you *SPOILER NO NO NO YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING*)

Summary: Great game. 9/10. Add more dialogues."
3110,"Voice Acting isn't that good, Weird cut scene animations, the story is bland.
"
3111,I good story and nice visuals.
3112,"it fun
"
3113,"+ beautiful environment

- boring story
- terrible check-point placement in the last level
- too much trial and error
- very short game
- bad voice acting"
3114,"I had gone into this game with no expectations, got the key from a friend without knowing anything. I had assumed it to be some sort of fairly generic game. Yet, that was not the case. 

This is a very nice game with decent level design. Furthermore, grappling is extremely nice and the overall movement is fairly responsive, although I happen to misjudge distances fairly often. Fortunately, the game is quite generous when it comes to checkpoints. Also, the game is fairly atmospheric.

Overall a recommendation and (currently) 2,49‚Ç¨ is fairly cheap."
3115,Although the game was short for 20 dollars I highly suggest this wonderful game for those seeking a nice story in a breath taking setting with fun moving mechanics.
3116,Well yeah.. I played for 3 hours and finished it. Very good story.
3117,"Good Platforming Game....!!

Some areas are very hard tough...!!"
3118,"It's a first person platformer with a grappling hook with hard to guess distances, especially on small moving platforms and we can never now when it's an interactive surface for the grappling hook or not..."
3119,its pretty good
3120,this game is just breathtaking
3121,"I did receive this product for free and decided to play it since i had nothing going on.
I feel this game is more of about the story than the actual game play. If you really pay attention to all the details from start to finish, you will see why it has such a great story, after all the game is called, A Story About My Uncle."
3122,I love the atmosphere of the game
3123,I  Recommend this game for  how story is told. Ending. the power in hand's of those who created this
3124,gg
3125,gud gayme
3126,This sounds like a porn. XD
3127,"somewhat of a short game but very enjoyable, also plays very well on my much underpowered laptop."
3128,√â MITO RUIM
3129,excellent game to play and relax to
3130,short game with a forgettable story but the movement is a LOT of fun! I basically ignored the story entirely and just had fun doing the parkour. Worth grabbing if its on sale for cheap
3131,"Honestly it's a beautiful game. You can play this in one sitting and just relax or you can complete it in parts. Even when you beat it there are many achievements you can get, so this game seems super re-playable."
3132,"Beautiful story, with interesting gameplay - pretty short, but well, what u expect from fable.
Highly recommended to play :)"
3133,"Good, basically for kids, but it's good to fly around a space for 3 hours"
3134,bacana
3135,"A Story About My Uncle is a puzzle platformer. Most of the gameplay is jumping and pulling yourself through levels with the mouse figuring out where to go. 

The level design is good; there are a lot of details and you can approach the levels in slightly different ways. The game is quite challenging; there aren't any bosses, is all about how you move through the environment and there are sections that will get on your nerves.

The story is sweet, but it could have been better; in the end is not very memorable. There are collectibles that tell part of the story, however you will have to check every corner of the map to find them, there aren't any indicators as to where they are.

Graphically the game looks fine. The environments take the spotlight; with textures, lighting and particle effects that look great. Optimization could have been improved as some effects like flares can dramatically impact your fps when you look at them, but is nothing game breaking.

If you got it for free I recommend you give it a try; if you want to buy it, wait for a discount. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, you can finish it in a couple hours and the experience is enjoyable."
3136,"I dont review games much, but this, I'm a FEW years late, dont judge, but good god the story is amazing, the gameplay is awesome and even frustrating at time, took me about 2hrs to finish and i bloody recommend it to everyone!

Love, me"
3137,nice game
3138,"Pretty cool, well over worth the 5 reais I paid for it"
3139,i have a few stories about my uncle but i can't tell them via videogames. i have to testify in court about them
3140,10/10 makes you feel like Leafy in 2015
3141,Fun
3142,"I've owned this game for several years, and still think about it occasionally. I just finished a playthrough today and felt the need to write a review, as this game is truly a masterpiece. An excellent world design with a pretty enticing story makes this universe one of my favorite relaxing and chill games to play. The game isn't too long but definitely takes a few hours to complete, (my favorite platformer by far). I'd buy it again, and currently the game is on sale for a major deal. GET IT NOW!"
3143,Yes.
3144,its a quick game but its a good story
3145,It is a F A N T A S T I C game I loved it the design the parkours the music the ATMOSPHERE is spectacular.The story is cooler than I thought.Love it good job! I certainly recommend you to buy this game even if it is full price.This game deserves it!
3146,"I liked the parkour and wish there were an endless amount of levels I could traverse and I liked the art direction and level design.

I didn't like when the games pace went to a crawl and I had to watch these terribly designed characters tell a rather uninteresting story.

Good only for the movement and for that I can recommend it."
3147,solid game
3148,"very engaging and fun. feels like spiderman
"
3149,"Love the whole look, feel and sounds of the game"
3150,"Perfect game there is no moment I did not enjoy
"
3151,Best
3152,"Really responsive and satisfying movement system for the platforming that poses a good amount of challenge. Story and voice acting is a little weird, not really its strong suit. Pretty short as well, but fun all the way through! I'd say this is a sale game."
3153,cool story bro
3154,"This game is boring, didn't finish the game.  Spent most of my playtime trying to attach to some floating windmill where I kept repeatedly hitting the light grapple signal dead on and I would just keep falling.  Pure jank.  I ended up quitting at falling ice cubes. What a pointless waste of time

Edit: I've finished the game, because I just couldn't not finish the game (i'm sick).  If I could describe this game in one word, unsatisfying."
3155,"This is an exellent platformer, I would suggest you play it, the game is not easy, but it is not hard either, it is just challenging, and the thrill you get from the time you beat a part you have been stuck on it great"
3156,"Great game to chill and relax to. Lots of great physics jumps and has a charming story.
Definitely worth a play through."
3157,"Very well sorted game, with Mirrors Edge feel as it it platforming, but with grappling. It had a great story and visuals, but is a shorter game as it only took 2-3 hours for me to beat. Definitely has replay ability as I was still getting the hang of the movement, and definitely seems like a fun game to speed run."
3158,10/10
3159,"I personally really enjoyed this game. I do get why people feel that they couldn't explore everything but the art style was pretty good I enjoyed every minute of it, It wasn't that hard but it wasn't really easy either. So overall a good game it took me about 2 and half hours to play it."
3160,good adventurous game
3161,Game is not working with a 8700k and RX 5700 XT
3162,"this game has such good plot and the story is super good, the game mechanics are the best and overall its a one of a kind game. 47/10 would play again..."
3163,"Although I loved the concept of this game, the bad implementation of its chore mechanics leads to really frustrating moments. Lots of unnecessary trial and error that, in the end, don't really feel compelling. I'm sorry to say, but wouldn't recommend it"
3164,"Good graphics and a good story, my only problem that the game ends way too fast"
3165,"A nice game, the plot is super, a lot of different locations, a beautiful game"
3166,good yes. worth my 0 dollars
3167,Very cool
3168,"Amazing game! The game is short (3-4 hours), but the environment is so filled with emotion, every interaction with Maddie feels meaningful, there is a fair dose of challenges and the end is on point. I repeat, amazing game! You won`t regret buying it."
3169,soooo much fun  would play for hours would wish that it was longer
3170,I wish this was the experience I had with my Uncle
3171,its a good game and a good story
3172,"Great, cute and to the point game. :)"
3173,Short. Nice graphics. A little bit short on suprices and an just okish end.
3174,"It felt kind of short, to be fair. I had been in expectation of something bigger, especially with all the writings on the walls, and the whole ""don't move when the eye is open"" thing, but nothing ever showed up, ever again. I feel like the whole thing was a bit rushed, and it could definitely use a remastered edition extending the story. It was indeed just a (single) story about our uncle...

I know I did start by putting out the cons but it was still a good enough experience! It was a unique way to tell a story, for sure."
3175,Completed in 3 Hours only EZ PZ
3176,Very good I recommend!!
3177,short and sweet; cute story.
3178,"Super short game, but honestly amazing! I wish they made more"
3179,REEEEEEEEEE
3180,"I loved this game so much I told all of my friends to buy it! Ok I don't have many friends...still!
The story is really cool with great graphics and musics!
It is a ""new"" kind of game where it's only an adventure moving forward, no battle or puzzle or stuff. Still, you will need to make your way with somekind of jumping device and other gadgets which will make sometimes hard but still ok not to get frustrated!
I completely over recommend this game which gave me such an amazing time!"
3181,good
3182,"Short and sweet, love it!"
3183,litty titty fun fun bum
3184,"If you like speed running games, playing this will make you happy as of all the fast paced areas and amazing graphics just make this speed run feel genuinely amazing, its an amazing game overall"
3185,if your reading this ur gay :)
3186,Wery fun a entartaining
3187,4/10
3188,"Nice game with nice story & gameplay
Grappling around the environment is Really fun & that feels like spider man :D"
3189,good
3190,Awesome !
3191,Un juego de puzzles en primera persona muy divertido.
3192,dis game gud
3193,Good Game
3194,the game had great story and great mechanics
3195,"The atmosphere and level design are excellent, but felt the story was a bit short."
3196,nice game
3197,"Actually didn't expect much from this game, but it has a good story and gameplay.
If you're bored it's a perfect game to relax after some trash teammates in whatever game :)"

[i]Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average.[/i]

A Story About My Uncle is a captivating and engaging experience which only takes a few hours to finish. When the game lets its main character race through the world, bounding across chasms and flinging himself here and there with the grapple, it is a really wonderful experience. Unfortunately, a fare share of the time the game breeds repeated frustration brought on by the difficulty of figuring out where the protagonist should grapple, why he can't, or what to do about it. Besides for the repetitive nature this game sometimes does inhibit, it is a great story and an amazing adventure."
3199,"one of the best indie game i have ever enjoyed in a while, game can be played fast paced or casually, puzzles were sometime hard and require some creative thinking that just a ""one path"", love to see some more of these adventure. character model may be a bit aged considering its 2019, but good work, good story and lovely music. 9/10"
3200,"I applaud the developers for how unique and different this game style is. I hear people complain about the graphics but I really think they suit the style of the game. The story is interesting but also predictable at times. Overall, had a pretty good 3 hours with this game."
3201,"The story isn't much to write about but the level design, sound and game mechanisms make it a very fun - albeit short - game to play."
3202,"I've played this game through, and it is pretty difficult. The story is great and the voice acting is amazing."
3203,"This game is so good. In my opinion, it's better than Portal."
3204,"What a lovely, heartwarming, visually pleasing game! The gameplay is so soothing, but it also gets quite challenging at times, making it impossible to get bored. Everyone should try this game."
3205,‚Äé
3206,the story goes like the aw yeah start the bifta im going to rape ur little sister!
3207,I like the game
3208,very nice game. i just wish it would have an usable speed run mode to grind through
3209,it's a good game.
3210,"[h1]Rating: Good (5.5/10)[/h1]

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
This game was enjoyable, relaxing, yet strange in a way. A puzzle game at its core, the story wasn‚Äôt rich, being a little confusing and lacklustre, and perhaps a bit strange, but as I said, mainly a puzzle game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[h1]Rating: Okay (4/10)[/h1]
As I mentioned in my introduction, the story wasn‚Äôt fantastic, but it was there, and for a  puzzle game it was fine!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[h1]Rating: Great (8/10)[/h1]
The gameplay was great, nice a smooth and relaxing, easy to master. The levels were increasingly more difficult and brought something new with just about every one, which was great to see.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
[h1]Rating: Good (5/10)[/h1]
The graphics in this game were not bad, but not amazing, not a flaw however."
3211,"Short, Clean, Fun. I'd give it 4 stars"
3212,bom de mais
3213,"Very nice story-based game, with an amazing mechanics system! I enjoyed every minute of it. If you're looking for a challenging ""puzzle"" style game, this is definitely one I would recommend. The gameplay is very unique, and you won't regret trying it out. Cheap price, good story, one-off indie game. What's not to love?"
3214,"good game, made me feel hollow inside"
3215,"it's just bizzare and surreal. Like seriously, i never thought i would be so attached to some noticeably old animation style and even though this game is from 2014 it's still an Extraordinary ride.. And the little frog girl maddie, At first i think she would just be annoying but just as soon as she [spoiler]left us[/spoiler] i felt so heavy in my chest and soooooo lonely in the dark cold ice caves."
3216,Hope you like parkour
3217,"KINDA SWAG tbh....
"
3218,Pretty enjoyable game to chill out to in your free time.
3219,‚Äå
3220,This game wass so coolll
3221,"A fantastic little journey, definitely check it out!"
3222,jogo nice
3223,Bem legal at√©!
3224,"I wish this was the experience I had with my Uncle, not wrestling naked"
3225,Is a very fun game loved to play it.
3226,Not Bad
3227,"Work.  Of.  Art.  
This was beyond enjoyable!  The story is fantastic and the gameplay (if a bit infuriatingly hard at times) is super unique and cool!  It's a nice, short, sweet story and overall, a really pretty game for being A) Free and B) developed by a super tiny team!  Definite thumbs up from me!"
3228,"too dull to be entertaining or engaging. also graphics of the characters are terrifying

the whole swingy concept gets old fast"
3229,"Its a cute fun parkour game, it keeps it short and sweet with some fun mechanics and good story."
3230,nice story
3231,really fun short game
3232,"Everything about this game was beautiful and wonderful until you find out that the ""people"" you find are mutated frogs. Then it got really weird. 
Graphics were great though."
3233,I'm terrible at this game but I liked it nonetheless
3234,"Okay, first of all I love this game! I love everything about it. I feel like the art style is perfect for a game like this, I love the narrating. Atmosphere is beautiful and I feel like once you start playing it, it's hard to stop. It's the type of game that you just hop in if you are having a bad day or just want to chill. As of writing this I have played it just a little bit over 1 hour and I'm so happy that I get to experience this. Once you get suit upgrades it's so much fun to explore, you can almost get anywhere. I got lost at one point, when I had taken so many weird routes.  I suggest this for anyone who likes casual gameplay, actually.. I suggest this for everyone. Big thumbs up, worth every cent.
"
3235,Awesomely frustrating.
3236,Great game! ^^
3237,"Awesome.

I really like to play this."
3238,nice game
3239,"Short game, played it when i needed some time to relax. Very enjoyable gameplay, original story. This game deviates from today popular standards but in a good way. It gives me the feeling of old times, when PS1 was popular, where every game was different and was not trying to be that other game, but original one.

Bit pricy at full price for the gameplay, but maybe i just whooshed through it. 

Should you get it?
If you like different gameplay and story, then yes.
If you like long games, then probably no.

Would i replay it?
Probably, but some longer time should pass."
3240,"Short but sweet, made me cry at the ending, the npcs were fucking terrifying tho 0/10 npcs, 10/10 story"
3241,Very nice game...
3242,"Good fun game, I remember it much more and fondly than some games which ive spent 10x as much time on such as borderlands 2. Would recommend. Bit short though, since I finished it within like 2 hours but you can replay, and play around flyin and such so you could definitely do more."
3243,absolute dog shit fucking trash. embarrassing.
3244,its agood game
3245,"I first saw the game back in 2015, but I never gave it a chance, until today! I really enjoyed playing the game. Three awesome hours supported by very nice stories. I definitely recommend this game. This is my first ""walkthrough"" game and I'm very impressed! Thank you for making one of the best games I've ever played."
3246,Great FUN! Wish the game was much longer. I loved it. It was short but sweet.
3247,Great story innit
3248,Very Good game!!
3249,"Such a good game, and story behind, kinda short story, but able to play it all over again"
3250,Good game. Should have written review years ago
3251,"absolutly worth for playing thru within a few hours, neat adventure game"
3252,"A fun parkour game with a touching story, it's pretty short though so I recommend buying it on sale"
3253,I really like this game!
3254,SO basically the game is so chill and emerses you in its expirience. I have enjoyed it for several runs and it was great.
3255,Super great game. Fantastic story line and amazing gaming mechanics! ill probably beat it a couple more times to make sure i dont miss anything
3256,A much more PG story about my uncle compared to my real life story.
3257,"Spider man, spider man, does whatever a spider can!
This is a wonderfully fun little platformer where you find yourself flying through the air at high speeds. Speedrunning it is very fun and not too hard. Looking for little sequence breaks is very fun. It has the best movement of any 3D game I've played. Carefully timing things so that you fly past platforms you're intended to land on and on to the ones after them is such fun to me. I love it!"
3258,"Good game Good storyline.
Short and sweet.
Kudos to developer."
3259,XD
3260,Chill game to spend a few hours on
3261,"Great Story, great gameplay, great game."
3262,One of the best stories i've seen in a game
3263,"very calming, relaxing and satisfying to play"
3264,A nice story
3265,i love this game great story and i want more of it
3266,"It's a really nice game with its own charming athmosphere. Looks quite simple at first, but then there's something that just doesn't let you go."
3267,Decent platformer
3268,Addictivly playable
3269,"a nice story game, definitely worth playing"
3270,"Nice short adventure game. Great story, puzzle/adventure style with platforming.

It's been frustrating at times, but the frustration became rewarding once I managed to get past certain parts of the game.

It's replayable if you're interested in practicing for the achievements, but overall it's difficult to get all achievements. 

Playtime: 6 hours for first playthrough, with all collectibles found"
3271,"Very creative story :)
"
3272,Game with really nice story and at the same time sad.
3273,"A gripping story, great puzzles, smooth gameplay, I can only reccomend this game."
3274,"A really good game, really fun, recommend it"
3275,10/10
3276,very atmospheric game!
3277,"I liked this game. The only bad thing is that it's extremely short. 
I didn't even play 5hours and I finished this game 4 or 5 times. 

I recommend to pick this up if it's on sale. 12,49‚Ç¨ are definitely too much for such a short game."
3278,this game is EPIC
3279,"it's really fun! great controls and an interesting story, it's a short but really sweet experience."
3280,"The gameplay is decent, kinda boring, the graphics are decent, nothing special, but the story is horrible, and there's a lack of content. Not that bad but definitely not worth 12,49$. Only buy it on sale."
3281,It's a really good game and the graphics are really cool if you ask me. It has a great story and I can't think of a single reason to not get the game because it's just awesome
3282,"It's a good story and a good gameplay, but you could do a workshop too for this game: let the players do maps with levels for the other players, so like this we can spend more time on this nice game. I think it's a good idea, so I wait a response from a developer, have a nice day y'all!"
3283,very good game
3284,niiiice
3285,"Tis a good game, now fork that badge, my precioussssss."
3286,"Great game with a short and simple story. The grappling mechanics are fun. Can get a bit annoying if you get stuck at some parts but still the grand landscapes and views calm you down.

The windmill mechanism is a bit glitchy tho

Would recommend."
3287,Finished up the game in roughly 2 hours.  I don't think I'd ever would of tried it out if I didn't get it for free and it's sad to say because it's awesome!!!  Highly recommend if you like platforming since this is that but in first person.  Story is kind ehhh but the gameplay is great!  I recommend to buy when on sale.

3297,"Beautiful art, and a touching story. You can tell alot of love went into this one. Also, holy shit the gameplay was so engrossing I was tensing up in my seat, moving around in my seat to avoid obstacles in the game."
3298,"A good change from my regular FPS, worth playing!
Updating my review because of steam awards nomination 2020!

3299,nc game
3300,"Beautiful, very relaxing too, the music are great. Got it for free from humble bundle"
3301,Feels incomplete. The controls could be better. I had a hard time having my character lock onto rocks between continuous swings. Pretty easy to not know which direction you need to head in and get turned around.
3302,"While the story is just okay, the gameplay is good enough to make it worth it. I would recommend waiting for a sale."

3321,"Epic gamer game, really fun if you just want a nice relaxing game to play while you are bored."
3322,good
3323,"This is a cutesy little indie game about finding your uncle. It's story is eh, I didn't care for the graphics all that much but the physics are so much fun. It will find new and interesting ways to challenge you and is totally worth a buy"
3324,its a pretty good platformer
3325,10/10
3326,God game for me
3327,"Before i played A Story About My Uncle, i had a big boobs, lot's of friends, girlfriends and boyfriends, no depression, and absolutely amazing life. These things haven't changed, so i have no idea if this game is any good."
3328,"Jogo mt legal, com uma narrativa forte e com uma gameplay bacana. A hist√≥ria me cativou mt, n tem mts horas de jogo, mas se vc quiser, vc pode aumentar as hrs de jogo querendo platinar o jogo, recomendo!!!"

3332,Very fun and creative game. Love it would reccomend it to anyone.
3333,muito bom
3334,It becomes a fun little platformer when you turn the voice volume all the way down.
3335,"I really enjoyed the story, art direction, and gameplay mechanics. My only real dislike about the game is the checkpoint locations, as it makes the harder parts of the game very tedious to redo when you inevitably fail."
3336,"A short little 3D platformer; I enjoyed its simple story and sometimes fiendish platforming puzzle. A little challenging, but not too bad (getting the achievements seems like it would be real tough; I didn't try!) and the fast loading times + unlimited ""lives"" means that I never felt more than mildly frustrated with the game. Worth a playthrough!"
3337,Could have gone longer with the puzzles and features it has but great nevertheless. Buy it on sale.
3338,Good game!
3339,"I played this game, and I loved it. The story was amazing, and it made up for the graphics. The gameplay was amazing and very interactive and fun. 10/10"
3340,"Good game for a while, but then it gets really stupid at a certain stage where you have to do stupid difficult jumps with lack of check points to save your progress, also the controls are not that good."
3341,one of my favorite nostalgic games. I really recommend it!
3342,Meh. It's always fun having long jumps and grapples in games. But this game felt more like a [b] find your path in the dark [/b] rather than a [b] parkour [/b].
3343,Loved it
3344,"This game is everything I need for a Sunday evening. It's cozy, calm and mysterious. I wish it never ends."
3345,The way you parkour through the game is just so pleasing. Games like this should be made more.
3346,"its a great game for what its worth , last bit does get abit tricky but can be done."
3347,"This was probably one of my favourite games of all time. Although it was short, it was so good. It's one of those games where when you finish it, you go through a grieving process. Highly Recommended."
3348,lo
3349,"Terrible voice acting, frustrating gameplay, and not enough content."
3350,A good and short story-line adventure with simple gameplay mechanics. Recommended for something different but pleasant!
3351,"I would absolutely recommend this game.

Having never played a platformer before, it started out difficult for me, but I doubt that it would be difficult for people that have played games of this type before.

The environments, the story, the characters--they all meld together to create a cohesive and beautiful experience. If you're looking for a platformer with a nice story and beautiful environments, this is the one for you."
3352,"It's a pretty chill game with a great story. 
10/10 would recommend to give it a go.
Worth for its price"
3353,WELP NOT BAD OVERALL :)
3354,I'll keep this short and sweet in honor of a thoroughly enjoyable short and sweet game. Two thumbs up.
3355,"Although short, this game was very enjoyable for the atmosphere/feeling of exploration. Sometimes you'll need to dive head first to progress, and it's exhilarating."
3356,"This game totally takes you on an adventure, the story is one of a kind. It's short but it's still a fun game. 10/10 would play again."
3357,Great atmosphere
3358,"Very good short game, nice gameplay. I had fun :)"
3359,best game
3360,"Its the best game. Ever and I really dont know why, its just SO GOOD"
3361,literally
3362,Randomly started this game and ended up loving the story it presents along with the different gameplay that it has to offer. Would definitely recommend playing this game at least once.
3363,"This is a sweet, fun little game. I quite enjoyed the concepts, and the mechanics. The narration and storytelling was also quite sweet. Wasn't very long, but it also didn't need to be, in my opinion; it told a lovely bedtime story, took you along for the ride, and closed up succinctly. Great work to all those involved in this project. I quite enjoyed myself :)"
3364,spiderman's adventure in Toad city....
3365,"Your reward for smashing your skull into big floating rocks is recurrently hallucinating your future self talking about your uncle's trip to another dimension to study glowing crystals in order to distract you into continually smashing your head into more floating rocks instead of landing on the next platform safely.

Platforming good, story leaves a lot to be desired, no memorable music.

Would not buy at full price."
3366,"An amazing idea for a game! Although more serious then Goat simulator, the magic is still there, and I absolutely love it! Great graphics, story, and gameplay. 9/10"
3367,is fun
3368,"Man I forgot that I refunded this before writing a review. It's really fun, but really that all comes from the swinging mechanic. It's about as fun as CSGO Surf and Bhop maps, except unlike CSGO, that's all it does. It's fun and easy to master, the campaign is short but it's mostly just an excuse to give the game its v i b e . 
And it really does have a vibe. Maybe not a $17 kinda vibe, but if you were gonna spend that money on a movie ticket, then buy this instead; the replay value may yet surprise you."
3369,AMAZING !!!
3370,Well-made physics game with vibrant environments and a good narrative. Short but thoroughly enjoyable.
3371,It's a short but great time
3372,"Frustrating at times, but it was a good game. Nice run through."
3373,One of my favorite games on steam. smoothest and most satisfying parkour since Hover.
3374,"It's a great fun game, challenging in parts but otherwise a really good balance of gameplay. Recommended! Really good!"
3375,"Well this was a pleasant surprise. I was a little put off to find I was playing a walking sim at first, but once I got through the introduction stage, I was treated to delightful world full of imagination and adventure!

This game sports a cool little story that is told while you jump and fling yourself around each stage. The jumping and such making up most of the puzzles, but they are great fun. Just enough creativity went into the game design to make it a breath of fresh air.

Not much else to say, other than, if you are a Edith Finch fan, you'll enjoy this fun little adventure. Like most games of the same vain, very short, other than that, worth a shot if it's your thing."
3376,"I picked up this game a while back when it was free, I remember seeing people play it in the background of commentary videos but I never knew it would be such a mesmerizing experience when I finally decided to give it a shot. The game was challenging but it felt very rewarding when I got to that checkpoint I had been working to get to for some time. The story is simple yet intriguing, I was so curious to what this place was and how I got there and I was of course, curious to where my uncle had ventured off to. The world is nothing short from beautiful, I loved taking moments to just gaze upon the world around me, it is such a unique atmosphere. The game was very short, a little short of 4 hours for me to complete and I was instantly demanding more.. This game could be so much more but I will have to live with the fact it isn't. The simplicity of A Story About My Uncle left me with endless questions, but overall it has been one of the best experiences I've ever had in a short game. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone."
3377,This game is awesome.
3378,"It has lots of seemingly impossible jumps, but also lots of checkpoints once you make them. I enjoyed getting from place to place and listening to the story bits in between."
3379,Nice Game
3380,great game
3381,Its not challenging enough
3382,Fun and challanging game with a good and touching story.
3383,Pretty dank the salamander girl isnt that thiCC though
3384,gyht
3385,One of the greatest games I've ever played... The only problem is with this game is that in real life I keep pretending to be one of the frog people and putting 2 forks in my pocket and strapping a watch to my wrist... I keep talking in the irish/british accents that they have and I believe I am morphing into one of them after witnessing this greatness... 10/10 would recommend to everyone!
3386,not very long game but worth every penny
3387,The game is fairly short but very fun! The controls on controller and mouse/keyboard work great. The story is simple but wholesome.
3388,A nice platformer that doesn't take long to get through the story for the first time.
3389,nice
3390,The game might be a little short but its one of the best stories ive played trough the last couple of years.
3391,someone is cooking something and it smells real good
3392,"Very fun and relaxing. However, it's a bit too easy and only about three hours long."
3393,This is a great game great story I love everything about this
3394,Meh.
3395,yes
3396,Good game
3397,its fun
3398,This is one beautiful game. An amazing journey and amazing visuals. The movement mechanics in this game are uniquely fun. Highly recommend this game for a soothing gaming session!
3399,nICE game
3400,"This is a very enjoyable game.  It's a bit Portal-like in that the game gives you a superpower (grappling hooks) and lets you explore a space using the power to solve puzzles.  Actually, ""puzzles"" is a bit of an overstatement; everything is about getting from point A to point B using your grappling power (and a few other less important powers).  The artwork is great, the story is very sweet, and I find this game to be that rarest of beast: the ""relaxing"" game.  There is no combat and no death other than you falling to your death a zillion times before you make a tough jump, but you come back immediately.  There is one monster to face, but it isn't that hard to get past.  I have two gripes with this game.  First, the voice acting makes it painfully obvious that the speakers are not native English speakers, which I found distracting.  Second, and much more important, the last set of levels (the ice caves) is REALLY hard.  I haven't been able to get through it without cheating, but maybe one day I will.  But overall, I've had a lot of fun with this game and recommend it to people looking for a fairly relaxing platformer.  8/10"
3401,"I got this game when it was distributed free, if I had paid I would be sad. It starts as a very cute platformer with gradually increasing capabilities and fun platforming with grappling etc. it is like the skyrim blackreach level or some kind of bioshock infinite-type levels. It gets boring and much much harder after some point which as a casual gamer I hated, I play games to have fun not get destroyed (some folks like dark souls like play, I hate hard games, love playing saints row 3 and 4 for example) I used the unlimited grapplehook https://steamcommunity.com/app/278360/discussions/0/613957600547110138/ and very long grapple config https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=1465 to complete.  

The story is quite elegant: SPOILERS AT THE LINK https://steamcommunity.com/app/278360/discussions/0/522729358374450914/"
3402,Exemplaryness
3403,i played this game when it was on Source Forge for free now it's pay'ed i'm glad it move to steam it's a really good game
3404,the puzzles are BEYOND enticing i lOVE this game!!!
3405,game
3406,"Pretty cool, wish for a part 2"
3407,cool game but a bit short i got it for free but would not buy for 15
3408,"Very nice
11/10 uncles given"
3409,Nope. Just acrobatics with a bit of uninteresting story.
3410,"This game is a very frustrating mix of two rather incompatible genres - relaxing first person exploration games carried by a narrative and skill-challenge trial-and-error platforming games designed to make the player rage as they fail over and over again. It starts out as the former and then gradually changes into the latter.

This is already pretty bad, but what makes it atrocious is that the platforming is ***3D platforming***, which is the kind that *everyone* hates. 

While ASAMU tries to make the platforming interesting with some fancy mechanics (a grappling energy beam, powered jumps, a mid-air double jump, etc.), the later levels are clearly designed to make the player fall to their death over and over, with platforms spaced out right at the limits of possible movement and checkpoints spread far apart in order to give the player more opportunities to fail. The result is - raging at 3D platforming.

To top off the mountain of bad game design decisions found here, the game commits the most cardinal sin a trial-and-error platformer can commit - it lets the player wait much too long before letting them try again. Missed that grapple spot again for the tenth time? Yeah, have fun waiting four seconds for the falling-to-death animation to finish before getting reset to the last checkpoint, which was two challenges before the one you are currently stuck at.

At some point in the later game, I had to make the decision if I wanted to hear the end of the titular story (which up to that point had been vague at best) that badly, or if I thought there would be more eye candy (the game is very pretty) worth spending more time falling to my death over and over again. I decided I did not and uninstalled this game unfinished."
3411,Short game but levels are well put together and gameplay is fun and different from most other indie games.
3412,Fun little puzzle platformer with a grappling hook mechanic. A good use of 4 hours.
3413,very nice
3414,"This game is one of my new favorite indie games and I would recommend it to most everyone. It has a soft warm story, great graphics for the unreal engine and will run well on most anything. The total campaign is about 4 hours with secret hunting adding another hour or two overall. The controls are easy to learn, and the tutorial is non-intrusive and lets you enjoy the game from the very beginning. I would love to see this game remade for vr in a more modern engine. If you find it in a steam bundle or on sale, I would highly recommend getting it and playing it"
3415,Short singleplayer
3416,nice story cool graphic design
3417,"like a boss
"
3418,"Interesting concept, but boring story, and incredibly frustrating gameplay."
3419,"SHORT 
JUST SHORT"
3420,Good.
3421,"Amazing game! Graphics isnt the latest but it already looks amazing, tho the story was short but i enjoyed the game"
3422,"great game, could play this game over and over"
3423,YES WERY GOD
3424,A nice game to just play a hour every once in a while. Jumping around and finding your way thorugh the levels is quite fun.
3425,"Downloaded this when it was free. The story itself isn't really interesting, i even kinda lost it. But the gameplay mechanism somehow is addicting. Although, after a few hours, it began to feel repetitive, just like any other game i played.

Graphics are, well i personally don't really care about graphics, since i'm playing with a slim potato.
Overall, it's a nice time killer, if you got nothing to do.

8/10 -Uninstalled :D"
3426,good flights.
3427,"very epic
"
3428,"A fun game. Overall pretty easy, but if you are looking for more of a challenge some of the achievements can be pretty difficult."
3429,"One of the best games I've played so far, thx for making it <3"
3430,Ez game
3431,It keeps you busy!
3432,"6.8/10 Competent 

In a nutshell "" a story about my uncle"" is a first person puzzle platformer. you start out as a kid trying to find his missing uncle. That takes you to an alternate world where you must jump and grapple hook your way to the next stage. The platforming is pretty challenging. there is no margin for error whatsoever. The slightest miss step could lead you plummeting to your death. The level and environments looks amazing and the game has pretty good graphics as well. however the visual is all that is excellent in this game.  The control doesn't feels as tight as i like them to be. since it's a first person game you can't really see under your feet so landing on a very tiny platform is pretty much a guest. that's  a major flaw in the game design in my opinion. My biggest complaint with the game is that it is just too repetitive. all the stages play pretty the same with very little variations. it also doesn't do enough to keep the game interesting long term. overall it's not a bad game. it doesn't do anything really well but it doesn't do anything all that poorly either. I can't recommend this game because it's a game that will appeal to only certain people. it definitely don't have a mass appeal. if your someone who likes these type of games then i think it's definitely worth the $15. i just can't recommend this game to anyone else. 

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME, IT'S JUST AVERAGE I SIMPLY CAN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR THE REASONS ABOVE."
3433,"It's a fun little game. The gameplay mechanic is nothing new--but then, who doesn't like flying through the air, flinging yourself between floating rocks with an electric beam grappling hook? The physics-driven puzzles are solid. And it's just so damn pretty. Unfortunately, the animation/concept on the NPCs makes it feel a bit like a kid's game. Otherwise, the archipelago of worlds in this game is so intriguing and immersive, and the use of scale and light is just breathtaking."
3434,"A very nice game, even though its short is has an interesting concept, a nice story and good playability."
3435,Great game to buy on a sale but too short to justify the 15$ price tag.
3436,slightly cringy story but great gameplay
3437,"Although the price may be high, it is quite a fun game. 4.8 hours on it, finally finished. Quite dramatic ending, just gotta love this game. Although I sometimes wish it had a sequel, its still awesome; gameplay AND story wise."
3438,"Top Games By Far

Everyone who has a pc should play this. It has a great off the hook and weird story and with all the elements to make a wonderful parkour experience. 10/10"
3439,"This game has a really fun design and the controls are just lovely, I really enjoyed this game and I couldn't recommend it enough! I feel as though it deserves some more recognition due to it's wonderful graphics, immersive story, and fun game-play. Although I received this during a free event I would definitely that its worth the price."
3440,"A really nice story driven platformer. 
It's a short game to complete so I would buy it at sale, but definitely worth a play!"
3441,epic
3442,"Cortico pero muy bonito de ver y con buenos mensajes, gg wp"
3443,"I got this game completely for free and it's absolutely worth my time. One of the best games I've played, very good gameplay, pretty good graphics considering the time of the release, and a pretty fun story. I really loved the time i spent with the game. I'm sad that now i will uninstall it, definately it will remain in my heart."
3444,"Actually a great game. Surprised me when i got it from a random steam key but i actually loved this. Great story, Fun Mechanics; Don't be afraid to give it a try."
3445,Great story
3446,This Uncle doesn't touch me while I sleep
3447,"this is a very fun game with a nice story, and best of all you dont need a good computer to play it"
3448,"This game was a lot of fun. the mechanics are great and the story, music and graphics are nice as well. Very immersive and very very fun!"
3449,Great game tbh
3450,One of the best games i played in all of my life.
3451,I got this game for free some months ago. I one day decided to play expecting to hate it but I think it`s fine. I liked the physics and if you have fear of heights while wearing headphones it really has it`s hold your breath moments. No hud also as what you need to know is displayed on the glove. Short game but challenging at times.
3452,WELL GAMERS WHEM YOU GET THIS FREE IT GOOD REALLY REALLY GOOD
3453,"A very good storyline, interesting mechanics and tools, beautifully stunning views"
3454,Frustrating and short. Do not recommend.
3455,"I played this game looking for cheap entertainment. I was very  surprised but how captivating yet simple the story was. I recommend this game if you want a good 3 hrs of a game this is it.

I cant remember if i got this game for free or not."
3456,"A great story in a world you rarely see, even in fantasy settings.

The grapple mechanic is also solid, and failures with it were always the result of a lack of skill."
3457,Very fun
3458,"Fun game with cool story
"
3459,Short game but levels are well put together and gameplay is fun and different from most other indie games
3460,"great game but i wish it was longer, or i wish it at least had an arcade mode or something."
3461,"though the graphic is stunning and beautiful, the character and map models are just terrible. I often got into the bug that my character is unable to move except using skills. these uncomfortable things are just enough for me to have a less exciting experience"
3462,good game thanks your game developer
3463,qwertzuiop
3464,Great graphics and story but its boring
3465,"good game nice story line
"
3466,Great game if you just wanna take your mind off things and relax.
3467,It fun to swing ;)
3468,"Simple yet challenging.
The game mechanics are simple but it is the improvization that is genius.
"
3469,"This game is a bit pricey, this game is short, this game is something else. Holy crap does this game blow you away. Its a short but sweet story, its a painting of pure beauty, its a game like no other. Its amazing."
3470,"i was skeptic about this game, because i got it from random steam key. but i definetly amazed me in a good way. music, story, gameplay realy good. if u are bored or just want to hill, this game worth trying."
3471,Good game. Bit overpriced for how long it lasts though.
3472,"This game is so beautiful!!! I can't believe it! If you have some spare money, then spend it on this."
3473,"ah yes, a game truly perfect for my commentary chanel"
3474,I love this game.
3475,"really loved the game, amazing graphics, really wish it was longer though."
3476,"This game is hands down, one of the best game I've ever played. Amazing story, beautiful level design and incredible platforming mechanics are common place here. and its amazing for when you want to relax. It's genuinely helped with my depression and anxiety. I don't think I could recommend it enough. I really hope they make a sequel one day."
3477,"This is a fun little romp through an imaginative story a father is telling to his daughter. The story is fun because it reminds us of our parents telling us bedtime stories, and it's a really mechanically sound game. Difficulty doesn't spike too fast usually and the challenge is pretty fair because you have infinite lives, and you have checkpoints very often along the path. 
Only issues, voice acting is sub-par. Not super important, but don't expect anything amazing.
Difficulty in the final level spikes fairly high because the path seems near impossible to find in some sections.
Sometimes the physics are a little wonky, and it's hard to grapple sometimes. 

If you want a nice and chill way to spend a few hours (game is not that long at all, probably 3-4 hours if you are playing for the first time) then pick it up. Not bad at all :)."
3478,"Great game 10/10. Relaxing and good story. If you are looking to buy it, it is definitely worth it."
3479,"A very lovely game, 
some challenges are very challenging, but that is what they are.
Finding the collectibles is a bit tedious, but not necessary at all.
Nice voices all around in the English version.
Would buy a part 2 without any hesitation."
3480,got a so many bugs but its not bad for playing fun
3481,i eat bees
3482,Recommended
3483,"I loved this game!! Its so beautiful and pleasant. The achievements are hard to get but not impossible. Soon I will try to get all of the remaining. I was surprised with how good the game is because when I got it, it was for free. Great game!!!"
3484,Fun game!
3485,Great game. Certainly worth a tenner. I would have paid ¬£50 for this
3486,"A beautiful game in every aspect. Atmosphere, visuals, audio and purpose. Yes, of course, the gameplay itself is fluid in a way one would never imagine possible via a first person experience; the swings, the propelled jumps mid-air, the charges and leaps. Everything is contributing to a seamless swinging experience that Spider-Man would be jealous of.




/// POTENTIAL SPOILERS ///









But, in highlighting the above, we would be at fault to gloss over the beautiful narrative. A father telling a bedtime story to his daughter. Even though one could assume that the story is exaggerated, through the perspective of a young protagonist and the way the protagonist himself passes the details on to his offspring, it is wonderfully warm, immersive and downright 'personal' in the absolutely best of ways. With the voices of the father and the daughter mingling with the scenery and the points of focus that trigger conversations in the present in order to explain things you experience in the game or lay out information that serve towards solidifying the world you have found yourself into.

Would gladly erase my memories from this game just to get to play it again. Absolutely fantastic."

3488,Nice old game to play
3489,"Nice first person platformer with a hook line and rocket boots. 
Aprox. 180 minute long.
I give it 420/69."
3490,"This is such a great game with a captivating story line! It was difficult at points but never impossible.  Not a long game play, but I was entirely engaged throughout, and hope to see more like this in the future!"
3491,"nice
"
3492,"It didn't look like a game I'd enjoy, but I did."
3493,"""Uncle Joe.... Do you think we can use like, Vaseline or something this time?""

""I have no problem with that Jeremy, on two conditions. One, I'd better be bone dry by the nights end. and Two, you better acknowledge how lucky you are to have such a hip uncle."""
3494,"Honestly, i found this game started boring, and it didn't become anymore engaging as the challenge level increased. There's really not much sense of progress, as you keep going and following your uncle"
3495,"I had mixed feelings about this game. I didn‚Äôt manage to finish the game which would normally be enough for me to give a game a thumbs down. I got to the last level but then the difficulty curve ramped up too much and the game was no longer fun. I looked up a walkthrough and I was about 5 minutes from the end. Well 5 minutes of a YouTube walkthrough but probably significantly longer and countless rage quits for me. The game limits the number of times you can use the grapple before you have to land which means you have short sections before you get a break to re-evaluate what to do next. That is until the end where you have to recharge the grapple mid-flight so you have no respite and the game becomes downright frustrating. This is especially annoying because the game essentially gives you Spiderman‚Äôs abilities and then curtails them so you never really get the sense of freedom you‚Äôd expect.

So why am I overlooking the frustrations of this game and giving it a thumbs up? Well it is only the very last part of the game where the fun is ruined. The rest of the game is quite satisfying. It is enjoyable exploration of a pretty environment. There is enough of a story to keep you engaged and even the newt girl sidekick is oddly endearing. It is relatively short but I think it is a good length as it would get overly repetitive if it was longer.

Overall I feel there is enough enjoyment to be had here for this to be worth playing especially since I picked this up when it was free."
3496,"This is a wonderful little plat former. There are so many good things to say about the game, but I have to start with the story. The story of the game is rather innocent, and geared towards a younger audience. That being said, it has a beauty that you don't often find. As an adult, I rather enjoyed playing through the game, if for nothing else, for the story. It is like Winnie the Pooh, innocent, nostalgic, and fun. The story is narrated by a father, talking to his daughter, which just adds to the warmth of the piece. In general, the presentation of the story was ingenious, in my humble opinion. The atmosphere and music just add to the story, and to the general feel of this work of art, creating one of the most beautiful tales I have ever known. It is one I would tell my children at night (assuming I had kids). However, that is just a matter of opinion. 

The mechanics of the game are not simple, but not unnecessarily complex either. It is enough to give a challenge so as you are not bored. That being said, the mechanics just flow. Instead of it feeling like multiple actions, as you progress you feel as though you are just taking one continual flowing movement. 

And the platforming aspect is also beautifully done. The environment looks almost completely natural, with multiple paths you can take and several nooks and crannies which aren't important, so as to not feel like it was constructed specifically for the character, adding to the realism. Each map was beautifully crafted, and not a detail was spared.

The only ""complaint"" I have is that it isn't long enough. I played through in one 4 hour sitting. Funnily enough, the game got me so intoxicated I didn't even realize how much time was passing; it really is a beautiful work of art. But I was able to finish it in 4 hours, intentionally not rushing through the content to enjoy it. But I guess such quality must inherently reduce quantity."
3497,Short but great story
3498,A very good game with a good story line. i would recommend it.
3499,"Wonderful game, time flies when you are playing this. It only took me about 2 1/2 hours to complete but it didn't feel too short. It was a great experience and I recommend you to try this game!"
3500,"This is a hard comparison. There is much good about this game but also much bad.
To begin with, let me say that I have not finished it. I am stuck on a section I have attempted about a thousand times over multiple days, but simply cannot get past due to the mobility mechanic of this game being so F****G difficult. 

Seriously. Do not buy this game if you are easily frustrated about puzzles that ONLY require agility and speed. And a lot of it. You will end up giving up.
If you do love struggling because of mechanics and through no fault of your own, buy the game. Its really beautiful and comes with a good story.

I only got this far actually due to bugs in the mechanic - I used some of the walls where you are _definitely_ not meant to stand, as break spots. I don't even mind admitting to this because 
1. this is a clear glitch
2. it was literally the only way I could get past some sections because they are just that hard.

Sadly, there is no way to use these glitches as help in the area I am stuck in because all that is around you is emptiness. /shrug

Because of the lovely story I really wish I had been able to complete this game. I will look it up on walkthroughs, but it's never quite as satisfying as finding it all on your own."
3501,So cool game ü§ù
3502,ez uncle
3503,leafy's dick pics are on the internet lol
3504,Good game. Really like the way movement was made
3505,"Really  nice game really relaxing  game :)
"
3506,"Heck of a job developers; You somehow made a game about flying around using beams of light to be BORING, LACKLUSTRE and above all else HERNIA INDUCING.

The best bit? The opening scene and the final scene. 

Poignancy ruined by ridiculously frustrating gameplay and awful level design. AVOID."
3507,pretty fun game short but not the bad kinda short. its a simple story but charming and the gameplay can be a bit challenging but not too hard. the grapple feels good to use and the rest of the controls are overall tight. the graphics are decent but nothing to write home about altough sometimes you have some pretty impressive visuals. i would rate it 8/10 might be a bit high but the game has so much atmosphere and uniqueness. (if its on sale definitely buy it you wont get dissapointed)
3508,"The best game I ever played after 2 years, Unfortunately the game is really short"
3509,well worth them monis
3510,Nice game! Nice Story! Good gameplay. Nice Texture. Recommend this game.
3511,"its pretty cool, i wouldnt get it for full price though"
3512,9/10 the end of the game was pretty boring but overall a great game and would recommend to everyone
3513,Very short (4h) but at the same time very good and very relaxing. The game is not about puzzles but more about reflex. The world we're exploring is nicely designed although the tribe living there looks quite stupid. A bit like smurfs. Nevertheless the game is worth the time I spent with it.
3514,Pretty nice visual
3515,"Played this together with my 7 year old daughter and we both loved it a lot. She is now playing it again solo. I myself am going to start searching for the next adventure, to have it ready by the time she is done.
This does not mean it's a game only for children, people of all ages can enjoy this game with its nice story and well thought gameplay."
3516,Short. but cool if you're bored.
3517,Short but interesting.
3518,"im a dad of 6. at work they call me the sex lord,so yeah the games okay"
3519,"A short game, but a good game.
The story is heartwarming--exactly my type--so that helps a lot.
It isn't my favorite platforming, but it's still pretty good, and certainly not bad.
Some parts in particular feel like trying over and over until you happen to get it right, especially in the early game, but it certainly does get more predictable and controllable as skill improves.
All in all, a fun little experience.
(3.2 hours for me to beat the game, finding some secrets/collectibles, but mostly ignoring them)"
3520,"Something fancy. I first bought it during the 'Free until January 14th or When *limited* Quantity' Event they had. I was not dissapointed.
The visual detail and everything was immersive, but I wouldn't exactly call it 'Perfect' or 'Stunning' really, but It is simple.
You could run it fine, that's all I have to say about this.
P.S: why is everybody complaining because they didnt get it in time? good god"
3521,"This game is a true masterpiece. The story is told in thirdperson, complimented by fascinating graphics. I dont know why, but the way this story is told feels amazing. I did not know that it was possible to fit such a magnifying story in a game that lasts 2-3h. And when it was over, my heart and brain was aching for more.


[b]Everyone[/b] should play this."

3523,"[h1] Should You Buy A Story About My Uncle? [/h1]
ASAMU is an interesting indie puzzle game brought to you by Gone North (the developers of Goat Simulator). This is a puzzle-platformer in first person mode so running and jumping at the right place and at a right time is a common element. ASAMU is a one big playground with flying rocks and caves. The unique part of this is swinging with the grappling hook that is attached to your gloves, sounds cool right? But it really isn't if you suck at platformers like me. This is not an easy game and you'll often die trying....a LOT. Some of the endgame puzzles are really frustrating and might give you a hard time figuring out what to do next. The story concept is really interesting as it is told as a bedtime story and the more you progress into the game the more the narrator will tell the story to his child. Nevertheless this is a great game for platformer/parkour fans but just not my type. 

[h1] Pros [/h1]
-The developer pitched an original idea instead of copy-pasting other artist's work.
-Challenging gameplay that doesn't hold your hands with stuff like a mini-map/arrows and stuff.
-Graphics are beautiful and look gorgeous at time. Landscapes look breathtaking, scenery is well done.
-The music is really good ...and relaxing! The music combined with beautiful landscape creates an amazing atmosphere. which is kinda rare to see in these kinds of games.
-Well placed checkpoints. 
-Should work on low spec PCs. Well optimized, no technical problems encountered. 

[h1] Cons [/h1]
-Too short for its price tag. Expect a 2 hour gameplay if you don't bother with collectibles and achievements. 
-Boring story, the ending was underwhelming. (sometimes predictable I guess?)
-Horrible character models and animations.
-Bad voice acting and some dialogues laughable (now that's often subjective)
-Unbalanced difficulty especially towards the end. 
-Gets repetitive after playing an hour.

[h1] My Rating: 5/10 [/h1]
I'll be honest, I really didn't like this game. The only reason I've played this is because I got it for free and one of my friends recommended this to me. But a lot of fans of this genre would love this game. If you decide to buy this anytime soon then do yourself a favor and buy this game on a deep sale. This game is absolutely NOT worth $13."
3524,"Cool game, decent graphics, good mechanics and a solid story. Too bad it's so short. Wouldn't mind a sequel."
3525,"Great game , 10/10 recommended , 100% will buy a UHD remake"
3526,looks like spiderman
3527,"I highly recommend with game because of how decent it is, the mechanics are smoth also there is a giant benis monster."
3528,Platform crap
3529,Great game. Made me want to break my keyboard about 40 times (I am bad at games and i kept missing when trying to use my abilities) but a great game.   Nice storyline and completable in less than 4 hours. (which i managed even though i am bad at games) definately recommend if you want something to pass the time.
3530,Best Single-player game i ever played. has a great story and perfect music and this game awesome for making you relax maybe i took this game free but i tell you it worth to Pay
3531,This would be absolutely sick in VR!
3532,"8/10
I enjoy this game for what is is, which is a short, story-driven puzzle game with unique mechanics. This game HEAVILY relies on the use of the grappling hook throughout the game, which can feel very repetitive at times, but works very well. There were times where it didn't work as well as it should have, but was still great for the most part. Everything from the music, to the atmosphere, to the story kept me engaged the entire time. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a short, story-driven game.
"
3533,The story is [i]great[/i] and i would recommend this game to all type of gamers. I haven't played any parkour games for a while and especial this is very fun to play if you are bored to play shooters the whole time like the most gamer do. Buy it when it's for sale. It's nice to have.
3534,"i thought it was a uncle who molested children, i got disappointed."
3535,Looks good so far
3536,"I had so much fun playing this, even though its and old game. would recommend!"
3537,"Well made game.
campaign takes only an hour or even less...
its made like a movie

only con is that you sometimes dont know where to go..

I recommend this game!"
3538,"I like it,"
3539,"If u got nothing to do, put u in seat and be ready to suffer, press two buttons and die instantly =)
Graphics are nice and really pleases the eyes.
Music not bad.
Gameplay - mad
8/10 (for story)."
3540,"This game is simply magical. If you like the Portal games, you will definitely like this game as it is very much in the same sort of style. Your abilities are limited however never seem to become too stale due to the game's relatively short completion time (for me ~3 hours), engrossing story, stunning environments and enchanting music.

The game opens up calm and remains this way throughout, despite the stakes being obviously raised and the environments becoming more foreboding as you progress. This is by design however some players may not appreciate the downtime as much. After hurtling through the air, the challenge is not how difficult the jumps are, but where to go next. The detailed environments looked beautiful however offer little in the way of directing the player, which - especially in the darker segments can possibly make it frustrating to get to the end. Speaking of difficulty, the game is relatively easy - bar a few segments I personally found challenging - which is why there are plenty of achievements to unlock which each provide a good challenge. There are also plenty of hidden secrets which can provide extra dialogue or unlockables.

I remember seeing this as gameplay footage in the background of YouTube commentary videos from 2015/16 and thinking it looked really cool, but never actually playing it. To be honest, I'm glad I played it now (many years later) - I likely wouldn't have appreciated it as much back then. Thank god I finally got around to playing it though..."
3541,"I got this game for free during an event, and it sat in my library for months. I was bored recently and decided to try it, and I was completely blown away. The music, atmosphere, and story are all phenomenal. I found myself completely immersed the whole way through. Aside from that, the gameplay itself is excellent. I've been wanting a good first-person parkour game, but haven't found anything that quite conveys the feeling I was looking for. This game excels at that. Swinging around with your grappling hook feels incredible, and using it in conjunction with the other mechanics can be challenging, which makes it all the better. One of the best aspects of the game is that it would still be amazing without the story. The fact that the story is so immersive just makes it that much better. On top of all that, it has replay value thanks to collectables hidden in each level. The game is short, only lasting about a few hours, but I think that its length suits the simple story that's being told. Overall I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an immersive experience, breathtaking gameplay and visuals, or just a fun diversion."
3542,"I really fell like this game is very good. the story everything is just so perfect. you really can connect to the characters. i was sceptical, but  after playing this game, i can really recommend this game. you are definitely gonna have fun with this game if you love story games. There are extra things you can do when you finish the story. if you still are unsure just pay for it. i am so sure you are not gonna regret it. Also it's just  8.61 euro. one thing i know for sure is that you are going to get frustrated, but pls play it for 3 hours before you judge the game."
3543,"A short, but an amazing, sweet game with a beautiful story and world and fun mechanics."
3544,"Nice game for chill.

Physics and plataform gameplay feels good."
3545,GREAT GAME!!! It is on the shorter side but they nailed it!
3546,Really good game wish there was a workshop with maps for the game as the actual game it self is really short
3547,Only jump and these shits...
3548,This game is fun
3549,Heartbreaking story... Only if others could see why...
3550,"good stuff, challenging but fair gameplay, interesting story, a lot of work and love went into making this a fun and memorable experience that is worth the time and effort. if yo have the money to spare and need a good game to play this is it.

DISCLAIMER: I got this game for free during a sale but would pay for a new copy if i had to."
3551,"Ok game, fun for about 1 hour the rest of it felt like a chore. Puzzles seems identical, the boots mechanic was great, wish I could have used it from the begining. Strongly recommend using mouse & keyboard, aiming is so much better than using a controller. Thought this was a ""couch"" game but the aiming is really frustrating. 
Would recommend it 6/10."
3552,Interesting but short game. It has some really cool gamemechanics and a okay story.
3553,already finished the game. this game touching my heart. deep storyline and challenging in every level.
3554,Best of the best indie-games
3555,A story about my uncle is a story about my uncle who touched me in the basement.
3556,"The grappling mechanics, the story and the visuals are just great. Totally worth the price."
3557,Good game
3558,Pretty nice adventure game with qute grafic. Took 3hours for full playthrough
3559,"Êàë‰ª¨ÈúÄË¶Å‰∏≠ÊñáÔºÅ

3560,"While short this is one if best games i played recently. Game is polished and graphics are simple but artistic and beautiful. Level design is very very good. Story is amazing and i will play this game again. 
Music choice is also very nice and suits game really good. 
Game is well worth the money.
Developers this is how you make interesting game. Bravo."
3561,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game with a very nice gameplay makes you wanna play it more the story is good its all about finding the uncle but there is deep things happened while you are on the adventure to find the uncle. graphics simple that make the game unique from others liked the idea of the game

recommended 10/10"
3562,"Voice acting is pretty poopy, dialogue doesn't feel natural at all, but it gets the points across. story's basic, your adventurer uncle goes missing, you find one of his devices and go to find him with the help of some frog people. character models of laughably bad. Rest of the game is pretty chill tho. 

ONLY reason i'm giving it a negative review is the price. feel more like a 5 dollar game then almost 15."
3563,7/10
3564,This game kept me getting sick with motion sickness :(
3565,"I often measure the succes of platformer games (2D or 3D) by the level of frustration they generate. Three keyboards a broken tooth and a smashed screen later I think this game takes the cake. I never been a fan of platformers but this one, despite being relatively short, was very nice to play. Good setting, simple but effective story and very nice design, artistic and level. My only negative remark is the pisspoor voice acting with exception of Maddie.

If you like platform/physics puzzle you'll enjoy 'About my uncle'. I got this for free somehow and good too, I would have never bought it for personal reasons :) (see above).

I believe this game doesnt has VR support, I played old fashioned, hence the broken screen... I imagine this quite the rollercoaster ride if you play with VR!"
3566,"GAMEPLAY: simple but interesting 
CHARACTERS: could be done much better, drawings and animation are not the top. 
MAIN CHARACTERS: good
Possibly studio had no time or finance.
PLAYED TILL' THE END: 4 hours
THE IDEA: creative 
WORLD AND DETAILS: nice, juicy picture: sometimes to many dark moments 
TOTAL: 8/10
"
3567,"Nice short fps plataformer.  Found some bugs here and there where i got stuck inside rocks and stuff like that but nothing really major. The enviroments are quite cool althought sometimes you feel a bit lost on where to go.
The story even being simple it does it jobs well and its quite enjoyable.

Overall a fantastic expirience."
3568,"yo, this game is literally cancer kys hiss
don't insult chin please.

*Please don't go out of your way to ""review bomb"" any game that I have talked about in these reviews. This review's purpose is to entertain people and not to spread hate to any games. I have no ill will towards any games I make reviews about.*



but actually the game is pretty alright tbh."
3569,"A moderately interesting platformer which is worth it if you get it for a decent price. There are some weird physics at times but it's got some mechanics that are fun to mess around with (and it doesn't overstay its welcome).

The story is disjointed and not particularly interesting. This wouldn't matter if you weren't frequently interrupted and kept from progression so the game can say more words at you; this breaks the flow of the game in a jarring way. It has a similar gameplay/story balance to something like Portal, but it would be very frustrating if you were slowed down and unable to create portals whenever GLaDOS has something to say. I'm fine with being frustrated in a platformer, but only because the game is challenging, not because the gameplay is on hold. This is a relatively minor complaint, but it's enough to deter me from replaying the game for achievements or just to mess about with the mechanics.

fin"
3570,Chill grappling with cool environments and stoner frog aliens. Game is about as long as it takes to read this review.
3571,This game is a fantastic story based game. The controls however are not the best. It feels like a combination of Garry's Mod's Surf game mode but not as fluid or consistent. There are certain sections of the game that don't work like they should when it comes to getting across gaps. What I mean by this is you have to essentially glitch the game in order to make it work properly otherwise you sit doing the same thing over and over. The game itself is good. The controls make it frustrating though.
3572,"I got this game because it was recommended to me by a friend. I dove in skeptical of its merits, since I am Platform-games impaired (and you can tell by the time it took me to finish it). Alas, I did find this to be a rather nice game, well put together, and while you could only interact with only a handful of characters during the exploration period, the ambiance and scenary were just superb to look at. Since I am not a platformer-game kind of guy, I did enjoy it (some parts were insanely frustrating and infurriating, to say the least, forcing you to look around while you were falling to your death, to hopefully figure out the way around the next block).

It is short, and I did like very much the story and the narrative behind it, and the fact you can piece together in much more depth the background story with the pieces of journals left behind, I had a blast. I did not find all of them, but I did my best fo find them and that made the exploration of towns and levels the more enjoying. At parts it clearly takes elements from other great games. I did find references to a few Nintendo classics (especially there is one part that really reminds me of a bit of The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker).

Mechanics are simple and well implemented. You do not need to ""collect 'em all"" extras in order to advance or even be able to finish the game. Makes really good use of the  UE and its amazingly beautiful rendering capabilities (even on an alien platform as Linux).

Personally I do not like games based on checkpoints, but I do get why it is like so in this game, it also adds to the sense of ""achievement"" when you get past that poart that's pestering you (I had at least a couple of them, and then some which were simply annoying). If you are up to for a challange, use a gamepad! I started with the SC and had to finish it with KbM!"
3573,"Fine plot, enjoyable mechanics wrapped up in a good and simple(like this review) game :)"
3574,This is masterpiece. 10/10
3575,"Nothing to say! The story was excellent , the gameplay wasn't repetitive . Every level was unique and fun. 10/10 Awesome Game!"
3576,"Short but sweet. If you like swinging-style 3D platformers, this one is very good."
3577,"I was pretty sure I had already written a review for this game, but I just saw that apparently I haven't. It's been quite a while since I played it but my review was along these lines:

-Story incredibly overrated and just bad.
-Gameplay gets really frustrating.
-From time to time very hard to see were you have to go."
3578,"Beautiful game with a heartwarming story, definitely recommended!"
3579,sounds like a plan
3580,Good scene. Short story but still fun.
3581,Uwu
3582,It's a neat little platformer/adventure game that has a bit of story to it. As someone who typically doesn't play games like this I didn't have high expectations. However the game delivered a fun enough experience. Overall I'd give it a 6/10 only because I'm not the biggest fan of games like this. I'm sure if you are then you'd enjoy it more than I did.
3583,"What starts as a simple grappling hook game quickly gets complex, with a lot of different mechanics and a very high difficulty. I still haven't completed the game (I'm stuck in the ice cave section) and I don't expect to finish anytime soon.

9/10, decent story with great narration"
3584,"Pretty cool game, never finished it but it's pretty cool with all the blue people and stuff"
3585,Really beautiful
3586,"epic game, sad ending"
3587,Fun chill game with an alright interesting story. A little difficult but not too bad.
3588,10/10
3589,This game is very cool.
3590,My head is reeeally  dizzy....     Too dark to tell which direction is which.   Other than that it is a good game for leisure time.
3591,"for about 2 hours of game play its not that bad graphics are epic and the story line is also epic, thanks for the good experience."
3592,"Just hate this game, the controls are not proper and repeatedly performing the same things makes it boring. Also, it gets too hard as you progress, which is not good for a casual gamer.
Wasted my money and time on this."
3593,"|| A Story About My Uncle ||
Pretty basic story line, clean graphics, beautiful environment. No enemies or fighting, you just clear all the obstacles and reach the destination. At moments there would be a few crazy, frustrating movements you need to do at precise time, otherwise this game is very much fun to play.
I got it from some kind of bundle, but I would recommend people to buy it during sales, if possible. I noticed I had this game in my library, and I am glad I installed and played it..."
3594,"Holy man dammn man like damnitty mannity oopity bopitty. It's actually good liek damn, short game but still its good as man"
3595,"I finished the game, but didn't receive any achievements :(
It's a nice and cool story, like a fairy tale.
Not bad for a free game.
Sometimes annoying when I fail at parkouring, but good gameplay overall.

[u] Gameplay [/u]
A Story About My Uncle is a non-combat, narrative-leaning. It tells a whimsical tale about a boy, his nomad and currently missing uncle, a fantasy realm, and jumping. Lots and lots of jumping!

[u] Review [/u]
A very short but good indie game, the platforming is very well designed which was the reason why I brought this game. The narrating is above par and isn't designed to be played for it's story, It has a few challenges along the way but most of them are easy to overcome. I wouldn't buy this game full price since it's a short game but it's definitely worth a play at a discount.

3600,7/10
3601,For a game made in 2014 it's just great.
3602,A Story About My Uncle is an incredibly immersive story-telling linear rpg. The painted world maps which you are going through are mesmerizing. I give this game an A+.
3603,fun
3604,"Got this on a Humble Bundle, and what a great surprise. 
This game is not about graphics or story, but flawless gameplay flow. It is a first person platformer, if that genre exist, in which you enter pretty fast in ""the zone"" where the controls just work, and you are almost not thinking at all, flying around.
Gotta finish it, but so far so good."
3605,"A beautiful game, though it is short it tells an amazing story."
3606,"Nice environments, fun to swing around in for awhile."
3607,8/10
3608,So I would like to recommend this game if you like a 3d like puzzle exerience with some basic backstory while not being too difficult
3609,I enjoyed this game so much!
3610,"Relaxing atmosphere in the game, good music in the background and a memorable story."
3611,"This game is simply amazing. The platforming is almost perfect and it's by far the best 3D platformer I've played. I feel like the length of the game is pretty on point, if it was any longer it would've gotten boring. I love how you can clearly see the place where you want to go, you just have to find a way to get there, and there are MANY ways to get from point A to Point B. In some areas, it became first-person Spider-Man and I'm completely okay with that. Overall solid experience. 9/10"
3612,"This game is pretty fun. The levels are challenging and innovative which I like, and the world that the story is set in is cool too. I can't say too much about the game though, it's a pretty good grab for it's prize, even though i got it on a sale. If you are the type to enjoy story games that are under 25 hours, this will be nice for you. For me, the game was mediocre, however I enjoyed it."
3613,"I really enjoyed this game. 

- The story was very simple, but charming. 
- The visuals were stunning at times. 
- The mechanics and gameplay are simply outstanding.

This game was short, but it is one that I still think about every now and then. For anyone who wants a fun story and environment to get lost in for a while, or for fans of parkour games, I strongly recommend A Story About My Uncle."
3614,"Nice and beautiful parkour game. Got it for free and did a quick gameplay. Histoy is, well kind of emotional, journey to find the uncle and then once found leave him behind... It reminds me to the five phases of grief. First denial and isolation your uncle is lost and that can't, be so you go to find it jumping arround a lonely cave. At the end of the cave you found people and then starts the dark chasm, the anger. You manage to get out of there and then find a place where even still with the lost of your uncle is not that bad, and something in you wants find a way to remain there, Bargain. But you still looking for your uncle so you go to a cold cave eand everything starts to fall arround you, Depression... At last you fing your uncle and you have to accept that you must leave him behind, Acceptance, and then the life goes on.

Sometimes it's hard to find a way and there are like two or three points where the dificculty spikes. The game is short but I think I wouldn't have enjoyed twenty hours of jumping arround ... 4h/5h it's ok.

Also for all that like the speedruns this game has a lot of replayability but that's just not my thing.

PS Edited: After writing this I've digging arround if someone had the same feeling about the game and, not only there are others, even someone found the text ""acceptance"" along the way. Then I remembered to have found some hidden runes in the chasm. With the help of my buddy I translated some of them tho fin it reads AN_E_ ... It seems that I found the ""Anger"" one, just I didn't realize it. So it is not like a five phases thing ... it IS a five phases thing ... So sorry for the spoiler :("
3615,lol dis id so bludy col
3616,"Such a wonderful short parkour game. The atmosphere, graphics, characters, sound design... everything is beautiful and cute. Game does give you new abilities constantly and thus the gameplay does not feel too repetitive. I did feel like it was getting repetitive but then the game ended so I think the length of the game is spot on."
3617,This game is by far the best i have ever played. The story line is fantastic and the game itself is a lot of fun. This game is well worth the amount it costs and i would recommend this game to anyone.
3618,"Difficult, but totally worth it for the story."
3619,"Great platformer game that's only a couple hours long.

The $13 price tag seems worth it to me if you are looking for a good story and a fun game. if you want a game that keeps you occupied for hours with a rich and engaging story this game will leave you wanting, and some of the voice acting was rough but if you just play it for what it is its pretty fun."
3620,"Nice graphic, design, music, and beautiful story"
3621,Took me 4 hours to complete. not worth 10 quid for 4 hours
3622,"This brings back PTSD from when I was seven and my uncle **************

Bought It to be like Leafy is Here from 2016 so it was worth it! 100/10"
3623,"You basically swing through cool looking environments with grappling hook thing and try to find your uncle.   Very simple game few parts were kinda hard.    Gameplay mechanics works good and story, voice acting etc.. are nonexistent. Overall relaxing game ,but few parts drived me mad.

7/10"
3624,Such a beautiful game.
3625,"A simple and pleasant platformer with neat level design and nifty game mechanics to create a non-violent FPS (grappling hook, different jumping styles and the use of gravity). The overall experience and difficulty is just fine: use a controller if your want more challenge (the hardest puzzles are just all right with a mouse). The main qualities are the atmosphere, lean gameplay and a bittersweet storytelling."
3626,"Amazing game in general, but even better when you're coming down from an acid trip."
3627,this game is not about my uncle
3628,it's a very short game but with a lot of replayability. It's a story driven movement game and i really enjoyed it although should you buy it ? Idk i got it for free. If you can get it on sale then yes you should definitely buy it
3629,"One of the best story games.
Recommend++"
3630,i dont like this game my uncle touched me when i was 8
3631,Do not waist money on this garbage game. Its 2 hours short and its just boring. Would rather go for Until Dawn or Man of Medan than this because of how boring it is. You want a story ? Buy one of those games. You want platforming ? Well this has it and its boring after the first 5 minutes. I got this when it was free for a while. Stay far far away.
3632,"wouldn't pay more then 5$/‚Ç¨ for it.
very short, exhausting characters you can't skip.
Gameplay is ok"
3633,"The game is fun, after you get used to the weird controls in the first level. Wish there was a way to skip the dialogues.

Also, the final level is the worst level design I've ever seen. I almost didn't want to recommend this game based on that, but the overall experience is so nice that I can ignore that final level frustrations."
3634,Fun adventure platformer
3635,Very good game empire. Yes.
3636,"Really good game, superb story line, really relaxing and a good ending to tie it all up.
The game itself takes about 2 hours to complete but i'd say that's a good length in this case.

Stunning scenery, smooth gameplay, puzzle game in a nut shell. I definately recommend the game and give it a 10 out of 10."
3637,this game is so good.... very short. but the story is amazing... voice acting is where its at. 10/10
3638,Fun whimsical game with easy to learn mechanics. Thoroughly enjoyed the story :).
3639,"a great game with a interesting story which will draw you in, has great visuals and a interesting but predictable plot. there are optional challenges and many things to interact with which makes this game have a very high replayability. gameplay mechanics are finely tuned and are great with more elements being introduced at a steady pace throughout the game.I believe that this game is worth every penny although i seem to have finished the game in just over 2 hours. this game is a work of art and a challenge in itself, a game that has personality.

i believe the only downside is the robotic animations of the frog people but you barley interact with them making it not a problem."
3640,"It is insulting how short the game is. First let me tell you that it really is fun to leap through air and the parkouring through these worldvisions are amazing, it's mezmerising how interesting the world looks and oh my, those landscapes are really something. BUT i finished this game in 1 and a half hour and it never really was that challenging, it all just felt like the tutorial and that the real experience would come soon but then the game ends suddenly and your reaction is going to be ""really? now already?"" and that just killed it for me. Also the graphics are to be honest really bad. Apart from the Skyrocks & Skycity arc nothing looked vivid or detailed. Also those ""cutscenes"" with the people look abysmal."
3641,dabest
3642,this was a really good game it was too short tho i played it in 3.5h but im not sure if it goes on from there it just said theend
3643,"Very good indie game, not the longest but the puzzles and story made it a very pleasent journey"
3644,Good looking and sometimes cute game. But I hate games that make me do things that demand good coordination. It's tedious and not fun.
3645,"Great gameplay
Cool enviroments"
3646,Interesting story and gameplay
3647,Uninteresting story and bad voice acting but still a very fun game and definitely worth playing
3648,"Great Game, got stuck at some points as i didnt realise where to go but other than that, brilliant game"
3649,"Okay gameplay, quality storyline over all good time killer"
3650,"It looks very nice on the first glance and the story seems to be like a beautiful fairy tale.

Unfortunately the whole experience is completely and utterly annoying because of the nighmarish bullshit controls together with the jump sequences. Especially these triple jumps are so tight. Sometimes it takes 30 to 50 tries to get these jumps right, and when you finally make it, it was pure luck or conincidence. The physics of these energy strings is super random. You have no way to tell how far the string can reach and the force they apply on you is totally unpredictable.
What comes on top, is the very short play time, that is massively stretched by these stupid jump sequences. It's safe to say that I probably spent 1.5 h with the actual game and roughly the same amount of time getting these shitty jumps right. And the achievements are a fricking joke. They actually expect you to pass these sequences without a single mistake? With such whacky controls and physics? No thanks.

Really, avoid this shit. It will just frustrate you."
3651,This game is dicky picky mad milk.
3652,Nice platformer game with a good story and mechanics. Could have used more freedom of movement and let the player choose how they want to get from A to B. Good choice if you want relaxing casual game.
3653,"This game was just beautiful.

The narrative was great, despite some iffy voice acting and the way they opted to deliver it was a bit off. I really liked how the narrator was telling a story to his little girl, it was touching and a great way to tell the story as you play the game so there's no interruptions to game play. However, it‚Äôs kind of off with the writing as there were moments the narrator mentioned things as though as if they were happening in the present as opposed to the past and this was a little bit jarring. It can sort of be ignored but it‚Äôs noticeable when they say something like ‚Äúthe suit was too heavy for me to swim in‚Äù to his daughter (which was a good way to answer the ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I just swim?‚Äù question) but then proceeds to say ‚ÄúI better be careful‚Äù. It can pull you out of it for a moment. Fortunately, the narrative only had very minor issues which doesn't trivialise it in anyway.

The gameplay is amazing. It's a lot of fun, challenging but not too difficult. Everything was doable with minimal frustration. The collectables actually unlocked things like being able to change your beams colour or a goat mode, although I really didn‚Äôt bother much with hunting them down. They were reasonably challenging to find; they do make a noise when you‚Äôre close to them so it‚Äôs good indicator when 1‚Äôs nearby. The controls were responsive and you really felt the weight & momentum of your movements, especially when using the power jumps or grappling hook to launch yourself through the environment. It was simple enough that almost anyone can get the hang of it. Figuring out how to manage your grappling hook charges was a nice touch & added to a bit of the challenge, especially when there were crystals you could use to charge your suit as you‚Äôre in mid-air. It was a pretty exhilarating experience.

Visually it was super gorgeous. It didn't have the graphics that most titles would have had in 2014. The way all the colours came together created really vibrant & appealing environments that more than made up for this. I found myself stopping & taking in the sights or exploring some of the areas despite knowing they wouldn‚Äôt really lead anywhere. The fluorescent lights that lit up the caverns were really breath taking. There was some good visual feedback as well, primarily when grappling onto something, it indicated if it worked or not. The environments had reasonably placed indications of where you could go, what you could grapple & so on. All of this conveniently suited the narrative & environments.

I grabbed this on sale for about $4US at the time and at <3hrs I‚Äôm definitely satisfied. The game is short and usually when a game is short, I generally don‚Äôt mind if I paid a small amount for it. But this game being short is ironically 1 of its shortcomings because you really want it to last, it‚Äôs just that good.

I‚Äôm really glad to have played this game. I remember getting to the first area outside the caverns and thinking to myself ‚Äúwow I‚Äôve really played some gorgeous games in my time.‚Äù I also liked the little Easter eggs it put in; the YouTube links to these random videos. It‚Äôs fun, touching, exhilarating, frustrating and satisfying. When you reach the end of the game, you‚Äôll really wish there was a lot more of it left. Hopefully someday we‚Äôll get a sequel/prequel or a spiritual successor because there‚Äôs undoubtedly some good talent at Gone North Studios."
3654,"the game end really quick i end it with 3 or 5 hours  , there is no thing else to do if u end the story and the story ended really quick"
3655,too short really good game play
3656,"Nice platformer
- repeatability
- time trial
- speed runs

Interesting position for gusy who like platformers"
3657,really lovely story based game. Really enjoyed it! :)
3658,"Fake, uncle didn't come to my bed at night in this story."
3659,"I recommend the game for the unique gameplay and the fun I had. The story, however, was boring at best, I disliked it. The only character you go through the story with was very annoying and didn't serve any purpose. Still, the crystal slingshot was a very cool tool to use to travel through the mines and beyond, making the game worth the time."
3660,Okay
3661,nice
3662,Not my type
3663,"Love this game! :)
"
3664,"Great game, enjoyed it."
3665,"This game is absolutley stunning, the art style is beautiful and the story is mysterious nut understandable. I have much love for this game and have played through it numerous times. It's worth the $$ and has a whole lot of replay value"
3666,brudas good game
3667,This game me a bit of a headache while seeing simple but beautiful graphics. Story wise it's short but it was magical.
3668,"fun game to just chill out, but limited gameplay for the price"
3669,Spider man
3670,"While I was really drawn to the game's core mechanic of the grappling hook, the big main issue I had with it was that it felt very 'limiting': 
- most of the levels just consist of rocks that float in the air with shining beacons that predetermine the path you take.

To break it up more:
- Never felt like I could truly explore or improvise the mechanics in a fun way to get to the other side.
- And nor did it compensate for that lack of freedom with at least some sort of puzzles to get me thinking about using the mechanics in a specific way - just repetitive platforming.

There's some other little niggles I have with the game such as:
- First-person and platforming can always a bit hap hazard - constantly miss judging distances (especially between very small floating rocks).
- Hook-able surfaces and non-hook-able surfaces blend into each so you end up constantly mixing up the wrong surface. However this is solved by always looking for the shining beacons but goes back to limiting the player."
3671,Uninteresting and boring.
3672,Beautiful and fun game.
3673,"A Story About My Uncle is a platformer style game that had a promising introduction, but I was dissapointed with the repetitive gameplay and rather lackluster story. However I had received the game for free so I would not suggest anyone spend their money on this game unless they are extremely patient and have a lot of time to kill."
3674,<3
3675,"It's obvious it's made by a small (foreign) team. The animations are a bit robotic, the writing and voice acting aren't exactly fluid, and the platforming isn't anything groundbreaking. That being said, I can't say I had a bad time. It wasn't great, it was good. I'd like to see this studio evolve and be able to apply more polish, their creative direction is nice."
3676,"One of the best indie games I've ever played. 

The gameplay is unique and yet tons of fun. The story is engaging and well written. The ending has to be interpreted for a full comprehension of what you've been doing the entire time.
Overall, 10/10 gaming experience."
3677,"A beautiful and short game, the only thing i can reproach it is that the animations about the frog people were too robotic..."
3678,"I wouldn't recommend buying it for the full price, but if you can grab it for some bucks, do it! Wonderful game, really nice gameplay, and it might happen, that you look at the clock and 3 hours have passed."
3679,"I believe that it is a small story for a 13‚Ç¨ game however, its a very heartwarming story and the gameplay is really smooth which makes it just better. Have fun playing this game on your own."
3680,"It has a very interesting story and some sweet mechanics. Although it was short, it still was a great game!"
3681,This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. Took me 7 hrs to finish the game for the first time! Did you do better than me?
3682,An endearing story about your uncle
3683,you're basically a monkey swinging around for 90% of the game and instead of your dad missing it's your uncle
3684,"This is a game that is highly unique. I thought that the world art style was lackluster at times (3rd level mainly) and beautiful in others (4th and 5th levels), I thought that the character design was mostly lacking, I thought the music was nice and atmospheric, and I found the gameplay to be very fun. The voice acting is not very good and the story, while heartwarming, fails in the writing department. However, I really enjoyed this game, mainly because of the time I played it. It's extremely memorable and this is one of those games where I will forever remember my journey through it and how I felt. This game is definitely something worth looking into.

(Got this for free because of humble bundle limited time giveaway)"
3685,"Some of the best movement in a game I've seen in a long time making for some incredibly fun gameplay, but kind of a lackluster story."
3686,its ok
3687,good game
3688,Its good.
3689,"Swing around in colourful caves, while having the story narrated like you're telling the story to your daughter. 
Story is ok at best, but the scenery is great. 
Gameplay is very challenging, especially when using a controller because you swing around with a grappling gun, which needs to be pretty precise at times. There's a couple of unnecessary difficult parts which can get frustrating. 

Achievements are only unlocked by time trials and other trials which means going back to the levels again and again."
3690,Short but sweet game with an amazing story and really good graphics.
3691,eh
3692,Good
3693,"Fun game, great gameplay and narrative, voice acting can be a lot better and AI is really bad, but funny sometimes. Took me a little over 3 hours to beat and it was a great experience. Buy it on sale. Its fun, but not worth the full price. Overall a good experience

[b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] sebuah game bertema adventure yang MEMUKAU mata soal pewarnaan worldnya, mengambil kesan yang Futuristik dan Sci-Fi yang sangat mantab. game ini  saya download sekitar 1GB. gak banyak mengambil tempat untuk memorynya dan dengan RAM 2GB sudah cukup diopsi LOW dengan ketajaman gambar yang cukup baik gak jelek-jelek amatlah. dengan cerita seorang anak yang mencari keberadaan si pamanya yang hilang/bertamasya ke alam lain dengan mengunakan baju khusus yang dirancang untuk bisa LONCAT dengan ketinggian lebih dari rata-rata dan juga mampu mengeluarkan jetrocket di kaki sangat menarik untuk dimainkan.

[b]Musik[/b] : sangat sangat MEMUKAU, musik yang dapat kita dengar disini benar-benar mewakili genre SPACE-AMBIENT. tidak terlalu menggebu-gebu karena ini soloplayer game. kadang ketika bermain dalam game hanya ada suara derap langkah dan ambient atmosfer game ini sendiri dan itu sudah cukup bikin kita seolah kita yang masuk kedalam permainan. narasi yang diceritakan udah CINEMATIC banget. benar-benar luar biasa narasi ceritanya usahakan jangan di skip ketika narasi sedang berlangsung udah mirip banget sama MOVIE gitu [b](9.2/10)[/b]

[b]Control[/b] : penggunaan AWSD biasa dan sangat simple juga dengan kliky mouse yang sangat simple very easy [b](10/10)[/b].

[b]Harga[/b] : dengan Rp 109 999 rupiah kita bisa merasakan, memainkan, melihat, mendengarkan 1 paket keistimewaan yang hakiki luar biasa menawan dari sebuah game adventure, ini game memang beda dari game adventure dunia yang semacam RPG gitulah. [i]SAYA DAPAT INI GAME GRATIS BWAHAHAHAHA[/i][b](8/10)[/b]

3695,"A princ√≠pio o jogo, parece demasiado simpl√≥rio, tanto pelos gr√°ficos (nada impressionantes), como pelo gameplay e pela trama. No entanto, com mais alguns minutos de jogo, A Story About My Uncle se revela um jogo extremamente divertido (apesar de realmente simples).
A hist√≥ria, assim como seus gr√°ficos, de fato, n√£o tem nada demais. Isso, contudo, n√£o afeta em nada o desempenho do game, muito menos a divers√£o que ele proporciona. Al√©m disso, unidas a um enredo cativante e uma dublagem muito bem-feita, seu estilo visual cria um clima amig√°vel e aconchegante, cumprindo o objetivo dos desenvolvedores com perfei√ß√£o (visto que toda a trama se passa numa hist√≥ria de ninar para uma crian√ßa).
Em resumo: Se voc√™ est√° em busca de um jogo divertido, cativante e muito fofo, A Story About My Uncle √© a pedida certa para voc√™ e lhe garanto que valer√° cada centavo!"
3696,+
3697,It was pretty fun!  Took 3 hours to finish.  An cute story and rather anti-climatic ending.  The gameplay felt maybe a little lacking.  Mostly just platforming.  Get from point A to point B...repeat...but it puts in enough new abilities and obstacles along the way that it isn't too boring.  There are moments where I felt super sly slipping through portions like they're no big deal!  And though they were probably only dumb luck I'm gonna play it off like I'm just that good!  Short. Linear. Simple. Interesting!  Fun!  Has heart!
3698,"Great game for a relaxing evening.

Fun mechanics, i mean who doesn't love a super suit with a grappling hook? 
Atmospheric game, beatiful world and very heartwarming story.

Even though it is very relaxing it has time trials for completed stages, a couple secret areas and unlockables and some challening achievements.

Definitely a great pickup!
"
3699,This is nothing like my uncle...
3700,"A real heartwarming story, great game mechanics and ideas. Really enjoyed playing."
3701,"sweet story, playable in one evening. wouldve been a good game, if it werent for the last chapter. lvl design is pretty bad there and it gets frustrating a lot."
3702,meh....
3703,"Pretty fun game overall, had no issue with the mechanics and thoroughly enjoyed myself the whole time. Although, I do think it is a bit overpriced at $13 because the story is rather short in my opinion. But if you can get it on sale I would definitely recommend it as a title to buy. In total I'd give it a 4/5 just because of the price for the story length"
3704,"At the beginning, it's good enough. Okay, the frame rate is terrible, but I stopped noticing after a little while, you really get used to it.

The problem is that, when you reach the section with the second village and the windmills, the gameplay becomes immensely frustrating. You have to time the jumps by freaking inches. It sucks all the fun out of the game.

When you reach the ice caves, fo a while, it gets good again. But it doesn't last, because after a while it again turns incredibly frustrating.

Overall, while most sections of the game are good, the ones that are bad are SO bad that they make the whole thing just not worth it."
3705,the art in this game is amazing beside the story
3706,Carcinogenic game. Don't try to buy and play.
3707,Short and sweet!
3708,An amazing game
3709,"Great platforming game. Especially when you need to take a break from games like Counter strike, R6 etc."
3710,"+ Really enjoyable, good looking, got into it very easily, control quite easy both with keyboard or controller.

- Short, sometimes next to the end got quite confused where to go, expected a bit more for the end. 

7/10"
3711,"I like the gameplay but sometime when you want swing but can attach to freaking stone even already same distance (Based on RNG). I'm still stuck at chapter 3 I guess in cave that Uncle Madlene  told. 

What I see:

1. Main thing you need is Grappling every time.
2. About 2 - 3 times only story in one chapters.
3. Being talked bodysuit can't enter water or fall but yet can walk in lake?
4. You need to jump every time you lost like when chapter 2 (Medline village) or entire chapter. Also for search freaking stone that you need to swing.

I'm not recommend this game even got free, and look at price with this experience, I'm not buy this but the gameplay still good too."
3712,good game
3713,It's a short game but it was one of the best game i have ever played! 10/10 would try again
3714,"Really cool gameplay, fun and entertaining."
3715,<3
3716,"Great game, great story, great platformer, 9/10."
3717,If you have a evening of free time it's a fun way to waste a few hours. I'm glad I played it and took my time looking around but in the end of it all it's an hour and a half long game if you rush I took my time and got it in 3 so keep that in mind.
3718,Great story. Wonderful voice acting.
3719,A nice short game in terms of gameplay and mechanics but the NPCs and voice acting is pretty bad. The story is also quite predictable and short but if its on a good sale or free i would recommend a playthough
3720,"Amazzzinnng visuals, and the story isn't half bad either, it made me smile a lot. The gameplay isn't hard to comprehend but the different ""levels"" are challenging enough to keep me interested, even got stuck a few times. The optional time trials are a nice touch as well, even though I haven't tried them myself, and the ""unlockables"" were a cool perk as well. The game can be a little glitchy in some spots: I found myself literally getting stuck on some rocks for exploring too much maybe, and also while flying thru the caves I managed to clip thru some of the walls/ceilings which was interesting to say the least. But overall I really recommend this game to anyone who wants a little challenge and great atmosphere."
3721,"Very nice calm game. The story is well-designed, if a bit simple. The platforming gameplay is very nice, and is hardly ever truly frustrating."
3722,hell yea
3723,good shit
3724,fun to play when ur bored
3725,"This game was pretty neat. A pretty to look at platformer with an interesting gimmick, easy to use controls, and a simple story tying it all together.

The strongest point of the game on the surface in my opinion is the short but sweet experience, it's long enough to keep you entertained for a couple hours, but not too long that the gameplay gets stale or boring. Though some might argue the game's length is too short to make it worth the money, I personally think the length is right where it needs to be for the type of game that it is.

Where the game falls short is the achievements / challenges (or time trials) that the game presents the player. All of them involve just playing through the levels again under certain conditions: without failing once, using less than a certain number of grapples, or the self explanatory time trials. While these achievements do present some challenge to the otherwise non-challenging main game, they can be tedious and sometimes outright annoying to obtain. For example the ice cave, the game's longest and most challenging level taking about 20 minutes or more to finish without speedrunning, can be frustrating to complete flawlessly with several sections or jumps that are difficult to nail. It starts to feel pretty monotonous after failing half or over halfway through and having to replay the entire level over again, and then having to play through it at least 2 more times to complete the other challenges. In short, going for 100% completion isn't the funnest thing in the world. The game's collectibles are pretty uninteresting as well, the game attempts to reward you for obtaining them all in the form of unlockables which alter your grapple device or add effects to your HUD, however to me these unlockables came off as obnoxious and unsatisfying to use. 

One thing this game really has going for it is its story. While it is simple, and the voice acting does seem kind of half-rate and lazy and lifeless at times, the story is unique with an interesting perspective and plot beats that carry actual emotion, though at times the emotion is brought down by the sloppy voice acting. The game also benefits from a very touching ending, particularly in its epilogue, and no matter how frustrated I got having to play ice cave over and over, I found myself feeling genuine enjoyment getting to see the ending one more time.

A Story About My Uncle is short, simple, and fun at surface level. I can see anyone having a good time playing through this game from beginning to end and leaving it at that, however going for full completion feels like a chore and causes the levels to get very boring very fast. There were little bugs that I noticed (there were a few times I got stuck in certain platforms, but it was hardly enough to hinder the experience for me), but the game for the most part felt pretty good to control, and the story and ending specifically had me feeling good every time the credits finished rolling.

5/10, get it on sale maybe"
3726,"To be honest I didn't expect anything from this game, I got it from some bundle and I found the name to be funny so I decided to play it. But I didn't expect to find this, the game has a beautiful art style with a short heart warming story, it's not difficult, it's just a nice little relax game. 

PS: I'd love to see part 2 somehow continuing the story"
3727,Good platforming game. Real short tho. So maybe wait for a sale. Got it in the Humble Bundle for real cheap so i'm not disapointed
3728,.
3729,"This game is considerably good for how short and simple it is.  I liked how the story is told as you go through it yourself.  It gave it a different feel, and brought back some nostalgia of my grandfather telling me stories when I was little. And that could possibly be why I enjoyed it so much.  The grappling mechanics are smooth, and easy to get used to.  And although this game might not be very challenging, or have much interaction with the world around you, it really shines in the visuals.  There is 3 unique worlds that are all, in my opinion, absolutely beautiful.  The story is decent, not great, and there's not much character development. But it's still fairly captivating.  All in all, it's definitely worth it for the price."
3730,"i thought this was just some game made by some chinese bootleg company, but i was suprised when i played it. the game has an actual story (sort of) not just some flash games with shitty graphics.

10/10"
3731,I bought this game cuz it was on a Leafy vid. I regret my purchase this game is boring af.
3732,"Nice game, played it with my friend and decided to buy it, 100% satisfied."
3733,"I don't care about yourt bullshit art story! 
Let me swing god dammit, stop interrupting me every 5 seconds to talk about this dumb kid and her stupid uncle!"
3734,"nice GOULART, o jogo √© realmente bom"
3735,"A Story About My Uncle is a short(ish) first-person/single player parkour game 

Rate: 9/10

Pros: 
- Appropriate for all ages
- Graphics are unique to the game itself, not exactly show-stopping, but pretty decent all around. 
- Story line is also unique, but captivating. 
- A game that's hard to get bored of.
- Unlockables are pretty fun and cute. 
- The controls were very simple and easy to play with
- Parkour is challenging at times, so it's never too easy
- Voice acting is good, and the audio is crisp and clear
- Can 100% grapple onto anything in this game

Cons: 
- I feel as if the game is a bit overpriced considering the play time.
- Occasionally, you're moving at such high speeds the unlockables are hard to get.
- Tends to get extremely dark with no apparent fix. 



Expected playing time: 2.5-4 hours (4 hours is kind of stretching it)
Graphics: 8/10
Story: 9/10
Worth the price?: On sale, yes
Bugs?: No (not that I experienced)
Bonuses?: Cool unlockables

Overall, this game was good and sweet. The story-line is extremely cute and the concept of the game is pretty cool. I've seen some complaints about the controls, but I found that they were very smooth for me. The regular price for the game is about $13, but I got it on sale for like $4 or $5, which I think is more worth the price considering the length of the game. The scenery is pretty nice, and the parkour in the game is pretty interesting as well. If you find this game on sale and have a few hours to spare, give it a shot."
3736,"Basically, a game that fell short for me because of a couple of design decisions. Definitely not a full price purchase - I'd pick this up on sale.

I have two major gripes with the game.

First is that the unlockables were always hidden from sight. While this criticism sounds dumb, trust me that the game feels best when you are soaring through areas at high speed due to how great the air momentum is. Having to stop constantly and wonder if an unlockable is somewhere nearby actively works against the game's high speed potential. I ended up not caring about unlockables because it felt like crap to constantly slow down and look for them.

I think unlockables would have benefited from being visible off-path and been designed as challenging to reach instead of challenging to find. A platformer like Celeste nailed this style of unlockable with its Strawberries.

It's also really frustrating to go back and find unlockables because there is no tracking from level select. I don't care to do my own tracking so I just closed the game after finishing it (less than 3 hours of gameplay - I spent a long time trying to get an achievement). Again, Celeste is a great example of tracking unlockables so that I'm motivated to find all of them.

I also dislike the inconsistency in jumping mechanics. In every situation you have high air control *except* during a running power jump. This was especially noticeable trying to get the achievement ""Maddie's Challenge"" which relies on jumping only. While it sounds like a minor issue it caused a lot of deaths for me and ended up discouraging me from ever using the move, which really put a damper on the game.

Both of those issues would have to be fixed for me to really like the game. Shame because everything else it's got is great."
3737,"A neat platforming game with beautiful graphics and stunning views with a okay story, overall I recommend it."
3738,"Nice game. 9/10 leafy leaves that [strike]are[/strike] were here.

vvv part contains story spoiler! vvv
[spoiler]Didn't get to see Maddie again and fuck her til I could call her Mad Maddie. sh- she- shes 18, right?[/spoiler]"
3739,"Very poor game, thought its going to be a story based game, like you walk around explore, get clues and find your uncle. But its rage inducing since its mostly not a story but a jumping simulator. Could get past 1 obstacle, and it was in the village biome, basically 2/6 parts of the whole game. And because of that i couldn't continue the story. Why was that shit implemented. A story means a story not a jumping around caves simulator. Overall i did not like it and not recommend it"

3741,Good adventure game but it can piss you off...
3742,"Nice arcade game with a little short but a really interesing story. I could say awesome if we pay attention to the fact that this game was made by a couple of people. I havent paid for this game. It was free then i got it, so being said if any of the authors will read it. Thanks guys. You did a great job."
3743,"Gorgeous game, highly recommend if you like platformers and engaging stories."
3744,"Dialogue is pretty bad, feels like it was written by a four year old who  copied a bunch of clich√©d movie lines. Gameplay can be fun, but doesn‚Äôt feel as fleshed out as it could, mostly consists of two modes, grapple to a bunch of points in a row, or grapple to a spinning platform and wait to grapple to another spinning platform. 

Everything in this game ranges from just ""ok"" to ""pretty bad."" I can see some potential in the ideas here, but it never really reaches anything worth talking about."
3745,its really fun
3746,Not bad....
3747,"a very nice game, been a while in played a good game with good story.."
3748,moo
3749,A Short and Sweet Platformer would recommend if its on sale.
3750,"very nice gameplay, 10/10 5/10 for the story , the ending was fkd up !"
3751,"A neat little game. Story isn't anything special and is even a bit disappointing, but the first person platforming with its grapple mechanics definitely make this game worth your time. Get it on sale though, as it took me only about 3 hours to complete."
3752,"I've played the whole game and it was great! The story was intriguing and the levels were fun and interesting. The difficulty was pretty easy but the fast pace made it a lot more exciting. I

If your looking for a quick relaxing story game, this one is perfect!"
3753,"A pretty decent first person platformer with some focus on lore/story. The whole grappling hook gameplay was somewhat fun for a while, but after a while I just wanted just see the end of the little story there is and get it over with. I'd rate this neutral if I could. Short fun for a few hours, probably worth it when on sale."
3754,I've played through this game 3 times and its suck a nice relaxing experience with beautiful graphics and lovely story
3755,"Really cool game, it can be done on one evening. I have great fun with this game :)"
3756,it alright
3757,"Having just finished this game, I can only say it's very not worth buying. It's short, graphics are bad, story is generic (just because it's a sad story it doesn't get an automatic pass as a good story), pathing is horrible towards the end - it's hard to know where to go or where you can grapple in the last levels.

As a free game, it's barely worth playing if you're really into platforming and you don't have anything else to play. If despite all this you want to give it a try, don't consider doing so for more than 2 euros/dollars or equivalent in your country - otherwise you're getting ripped off. Now consider that at the time of this review the game is going for 13 euros/dollars... yeah."
3758,nice
3759,"Whoever says the game is short is good at this game. Some levels are so difficult, they're taking me hours. It's still fun, that's why I keep on trying to finish it. Worth it for the butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling alone."
3760,It's very good game. I recommend
3761,"A short but very nice game, controls are a bit weird, but that's really the only downside, it's fun, the story is nice, and I enjoyed every second. $13 is a little too much for how short the game is, I got it when it was free."
3762,"- Tremendous Graphics -

3763,It's a fine game.
3764,A story driven challenging platformer? yes
3765,11/10
3766,Amazing but way way too short. I would love to see a level editor or modding support
3767,"Not much to this game - a fairly fun 3D platform relying on grappling hook physics.   Would make a solid speed-running game, but there's not much depth to it beyond that."
3768,"I picked up this game when it was offered for free on Steam, and it's certainly a fun game, but I wouldn't spend much money on it.

This game lacks the polish present in a lot of AAA games, such as collision detection and decent character models. The game will only take you about 3 hours to beat, so pick it up on sale if you want it. 

The core gameplay is pretty solid and exhilarating, although you might want to use a mouse and keyboard instead of controller, as turning the camera and finding what you need to latch onto will be a lot easier. 

8/10"
3769,good game if you like uncles
3770,"This game is alright.  Its a chilled but challenging game.  The story is short, but its still worth every penny.  Theirs a few things to unlock and time trial mode as well if you want to speed run, but that's mostly it.

Strangely enough as I type this, I found this game to be therapeutic in some way, because I was going through a depressed state, and for some reason I feel a bit better now. (at least for now that is.)

But anyways this game deserves the money its earned and encourage anyone to check it out.

Hope this review helps."
3771,"I held the mouse button a quarter second too long, so I'm writing this review while I wait to slowly fall to my death.

Grab your adventure suit and gain super jumping powers! Jump, grapple, float through the air for a bit, repeat, repeat, repeat.... There's no hook. Just a linear path of obstacles to wander across. Even the narrator sounds like he'd rather be doing something else. And so would I."
3772,i don't even remeber buying this game but i have it so i guess thats worth a positive review
3773,It wasn't that kind of story
3774,"A story about my uncle is a game I knew nothing about. To be honest I thought it was a game similar to to the moon as in an RPG maker game. I got this as part of a bundle so had no idea what I was playing. What this ended up being was a puzzle platforming story driven game with some nice art direction, good performance and some interesting platforming mechanics. I can say that this game is pretty decent a cut above most indie titles at its price point with a game play length that I'd say is right on the mark for what it set out to do. I can say the mechanics were both cool and annoying. Never once did I feel in full control of my movement even when fully upgraded. When you do the platforming smoothly you feel awesome but when there is a tough segment or the jumping is not very forgiving you feel annoyed. Sometimes I could grapple things at a far distance. Other times I had a hard time grappling something right in front of my face. Its things like that that hold it back from being an outstanding game. Personally I enjoyed it even though it frustrated me a fair amount in some spots. If you can get this game on sale I'd pick it up It's a good game to play in an afternoon. 7/10"
3775,"This is not the type of game that I usually like and only decided to give it a shot since I got it for free.

The story's premise is simple, a boy is searching for his uncle and has to traverse a foreign cave filled with floating rocks. The execution was very well done and I was really wondering what would happen next.

The game itself is quite short; but will feel a bit longer since you will die, a lot. I had a hard time grasping distances, which had me falling to my death uncountble times. In additon, I often found myself getting lost and confused. The usual remedy that seemed to work most of the time was to make a blind jump and hope that I was going in the right direction.

Despite somewhat struggeling with basic platforming, cheap deaths, and my negative prejudice against the genre, I still could not put the game down. It felt like I almost made it, almost reached the next checkpoint. Then I finally reached it, triggering a shower of unrational pride. 

Would recommend anyone to pick it up in the next steam sale."
3776,"A very good puzzle platformer based around a ""gravity glove"". The gimmick keeps getting expanded with new moves all throughout the game so it never gets old. The story is simple but interesting. My only complaint is that the ice level is a bit over the top in terms of complexity and with little to no direction as to where to go.

8/10"
3777,"Not sure what game all the reviewers raving about ""tight controls"" and ""smooth gameplay"" were playing. The controls are clumsy and often respond poorly. Levels are repetitive. The writing is strange/bad and not particularly compelling."
3778,"This was overall a pleasureable experience on the 1st run through, (Which is all i'm going to do) The characters are insanely cookie cutter but are done well enough considering how little you see the majority of them, There is a few absolutely gorgeous scenes and enviorments despite the dated texures,The platforming is very Sand-boxy but feels un-utalized as it could of been considering the options given to you, Being a charged jump, 3 grapples and a rocket boost, Not a whole lot of momentum possible so I didn't feel like much of a badass but it was satisfying enough.

In conclusion: The story is servicable and made me feel something which is better then most but will not suprise you, There are some really nice moments when the games at it's best and slow or empty at it's worst, But the games short enough that its definetly a good idea on a sale but it coulda used more cinematic scenes considering it's setting and more suspensful moments, Also shoulda used the giant fkn monster that I was hoping to be grappling on is some kinda cool climactic setting. Overall 5/10, A good enough game but, nothing to memerable."
3779,"The game story is good, I liked that and some of the characters are really well written.

For most of what I could play it's an enjoyable game, but I got really dizzy from the camera settings on this game, and no matter which one I choose it gave me some problems."
3780,meh
3781,"Not the game i expected from the title, but its my go to baked game, played through it more then once and will always recommend this fantastic game"
3782,"I could say I enjoyed this game, but the uncle waiting at the end was way too uglier than I imagined. I was extremely disappointed at that point."
3783,"Decent gameplay that's all about platforming and momentum, though it's a pretty short experience. I managed to complete the main story in just 2 hours. Also, the beautiful environment art is oddly contrasted with awful character models. Is it worth full price? Definitely not, but it is a nice bonus to get from a bundle or on sale for a few dollars."
3784,"The game is visually pleasing and the main element, platforming, is fun and relaxing. The story itself is simple: A man tells a story to his daughter about his adventure finding his disappeared uncle. I kind of expected a longer game and and a more nuanced plot, and I definitely wanted to explore more of the game's beautiful world. I expected more drama among the game's characters and after finishing the game, I found it odd that I was being introduced to the game's characters without being able to really interact with them, or see them interact with the world more. One moment I am with a character and I feel like they're going to be involved with the story with me, and suddenly: ""Poof! Sorry, gotta go!""

It kind of felt like the game ended right in the middle of the moment that I thought it would truly begin, both in terms of the story and gameplay. I expected something grander but I guess a bedtime story told to a child wouldn't necessarily need to be anything too complicated.  I did enjoy the game, but expected it to be longer and more fleshed out. I was left wanting more!

TL;DR: It's a great, laidback 3D platformer, although it ends way too quickly. I wouldn't say that the current default price of 12,99‚Ç¨ is worth the investment. Buy it for 5‚Ç¨ or less on sale, and complete it in a single evening with a cup of your preferred hot beverage."

Very good indie game overall. [h1]7/10[/h1]"
3790,This game feels like a gameplay demo that never actually turns into a game.
3791,this gamed doesn't work on mac I haven't been able to play it at all
3792,Well just ask Vincent how it all happened.
3793,"Pretty fun game overall, had no issue with the mechanics and thoroughly enjoyed myself the whole time. Although, I do think it is a bit overpriced at $13 because the story is rather short in my opinion. But if you can get it on sale I would definitely recommend it as a title to buy. In total I'd give it a  4/5 just because of the price for the story length"
3794,"I dont know how i got this game for free,but free games are always great!I like the game,its a good story,its not confusing at the start and generaly good."
3795,A nice little adventure story about a boy trying to find his uncle.
3796,"A story about my uncle is a game where you play as a father telling his daughter a bed time story. and like the title suggests. its about his uncle. you are gifted a suit that lets you run very fast. jump high. leap. fly. and grapple. you use this suit to traverse the map. Its basically a first person platformer with a wholesome story. I got it on sale for cheap and it lasted a little under 2 hours.

I highly suggest giving it a try. its visuals are also stunning in some places.

8/10"
3797,"Fun little parkour game, with lots of freedom and ways to climb/dash/fly
The worldbuilding is also pretty nice, lots of lights and colors.
Ended up being a bit short for me, the story is sweet but ends a bit abruptly.
There is no boss encounter except if you count the ""dice room"" (you'll see)"
3798,"This game is not about the story, but the reflexes, hand-eye control, timing and strategy."
3799,good
3800,my uncle have never done that.
3801,"Short, buggy, boring, overpriced.

Also, you want achievements? Fuck you, unskippable dialogue and slow walking every time you restart the level."
3802,"It was an odd story to say the least.
Uncle was a very strange one"
3803,he was killed in a drone strike along with uncle fungus
3804,Nice concept.
3805,"Thank god that i get it free, otherwise i would swear to myself. Story sucks, mechanics not pleasent. Wanna play a parkour game? Check the other ones. Wanna hear a story? Go to the nearest bar. That would be much better."
3806,A short but nice game
3807,"The graphics are stunning and the platform jumping with swing style jumps are cool and feels fresh. They are kinda hard to control sometimes and the difficulty is usually simple but sometimes it swings up to extreme, mostly due to weirdly placed platforms and some places in the ice cave. Sometimes you don't know where you are supposed to go at all.
The story is very bare-boned, you are looking for your uncle and there's some extra spots to get small backstory snippets but that's it.
I've seen people complaining about the voice acting, I didn't find them too bad, although Maddie was a very annoying character. Sometimes the cutscenes are a bit malplaced, like a character starts talking about something before it's physically possible to see it.

Sadly I felt quite bored playing this, a walking simulator with some simple platforming and a vague story in the background. It's kinda short too."
3808,"Too quick if a game, but a fun game to play."
3809,"Honestly, its short."
3810,love this gameeee <3
3811,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is a game that allows the player a fantastic world with beautiful views. The control for the keyboard is simple and in my opinion you don't need a controller. Who is looking for a game with a great story is right here, but you should be aware that it is a relatively small game."
3812,"A Story About My Uncle is a likable game. There are some aspects of this game that I liked and some I didn't like about the game.

I'll start off listing the positives: 
+ Well optimized and clean moving mechanics which is so important in a platformer like this.
+ The game looks great and each stage has its own unique atmosphere. 
+ Soundtrack matched with the gameplay perfectly. 
+ Grappler was predictable and accurate which made the game more about skill instead of luck. 
+ Can be a relaxing or serious game depending on play style. 


Here are some negatives that come to mind:
- Story was average, there was so much room left for more content. 
- Game wasn't challenging as long as you aren't going for achievements. 
- SHORT STORY


This game was very fun from start to finish but it was so short! They could've added so many other game mechanics to continue the story and kept it interesting. Some said achievements extend the gameplay for this game but achievements aren't equal to more content! I feel like this game fell short in that aspect which left me disappointed. I would recommend to buy this game when its on sale. 

Overall this is a average game and I do recommend it to most.

My Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüåüüåü 3.5 / 5"
3813,"The game is very short, but the replay value is always there. It's always fun to go back and attempt to speed through the game as quick as I can. The game doesn't have the best voice acting or story, but that isn't really the primary focus. The game does have very entertaining movement mechanics, and awesome level designs. It would be cool to have the ability to develop custom levels, but I don't see that ever being implemented. Especially not this late in its life. But still, I enjoy playing what is there when I want something chill to do."
3814,I can't say anything bad really. It was a free game...It's like whatever.
3815,"Amazing game, i managed to get it for free a while back (although i'm gonna buy it as a gift for my nephews), but only started to play it recently (also just finished it).
The world setting is amazing 10/10, characters are good 8/10, gameplay is fun 9/10, and the music is 11/10.
The ending was a bit lackluster but good nonetheless .
Thanks for making a great game, fully recommend if you wanna relax and play something."
3816,Great game
3817,"Short but very good. Both story and gameplay wise.

The grabbling hock mechanic is most of the time reliable and works like you expected. However, in some situations you can shoot over the target when landing with high velocity, when the landing angle is to narrow. When the angle is high enough, you simply stop (that's the problem here).

The difficulty is fair. Some sections require good timing, however everything is doable."
3818,"8.5/10
great game, sadly no online save data
the mechanics is good, story is well done
anyway got for free so don't listen me"
3819,"Fun game, few annoying bugs late game, overall 7/10"
3820,"great game, fun to play while killing time."
3821,"Great game, the mechanics are solid, the voice acting is great and the story is also a nice thing to have as well. The only negatives I have about this game is the poor NPC animations and texturing.

Overall definitely worth playing."
3822,"This is one of the best story games I have ever played, and also one of the earliest. No other story game I've played so far has come close to this one. This story stole my heart, and I must admit, I cried multiple times. I think that this game is well worth the current price, and I advise you to buy it. If you are worried about bugs, don't worry, in the multiple times I have played through this entire game, I have found none."
3823,A very beautiful game with cute story and relaxing gameplay
3824,"This game is AWESOME! Loved every single second of it. Gameplay was both challenging and fun at the same time. The story is sick, and I'd love a part 2. Pretty sad that it ended so quickly :("
3825,<3
3826,DLC please? :D
3827,"Oh, this is a different story ab... never mind."
3828,"3 hours of gameplay. The game is really good but the fact is that I did finish the game in 3 hours... (scenario only , didn't rush the completitions) which is really low, I would have prefered a long story but still , it""s a good game which spending time on is worth but 13$ is too much for it."
3829,Very good game with a pleasant story and average difficulty. Good potential for speedrunning.

3833,Nice adventure game
3834,More like a story about me failing a single level like 30 times.
3835,"sometimes it was so hard, it made me angry.
But is was a very nice, but short game."
3836,great game quick and good story
3837,"A Story About My Uncle is a short but fantastical adventure, a first-person platformer; a science fiction story about grappling your way through caverns and floating islands. It sort of reminds me of a modern Jules Verne novel, a journey into a strange land, driven by curious gadgets (a grappling suit, and rocket boots). I went in knowing nothing about the story, and found it touching but slight. I wish the adventure were longer, but I loved whats there."
3838,"I had this game in my library for awhile and it took me some time to even consider playing it. I thought this game was just going to be a mediocre platforming game with nothing special, despite the reviews given for it. However, I was rather surprised that the game had more than what I expected. There were some flaws to the game, but I was still impressed with the game overall and I wanted to share my thoughts.

Pros:
- Impressive Graphics
Like I said before, I wasn't expecting much when I downloaded the game and I had that mindset when I started the game. This quickly changed when I noticed how stunning the environment was. From the first level, I was shocked to see how detailed the floating rocks were and how the environment in the background felt natural. It got even better when I progressed through the game, when the levels became bigger and the environment shifted from dark, eerie cave to traveling through the sky. It was breathtaking overall and it felt like I was the one actually flinging myself through the air and doing these amazing and dangerous parkour moves.

- Supportive Soundtrack
Another thing I noticed right away was the soundtrack for the game. It felt like the soundtrack fitted each level perfectly and it made the overall experience better. I even took my time when I progressed through each level to just listen to the soundtrack and marvel the environment around me. The point where I thought the soundtrack and visuals blew me away was when I entered the level called ""Sky Haven"". It was beyond my expectation and I was taken aback on how beautifully designed the level was. The track that was playing in this level gave me a sense of wonder, curiosity, and a feeling that I was a tiny speck in an expansive universe. This soundtrack was spectacular and it gave the overall environment of the game a huge boost.

- Demanding Level
As I was playing through the game, I really enjoyed how the levels felt and were built. They progressively got much harder throughout the game, but the pacing of the difficulty felt just right. Which is great for new players because they don't quit right away. Each level was challenging, but not too difficult for someone to complete. Not only that, I loved the way the levels were designed and how they worked. Each level requires different techniques to complete it and it gave each level a unique image, or made them feel unique. It does require quick and precise movements to latch onto obstacles and some planning when you are progressing through the level. To me, it felt just right with the amount of difficulty presented in each level.

- Smooth and Simple Gameplay
It wasn't too hard to learn all the mechanics of the game, which is a relief when playing platforming games. Most of the mechanics in the game requires you to jump, leap, and latch onto obstacles, most of the time. There are just a few unique mechanics you encounter or get in the game that changes the gameplay a bit, but it not too much. It should also be noted that the controls are relatively smooth and quick to react, which is essential in games like these.

Cons:
- Mediocre Story (Possible Spoilers)
Now, the only reason why I put the story in the con section is that there is obviously no middle ground to put this in and I wasn't exactly blown away with it. The story can be subjective to others, but here is what I thought. The main premise of the story is - SPOILER ALERT - to find the uncle. Well, it may not be that big of a spoiler, but that's pretty much the entire story in my opinion. Sure, there were some twists in the story where in may enhance the story a bit, but I still found the story to be rather dull. If there was something I had to complain about, - SPOILER ALERT - it would be the time when MC find his uncle. I felt like this encounter with the uncle was a bit too quick or rushed. Other than that, it was just a decent story.

- Decent Animation
The animation of most of the characters and npcs in the game felt like they were more like toys than actual living beings. Sometimes when the npcs are turning their heads or moving their arms, it looks so stiff and robotic that is makes me believed that the creators didn't put much effort in the animation. However, there were some part of the story where the animation was more than decent. The supporting character had better animation in a couple of cutscenes and there was a unique obstacle in the third level that had a surprising amount of animation to it. Maybe the developers didn't have enough budget or something, but in the end I thought the animation was lacking a bit.

My Verdict: 8/10

There were a couple of things wrong with the game and a few decent problems that I noticed, but I was still impressed with the game overall. Coming in with the mindset I had before, there were a lot of good qualities this game presented to me that made me change my mind. It was a short and pleasant platforming game that I will remember down the road. Maybe not for the story as much, but for the atmosphere it had. The level design, the graphics and the soundtrack was the most memorable part of the game for me, especially the ""Sky Haven"" level or whatever it was called. That level was gorgeous and I enjoyed every second of that level. Overall, this was a well-done game created by Gone North Games and I would like to see another game similar to this in the future."
3839,"Honestly one of the best games ive played ever. The story is great and even tho it isnt that long, it is always fun to go through the map and perhaps go for a new pr
"
3840,"Just an Awesome game, the story is short but still 10/10. if you want to complete the story it'll take like 2hrs-3hrs, but if you want to take time and complete all achievements it'll take another 3hrs-5hrs."
3841,"my favourite indie game
good story
fun to play
"
3842,"I shall review this game, but first I am going to put up the Urban Dictionary definition of the word ""twee"". As I am going to be using that word often, and it will help explain the loathing and vitriol I have for those things described by me as ""twee"" 

Twee:
""Something that is sweet, almost to the point of being SICKENINGLY so. As a DEROGATORY DESCRIPTIVE, it means something that is affectedly DAINTY or quaint, or is way too sentimental. 

In American English it often refers to a type of simple sweet pop music, but in British English it is used much more widely for things that are NAUSEATINGLY CUTE""

My definition of what ""twee"" means = kiddy-ish / bland / toothless / banal / poncy / nauseatingly cute (hello from the UK, where we speak British English) / all of the previous

With that said: here's the review.......

Dunno if this ripped off 'Valley', or vice versa, but if you're familiar with that game and thought to yourself ""hmm! I'd like exactly the same mechanics, but with really twee music, a twee setting, and duller game play"", then rejoice! For, lo...this is the game you seek!

But for me, despite the two games being quite similar, I couldn't stomach more than an hour of this before turning it off. And I doubt I'll give it any more mind, as it was getting a bit boring. The actual game play is passable stuff, it's just that this is very twee in its presentation and not very involving for me.

If you're unfamiliar with 'Valley', and want to know what the skinny is with this: You have a suit that gives you super jumps, and has a grappling hook that can latch onto certain objects. It's a first person platformer of sorts, that ought to have the thrill of jumping great heights like a bionic flea, and the adrenaline rush of zipping around with the grappling hook. But, uh, well...it doesn't have that excitement.

Admittedly that might be because I only played it for an hour, and the challenge hadn't yet ramped up to be anything other than simplistic and mediocre. But it has two issues that scupper things anyway: 

(1) The mechanics are a little flimsy and not totally reliable, which breaks the flow of the action. 

(2) The music, story, and presentation, are way too poncy for my tastes. Come the point I arrived at an underground village, populated by cute humanoid toad people wearing dungarees, it killed the appeal for me.

Why are they dressed anyway?
Is it because: 
(a) they value clothing as it has pockets for carrying stuff, such as money / keys / mobile phones / vapes?
(b) they developed into a puritanical society, and must hide their naked bodies after they learned the concepts of sin and shame?
(c) the first character you meet is a young toad girl, and the developers felt the need to cloth her because there are sick perverts in this world who'd get their rocks off on the digital representation of a naked prepubescent member of another species....??!! 

I don't really care what the reason was (there is a high probability it was option C) I just find cute underground humanoid toad people wearing dungarees to be effing stupid! 

Maybe if there is a bit where you have to get across some spikes by flinging the toad people and impaling them to make a platform to stand on, then I might change my mind. Or a bit with some ravenous beastie chasing you, and you fling toad people into it's hungry maw to give yourself some breathing room while it chows down on them, then I might change my mind. 

Basically if at any point in time I get to kill the stupid twee toad people, then stomp their ickle wickle cutesy twee world into the dirt while laughing like this ""MUAH HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!"" as their brains drip from my merciless augmented steel foot, then it would be an improvement (Honestly - I'm not a psychopath...I just really can't stand tweeness)

But I doubt that will happen, and it will just stay sickeningly twee. If the mechanics were tighter, if it was more exciting, and the music wasn't so damn boring and ""nice"", I could maybe overlook this aspect. But they're not, and I don't do twee....ever!!

If you like that kind of thing (you're a fan of *ptui* Mario for example), then tuck right in. If the concept sounds cool, but the execution here doesn't, then check out 'Valley' instead, as it's much better."
3843,"A lovely, charming platforming game with a good story, mellow music, amazing scenery and great controls. For the price, it's well worth it"
3844,"Amazing game ,like,like,like"
3845,Nice game
3846,"I don't like endless grinding and frustration but if you do, then perhaps this game is for you. I don't really like platform games so I should probably not have even tried this game in the first place. I did like Portal but this is nothing like Portal. There are no puzzles, it's all about hand-eye coordination, reflexes and timing. And the game is ridiculously difficult, or more likely, I suck."
3847,fun game with short playtime u could literally finish this in one sitting
3848,visions of sex dungeon
3849,Beat the game in 113 minutes. Just in time for a refund =)
3850,Very nice atmospheric jumping game. Recommend!
3851,Pretty Gud.
3852,Beautiful
3853,"Okay, okay. I'll just make a list.

Graphics: 9/10 (Mostly characters)
Gameplay: 10/10
Story: 10/10
Awesomeness: 100/10

I recommend this!"
3854,Amazing game I really hope they come out with a second one.
3855,"This game is cute, fun and very quirky, made slightly more enjoyable by the semi-broken English that absolutely just adds to the charm. Not very long, but long enough, roughly 3 hours if you stop to smell the roses. My 2 hours of this were incredibly enjoyable, to the point where I was already looking forward to playing it through again at some point with a better handling of the mechanics.

The final 50 minutes or so were spent repeatedly dying on the same ridiculous two-minute long sequence that involved a gameplay mechanic that failed to get a mention. Spoiler-free advice ahead: Anyone reading this planning to play, you can only recharge your glove via the crystals if you have at least one grapple remaining. I had to Google this and afterwards did it on my second try after having attempted it about 40-odd times. It pretty much ruined the game for me by that point and I doubt I'll ever play it again now, which is a shame. That said, I can still recommend it if you go in with the knowledge I didn't have."
3856,"Almost 4 hours spent on the passage of the entire game, I will remember for a long time! A real example of how games should be made. I just advise this game, it is damn beautiful in terms of passing."
3857,"I like it, a really fun to play game with its own interesting story and the mystery behind it"
3858,great gamne
3859,100% worth it
3860,"I own this game for a long time, but never played it at all. Judging from it's name, I thought it would be a weird game, like Shower with You Dad Simulator or something. After couples of month, I think, ""well, I should give it a try"". Turn out, this game is a pretty good game. I never into platforming game before, but this game changing my perception. This game has a good story and quite challenging level so I don't feel bored while playing it. If you are into a platforming game or game with good story, you should give this game a try."
3861,nice story :D
3862,"It's fun, a nice storyline. Great to pass time playing."
3863,"amazing story,"
3864,yes
3865,"This acrobatic game has some very nice mechanics woven into a token story - but the developers overdid it with some of the jumping sequences that have no save point in between. At the start of the last level, I got so frustrated that I stopped playing and watched the rest on Youtube. Might be just me, but it's my thumb, anyway."
3866,"Great story line, good graphics, good concepts. Overall great game highly recommended"
3867,I have a different story about my uncle and it isnt as good as this one. Loved this Game 10/10. <3
3868,"This game is one of the most hidden gems out there. It's absolutely a blast to play, and the story is so fun and whimsical. I would recommend this to just about anyone, especially if you want something that is challenging yet a break from the typical hyperviolent in your face action games."
3869,"A beautiful game with amazing story-telling, and smooth gameplay, not too graphic heavy. Overall a 9 out of 10 from me."
3870,"A really fun game that satisfied my parkour crave. It was way too short for my tastes and really wish that they could add more. The dialog is really creative and the gameplay is smooth, I love how it acted like a horror game until you got into the first village. It REALLY needs more content."
3871,"If you're a masochist, you could either buy this game, or add me."
3872,"A heartwarming little adventure. The movement mechanics work very nicely, and the music is subtle but really helps to immerse you in this calm little world of floating rocks, and endless chasms. 

I do have some minor gripes. The graphics do look a little old, especially the NPCs, and the animations can feel a little still and unnatural.

Overall, a short but fun adventure, that I recommend to any fan of 3D platformer / parkour games.
8/10."
3873,:)))
3874,chill game
3875,"Honestly, the story here isn't really notable. Seems like a footnote wedged in after the 'game' part was already completed. Don't get me wrong, they made a lot of assets to sell the story and the voice acting is good. They spent effort on it, it's just not super well thought out or compelling. I'll give extra points if the dad narrator is just making stuff up so the daughter will go to sleep.

The gameplay is the fun part, and I rate it a 7/10. The tether does not swing you, it drags you to the point you tethered, at speed. Managing this and maneuvering midair without faceplanting into the thing you tethered is the challenge this game provides, and the game does not lack in challenges for this moveset. There are collectibles, secrets, and side challenges.

Generally this game gave me a good impression and I'd recommend it to children or people who are new to gaming, as opposed to people who are looking for a story or grand challenge.

"
3876,"its a cool game, got it for free, thanks for making it so beautiful."
3877,"Absolutely amazing game, best indie game I have ever played."
3878,"A story about my uncle is a good game, its genuinly fun and the mechanics and physics work perfectly.
The difficulty is slowly ramped up at a decent pace by introducing new mechanics throughout the game, the story isnt anything special but interesting enough to keep yourself going.

However the one major flaw in this game is the length. I completed the whole game in an hour and a half, not long.

TLDR
A very fun and entertaining game, but way too short to make the most of the mechanics."
3879,One word: Amazing
3880,Love the game

3888,I liked it
3889,cool and good
3890,"A Story About My Uncle is narrated as a bedtime story, a fact which pays off by the end, but doesn't mesh well with the rest of the game. Between calmly retelling tense challenges and asserting danger in a world of instant respawning, there's always a disconnect. I was left feeling like the story being told here would have been better told if the game had leaned in closer to its walking simulator elements, and considering how all the platforming mechanics are disabled during story moments, it would seem that the developers agree.

The grapple-based platforming that makes up every non-story moment is all joy and freedom, at least in the few areas that have solid ground beneath them. The constant threat of bottomless pits everywhere else, however, stifles any desire to explore outside of the next stable platform. The healthy amount of checkpoints and lack of a real punishment for falling do mitigated that fear somewhat, but not enough to encourage me to look for the plethora of treasures the achievements tell me are still left to discover.

Don't let me give you the impression this is a bad game though. The grappling system is exhilarating and the story is compelling, if a little by the numbers. A Story About My Uncle is just a game whose inability to decide whether it should be a challenging platformer or an engaging narrative hamstrings its potential."

3917,"The story is pretty bland with very 2D characters. The ""sidekick"" seems to be written to be endearing yet I found her just annoying. 
The movement in the game is the highlight, very satisfying to jump and swing around. Disappointed there wasn't any area to just play around with the movement."
3918,good adventure and confirmed non violence..thumbs up
3919,"Man shall I say this game is awesome! It will still be a gross understatement. This game is worth ways more than what I had paid for it, the story, the mechanics, the gameplay, everything is top notch, it is all top tier stuff. The game is very well optimized as it managed to run at 40-50 fps,  768p medium-high settings on my crappy intel HD 4000 graphics.

the bad part is that the game is only 6hrs long if you play along the story, but those 6-7hrs are going to be awesome.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes open world adventure based stuff!"

3921,"The gameplay is boring and repetitive. What little story there is dull and has the pacing of a custom map from Counter-Strike. The levels are big and empty and look like a bunch of random geometry thrown into a big skybox like a bad custom map from Counter-Strike. The characters all voiced by people who speak English as a second language which provides another whiff of bad custom map from Counter-Strike. 
Basically save your money and go try a custom map on Counter-Strike. If you hate that then you'll hate this game. If you like that then congratulations, you saved yourself the price of a pizza."
3922,ok game
3923,"Got it on special offer for free, deffinitely would recommend
Interesting story, stunning visuals, good puzzle like elements in gameplay
Only minus is short gametime"
3924,grapple hook time
3925,"The game is pretty short but it is enjoyable while it is lasting, i fell in love with the atmosphere it gives, the story is actually pretty good for a game like this and the gameplay is good.
Great game overall 8/10"
3926,The game is fun when youre bored
3927,"It's a nice game which can easily pull you in with unique sceneries, creatures and calm, relaxing sound effects. You will not be relaxed though, because some parts are fucking impossible. I got it from a bundle of random keys, not sure if I'd pay more for it. I'm reviewing it before finishing the game because I can't fucking make it."
3928,"Nice short but replayable game.

Great gameplay elements but the story could be better.

In order to avoid spoilers I won't mention why, but I thought the plot could have been greatly enhanced by changing a couple elements.

If you enjoy short and sweet games, I would recommend it."
3929,A short but amazing gem of a game
3930,Chill game to kill time

3934,Great game. Short and sweet. A little buggy when trying to cling to floating objects but that makes it challenging.
3935,good game
3936,Leafy
3937,"Afterthoughts: I refuse to recommend this game, it was fun evening of grappling, but I won't recommend. I'm a giant sucker for a great story, and it starts off strong, but the more into the gameplay you get, the more you see how ambiguous the ending gets. I dislike a story that ends with too many questions, especially with some of the elements it incorporated. So pros and cons:

Pros
-Very pleasant environment
-The narrative fits the narrator
-Most of the controls are simple

Cons
-Blink and you'll miss it short
-The game was designed to be a speedrunner/challenge-motivated gameplay.
-Not enough substance to the narrative
-Last part of the game will drive you insane with the amount of experimenting you do as you grapple.
-Too many times you will do a vertical boost jump over a horizontal one. I still don't understand how this happened.
-Maddie's challenge.
-The design of the frog people."
3938,very good
3939,Good storyline

3942,good for one time play really only tried to play again wasnt as good
3943,ok
3944,"+ incredible presentation, especially the visuals
+ very detailed, even includes some nice easter eggs
- short game (3h) and already gets repetetive after 1h
- only explores the physics on a basic level with little challenge or innovation
- sometimes has unclear indication for if a rock is targetable, alongside other annoying interactions"

Cons:[list]
[*]Quite short (Around 2h on first run)
[*]While nice, the story is way too unbelievable [spoiler]to fit the ending[/spoiler]
[*]There can be minor bugs and glitches. They don't affect the game too much, but can be annoying.

Overall, pretty good game if you are looking for a platformer with great mechanics and don't mind that it is rather short."
3953,i like.
3954,"Short, but fun"
3955,pretty good game to play when you have nothing to do
3956,Its a very good game in my opinion I got it when it was free!
3957,good
3958,Short but fantastic platformer that feels similar to the portal games.
3959,A short and sweet story line!!! I loved it.
3960,"It's all in the wrist!

Seriously. This adventure has been quite engaging, and frustrating for sure. If you enjoy puzzle adventures with semi-hidden collectibles that rely heavily on control accuracy, then you will very much enjoy playing this. If an immersive story is your thing, even better. Stunning visuals, an intriguing story, a sassy NPC, and smooth controls (but...accuracy matters. A lot!)."
3961,the game has aged very well and still is really fun to play
3962,great story

3987,lit
3988,"Interesting gameplay, a compelling story and unique concepts help to make this game an enjoyable experience. The game is short but with very cheap prices during steam sales the price is worth the time. The graphics and character models are a bit dated but don't subtract from the overall experience. I would highly recommend this game when it goes on sale as I don't think $13 is a fair price point."
3989,"This game is pretty short but the story line is interesting and drives the player to keep playing to find out more. Once the game really gets going however, I think the game play alone is enough to want to keep playing. The levels are beautiful and although sometimes it may be a little difficult to see where you're supposed to be going next, I always felt amazed by their visual design.
The controls are pretty simple and there are only a few moves to master, allowing the player to enjoy jumping, swinging, boosting and crotch thrusting from floating rock to floating rock with a sense of satisfaction/relief.
"
3990,fun twist on platformers.
3991,"Would recommend waiting until this one is on sale. As good as it is (and it's really good), it only took me about 5 hours to complete."
3992,"A short yet sweet first person platformer. The story is simple and predictable, but not unpleasant, the performances are pretty good, and flying through the air is fun, with a good feeling of motion. A few sections can be tricky, but nothing insurmountable."

4001,"It's a nice relaxing puzzle game, and there's not much more to it. The story, while cute, seems mostly to be there to flesh out the mechanic."
4002,Takes ~2 hours to beat. Solid game.
4003,yes
4004,This game is puzzle-y.
4005,not realistic enough
4006,a short yet interesting platform game that managed to blow me away
4007,Yeah it's good
4008,"The first half of this game is awesome. Great level design, cool movement mechanics, nice mystery story. The second half has its moments too, but overall the level design takes a pretty big dive. A completely superfluous movement mechanic (you know the one) is added which feels like its literally just a quick fix to compensate for the poor level design. 

Overall I liked it since I'm a fan of fast paced movement focused games, but if I had to pick only one, it wouldn't be this one.

[spoiler]It'd be Valley. Just sayin'.[/spoiler]"
4009,I recommended for storyline
4010,This game is awesome!
4011,have a good story
4012,very good :)
4013,"Fairly short but fun game. Feels satisfying with how high you can jump and once you get the grappling hook it becomes even more fun. the character models are a bit freaky but the levels are great.

(Tip) I played with a  controller and it was pretty easy at first and then it started to get much harder later because I couldn't aim as precisely as I wanted. I then switched part way through to playing with a mouse and KB and it became waaaay easier!"
4014,Good game.
4015,"This game is very good, i don't know what to say about it. I highly recommend it."
4016,10/10 would play again
4017,This game is very fun to play.
4018,big good game
4019,Quite a chill game with a tragic hidden story beneath. Platforming is really really fun. I'd reccomend
4020,"The Good: Touching ending, exhilarating jumping mechanics, beautiful visuals and music

The Bad: Not much to do in between jumping, puzzles can get down right frustrating towards the end, only a couple of hours long

First person platforming isn't attempted often. A Story About My Uncle keeps it basic with grappling, anti-gravity jumping, and various puzzles. The story is fairly simple, and doesn't really mean anything until the very end. A boy is trying to find his uncle Fred. He finds his uncle's lab where he straps on a weird jump suit and takes off to some unknown land. He eventually comes across a species of frog people and a little girl from this village befriends the protagonist.

The jumping is actually quite exhilarating. You jump really high and your character's hands swing around which make you feel vertigo. The sheer speed and height this game creates is something not really seen in most games. As you make your way across bottomless chasms and dark caves you begin to wonder what all this means. What's the point? The jumping puzzles get progressively harder to the point of down right frustration. The grapple has three shots. Once these run out you either need to land or you're falling into the abyss. Later on you get rocket boots that allow a quick boost if you miss your shot or your next grapple point is too far away. One of the hardest obstacles are the windmills. I actually had to manipulate the physics by landing on one for a split second so my equipment recharges. The game gets so tricky towards the end that casual players may not make it. Sure the game is only a couple of hours long, but the complicated jumps are just mind bobbling.

With that aside the music is great and the game looks beautiful. While it uses the dated Unreal Engine 3 the art style is superb. I honestly felt like this was Journey to the Center of the Earth meets Mirror's Edge. There's nothing else out there like it and the ending is extremely touching, well worth the play through to get a few heart-strings pulled.

I just wish there was more to the game. Sure jumping around gets fun, but some times I feel areas dragged on forever with too much nothing in between. It's a step in the right direction for this type of game. With more story being pushed out and some variety in gameplay this game could have been something even more incredible."
4021,Beatiful game. Very cool levels and interesting characters. Story is good but it is short and you want more. It is fun to move around in game but sometimes little buggy. Still very good game!
4022,very cool game

4052,"played it a bit, its ok"
4053,"Nice game, good story, chill game for an afternoon. 10/10 would play again."
4054,weird
4055,"There is nothing special about this game, and that is the real charm.

The story can be completed in only an hour and a half at most. This is because the gameplay is quite simple; run around, aim, and grapple around. The only real challenge in the game is in the beginning of the last level; no spoilers, but if you have played it, you know what I refer to. Some may prefer more complex parkour, but the simplicity of this game makes it quite relaxing.

As for the story itself, I like it. Sure, there are no plot twists, no crises, nothing of that sort. However, it is incredibly cute.

This game is definitely worth playing in my book. If not for the cute story, nor the gameplay puzzles, the grappling hook is pretty entertaining by itself. Just remember: You can latch on to [i]almost anything[/i], not just the symbols."
4056,"Nice gameplay and story, loved it"

Environment was cool and beautiful at parts. The challenges & achievements add a little more replayability to it also and I probably would play this again. A story about my Uncle is just as good as most of the single player story-narrative adventure games I've played before and it's free."

4091,I love the graphics of the game but its  so hard to achieve the steam achievemnt üòñ
4092,An amazing and beautiful game. Feels like an escape from our world to the wonderful world.
4093,"A Story About My Uncle is not maybe for everyone, but still it's a fun game.

This game is a platformer where the player must find their way through the world, while the main character narrates the story an bed-time story. The game itself is fun, and has a nice challenge to it. completing the platforming challenges is pretty fun. the evoriment is very nice looking and the music, while not the most memerable, is very atmospheric. I spend a couple hours completing the story and i had a fun time playing the game.

However, while the game is fun and the eviorment is good, the game has some flaws.
While the idea of the game as a bedtime story is interesting, the in-game characters facial animations are not the best...
The story is also not the most deep, and while that is not a problem for me, some people who are looking for a deep story, shouldn't keep their expectations to high. the story is pretty lighthearted overall.

Overall, A Story About My Uncle, is a fun, short platformer with nice challenge, good envoriments and atmosphere, but with a not too compellling story and kind of bad facial animations. I recomend this game if you are looking for a fun indie platformer with nice atmospheres. worth a try if you are looking for something fun and lighthearted."
4094,"What is the story of my uncle and my little brother?
Can anyone tell me...."
4095,bery nice
4096,"fun game, good story"
4097,Pretty nice.
4098,"Pretty fun platformer. It's got a light story that doesn't really matter, most of the game is just swinging around and flying through the air. Some parts can be frustrating and the physics can be a little jank. But when you're doing everything right and you swinging through the air it's a fun feeling. 8/10 it makes me feel like spiderman"
4099,Very casual game. Very fun too. Would recommend when wanting to play a game while talking to your friends.
4100,Overall a short yet enjoyable experience. For anyone wishing to play though be warned inputs don't always translate well into actual actions and can be quite frustrating. But for the price of 3-4 dollars it often goes on sale for is well worth the experience.
4101,chill and kinda fresh doe üëÄüò≥üò≥üò≥üòè
4102,It's a nice game.
4103,"Best game on steam. No other game compares. May not be your average shooter but is definitely up there in most calming, soothing, and satisfying games. The story line is great and the player really feels part of the game. The characters in the game truly have an effect on the player. Overall, this game is in my top 3 of all favorited."
4104,Cool story.  Liked the mechanics.
4105,"If you want a short platformer with different mechanics, A Story About My Uncle is a pretty good option."

4149,"I guess I can only recommend this if you get it for a very low price.
It's not a bad game but it's VERY short, and it doesn't offer much once you finish it. The voice acting and some models are pretty bad but the overall aesthetic is pleasing. The gameplay itself is pretty nice and it could have been explored some more but the game is rather story focused and honestly, the story itself it's not that great.

Could have been better."

4161,A kind of storytelling game blended with FPS. I recommend it.
4162,short but sweet. I really enjoyed the movement aspect of the game which is by far its largest selling point but what surprised me was the story within the world you progress through. Its not overly complicated but really compelling. The games atmosphere and level of detail is also impressive without being distracting. For the price I would highly recommend this game : - )

4171,"One of my first games on Steam - still love it!
Recently played it again and the wonder and adventure is still there.

+ The controls are tight.
- The pathfinding is a bit off in a couple of sections, one area in particular required a blind jump but was easy to figure out where to go after I was out in the void - 
+ and even if I died, the respawn rate is super quick and the checkpoints are very forgiving.
+ The whole game has a certain charm about it you don't find as much nowadays.

If you have a couple of hours to spare and want a bit of light-hearted escapism, then I highly recommend this one."
4172,An enjoyable platformer game. It's very similar to Valley in that it's a platformer with a narrative and short story. The difficulty seemed very good in that it's not super trivial.
4173,A good game
4174,Fun
4175,This game is pretty good when it comes to gameplay. Creative platforming and grappling hook mechanic make it incredibly satisfying to swing around levels. Really what caught my eye was the world these levels were placed in. Tons of visual world building coupled with a mysterious story leaving you to fill in the blanks is what makes this short game worth playing. Nothing is left too open ended and nothing is over explained.
4176,Great little story with fun mecanis to the game. Worth the price.

10/10, would buy for double price"
4187,"One of the best games in my library, and one of the best I've played on Steam.  From what I remember (it has been quite some time since I played it) the challenge progressed very nicely, and the story was mysterious enough to keep my interest piqued the whole way through.  I enjoyed the controls and the skill needed to swing - it was very fun.  I remember it only being frustrating sometimes because of the skill required, but never because of the controls (I could be remembering incorrectly, though, perhaps).  But when I got past a part I was having trouble with, I remember the satisfaction in succeeding in doing it - and once again, the swinging was so fun and done so well, I thought."
4188,the game story was fantastic and had an emotional touch
4189,Game is dope af. Buy it.
4190,not bad game
4191,good feelings about this game
4192,"Nice game! Mix of adventure and jump and run, I guess."

4201,"Nothing to say, just play it :)"
4202,"One of the best motion flow I've played. The early levels are really entertaining and offer such an amazing freedom. While the latter become more difficult and more restrictive, in terms of where you can go and what you can grapple, the rocket boost introduction level is one of the best freedom moments I have experienced in gaming.


Most of the levels are easy or approachable. There are some stages like 5 minute moments that can extend into 20-25 if you fail a lot or attempt to do the challenges. I had like 2 frustrating moments where I got stuck, took a break came back, more attempts and complted it. Either than that it is well made. There are also some moments where you don't know where to go, so will have like a bit more exposure on where to go or what to do.

The soundpart is minimalistic, with ocasional atmospheric music and decent voice acting. The gameplay is mostly tight and responsive, but there are moments where you think you did the jump but you fall short. Also some moments where you bounce(slide) out of the edge of texture and few scenarios where you could get block, but I managed to get out of the issues. In case you can't, there are a lot of checkpoints and you can reset the checkpoint. There are a lot of save points, almost from 30 seconds to 30 seconds.

The story is mostly an emotional filler that does it's job in providing a decent story and graphics are outdated but the visual style is enjoying and beautiful enough to save some of the textures.

I have to say that the story is ok, nothing surpring, or different, but it is a bit creative and helps the environment and also pushes the game a bit forward.

While the core gameplay is swinging and moving around the map, the game does a tremendous job of offering this liberty. Sure... maybe not like in Just Cause, but it is really great.

The lenght of the game is just fine and could even have been shorter. There is enough content in this game and I have to say that if the game lasted 30 more mins or would have been longer I would have become to get bored. It has a really nice lenght, and because after a point it doesn't introduce more mechanics, it is better that they kept it short. It will have been boring to just play levels and levels with the same mechanics.

The game introduces some new scenarios in the end and is trying to roll and revolve on what it can do and apply with different modifications.


Overall I recommend this game for the movement quality and freedom, for the environment and a bit for the atmospheric soundtrack. It also can run on older PC's as it isn't graphic intensive. It';s a game that you can complete in 1 playtrough. And it is aimed at casual so there won't be something very difficult. There is a time trial mode and some of the achievments are a bit hard, but they can be completed by the players who try harder at this game. There are also collectibles and steam trading cards.

4203,The visuals are great but I haven't completed the game
4204,good feeling flying like anything
4205,"I received this game for free from a Steam promotion a year or so ago, and I didn't download it until very recently. This was a mistake. I can't put into words how long I've been trying to find a similar game to play that was as well made, immersive, and beautiful as this game. When I loaded the game up I thought it would be another wack parkour game.
The story as well as collectibles are very well integrated into game in many aspects, such as when you go to exit the game, the narrator says ""It's getting late, should we continue tomorrow?"" as well as the collectibles aren't just some coins or random pickups, they are data results from machines that your Uncle built. The progression and difficulty are great as well. It starts by showing you the functionality of your power jump and power dash before giving you the grapple. This gets you used to your basic tools before giving you some of the more advanced ones which is a mistake that lots of similar games make. Each area has a new aesthetic to it, as well as mechanic or ability that can be used to complete the area. My favourite extra thing to do in this game is to make a Stray translator, as you can do this from what Maddie tells you the writing says. Overall I would recommend this game to people who are thinking about getting it. I would rate it 10/10"
4206,"A very enjoying journey of playing as an adventurous boy at the same time telling a bedtime story about his uncle to his daughter, a very calm experience when things are going smooth in platforming <3"

4284,i have mixed feelings about this game. It has nice visuals and i loved the way the story is told as a little bed time story but honestly it was too repetitive and the ending was disappointing. i'd give it 5/10.
4285,Pretty darn cool
4286,very enjoyable <3
4287,"This is a very beautiful and whimsical game.

It doesn't take very long to beat depending on how swiftly you can solve its puzzles and the like but for what you get it is worth the time.

The atmosphere is great, the voice acting is simple but compelling and the characters you meet along the way feel both real and meaningful.

I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice to say that the world that has been created for the player to play around in is very beautiful and filled with a myriad of challenges to overcome and enjoy."
4288,A short but fun platformer
4289,Fun game with great landscape - Stopped up several times just to take screenshots of the scenery.
4290,"Very interesting game, solid story and levels are beautiful. 
Its kind of hard and challenging, achievements are very hard to get."
4291,"A fairly short 3D platform game, with a grappling mechanic.
The graphics are nice, and it gets somewhat difficult at times.
The story however is a little brief. Just when you are starting to get into it, things finish.

Still, worth getting, for $10 or less."
4292,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this game; the graphics were beautiful and the story interesting. Unfortunately, the gameplay itself felt really lacking.
In what is essentially a parkour game, the controls should be tight and responsive, but they simply weren't. I'd take a running jump off a ledge and never be sure quite how far it was going to take me. The grapple seemed to be excruciatingly precise, and so I'd find myself firing it multiple times in panic just in the hope that it would stick.
I had to quit the game halfway through because of the sheer frustration of these controls, so that is why I would not recommend it to others."
4293,Interesting game
4294,Its a fun game
4295,Story isn't its strongest point but it's a lot of fun would recommend
4296,Good but shortish game.
4297,"7.5/10. - Relaxing, enjoyable, beautiful story, artwork & detail. Mechanics feel great and enjoyable to play around with. 

I can't really describe much without potentially spoiling so I'll just be honest and say I had a blast with this game. It was shorter than I would have liked but I felt engaged and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. It's a super good game to just have a relaxing evening with. 

Definitely recommend to anyone!"
4298,"Pretty fun game to chill on story lines okay I haven#t really paid attention since I just wanna swing.
Would recommend but I didn't buy it and I wouldn't recommend for a buy"

4336,"Most of the time, the grappling hook mechanism is fine, but once in a while it's infuriatingly hard to ""solve the puzzles""
it was rather disappointing to find out that the game practically doesn't require any thinking, but dexterity instead.
Story is simple and rather bland, but that's not a bother.


Still, it was a rather fun game at first. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes boring."

4388,"It's a great little game. It doesn't impress with graphics, but with a heartfilled story. In addition it is fun to play along while listening to the story. It is about 2 hours long when you don't run it and only play the story, but i don't think that is a problem.

Thank you for making this game, this beautiful little gem."
4389,"Quite a short game, but it has its own appeal. If you like platformers, and a small heartwarming story, you would like this game, though some parts are quite difficult (for me).

4392,"A Story About My Uncle is mainly a parkour game with beautiful scenery and interesting story.

I only recommend this game if you like parkour, or else you might dislike this game. This game might be a bit difficult. You will keep falling down so often, which might annoy you. Many parts of the game really need players to fully use all mechanics available to actually get through it, or else you'll fall down again.

As an overall, I get bored from this. Purely parkour game is not really my type."
4393,"[b]Definetly Play this game.It's a must play.Good games made by low budget companies are always Appreciated
Grappling Hook mechanic Feels good,and story is great.[/b]"
4394,"Good game , good story. I love ur game bro."
4395,So this gem has been sitting in my game library im the kind of first person shooter guy but my god did i love this story. the begining is a little bit of a drag but arnt most good games? this to me 2 or 3 sessions to complete with causual play. if you buy this game stop every now and then to just apprecate all the detail and lighting that was put in the game. checkpoints seem fair but some where just not fun. a really hard puzzle and i have to wait 45 seconds just to get back to repeat it. ice caves where some of the hardest and most fun in the game so pretty and the managing of crystal charge was unique to me. if the game is under 7$ or is on sale id pick it up. even if you dont play it for 3 years like me you will end up loving this little game and dieing to find your uncle. charecter models are terrible. if u can get past that then u have a great game 8.5/10
4396,Story is very appropriate. Little girl gets raped by her uncle. Not funny. But good game.
4397,"My Review of A Story About My Uncle

I did not think much when this game was free on Humble Bundle but I decided to grab it considering it was free and thought I will give this a try.

Well game play wise It's actually really good the grabbing and swinging and jumping from one rock to another seeing new areas.
The campaign is remarkable tells a really good story as you play along and is very soothing to play this game.

Game runs perfect on most systems.

No bugs and or glitches I have encountered at all runs great with no issues to stop you.

Overall: Anyone thinking of buying this game or not I would say 100% Buy it if you enjoy a nice single player story mode game. 10/10 Would recommend to anyone having doubts."
4398,"Very nice story telling game, graphics look very nice too. Level design is nice and if You want some challenge You can try to speed run levels on time trial to get achievements. Some levels are challenging to speed run even with using some glitched shortcuts. Soundtrack feels really nice and it really builds up unique atmosphere."
4399,"all i have to say is that this was a damn good game the platforming was challenging but fun the story was happy and sad well to put it simply this is the only game (in my knowledge) that ive written a review for so that tells how much i enjoyed it.
and even though i got it for free it is well worth any price."
4400,GRAPPLE PAKOUR.
4401,"Good game overall, took me about 4h to finish it with LOTS of deaths between. Good stroy and smooth soundtrack"
4402,Amazing game.
4403,Good story game. Finished playing it a couple of time.
4404,"this game is freaking awesome, it might not seem that i have played it on steam, but i already completed story 2 nd tome and it feels really awesome to swing in the sky and look at awesome graphics!!"
4405,"I played this game a couple of times already before I bought it on my own account. It's a great ""parcour like"" game."
4406,"I loved this game.  Delightfully fun and filled with occasional challenging bits, this game is so worth it. Highly recommended. Go forth adventurer. Have fun."
4407,nice
4408,decent
4409,"Beat the game in just under 2 hours. Story is light and goals are straight forward. Kinda wish the guy you play as would talk instead of saying what he said, would have made for better convos with Maddie while your jumping from place to place. Also wish she would have stayed with you to talk God of War and Last of Us style for less moment void of sound well you parkour to your next goal."
4410,"It's nice. It's short. It's sweet. It's a fun little candy you get at grandma's house that you enjoy for the short time you can taste it and then you want more. Unfortunately, that's all you get. By no means is this game so phenomenal that it leaves one wanting more, rather it's a relaxing use of about 2 hours that, like candy, is worth way less than sold. The games mechanics are generally tight and only a few times did I clip through random walls on the map. Although the story is very simple, it brings up a cool topic that the game could have delved deeper into: about choosing your own adventure while ironically following your Uncle's adventure. Even though the game is made short, I think there could have been a little more exposition, not about the world but just the topic of making your own adventure. 

TLDR: 
Unnecessary metaphor about the game ‚òë
Very short, relaxing game ‚òë
Not worth $12.99 ‚òë
Basic story with a cool idea ‚òë

FYI: Bought it when it was free that one time."
4411,yes
4412,it's epic.
4413,"The story part seems pretty lackluster, but just the basic game mechanic of jumping and swinging from platform to platform seems fun."
4414,"Just play and chill doing some parkour and jumping here and there while doing the cute story.
definitely recommend it <3"
4415,"Touching storyline, great graphics and gameplay overall. Wished it was longer :)"
4416,A fun game with a good story and a mechanic never seen in any other game
4417,"It's 10:00 PM and you're thinking about your life. How far you've made it, how well you've done tons a things. But suddenly you'll realise, ""Hey, I've got 'A Story About My Uncle' (ASAMU)  in the library .. let's give it a try.' So you'll download a game and ...

[h1]It's great ! [/h1] 
Yes, probably it will take you only one evening to find an Uncle, but believe me, it's worth it. I recommend to grab it, when it's on sale.

- Story telling
- Graphics, visualisation
- Gamplay

[b]Cons[/b]
- Skipping through textures
- Poor animations of other NPCs

Edit: Added Pros and Cons Section."
4418,"I got this game awhile ago when it was free to claim for a week and it is a wonderful game. It is fairly easy and fun, however, there are some hard parts in the game that'll take a bit before you get to the next checkpoint. The soundtrack is very good, it goes along well with how the world looks and how the story goes. The graphics are alright, but this is a game that doesn't need fancy graphics. A Story About My Uncle takes about 2 hours to finish, or longer depending if you are having trouble. 

This game also has tons of replayability, so if you are planning on buying it, you should get it."
4419,"Good story and fun gameplay mechanics, i would love to explore this world even more, i hope we'll see more of this place in the future.
There's a real sense of wonder and adventure when playing"
4420,"A Story About My Uncle- Definitely one of the best games!
Here is a short overview what makes it so special.

Gameplay:
10/10 
The mechanic of this game is awesome. Its like a 3D jump-and-run game with a grabber and fast jumps.

Graphic:
10/10
Nice graphic style, a few worlds with different themes. 

Story:
7/10
It is a short and not that exciting story, anyway a binding story.

General:
This game is really cool for people who like challenges and little games with a story!"
4421,Simple but pretty great game
4422,"just completed the game. okay story, few bugs here and there ,the grapple system is cool and different scenarios. overall for me its a 7.5/10"
4423,Cool game but very short
4424,"A short but relaxing game to play. 
Great atmosphere.
Good story.
Great mechanism.
All in all a fantastic game and definitely worth the price"
4425,Beautiful game. Awesome story and amazing physics. An absolute must for anyone into 3D platformers as well as anyone else. Amazing work!
4426,"At first I was not excited for the game but I told myself why not give it a shot and it turned out to be an amazing game! The game has a very fun and relaxing atmosphere to it. Its a quick game but you don't feel dissatisfied with the amount of time it takes. It has great diologes and what I like to see a heart warming story. 

Very smooth platforming and an overall enjoyable experience.
I really recommended this game.
"
4427,"Do you expect a great story to get lost in? Don't play this.

3.5/10

"
4428,"Good game.
Uses my 2 braincells 103%.
"
4429,"At first I was not excited for the game but I told myself why not give it a shot and it turned out to be an amazing game I almost finished it in like 2 hours , the graphics were ok and the gameplay was so much fun but what I didn't like about the game is that it doesn't have any combat system it's all running and jumping and flying and I'm used to fps games so that was kinda strange to me but overall it's a very good game and I definitely recommend that you play it.
"
4430,"some nuisance cons:  routes tend be quite unclear as you go, ice cave is fucking timing rush with these unclear routes and way too few checkpoints"
4431,God I'm bad at parkour
4432,"It's a cute game, the aesthetics are the best part. If you're looking for a short, sweet, first person platformer with some challenge this will be good for you. The story is pretty weak and mostly exists to string together gameplay areas.

The WORST PART about this game, by far, is the mechanics. It was damn near impossible for me to get through a few areas with the physics treating me like a ragdoll at times and an anvil at others. It's really easy to lose control of your character while jumping, and that's only made worse by the fact that you aren't in control of when the game saves your progress, so you often end up repeating some parts over and over and over.

I ended up getting so frustrated at times that I definitely wouldn't describe this as a ""relaxing"" experience to anyone.

TL;DR: Get it on sale, unless you really love first person platformers with convoluted mechanics."
4433,"This is the hardest game I have ever played on controller - i changed to mouse and keyboard in the 2nd part of the icy caves, because it was simply impossible to react fast enough with the standard controller settings...

I ONLY bought this game because I was controller compatible, but I feel that was very misleading, as it is not controllerfriendly at all.

The storyline is ok, and Im sure its more enjoyable using mouse and keyboard throughout the game, but I definately dont recommend buying, if you expect to be able to play this using controller only."
4434,At the end everything was a dream and you woke up inside a closet with your uncle‚Ä¶[strike]touching you[/strike]
4435,"is fun, puzzle platformer and go on adventure"
4436,"A nice story-driven game with parkourish elements. Honestly loved it, solid game."
4437,"Perfect parkour game, hard sometimes 10/10"
4438,I found myself completely entrapped in the game for the ~2.5 hours it took me to complete it. Difficult yet very enjoyable along the way. Highly recommend!
4439,"first thing's first. If I had reviewed this game when I was raging and on the verge of tears after multiple fails in the game, I'd have given this game a downvote just out of pure frustration. but ahem. I'm sane now.
I totally have no idea how people finish this game in one runthrough cuz I got stuck in so many areas and had to keep on trying repeatedly till I succeed. Please don't even ask how many times I've fallen down into the abyss/died in the game so far. (more than 700+ times) I haven't accomplished even one achievement outta the 15 so... uh that says a lot.
Other than the fact that the game lacks any hints or directions or help in some confusing levels  (for me at least), it was a good game. Fluid gameplay and the feeling of grappling in the air is amazing. 
The  story line is not such a wowie either but meh okayish.. i'm in the ice caves right now in the game so idk how the ending is but hoping for the best. 

Play this game but at your own risk. If you don't have patience and got stuck somewhere, you'll rage or get frustrated probably... or you might just complete the game in one go idk :DDDD Overall, the game is good! Just play it and experience it. GOOD LUCK!

(Thankfully, walkthroughs are available on YT so don't worry about being stuck for eternity :))"
4440,"Wow. Okay... that was just beautiful! I don't leave reviews generally, but for some reason this time I had to share how beautiful this game was for me. And I can't."
4441,"It felt like you could really inmerse in the world, the gameplay was very smooth and enjoyable. 
The story had a great narrative, but it was too short, yet for it's price was great. 

For the price it's a good game"
4442,"[b] Got the game when it was free, really short story line but whats more important is that its fun and enjoyable. highly recommend picking this title up. [/b]"
4443,pretty good game
4444,story touched me same way my uncle does.
4445,oh man I have a scarier story about my uncle [spoiler] he touched me	[/spoiler]
4446,"Cool game 
Bad Voice actors"
4447,Really good story.like it
4448,Great gameplay and unique mechanics with heartwarming story that I'd wish it wasn't short.
4449,"Great game to pick up on sale. Pretty good story, platforming is fun, but glitchy. Don‚Äôt buy for any more than $7. Short game, but hard to put down once you start"
4450,The game has a very fun and relaxing atmosphere to it. Its a quick game but you don't feel dissatisfied with the amount of time it takes. Very smooth platforming and an overall enjoyable experience.
4451,Good.
4452,nice game
4453,Absolutely love this game
4454,nice game
4455,Gameplay is good but the story could have been better.
4456,"Nice game but very short (2h), the story is kinda good at the start but then it quickly gets ridiculous.
Replayability is there, with unlockables and different mods."
4457,was a great short story and fun laid back game play but would by at around 7.99 not 12.99 but I'm not big on story so it may be worth more to others. 4/5 for what it was
4458,epic
4459,"Relaxing, challenging, my heart is warmed and my soul is c l e a n s e d!

No really though, the voice acting might be sliiiightly off in some places but I love it."
4460,This game is epic
4461,"game is amazing, runs fluently on low end computers, great story line



almost as good as hentai"
4462,Amazing scenery. Great gameplay. Only downside is it is short. Got sucked into this game wish I could have played longer than 2.5 hours on it. Great job.
4463,"Relaxing atmosphere in the game, good music in the background and a memorable story."
4464,intriguing little walking sim game with a lame ending
4465,"A 3d platformer, with a sweet story about a kid going to find his uncle, who is lost in a mystical land. You go to find it and made some friends in the way.

The story is told by your character to his daughter, about how he admired his uncle who always go on crazy trips around the world, and one day he disappears. You find a suit made specially for you and a teleporter to another world, where the main story will unfold. There, your character will knew some of the people in the world, made some friends and, in the end [spoilers]find your uncle that will teleport you back to earth, while he stays behind[/spoilers].

The main way of moving in the game is through an attractor ray in a glove (Like a grappling hook) that your uncle leaves behind for you to try. The game is short, and sometimes can be very frustrating, since you will fall, and die, and fall and die a lot (For an example of this: All achievements on Steam are for not dying on a given level, and only 1,5% of people got one.) There is almost no enemies, and the few that are there you don‚Äôt fight, only evade. After a while you find some other items, like a jetpack, and use all of these to move through the world.
Because of this items having a very big reach, and the fact that you can make really big jumps like living on the moon being a professional basketballer, most of the game is comprised of small islands really far from each other, something like Alice Madness Returns ‚ÄúCastle cards in the sky‚Äù level, you can say. That part of Alice was one of my favourites, just for the evocative, relaxing and melancholic feels it has, and Gone North Games nails that same feeling on this game.
Some symbols on the map help you go, like tutorials, when the path is hard to see. Given the big jumps you have to do in-game, sometimes they are completely necessary.

Another paragraph goes to the voice acting, which, in my opinion, is perfect. You can feel every character attitude, and feel the story through their voices, so much that a simple story about a lost uncle can get all the feels. Really a lot of love is put on this game story and the story execution.
The story might not be strong enough to make you cry, but it will give you a melancholy smile, and the voice acting will stay with you even long after finishing the game. Some parts might even make you laugh, mostly the dialog of a character you meet around the middle of the game."
4466,A cool/luring parkour/platforming game with obscure wonderful story hidden behind its gameplay. It is nowhere near spectacular but worth finishing at least once.
4467,"Good game.
I love the story and the game mechanics are great. The story is pretty short so I recommend to buy it at a sale.
I found myself playing this through a few times. Pretty chill game, and not so action filled.
Still it has a few glitches and places to get stuck in, but it's still a great game and you should definitely play it."
4468,"This game was just amazing, the story line of it was what kept me playing it. The only downside is how short the game actually is, there are unlockables and you'll probably have to go through the game a second time to get them but other than that playing the game and going through it was very fun and addictive. I fell a lot, got frustrated once, but finished the game in a mere 2 hours or around there I think. All in all, the game was just super fun even if it was short. I'd like a sequel to the game, maybe one with the little girl exploring as well!"
4469,Great Game xD
4470,"Nice little platformer however I wish the story was longer as well as having more of a challenge, I finished this very quickly without any sort of difficulty."
4471,"Very good game, I liked it very much."
4472,"A good game with a somewhat good story-line, though very frustrating at times. It can be stupid when and when it doesn't set checkpoints, and the character animation is terrible, but overall, it's okay."
4473,Good game but way too short for its price
4474,When have csgo cool down
4475,10/10 game good parcore and story
4476,Got it for free! This game is okay for me if you like parkours and stuff. 8/10
4477,"Nice story, great atmosphere. 
overall great game

Worth the price :)"
4478,"A short but rather compact story-telling puzzle game. It took me less than 4 hours to finish it. There's no violence and the gameplay isn't intense. This game has truly a wonderful atmosphere that makes me amazed. However, as you progress the course gets tougher. But not so tough that you would rage. Overall I'll give it a solid 8/10."
4479,"It's a quite short game, or maybe I was just very fast at completing it, but although the character models looked quite ugly, the story and the gameplay was quite magical."
4480,Good game
4481,"i like it, i like the game until i kinda ""spoil"" the ending by watching the video on youtube,il give it 8/10 for story, the other 2? its the dificulty of the game, its start easy but when you allready far inside the game, it will much harder"
4482,veri nice
4483,"Fun as hell rope slinging game, to bad i haven't played it in a while."
4484,"Visually gorgeous, amazing mechanics. 
One of the best Platforming games I've ever played."
4485,"A Story About How I Fell to My Death 77,000 Times in Three Hours and Then Beat the Game...

quite short (beat it in 3 hours, 77,000 deaths included), so make sure you get it on sale.
it has some nice moments,
as well as some truly aggravating sequences.
a fun sidekick for a part of the game,
and decent narration.
worth a few bucks for a few hours."
4486,cool
4487,"It achieves its main gimmick pretty much perfectly, but the rest of the game is just awful. I'd go as far as to say that it would be an infinitely better game if you'd scrap all of the story and just leave it as simple first-person platformer going through different challenge maps. 

Writing is pretty bad and the voice acting is straight up painful. Character models resemble ones from at least a decade ago. The saving grace of the game in form of the first-person platforming (as well as some of the scenery) pushes it enough for a recommendation, but don't expect anything outstanding outside of that.

6.1/10"
4488,"I had gotten this game for free a few months back, and I found that this game was short handed as it had a good story and good gameplay but the short handed part is the fact of how short the game actually is. It took about 2 hours just to finish the game. But otherwise the game is great. :DD"
4489,"The voice acting in this game isn't that great, but the game doesn't take itself too seriously, so it all balances out. The levels look really cool, the music is nice and relaxing, and the game play is excellent.  If you can get it on sale, go for it!"
4490,"WAIT FOR SALE

Though it is quite the fun game, the length of the story doesn't live up to the standard $13 price-tag. If you plan on purchasing it to speed run or master the mechanics, then it may be worth it at full price. Otherwise, I would 100% recomend when it is on sale."
4491,Good game! Not much to do after you've completed the story though.
4492,worth the price!
4493,"Got this from humble bundle and wanted to give it a try after a long time, Glad i did. Good story arcs, relaxing yet challenging gameplay, and beautiful scenery. It ends at its beginning which makes the story well rounded. 

One issue though, I NEED MORE!"
4494,I really like this not very hard relaxing gameplay with great diologes and  what I like to see a heart warming story.
4495,"Its a great game that I got for free. 
I finished it in 3.4 hours, not much replay value.
Its worth it if you get it on sale"
4496,"it s very good game
"
4497,"Not too long gameplay, still very good though"
4498,"What pleasantly surprised me is that A Story About My Uncle doesn't focus exclusively on the story itself, but puts great emphasis on the simple yet engrossing narrative. This results in a high sense of immersion which becomes apparent only at the very end of the narration. ASAMU is certainly a non-violent interactive story videogame that pushes the genre one step forward, through its platforming mechanics. For anyone who thought Dear Esther as a surprising alternative to conventional gaming, ASAMU will certainly not disappoint."
4499,Very nice story!
4500,"Great game, it was very enjoyable and relaxing although tense at a few moments. the graphics and design are excellent and fitting for this sort of game."
4501,"I found this game great. A nice story, wholesome. At times difficult but the exploration was fun. My only sadness was on how short the game felt. i played it a couple times and still liked it. A great game even years after launch"
4502,Good parkour game and has good mechanics. I advice it.
4503,"Phenominal game with great gameplay and a good story, its not that long but after finishing it normally there is always more stuff like time trials and collectables to unlock some bonus content.
I recieved this game for free and would normally probably not have bought it, but since I recieved it for free I decided to give it a go anyway and was very happy I did, I highly recomend playing this game even if you don't normally play this sort of game (like me)."
4504,"Overall I enjoyed this game, especially the scenery. I'm not big into platformers though so I found it quite difficult. If you're not good a platformers the main game is challenging enough. The achievements are more challenging still. 

Pros:
- Brilliant graphics and scenery
- Good voice acting
- I really like Maddie
- The controls work very well

Cons:
- The story really only exists as an excuse for the gameplay
- It would have been nice if the towns/cities were larger and more interesting to explore, especially the second one

Verdict: 8/10"
4505,A relatively small game with a good story and quite simple gameplay mechanics.
4506,not a bad game tbh
4507,a very relaxing and thoughtful puzzle parkour game. loved it and made me feel real wholesome and nice at the end. some dificulty spikes in it but nothing unbeatable after a bit of brute force reps. gorgeous game too really loved the whimsical aesthetic the game has. 10/10 made me want to find my own adventures. only wish it has a sequel.
4508,is this the one about my uncle touching me
4509,"Very enjoyable, thoroughly enjoyed it. The mechanics, art, voice acting, and of course the story, are all very well constructed and done. Good job to the team and everyone who helped make this."
4510,Amazing!
4511,"The Story is really simple and cute but it is not the best, And It has a good music especially at the end, 
The Control is good but sometimes It is Glitch, And you can't get the power of crystal, The world of It is beautiful 
And It has a good design, This game for relaxing but the challenges are difficult a little bit,
It deserve to buy, Thanks for reading my review"
4512,"Just read other reviews, this game is amazing."
4513,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game, i enjoyed it, i got it for free on Humble Bundle, it's got a unique style of gameplay and the story is short but worth your time."

Retrace your father's story, when he was your age. A boy with a fantastical tale of his beloved uncle.

[b]Hook[/b]
Discovering a suit that allows you to jump, leap and grapple your way across great distances, you must navigate the void as you traverse caverns, sky-scapes and ice caves in search of your beloved uncle. On the way, the aliens you meet will warm your heart and raise your spirits as you try again and again to overcome this battle of survival against the odds.

[b]Mechanic[/b]
A first-person game that uses a half-life-like grab-and-pull-me-forward physics engine
- jump up high
- power up your technology
- grapple your way using a set amount of charges
- boost your trajectory wiht rocket boots
- checkpoints are frequent and areas are easy to replay - though some need a LOT of practice!

[b]Accessibility[/b]
- No gore, lewdness or profanity
- Tells a wonderful tale in your ear as you freely roam the fantastic world
- Initially easy to play
- Gets hard quickly, and there will be a tipping-point where some will find the need to cheat or quit rather than persevere

[b]Universe[/b]
- Wonderful, fable-like story, rich in style and warmth
- Beautiful voice-acting, really genuine characters to encounter
- Lovely story with a bittersweet arc

[b]Delivery[/b]
- really well delivered: slick presentation, simple menus, good tutorials
- compelling gameplay, with some really nice level design; on the cusp of frustrating and rewarding...
- as you leap, you will often find yourself leaning forward into the screen, willing yourself to reach a few more feet forward as you desperately try to reach that elusive ledge ahead...

[h1]A terrific example of gameplay and storytelling, meshed beautifully. Family-friendly with a whole lot of heart - but the final act, wow is it tough to beat![/h1]

Pros:

- simple mechanic, well explained and executed
- beautiful maps, great sense of danger and andrenaline as you explore
- the story is well delivered and you do care about where it goes
- overall, great level design... but....

Cons:
- ...when the going gets tough, it gets tough: expect to try the same section doens of times for that sweet trajectory to victory
- there are side-quests but the difficulty really makes it marginalised
- a great trip but one to grab in a sale

4515,"I'm only giving this game a positive review because there's no neutral option. 

I really wanted to like it. It has an interesting concept behind it and the visuals are pretty nice. 

But gameplay is where it fell flat for me. Controls feel really clunky and the physics feel kind of off. I've had multiple times where I would try to do a running jump, only for the game to not register I jumped. The beam feels like it should latch onto things but it doesn't. There's no real 'puzzle' element because the game tells you where to shoot your beam to via glowing markings on the environment.

I got the game for free through humble bundle and I personally do not think its worth the full price. Maybe on sale if you enjoy story rich games and don't really care much about the gameplay.

Overall, it's not a bad game, it's just not something I can enjoy for more than maybe 10 minutes at a time."
4516,"Really nice and calm game. The story is quite short (1 playthrough took me 2 hours) but very heart warming and wholesome. Everyone who enjoys little nice and wholesome stories, will have a great time playing this game. I give it 8/10."
4517,great game
4518,"Beautiful story, would play again 10/10"

with very nice Leveldesign
and some chill music 
and dont hesetate to do some tricky (but doable) challenges. 

COME AND GET THAT MASTERPIECE!!!!!!

i played the Mainstory in about 2:45 h i think you need around 2:15-3:15.

Buy this Game and experence something great, its worth the Money"
4524,"Obtained in Humble Bundle Monthly
First of all, excuse my blinding english skills but i have to practise somewhere ey.

The worlds building in this game is really interesting, it sets you into at first chaotic dark world and as time goes you found out that this abomination is actualy really well thought through. The aesthetics are breath taking and every screenshot could serve you as a background or just print it and hang it as a poster because my pals, this game is amazing. 

Game mechanics are really unique, swinging from hook to hook finding the perfect time to let go to just fall into the deep pit of darkness (ice caves much?)

You watch the story of the main character unfolding in retrospective. The character is coming back from adulthood to childhood in his memories to his missing uncle, how he found out where he went and if he will ever come back. You would expect a heartbreaking experience but the main character does actualy have a sence of what is right for individual as a whole and what is right for life in general. So even when significant effor is put into actions, it went the way it did. 

This game could also be used as copying mechanism with death of someone close or related. Letting go of strings of relationships can be painful but in the end there is not much you can do about it. You have to come in terms with it and it can take a lot of time (or just one or two dimentional trips to your uncle when you were like 9, what do you know)."
4525,"""exquisite"""
4526,.
4527,"Incredibly well-made game, good atmosphere, decent story, great ending. Good game."
4528,When I played A Story About My Uncle I did really enjoy it. The graphics were riveting and it is a really fun platformer in my opinion. Only downside is you can complete the game really fast but the levels are definitely great.
4529,"bugged as hell i mean impossible to play on a good steady alienware 
very very very poor adjustment for pc i guess it is only for controller maybe thats why it is bugged as hell and does not react to pressing the keys"
4530,"Short, but fun platformer. Graphics are a bit dated and physics can be weird at times, nevertheless it was still a decent experience."
4531,"very fun! good mechanics, great visuals, intresting story, great ending!"
4532,This game wasn't what I was expecting but I loved it anyway.  You might be put off by some abrupt introductions near the beginning of the game.  Keep playing through these though and you'll find a good game with fun mechanics and a nice story-line.
4533,"This game is a beautiful adventure, it reminds me of the studio Ghibli movies, which are filled with magic and wonder. It is much better than going to the movies."
4534,"Got it for free, this game actually surprised me, I just wish it was longer and with a deeper (not so much) story. very cool short game, highly recommend."
4535,Got this game while it was free a few months ago. It's definitely way too short and only taking 3 hours to complete I would say $13 is kinda expensive but I liked it and it's fun to grapple onto stuff and fly around.
4536,"Short, fun, and doesn't try to be anything else. 
It's a nice story for being on the side of the gameplay.

Ultimately, it's a pretty game with awesome platforming mechanics."
4537,"Its not the most fun I have had in a while but its not a bad game, its only 2 hours long story with chill narration and since the story aint that important you can just enjoy the gameplay with sum chill music in the background and have a great time."
4538,"I got the game for free. The game was good and I completed it. Unfortunately I Swinged too hard and threw up on the keyboard. 
Would play it again

7.5/10"
4539,Only the title sounds intresting.
4540,"only played it a bit but solid game, too bad commentary youtubers exist"
4541,Netter kleiner 3D Plattformer gepaart mit einer seichten Story. Ganz nett f√ºr zwischendurch.
4542,"Pretty nice, unusual and interesting"
4543,false advertising: this story had nothing to do with my uncle.
4544,"[h1][i]""Uncle Fred had warned me not to touch any of his things but... i was a curious child.""[/i][/h1]

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a first person platformer about a boy in search of his uncle in a fictional world.
You're owning a grappling hook, where you have to swing from platform to platform. You can also use this tool to jump higher and farther and build up momentum.

I like the graphics and atmosphere. The world is well designed and there are a lot of sweet spots to discover.

Why I can't recommend [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is because i didn't like the execution of the gameplay core mechanik: [b]the grappling[/b]

The idea is pretty nice, grappling from platform to platform, combining it with high and farther jumps. Later you'll even get the possibility to dash a long distance or refreshing your tool in midair (usually it only refreshes after landing).
The problem is, it feels really clunky and unprecise.

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] punishes you too fast for your mistakes. If you clicked too early (to grapple), you fail and will be respawned at the last checkpoint. If you clicked too late, you fail. If you clicked too often because you missed the target, guess what - you fail.

I also failed a lot of times because I've missed the platform by a few meters. You can move a little bit in midair but it's hard to comprehend where you'll land and sometimes you'll slide after landing (most times, sliding into the depths).

It's also hard to build up momentum because of the limitation of your grappling charges. It would be much better if you could grapple all the time but you're forced to land on a platform to recharge. In the last chapter of the game, this restriction is partly reduced due to the possibility to recharge midair but still not ideally.

I won't start about the boring story and characters here, it was difficult for me to continue.

[h1]The idea behind [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is pretty awesome but the execution is bad in my opinion. Every platform feels like trial and error and you won't find much momentum in here.[/h1]"
4545,"This game is almost identical to the game ""Valley"" .. I would rather suggest you play The Valley first, as it has better visuals and ofcourse better story line with some Amazing Music!"
4546,"A fun platformer with a good story and fun mechanics. Sadly it's really short so you can complete it in a few hours and the price is a bit high for such a short game, but if you want to support the developers do buy it at full price. Otherwise wait for it to be discounted.

8/10"
4547,This is one of the best indie games I have ever played. 10/10 recommend. Also the game has a very tightly wrapped story that made me finish the game in just one go.
4548,strory si nerde amk .
4549,Good but not worth for 13‚Ç¨
4550,"A nice little platformer that has a nice little story to it.
Visually nice looking and fitting melody in the background.
The ""platforming"" can be a bit annoying at times but mostly works as it should.
It is short and at parts you will fail and have to redo parts so be prepared for that.
"
4551,Game name is spot on. Short but intriguing game as you spiderman/rappel your way through the levels to find your uncle.
4552,"Bland platformer, mechanics are loose and not very interesting"
4553,"This is such a great game. I especially liked the story. My favorite parts were when the main character was talking about his uncle so positively, and how they did all those cool things together. It reminds me of how me and my uncle used to tickle each other in the showers at the community pool."
4554,Fun game very calm a bit short and custom levels would be nice
4555,"good game, but I wish they would come out with some sort of level editor where creators could build their own worlds. The campaign is all too short. I feel that right now this game is barely worth asking price and that if they came out with a level editor it would have a lot more worth as a game."
4556,Spiderman 2019 simulator!
4557,relaxing gud game
4558,Great game. Good story. The world is amazing. So relaxing and the music in the background is pretty good as well. Its totally worth it.
4559,Great.
4560,good game would recommend heHA
4561,"It's a quick 2 hour dash of beautiful scenery and a heartwarming story.

The game offers time trials and some unlockable perks after you have gathered some collectibles within the main story mode.

Although if you only wish to play through the story it's not worth the full price."
4562,"Genuinely surprised by the quality and the enjoyment in this game, cant recommend it enough!"
4563,"This game is amazing. It's taken me on an emotional roller coaster.

From the start, it's interesting. The gameplay is not complex, but it's not like it gets boring and still offers a challenge.

As for the story. I haven't played it in weeks, just started it up again and got soaked in the atmosphere right away. Finished the game and the ending hit me hard.
Buy it."
4564,"es un hermoso juego que te llena de lagrimas el final, un poco corto pero es una obra de arte"
4565,Jumpy jump nephew
4566,"Needs a lot of polish.
Has a lot of unfixed hitboxes.
Character models are dull and not moving most of the time."
4567,"Good story, great mechanism"
4568,good
4569,A charming little adventure with a fun gameplay mechanic. A short game that tells an interesting little story.
4570,"A Story about My Uncle has a unique mechanic where the player must swing from floating platforms and try to find their missing Uncle.  While the mechanic is very interesting I did not really have fun playing this game.  The story was very dry and boring, and the characters did not interest me.  I made it to the third area of the game but did not want to play it anymore."
4571,Decent game...
4572,"A beautiful story, Nuff said!!!!"
4573,"Wow... I came to this game expecting a fairly challenging platformer. I was not disappointed in the slightest. In fact, I was given a heavily story driven game, with powerful subtext and fantastic characters. If you are apprehensive about the difficulty, don't worry; the game is not remotely punitive for your deaths, and is as hard as you want it to be. You really feel like you're mastering the mechanics. I have played the story only once, and look forward to the time trials.

I 100% recommend this game. The platforming is slick (and looks awesome) and the story is wonderful."
4574,best game i ever played #aftertheportals
4575,"Great gameplay,story and graphics."
4576,Great Story and The best game play keep up
4577,"You Feel Freedom Flying through the landscape,
You Delight at Discovering hidden story,
You admire the animation.
You acknowledge its flaws in story polish,

And you understand its meaning at the end."
4578,"This is a jump puzzle game.  The world is moderately interesting and they make the characters and the jump puzzles about as interesting as you can reasonably expect, but unfortunately....it's a jump puzzle game.  Once I got to the ""falling boxes"" section, and spent an hour of futility due to the simple fact that there just didn't happen to be any boxes within remote proximity when it was time for me to jump, over and over and over again, I couldn't anymore."
4579,Great game (only a bit short story)
4580,aerf
4581,"Bought it on sale, would highly recommend. It's really atmosperhic."
4582,Make a new adventure and make it more trilling and fun !
4583,"Short, fun and good."
4584,Quality Solo Game
4585,The Game was pretty boring and repetitive and the story was trash
4586,"Short, good indie game that has some original game mechanics and bad story.
Get it when it gets discounted to a few dollars."
4587,"Very good game. Picturesque, kind, relaxing, art object created with the soul."
4588,It's a difficult game but not way too difficult. The ending might leave the player with speculations. Fine game.
4589,Later
4590,"It's a great game, but it is way too short...
It is 2-3 hours of gameplay, depending on your speed. I really wanted the story to go on, to unfold, and the gameplay to continue, but it didn't sadly.
Aside from that I can totally recommend it."
4591,"Nice adventure game . But reason for all adventure is a bullshit
"
4592,nice game kinda buggy at times
4593,The story is heartwarming and the gameplay is fun although sometimes frustrating but i would recommend it.
4594,Interesting story.
4595,"Join a group and play together
https://s.team/chat/iFZrVCvS
"
4596,"Amazing game. Incredible movement made me feel like I was spiderman chaining the grapples and power jumps together. Game looks amazing with super creative environments, my favorite being sky haven. So fun to keep playing over and over again and getting faster and faster. Only problem is it's too short, I want more. DLC or workshop. If you love momentum based platforms this is a must play."
4597,ok everyone get out of the way i'm zooming now
4598,A surreal journey with some clunky parkour elements. The story isn't anything special unless you overinterpret the hell out of it and the numerous passive characters added to make the world feel more alive quickly change into a pointless background noise and are barely noticeable. All of this combined created a colorful but blank fantasy world which in my case failed to deliver any kind of atmosphere or immersion.
4599,gg
4600,Good free gama
4601,awesome adventure
4602,verry good game
4603,"Nice little game with grapling hook and relaxing soundtracks. Some puzzles and challenges are hard to complete but thats what the challenge is. Dont worry those are optional challenges the main game challenge is not hard its good enough for casual gamers.


actually its also a challenge for me to not say ""challenges"""
4604,"Love what they're trying to do here, but make the game longer tho (entire game can be finished within 2 hours if you don't hunt for collectibles)"
4605,"This game is a fun, 2-3 hour visual ""bed time story"" / grappling hook puzzle game that takes you through amazingly crafted and visually stunning environments with just enough of a narrative to keep you wanting to finish it.

Dont go in expecting the next Skyrim and you wont be disappointed. I dont think its an AMAZING game, but I think it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and for that I gave it a high score."
4606,"Gameplay is fun, (all 2 hours of it) but that's about it. Story is dull and uninteresting, and the forced cutscenes are annoying when you're trying to complete some of the achievement challenges."
4607,gud game buy it
4608,The story is nice
4609,A nice little short platforming game that everyone should try.
4610,"A relaxing platformer with upbeat music. That is until near the end where the difficulty ramps up. The last level will frustrate  more casual players. The story is short but sweet. Most players will beat this game quickly. Their are speed-run achievements and collectables to find for those who want extra challenge.

Overall this is a good game. I'd give it a 8/10."
4611,an enjoyable few hours
4612,"Absolutely Incredible!
The ending almost made me cry; well done!"
4613,"7/10

Fun speed running, platforming first person game. If it reminds you of something, its probably of Leafy. It has a story thats nothing special. It also is kinda short. Afterwards theres certain parts that are challenges. Some different paths and of course the time trials so it has a little bit more to do beyond one playthrough"
4614,"boring... would play again, maybe"
4615,Good because when i got it it was free
4616,Great game
4617,"The jumping feels good.
That's basically it, the only noteworthy thing about this game. The story doesn't suck by any means, but it's instantly forgettable and very, very short. Basically if you feel like playing a short 3D jumping platformer with increasing difficulty - albeit never too hard - this might be the game for you. 

But be warned that there is not much else to it."
4618,:)
4619,Its like mirrors edge without combat set in caves.
4620,"I really liked the game play - jumping and grappling around caves and floating rocks, but it was too short! And, the climax was not what I had hoped for. The game just sort of ended. I wanted more. It's better if you think of this as just solving puzzles - How to get from A to B. I also didn't like that you generally had to die all the time to figure out many of the puzzles."
4621,"Nice, sweet, touching, challenging(it has really challenging challenges...). Waiting for the next part(prequel, or sequel)."
4622,"Optimized , smooth , awesome."
4623,A short not that memorable but OK story!Pretty well made platformer!For a low price it is worth it.Dont give morw than 5 bucks!The game is just a pleasant experience!7/10
4624,"good short story, ads are a bit misleading and the dialogue is atrocious, gameplay is great"
4625,"dont know much about this game, but the story about my uncle is that he is a convicted pedophile"
4626,you saw this game in one of leafys videos now you want to buy it.
4627,"Really beautiful game with a very interesting storyline. I'd recommend waiting for a sale, because the game is a bit too short and to me would not be worth the RRP."
4628,"A Story About My Uncle
Nighthawk's Score: 7/10

A straight forward narrative driven game. Fun physics based 1st person navigation thru a charming world. A calm world that can be a bit treacherous to get thru at a few points, but usually if I walk away for a bit and return the answer is right there in plain sight. Story is lighthearted and a little anti-climatic but still worth the journey."
4629,"No real replayability, voice acting is amateur at best 90% of the time, but it's worth it for the atmosphere and story alone. It's a good one to save for a relaxing afternoon. It's got great visuals, a charming fantasy environment, and some cool grapple mechanics. I wouldn't play it again, at least not for a while, but I recommend playing it once."
4630,"At first I wasn't sure what to expect, considering the price. I was reading reviews and thought to myself, oh wow, this sure is not much auf playtime you get for the money you invest into this game,
but as to my surprise I quickly fell in love with this game, it combines so many elements of gameplay, the music/soundeffect, story, and the physic engine are just greatly made,
Music 8/10
Story 8.5/10
Gameplay 7/10
Graphic 4.75/10
Don't be intimitated by the rating i gave for the graphic elements of this game, the thirll of learning the story, getting through these levels, and the extremely good voice acting are making this game into one of my favorites.
And not to forget the fact that this game is filled with cute little easter eggs.

Overall i really recommend this game to people who like Fantasy-Adventure Games that also have a story containing more than just unrealistic rubbish."
4631,The game play and powers are great. the problem I had with this game is that of the voice acting it's just really annoying to listen to and the main reason I couldn't finish the game
4632,interesting story
4633,A short game but I would assume it's great for speed runners.
4634,¬≠
4635,runs nicely and zero lag ^-^
4636,Short and Sweet grappling hook fun
4637,"I absolutely love this game with all my heart, the characters and story telling is captivating and unique, I really felt a bond with all the characters by the end of the game and was extremely sad it was over. The gameplay aspects are also very well done, with smooth mechanics it almost feels like you're flying and I love the addition of small challenges all over the areas so that there's so much more to do than you think. My only complaint is that it ended too quickly"
4638,"story isn't real, my uncle was sexually harrasing me when I was a child so no..."
4639,"This game is awesome, ive been searching a long time for a game like this."
4640,so relaxing with enough difficulty to be a good mix
4641,I didn't know this game was called this.. i used to see it in leafy's old videos...  IKR a long ass time ago. but very enjoyable and fun
4642,"A story about my uncle is a short but enjoyable single-player experience. The grappling mechanics feel satisfying to use and create a nice feeling of movement. I will say that the character models for the villagers in this game need some serious work though, at best they look devoid of all emotion and at worst are seriously unpleasant to look at. Aside from this and the fairly lacklustre ending, I will say I enjoyed the story mode of the game. 

However, I must warn you about the additional challenges the game has to offer. The game has some extremely bad quality of life issues for anyone wanting to complete the challenges for no falls/ low grapple count/ time trials. One small but frustrating problem with the time trials is not having any sort of restart level button, which means you have to quit to the main menu and reload to restart a time trial attempt. Even worse, is that you can't complete the no falls or low grapple count challenges in time trial mode which means that you have to suffer through unskippable cutscenes every single time you start a new attempt. This becomes extremely frustrating very quickly. 

Having said that, I received this game for free and for the most part I enjoyed playing it, so I'll give it my recommendation if you happen to have it sat in your library or see it on sale."
4643,"A waste of time
just a walking simulator with some jumping around here and there
and shallow story"
4644,Very beautiful game. Wished it ended different though.
4645,"Nice game & good graphics, Recommend."
4646,very good game. i enjoy it
4647,Great game its short with a good difficulty curve.
4648,Its a great game if you buy it on sale
4649,"If you have a couple bucks , 3h of free times and like a platform/jumper game. This is for you. Not a great story by any mean, but very sweet. The platform can get hard by the end for casual players however."
4650,good
4651,"This is a pretty good game. It has great movement mechanics, great characters, beautiful environments, and a pretty interesting story. The only thing i dislike about this game is that it's way too short. As soon as the story started building and getting really interesting, it just ends. I would definitely recommend A Story About My Uncle, but just be aware that it ends quickly, and doesn't offer much content in the long run."
4652,"I'll be honest , i got this game on a discount and it was well worth the 1.50 but i just dont understand why its 10 quid as it wont last longer than 2 hours , it only took me an hour to complete the game"
4653,good
4654,Very good and calming game. Has great fluid motion dynamics and is soo pleasant to play. It is easy so it can be given to smaller kids to play and have a great time.
4655,Got this in a bundle. Thought it was pretty cool till he made a MLP joke...
4656,A Story About My Uncle
4657,An enjoyable 3-4 hour platformer with a fun grapple mechanic and nice storytelling.  I enjoyed the game and would recommend it.
4658,Beautiful game with fun and relaxing gameplay.
4659,Cool and fun
4660,"Great game, very good story"
4661,"Really nice game, pretty cool style of artwork and a good story, worth every penny you pay for it."
4662,A beautiful game with amazing story telling and fun gameplay. Would recommend this to all my friends and others. Also + for Linux support. Thanks for making an amazing game <3
4663,"great game, nice story , grapling hook simulator"
4664,nice
4665,"Pretty nice game, wish I got all the cards though.
"
4666,"Cute little game. It's like Parkour Portal. You have to combine your multiple movement abilities with good timing, fast thinking and a bit of puzzle solving literally on the fly. There is a small story but it isn't worth saying much about, other than that its not bad. 
Fun game to get outside of your typical gaming genres for a little while. One downside I will point out is that later in the game the longer obstacles can set you back quite far for one mistake, and all a mistake means is a  small misclick. This can be frustrating but overall I enjoyed my time with the game."
4667,"itsa gewd game
"
4668,I would smash :]
4669,Eƒülenceli
4670,Bought this game for $2 would not buy it for more than that. It's not worth $13 story is so short and gameplay is so boring.
4671,"A Story About My Uncle is an excellent Platformer, with a heart-felt story.
It is a bit short but the challenges will prove quite difficult. Most I couldn't even do out of frustration.
The way the game teaches you to play is great. For one, they do not treat you like you're a complete idiot. They simply show the controls and expect you to do it your self.

I do recommend this to anyone who likes a ""good"" or ""decent"" Singleplayer game. 
Especially if you are indeed a fan of Platformers."
4672,nice
4673,"""It's not about the destination, it's about the journey""

4674,"Physics based platformers rarely get along with me, and this is no exception. Floaty jumps tied to momentum loss on contact with 'anything', topped off with blind jumping so you can't even call it a puzzle. I have no idea after getting the 'boots' how I was supposed to actually 'do' a good third of the jumps afterwards, as I kept getting lost and ending up standing in places I probably shouldn't have been for a free refresh. I could ace LPB1 and all but a certain space section of LBP2, and those are the definition of both fun and floaty, this lost steam just before Maddie challenged my jumping skills.

Storywise, it felt like a cellophane wrap around an overly long tech demo. Maddie was 'ok', her 'conflict' was rather inconsequential, and I feel very uncomfortable pondering what sites the narrator's daughter frequents considering her questions about the two of you. I did what I could to ignore the narrators fumbles, his delivery felt like someone asked him to read the script out loud, then left after recording the rough read, before a first take.

I'd overall call this a 'meh' experience, with no plans to replay it. The first cave was pleasant enough, and I even lingered around and looked at much of the makeshift village just for the sake of itself. The dark section was a bit bare, but the story wasn't entirely out of steam, so right up to stumbling past the 'beast' I held some hopes. Outdoors, as pretty as the view was, the resolutions on textures were now outright making gauging distance and what's jumpable outright guesswork. Everything effectively became a slog, I did Maddie's challenge just to spite her, and the boots kept me awake by breaking jumps that I otherwise couldn't physically do legitimately. The less said about the ice cave hiding grappleable surfaces and expecting me to chain 5-10+ jumps, often bootless, the better."
4675,It'sna very relaxing game.
4676,"Game's very bad. Far from being casual. It's not intuitive. In some certain points the game decides at which distance your glove will work, if it works at a distance 10m, for instance, it won't work the same way in some spots, game just decide it's now 7m, totally arbitraty."
4677,very beatuiful and artistic game 8/10
4678,"A fun time but very short. Wouldn't pay for it at current retail.
Wait for sale around $5."
4679,"decent game but it is very short 
story could have been better but still lovely
i got it for free but i suggest you to buy it at a discount"
4680,"IDK how i got this btw i just remember seeing it in my games library.

First off should you play this? YES.
Second was it worth the time? If you don't mind solo story based games then yes.
Third bugs? there is very few bugs i came across the only one which was seriously annoying was where a part of the geometry was visually there but there was no collision so i just died however none of the other glitches where negative they where more things giving more acceleration.

This game is short and sweet and after half way the collectables get hidden way better.
The story is great however if you get lost it will be DEAD silent other then footsteps and soft music (happened once at the very end for me)
The physics is done well but sometimes hard to judge if not using all mechanics.
This game is a little bit short though."
4681,Nice little Jump 'n Run game
4682,"Story        - 10/10
Gameplay - 10/10
Controls    - 10/10
Graphics    - 10/10 (The graphics isnt that realistic but its blends with the game)"
4683,Love the story it was a good game for what it is but would only buy on sale as its a short story
4684,I never even heard of this game before.  How the the f*** did it end up in my library?
4685,"Short, but lovely and chill game. 

Even if the movement/free-running felt a little bit wonky at times, it didn't make the game any worse. Even playing it under 3 hours, you already started to develop feelings towards the characters, which made it have some touching moments.

All in all a great experience."
4686,A Story about my Uncle
4687,This was an outstanding game. Very creative and clever platform puzzles. Highly recommended
4688,"Very short game , very touching story ...... And i freaking miss Maddie and Uncle Fred ;("
4689,I just love this game. It's short sweet and easy. But what makes it special is the world it throws you in. I could see a movie made from this. Just try it
4690,"A simple puzzle story telling game, which executed out like portal 1, it's pace kind of slowly after few minute of game play, still core element of parkour and jumping drag worth for some easy enjoyable time for casual player."
4691,"In a time of negativity, and just stress, playing this really enlightened me for a while. Very different to what I usually play, the story really just hit me even though it's just so stupid but actually makes sense. Like the human rubbish being used, the idea of adventure, etc. I love it :)"
4692,Good time killer
4693,i picked up this game from the steam marked when it was free and i really enjoyed it the story was really nice and a bit sad and the mechanics are really nice even tho i dont really like jump and run games i was stunned by it the graphics arent bad too and there are also gamemodes where u can speed run certain parts of the story
4694,Amazing story and super relaxing to play.
4695,"the grappling hook mechanic is really uncomfortable to use (compared to the grappling hook mechanic that i know from Just Cause3). Often made me (want to) rage quit. Rest of the game is quite nice, but the grappling hook as the USP and main game mechanic isn't woking out for me"
4696,"For 12 dollars, I have to say it's worth. It has some challenging points. It's a nice short linear story, but the game is more about the mechanics. 

There is very little bad about the game. The npcs seem to be a little buggy (Fred's head twitch) and Their voices are questionable sometimes. That's it though. 

I'm glad I got it on sale, but if I didn't I would still be satisfied."
4697,"Short, cool and enjoyable adventure/jumping game.

If it was longer, it would be repetitive and less interesting.
Story is pretty easy to complete, but you can always try to collect time medals from the maps if you need more challenge.
Plus the achievements require more than 5 hours of gameplay...  except if you're insanely good.

The game looks ok... Some things look like they were made just because gamemakers had to put some kind of content there. It's definitely not the prettiest graphics I have seen, but totally bearable.

I bought this like 2-4 years ago (can't remember), finished it back then and just came back to kill some time. It's good for that :)"
4698,Beautiful graphics and locations
4699,"Just endless platform jumping with shitty story, very babyish, something I'd expect to be branded Leapfrog. 

Also stuck, there seems to be no way forward, without consulting the internet I can go fuck myself, I'm not a fan of having the internet play the game with me filling in when it needs the page clicked on.

Got it for free, probably see why."
4700,The game is just great the story is great the gameplay and so on. I liket it really mutch.
4701,Truely a masterpiece
4702,FLYYYYYYYYY
4703,"Honestly one of my top favorite games and I don't like puzzle games all that much (Aside from portal.. and portal 2.. and portal stories). A Story About My Uncle takes an ability similar to Spider-Man's webs and makes it really interesting, along with a super jump and super leap ability to help you get around obstacles. The story line is actually really intertwined into the game, bu isn't important to completing the game which I think makes it really well structured. I 10/10 recommend this if you have a lot of time to spend on puzzles and things like that. I would say that it's a little tricky once you've turned around a lot which way to go forward, but that's just me."
4704,Short platformer
4705,One of the best games I've played. The story was great and the mechanics of the game were awesome. 10/10 would like to see a continuation to this.
4706,Leafy is here
4707,"[i]A pretty solid movement/parkour system wrapped in a stylish world, a paper-thin story with a moderately weighted price tag[i/]

This game is primarily focuses on fluid movement mechanics with loose story holding it together. Functionally, the game works very well and the movement can become quite fluid with practice of the controls. Sometimes I felt a tether target was in range, but the game would say it wasn't. I can't for sure say that this simply wasn't a failing on my own perception, but I felt this in a few different places. Additionally, anything that isn't completely flat ground is a bit hit and miss. If you land badly on one of these non-surfaces, you'll either bounce off or somehow stand upon it, allowing for a few sneaky recharge points. Occasionally I did get stuck in gaps or slopes, but I was always able to get out somehow.

The world looks really nice, except when character models are on screen. They are of poor quality when viewed adjacent to the rest of the world. The world is brought to life with some nice sounds and above average voice acting.

With all that said, you are paying for not quite 2 hours of jumping from platform to platform and tethering to floating rocks. That's about 90% of the game. There are a couple of more creative sections that add a little twist, but they are short lived. There is the addition of Completionist challenges and time-trials for the 'pro gamers', but the latter aren't my thing and the former I just wasn't inspired to complete.

It's tough to recommend this game to a general consumer at its current price. You'll get additional value out of it if you like competing for best times and maybe if you like Counter-Strike Surf maps. I would recommend that you should definitely get this game, but maybe on sale. (currently $18.50 AUD at time of writing)"
4708,Chill game.
4709,"Such a wonderful game and immersive environment, recommended for playing this at night all alone in your room and all lights are turned off, the soundtrack is really good also, the game just has 1 problem, it ends. The story is really good and I was shocked knowing that I was at the end already, just wished that the campaign is much longer or have creators make different maps and levels for other players to enjoy."
4710,"A fun game, I thing it's worth money"
4711,"very nice and beautiful game - don't think much, just enjoy."
4712,Great game. Recommended. It reminds me of my Uncle.

This game only takes around 3 hours to complete but after that it is quite nice to play when you are just chilling out. It has a nice storyline and some relaxing music. Plus its fun to find new ways to complete each section/level.

I won this game in a competition but would have happily spent the money for this game. 9/10"
4715,"Beautiful graphics, awesome music, and a great storyline!
This game is highly recommended!"
4716,"A good game With....
Nice Story..
Good graphic 
Short indie game
puzzle 
good Adventure"
4717,Wonderfull game
4718,"This was a fun short and sweet game, I was planning on buying this but one day steam just gave it to me for free (thx steam) and it's fun for what it is I just don't like that price tag. It's a little bit too much if your asking me."
4719,"play this amazing game, you can run this little big game in a simple computer, so don't be scared of trying in your intel core duo or something else. 9.5/10"
4720,"I tried this game. The movement was at first very fun and unique. Unfortunately it never ended up feeling fluid. Movement always had a bit of clumsiness to it. Also I frequently found myself getting stuck in or amidst rocks. 

This would likely be forgivable if the levels were shorter. However same of these levels are an hour long. The worst one was composed of a vast outdoor space with floating rocks. There was so little to see and do aside from the next challenging jump/grapple, it was quite the drag. Further, the movement challenge itself seemed to repeat itself: another windmill grapple. Another long jump with a couple grapples. 

At a certain point two hours in, I just stopped. It's a shame. The story is charming."
4721,TATS A VERY FKING GOOD GAME 10/10
4722,"Decent enough game. Had a reasonably fun time with it. I don't think it's worth 18.50 AUD, but with a good enough discount it is a recommend.

Pros:
- Great mechanics
- Decent emotional story
- Generally nice graphics

Cons:
- Not much logic to the story, and it doesn't really answer any questions
- The fish people just look bizarre
- Sometimes you can glitch through rocks and surfaces, Happens rarely though
- Dialogue isn't perfect, noticeable errors in English grammar

4723,"this some good shit, thank you fren for giving me this."
4724,yes
4725,good game
4726,nice little puzzle game
4727,game sucks
4728,"Very beautyful design, intresting story. Sometimes VERY frustrating ... but the hell started when i wanted to collect steam achievements ... frustration level Dark Souls... Try, fail, repeat.
Sadly regular price is too high. For a 5yrs old adventure game it's still high. Wait for serious discount."
4729,Pathfinder main
4730,"Lots of fun in an occasionally rough package.

First off, I got this game as a giveaway on either greenman or humble. Regardless I want to say that I was growing tired of the puzzle platform genre, but this game brought some new life to it. If you've played Valley, you have experienced one of the better forms of kinetic platforming in a first person 3D space. I still have yet to get all the way through that one, but I think this game nailed what I wanted from the scope of that pitch.

You play through a series of environments that get progressively more difficult to use your tools in, yet you get more tools as you go. At one point you lose a tool, and the game provides you with a chance to dial back your approach to success, but then ramps it up quite a bit after that. Paying attention to the game mechanics really helps here, because I was losing my mind over how I always couldn't recharge my grapple beam mid grapple when I was out of charge on my grapple beam, but you need to shoot a grapple beam at a recharge point in order to recharge, so DUH I needed to recharge before I ran out. Smart mechanic. Requires you to stay logical while swinging and flying through a really fun playground. Of course once I figured that out, 

There are some QC janks that you would expect from a small team. Bump mapping when you're exploring an area of where they didn't program you to be will find you clipping or falling through objects. Which is an issue because there are hidden areas to find for achievements, but its forgivable because checkpoints are aplenty and it doesn't take any time at all to load back into those.

Ultimately it's a short and sweet game that doesn't outstay its welcome and gives you a lot of fun while you're with it. I am at about 3.5hrs of playtime, and will likely load it up for another 3.5 just to mess with the challenges. I will say it's better off as a sale game in my opinion, but I guess that's up to you. I enjoyed it and would have gladly paid $5-8 for it if I didn't catch it on another site for free."
4731,very nice game. sadly it's short. but enjoyable.
4732,"It was fun for 45 mins.
The worst part about this game is the blue alien Maddie. She has the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a videogame. I'd rather listen to earrape for 20 hours than listen to her complaining."
4733,"A short charming game with mechanics that'll have you jumping and grappling to get through areas. I received it for free, but on sale it is ¬£2, and I think it's fully worth that. Fun little indie game to add to your collection."
4734,"Would appeal to casual gamers who enjoy following a set story line. Nice story, good detail and some interesting ( but not overly challenging) puzzles."
4735,love it
4736,The best game I've ever played. It's just wonderful!
4737,its good
4738,"A unique on the rails but still fun adventure game.  Frustrating in parts due to the required timing, it always felt satisfying to get through a particular challenge.  On the whole, a relaxing game to play and worth the time to complete it.  The story is light with a lot of depth remaining unexplored.  Perhaps Uncle 2 will come out someday to fill in the details."
4739,"It has been a long time sense I found a platformer that I enjoyed this much. With its amazingly fluid controls this game will make you feel as if you can go anywhere and do anything, because you can. Unlike most games there are very few deathwalls and weird hitboxes on far away objects. If you see any structure or island you want to visit you can, it may not be easy, and it may feel worthless but for all purposes, you can get there (and you may actually find a little thing hidden by the devs while your at it).  And I can't leave out the fact that the graphics are stunning, though they aren't the most realistic I frequently found myself staring off into the distance just soaking in the beautiful world. There is only one main complaint I have about the game, and that is the story. This is mainly just my opinion but i feel like the game would be more enjoyable without the story, because though it is a good story, it feels off to go from grappling around the world without limitations to sitting through a 10 minuet story section. Other than that I have nothing else to say. If this is your kind of game give it a shot, but if you are on the fence maybe wait for a sale, because 10 bucks is a little much in my opinion but it isn't as bad as some other games."
4740,"In sports such as pool and snooker, the players need to hit a smooth surface ball with the tip of a stick. If you have ever played any of these games you'll know that you have to chalk the end of the cue quite frequently because if you don't then you will quickly notice that although you may be doing everything correctly the ball doesn't go where you want and the game becomes more and more frustrating as you fight against a poorly maintained cue. This game is the same, it's like playing snooker without a chalked cue and upping the stakes by sometimes asking you to hit the ball while blindfolded. Allow me to elaborate.

Platformers, of any kind, depend upon tight controls and good level design. If you have good level design but sloppy controls, the game is frustrating. If you have tight control but poor level design then it becomes boring.  It is fair to say that making a good platformer is actually quite difficult since you need a blend of both clever mechanics and great design. There are a number of serious design errors that experienced developers know to avoid when it comes to platformer level design, these are things like blind jumps, excessive recycling of obstacles and above all - sudden difficulty spikes. Story About My Uncle makes all of these mistakes, starting with very repetitive obstacles and progressing into blind jumps. Difficulty spikes are all over the place, one minute you're hopping along without issue and then suddenly you grind to a halt because the margins for error on the next jump are very narrow. Further to this, the waypoints for sections seem frequent and then suddenly you're faced with a bottomless chasm, disabled rocketboots, no grappling hook points and a waypoint that means that even one slip sends you back a few minutes to repeat jumps that were frustrating the first time around. Which brings me to my next point - controls.

Initially, the controls seem suited quite well to the level design. But when you reach the ice caverns you suddenly need to have pin-point accuracy to land the grappling hook. So you jump and hope that your momentum brings you within range of the grappling point. So you aim the crosshair, hoping that it lights up as your momentum slows and you begin to fall into the abyyss. if you misjudged the jump, you try again... and again... and again until you find the velocity needed to reach the grapple point. In earlier levels this isn't so much of an issue since you can grab onto anything, but now you need to be within reach of a very specific spot. This can be frustrating and compounded further by blind jumps where you swing to one point, but won't see the next until you're already starting to fall from the first swing meaning that you will have to fail multiple times before you know where you need to be going next. Further to this, the rocketboots use the same jump key as the normal jump... but if you're standing on an uneven surface like a piece of scenery the game thinks you are in the air, so suddenly you're speeding forwards over the edge of a platform you were just standing on and all you wanted to do is hop down from a bit of window dressing you happened to land on.

Then there is the 'story' which given the title you'd think would have more effort put into it. However, it is so dull that frankly it doesn't contribute anything to the game whatsoever. Since you are apparently hearing a bedtime story being read to a child i can understand why it is so shallow and simple but the target audience is not 8yr olds. 

Frankly, I found the game so aggressively tedious and frustrating at times that I just sat there for a moment and asked myself what on earth I thought I was doing trying to persist with this mess? Avoid this like the plague even if you happen to enjoy platformers."
4741,This game is about jumping but has really really bad controls.
4742,This game is refreshing for its storytelling and simple yet challenging gameplay. It would be even more fun in VR.
4743,Great graphics with interesting parkour style puzzles and a delightful wee story
4744,its pretty :)
4745,"Indepth story super fun. (Still playing) would recomend because of the story alone but game mechanics are very fun and take a bit of time to learn making them feel rewarding after you mastered them. Last word, Fred. 8/10 water skiing squirrels"
4746,The Story is amazing and kept me wanting to know more. To bad It wasn't about his granny... AMAZING GAME - AMAZING LANDSCAPE - JUST TRY IT (However I did get it for free I wouldn't have bought it)
4747,"This game has a fun gaming experiences, but this gaming experiences familiar to the Portal 2 game. But this is more fun and more bigger map for you to explore and enjoy the atmosphere he brought for you. 
I recommend this cheap game for the people who wants to buy games."
4748,"This game is so absolutely beautiful and heartwarming.  It is just such a good game! It's an FPS where the ""shooter"" is only your grappling hook so that you can swing around in the beautiful environments.  It is a fairly short game, but well worth a play through for the great ending.  I'm not ashamed to say it brought a couple tears to me. I loved this game, so much.  We need more like it."
4749,"Short and sweet. I got the game for free and it was well worth it. Finished it in 2 hours, I don't see myself playing it ever again, but I'm glad I did play it.
I liked it, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
4750,"Interesting story, good premise. worth a play."
4751,"SImple and nice game.
"
4752,Good one!
4753,"Worth playing for the gameplay alone, everything else was mediocre though. But the gameplay really carries this game and with it only being 2-3 hours long, I can very much recommend it!"
4754,"[h1] Short and Bland	[/h1]

[u] Introduction	[/u]
A story about my uncle is a first person platformer game about a story told by a dad to his daughter in order to help her go to bed. Just as the title suggest, it is a story about his uncle. Within the story, we relive the dad's experience as a boy trying to find his uncle who has mysteriously disappeared...

[u] My Opinion	[/u]
The story about my uncle is really short, with a total of five levels and the average content playtime of about 2 hours. The voice acting is really amateurish, especially from the Dad who is the main source of narration. He sound really monotonous and boring, just like the game itself. 

Visually speaking, out of the five levels; only one looks visually pleasing. The other four levels are basically just caves and caverns. The gameplay loop is also pretty dull, there are only 2 action; jumping and using the adventure suit's glove to sling across various platforms. It get really repetitive after the first 2 levels or so. The first person camera is also placed at an extremely low level, almost to the point of touching the ground. I understand you are playing as a young boy but I do not think any boy would be the height of 2 steps of stairs which you can use to compare at the first level of the game.

The story is also pretty dumb, [spoiler] you traverse all the way to find your uncle just to find him at the end for him to tell you he created the frog people and would prefer to stay put in this strange world. He sent you back home after that. Such a very unsatisfying story conclusion.	[/spoiler]

[u] Conclusion	[/u]
I do not think A story about my uncle is worth buying at full price due to the extremely short gameplay content, dumb story and boring gameplay loop. Even if placed at a sale, I would caution against buying unless you do not mind short-length repetitive games. I would give this game a 2/10."
4755,Nice game.
4756,"To be honest, this is a great game, or should I say adventure... Good graphics and great storytelling. I'm definitely recomending this game for one or two long winter evenings. It's story is great, to the point when you feel like you're listening to one of he stories that mom used to tell you when you were little. Maybe it's not the longest game, but that was the best four hours I had in a long time! And for those, who like challanges, there is a lot of achievements o complete. Ones about amount of grapples and ones about completion time. For those, who like to wonder around, in every stage are hidden machines, to be exact five of them, to find"
4757,"this game had a lot of potential, however its quite small and doesnt have workshop maps, on allah/god/budha / whatever fucking god you believe in workshop wouldve saved this game, so if the developers ever come back and add this that would be cool."
4758,this gasme is really fun only if they could make a second since i finesh it quite quickly
4759,"Good game, nice way to tell a story. Lovable characters and decent enough graphics.
Very nice. The only bad thing i can think of is that it's very short. (roughly 2 hours long)"
4760,"The graphics of the game are not good for today standards, lets say I only liked 3-4 screen shot of the whole game, that means the whole pleasure of this game maybe experienced by going to an art site and watch 3-4 really good enviromental picture."
4761,"Fun platforming, only rage quit once 6/11"
4762,"GREAT GAME
"
4763,Nice atmospheric game that you can easualy dream of in. would recommend this to everybody who loves a short adventure game.
4764,"The price on this game is very reasonable. It's not the longest game in the world, in fact it was over before I knew it; but it is in many ways reminiscent of Portal and The Talos Principle.

That said, if you hate games like that, then I don't recommend this one. There's a lot of jumping and grappling and rocket-booting around, and some of the executions can be absolutely mind melting, even when you can plainly see what you need to do. But if you're into that sorta thing, then go crazy. I enjoyed it, and would like it very much if there was ever a sequel."
4765,Ahhhhh this game was amazing! Loved the gameplay and the story. Super unique and entertaining. I miss games like this one.
4766,good 2h long game
4767,"This game is great overall, but I felt that it was a bit too short (could just be me though). I would recommend this for anyone looking for a grappling style platformer with a nice story. 9/10"
4768,Hey it's the game you see on 2016 commentary channels!
4769,YES
4770,"A Story About My Uncle - or ASAMU for short - is a stunningly beautiful game with a very satisfying concept and style. The mechanics are probably the most important feature in any game and ASAMU's mechanics are perfect as they're very intuitive and aren't complicated to use. The story-line is also amazing and easy to follow with no complicated or hard to understand parts. The graphics are also stunning as they change to adapt to their environment which is a small detail but still contributes to the experience.

Overall, A Story About My Uncle is an amazing, fun and entertaining game."
4771,"I really like the challenge , but it was kinda short? It took me a day to finish.. I bought this yesterday, it's interesting and i loved it . I recommend this! the only thing was that it was too short."
4772,"This is enjoyable the moment the narrator starts speaking. A tale about a crazy journey to follow uncle Fred. That guy is a bit of a scientist!

It's a narrative focused game. Learning about Fred and following the main character on their journey was enjoyable. We're not breaking new ground with twists and turns here, it's a simple story. You enjoy it mostly from the narrator's point of view, the main character. But also get some outside perspective as he tells the story.

The mechanics are good most of the time. There are a few instances where it can be frustrating if you're stuck. What happens is that you'll misjudge the momentum and slam your head into a rock. Then you wait as you plummet to your death and have to start over. The fall is the problem, I wish the game restarted quicker. You'll almost never be able to actually save a fall. At least the checkpoints are close. And this is nitpicking because the game is so short it doesn't matter.

Overall, A Story About My Uncle is good, and I liked it. I can't believe this came out in 2014 and I missed it. This game has held up incredibly well. It's a nice short experience that I highly recommend."
4773,"This game is just so beautiful even though the jumping mechanic is a little bit awkward for me when have to use right mouse to jump but i will get used to it. Great relaxing game, great price on sale (2.59$) worth a try."
4774,"crazy good atmosphere, tight controls and quality story 10/10 glad to pay 3 dollars for 6 hrs of fun"
4775,"Great game, but very short. It took not even 2 hours to finish it. Still absolutely worth it though (when it's on sale)!"
4776,leafy game no because leafy stink head
4777,"[quote]
Grade = B. Worth a buy, for who enjoy grappling hook time attack & exploration. However, for who want charming & smart characters, don't buy it

4778,Its a sort but fun sory line. If you ever wanted to play a game fully out. This game is a great start.
4779,"A Story About My Uncle was nice chill game. 

Gameplay is not too difficult - story is fairly short - graphics look pleasing. Achievements are not too difficult to get either. I actually had a lot of fun hunting the achievements in this game. Good job!

4780,"It's sometimes frustrating, but most of the time its just beautiful and fun game to enjoy. :)

4784,"A fun platformer. 
I occasionally switched to mouse/keyboard because the controller wasn't quick enough for looking around while flying through the air.
Noticed a typo in one of the wall writings, but no real bugs of note.
Nice, diversionary, palate-cleanser game lasting less than 10 hours. Glad I got it."
4785,"It's a pretty short campaign, glad I got it on sale. Not my style. Good if you like speed running. Graphics are 2014 graphics. Story is boring. Gameplay is kinda awesome though. The visuals aren't bad. Achievements give decent replayability. Recommended if on sale."
4786,"this game is really good gameplay-wise and story-wise
it`s really short and you can probably complete it in less than 3 hours
still worth the price, I had a great time playing it"
4787,Awesome :)
4788,"Never thought i would be so eddicted to a platformer,decent story,nothing crazy tho which is OK,qunique mechanics within the game and even more quinq stages through out the game that keep you interested 24/7,on top of it beeing playable on any machine really.It has everything,but it.

(it is only for 2,59 just buy it you wont regret it)"
4789,Did I literally cry at the end?
4790,"I finished the game and unlocked all achievement, so I have several playthroughs of each level :) 

This game is very, very nice. It's a simple platformer, where all do is pretty much jump and swing through the stages, while the story progresses. I get the feel of a mix between the surf maps from cs 1.6 and Portal, because the stages are kinda like puzzles, but you can still swing and fly around freely and make your own solutions. 

This, along with the music, atmosphere and level design is what makes the game great. My only complain who be that is is kinda short, but you can still replay it for challenges if you want to try and beat the stages faster/with fewer grapples.

All in all, this game is excellent. I am giving it 8.5/10 on my personal scale."
4791,"A Story About My Uncle is a very nice take on the First Person Platformer-Adventure genre. I don't want to say it is anything revolutionary, but it is a perfect example what an indie title is, with all pros and cons of an indie game. You can feel that only 18 people made the game - in a good and in a bad way as well. Everything of ASAMU is just ""okay"". The graphics are okay, the voice acting is okay, the story is okay (although it is very very short and a bit anticlimactic), the sounds are okay, the puzzles are okay. Nothing is exceptionally good nor bad. This is why it is so hard to write a review of this game.
Although, for speedrunners, this game is a gem. I can see how dedicated speedrunners will go through this game again and again, finding new and better techniques to finish the game under 60/30/15 minutes. The limit is the sky. For casual gamers it is a nice a relaxing experience, which is fun for one playthrough, but I don't see myself getting back to this game ever again.
If you are interested in the game, buy it when it is on sale, but paying ‚Ç¨13 or $15, i think the price is a bit high.
All in all, i would give it a 6/10, recommended, if you are into First Person Platformers."
4792,Great free flowing first person parkour game. Only a couple of hours long but it's as long as it needs to be.
4793,"Very fun gameplay - but doesn't take long to complete the game. Immersive world - imaginative level design and very forgiving difficulty curve. Nice music. Voice acting decent.

Only downside is the story has good premise but is executed in a rushed way; there are interactions with NPCs that seem so ridiculous in the context of the game due to how flitting and blase they are.

[b] PS to get consistent FPS for those of you that go 144hz and above you need to edit the  ""MaxSmoothedFrameRate"" in ASAMUEngine.ini to go above 120. 	[/b]
"
4794,Honestly one of the most comfortable and relaxing times I have ever had was playing this game. It is a thing of wonder and makes me happy even thinking about it. Great experience and should be a must play for everyone.
4795,"A fun first person platforming game, once you get used to it it's fun to go fast through the levels swinging all over the place.  Fun story and atmosphere."
4796,sequel? / VR version?
4797,"I got this for free, so bear that in mind. 

This is a charming little FP adventure game. Reminds me of a mix of Portal, Mirrors Edge and a dash of Dishonored. 
Its purely story based, so no fighting mechanics, just physic based puzzles. 
My only criticisms are:
Not always easy to judge the distances to use your grapple. 
Ice level can be tricky to see where to attach to.
Having the protaganist nameless makes some of the dialogue a bit awkward.
Short and ends a bit abruptly.

Despite these, I would recommend this, but suggest waiting for a sale if your unsure."
4798,There is a problem saving the game
4799,"It's a story... about your uncle...

Pretty good bed time story 10/10
Also you can finish the game under 2 hours if you'd like"
4800,"Amazing game.

4801,"This is a short adventure/puzzle game about a man who is looking for his uncle in an unknown world. The gameplay is pretty simple and fun, however, it can be a little irritating at times when your grappling hook doesn't attach to an object you think is close enough. I really enjoyed the ice level due to the amount of movement you were able to do without stopping, I wish more of the game was like that.

The story is okay, the ending is touching and sweet. The graphics look pretty nice. I ran everything on the highest settings and didn't have any issues. The music is very relaxing and contributes nicely to the game.

This game has trading cards. I managed to beat it in just over 1.5 hours, obtaining 0 achievements in the process. I wouldn't buy this for more than $5."
4802,get it my dudes
4803,Beautiful story. That's simply what it is. A beautiful story about adventuring.
4804,"A relatively short but surprising game. In the 3 hours that it required me to complete it, the game managed to immerse me better than some games I have played for hundreds of hours did. If you are thinking on buying this masterpiece - do it. I promise you that you will not regret it.

The game offers a unique non-combat experience, which is a must to try for every gamer

4806,"the game is good, the story is not that deep, but the gameplay is very nice"
4807,"If you enjoy platformers, this will be great. The graphics are immersive and the gameplay is a combination of dexterity and puzzle solving (which an emphasis on the former, as you'd expect). A big draw for me was the lack of violence, which means I can share it with even my youngest."
4808,This Game is so interesting and fun to play.
4809,THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!!!!! DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!!!!!!!! OR DIE!!!!!!!!!
4810,"Got the game in some promotion - but boy, was I not expecting it to be this cool and strange at the same time! 

I highly recommend it! The game is story driven - in my interpretation the game is about a little boy learning how to live with the death of his Uncle. With this deeper meaning it is an enjoyable experience for adults, all the while it is a perfectly fine game for children. 

The platforming is a bit easy to my taste, however sometimes there are opportunities to chose between an easy and a hard approach. This means that the player can either enjoy the story or seek some challenge with going on the harder routes. 

I have not experienced any real bugs (only some slight stuttering at some places because of walking into objects) or some small issues of going through some textures. But nothing major. 

I highly recommend it for casual gamers since you can more or less complete it in one sitting, in lass than 3 hours. It is a rather enjoyable experience."
4811,Wishing the story about my uncle hadn't been so traumatizing
4812,Very nice game BRAVO. Thanks.
4813,"Decent. Cute story. Short. But get it on sale due to the shortness of it.

For those with higher hz monitors like me, you can unlock that 60fps cap in an ini file and fully enjoy this game in super fluid motion (which makes flying about even more rewarding)."
4814,"This game was really fun, beautiful and the story was great! The parkour is difficult, but you can find other ways around it. I have written a fuller review here https://jaxscorner.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/a-story-about-my-uncle/"
4815,"Quick singleplayer story that passes time, good details and story to it"
4816,Would recommend this game however I did finish the game in an hour and a bit so would not pay full price for it. However if you like easy 3d platformers with a story this game is for you.
4817,"3/5

While the grapple mechanic works really good, almost everything else is either okay to bad. Music and voice acting are subpar. It's story isn't my cup of coffee. Every stage is a variation of the past stages. It's really short, although I shouldn't complain as I received this game for free. I'd be pissed if I bought this."
4818,"[code]
To me, it's one of the most original platformers I've ever played.

Pros:

+ A nice story where you are looking for your uncle
+ Nice graphics
+ Great originality
+ Interesting environment

Cons:

- The game is pretty short
- Sometimes grappling doesn't work

Rating: 8.5/10

4819,"A short but very good story driven game. 
The puzzles aren't too too hard but a few are tricky
I may have gotten this game for free but this is not a factor in my overall rating of this game.
The voice acting is good and the story is heart warming. The only con I see is a bit of an anti-climactic ending
over all 9/10"
4820,"Nice story, short, you can beat it in 2 hours"
4821,"A Story about my Uncle is an inoffensive casual 3D platformer.

You start off being able to run, jump, do high jumps, and long jumps.  Along the way you'll pick up a grapple beam which allows you to swing around but only once before needing to land so it can recharge.  Eventually you'll find another charge so you can do two swings, then a third so you can use it three times before landing.  There're two other mechanics that occur later on, but this is most of it.

For a game called ""A Story about my Uncle"", there really isn't much of a story.  In fact, pretty much nothing is explained.  Where the heck did you go, how'd you survive getting there, how'd your uncle build that thing and why, why'd your uncle build you the suit, how long has he been there, etc?  The ending is short and makes the game pretty much pointless.  There's no reason to really care about anyone as none of the very few characters in the game are expanded upon in any meaningful way.

A major issue with the game is that it's incredibly simple.  The vast majority of the game is simply, 1.  Look around for where you're supposed to go.  2.  See nearby platforms you can jump to or objects with sigils on them (which indicated Fred used them to fling around).  3. Jump onto nearby platform or fling on objects Fred flung on and land on ending platform.  Then repeat steps 1-3.... for pretty much the entire game.  Despite seeming like it could be a free form platformer, the game is very much linear.  There's no real alternate paths to get from point A to point B.  Just follow the set path over and over and over and over.  It's almost as though they were afraid to take any risks to provide the player any real sort of challenge.  Due to this, the game is only 2 - 3 hours long.

Another problem is that the grapple mechanic is inconsistent.  Sometimes you'll be able to latch on to things from a mile away.  Other times you'll be much closer to an object yet be unable to latch onto it because.... reasons.

A Story about my Uncle is ok and I didn't dislike it, but these are really the best things I can say about it.  If your game that is almost entirely about platforming doesn't bother to challenge the player with its' platforming segments, then what's the point?

Space... the final frontier.  These are the voyages of Uncle Fred.  His continuing mission, to abandon his family.  To seek out frog people and live with them for some reason.  To boldly bang a frog chick..... presumably."
4822,i watch leafyishere
4823,"it was fun but i wish you could make more story maps and if the players could make their own storys and play co-op.
i finished the story in 3.3 hrs 
10/10
would play some more."
4824,Not worth the time and incredibly boring
4825,The gameplay is smooth and the graphics are beautiful. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a short story driven game.
4826,"Just finished this game and oh my, it is beautiful, the story even not deep, touches your heart, I forgot that I was playing the game on my laptop and was lost in the world of floating islands, also the music is on point and the ending sure gave me chills down my spine.
Beautiful, trust me, buy this and play it, some levels might be difficult but see there is where the game becomes challenging and fun."
4827,"I don't know,,,, I think it's not worth the price, this game should've been free or should cost around 5cents to 2dollars because you literally do nothing but the same repetitive jumping and grabbing to stones which doesn't make any sense. Also terrible controls, you'll end up getting frustrated with the game mechanics, it's hard to grab and it seems like the player has it's own world and very very very dumb controls. TOTALLY WON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME."
4828,"Considering the budget, Gone North Games made a great job. As an indie game i like it.

But overall, it's a decent game.

Grapling mechanics are ideally good, practically terrible.

Story is good. Storytelling is better.

Graphics are not bad.

A good adventure you can dig into for 3 hours.

7/10."
4829,if you want to pass time or get insanely frustrated by the history and all the effort you put to reach the end of the game ... oh sorry for the spoiler ... ehh i say.... it's a great game
4830,???
4831,"The mechanics are very fun and easy to get the hang of, although some places can be quite challenging and might need a few tries to pass. The whole setting is beautiful, it's just such a shame this game is so short, it's over before you know it."
4832,i just liked it
4833,"A Story About My Uncle is a short,but charming game that I really enjoyed. Although it's definitely not perfect it still nails what it does right. First off the game is definitely not beautiful. Although I don‚Äôt care about graphics too much and this games graphics are acceptable, it will not be blowing you away. The character models of the human-like amphibians have an interesting design, but are very poorly done. Many of the environments were pleasant and passable, but nothing feels grand, except for my soon to be mentioned favorite level. My favorite level is definitely the outside, open air level, that has greater sense of freedom and scale then its cave-like counterparts. The game was never too frustrating or difficult, accept for the Maddie‚Äôs Challenge, which I had a lot of difficulty with for some reason. Many of the achievements were time trial/perfect run achievements so I really didn‚Äôt go after those. The game includes collectables with game changing rewards. I only collected enough of the collectibles to be able to change the color of my beam, but the other abilities seemed much more rewarding. I feel that for some there is great replayability here, with the inclusion of collectibles and time trials. This isn‚Äôt to say the gameplay was boring, because it was actually a lot of fun. It revolves around you swinging around using ‚ÄúSpider-Man Web‚Äù like beams to maneuver through levels. Throughout the game you are able to increase the amount of beams you have and equip a rocket boost. These changes are nice, but don‚Äôt change the game up too drastically. These mechanics don‚Äôt overstay their welcome through the roughly 4 hour campaign. The only downside to the gameplay was the often glitchy map, and the inability to change directions when long jumping. The story was sweet, and served the story well. It tells the story of the narrator's uncle, Fred. He has discovered these caves, that he uses to house the new species he has created. You play as a 10 year old boy, who goes to search for your uncle. Along the way you meet his creations, an amphibian like species that resides in the caves. They are split into two factions. There are a group of them that worship the crystals in the caves and do not harness their power. The other group has left the village and has been able to control the power of the crystals, creating beautiful floating villages. Along your journey you meet Madeline, who joins you on your search for Fred. She was close to Fred before he disappeared. The story never gets too deep, but it is still very charming and sweet, as it is told like a story by the narrator to his daughter. Plus I love when you have a companion in single player games. Overall this is a solid game with a good story and fresh gameplay mechanics. The games looks a little outdated, and a little glitchy, but it never hinders the experiences for me personally. 6.5/10."
4834,When i tell a story about my uncle it ends in prison and not having a grappling hook. 8/10 better than my own story about my own uncle

Ratings by Category:

Story: 8/10 Pretty tame and fits with the game

Sounds: 8/10 Doesn't ever get in the way and is very relaxing.

Control: 9.5/10 Feels great but the super jump can be inconsistent at times.

Scenery: 7/10 I love how some of the areas are themed but the models are very low resolution which is unfortunate 

Originality: 9/10 Doesn‚Äôt copy many things from other games

Value for Content: 7.5/10  2-15 Hours of gameplay. One can stop after completing a first run but going back to hunt for achievements is made fun in this game. It's best to wait for a sale though.

Bonuses: Achievements, Trading Cards

Overall Score: 8.5/10 Really memorable game that I think everyone can appreciate"

4837,I enjoyed this 3D platformer. The story is more for kids. But I did enjoy the gameplay.
4838,"Great game! Wish it was longer and maybe even got harder towards the end. I‚Äôm not normally very good at games, but I beat it in 6 hours while taking my time with the story. The story was deep and heartfelt, but could have been extended, as it left out on a abrupt ending. Still an amazing, unique game."
4839,"Short, bit tiresome, but would not say the game is bad. Its kinda nice, pretty and easy learning."
4840,"This game is very short and easy, but still fun. I don't like those creepy frog-smurf abomination things though.."
4841,"If you can find a good game that uses grappling hooks, play that instead. This story is really bad, with bad voice acting, and the rooms are stupidly hard - more to do with a bad control system than your skill level. Frustrating with no reward."
4842,even tho its a indie game the mechanincs are good but the story man it had so much potential and the ending just really fucked it up like it just disapoints me but the overall game is pretty good and it runs good but its very short this game i say this prob worth it when theres sales
4843,"i originally got his game free from gamekit. But when i first tried it i thought it was decent, but when i kept playing  i laughed at the frog ppl. But tbh its a really nice game."
4844,A fun adventure game
4845,"Definitely a must-play, but the story felt cut short and left me wanting more. However, after reading a bit into the hidden messages in the game, mainly through the forums/discussions, I have to say that the game's story is pretty deep.

8/10, left me wanting more."
4846,This game was good but then  got to Maddie's challenge and I failed so many times that when I gave up I had given up on the game entirely
4847,"great game although really small!! completed it after 2 hrs so thats a thing. the movement mechanic is awesome and i would love to see it in another full game because this was definitivly a demo. nothing more to say, voice acting is good but since its a retale of the story there isn't allot of reactions, but either way it was a nice thing to expirience. grafics were gorgeously desing even if the engine isnt super mega wow.

i'd buy it on an offer day."
4848,"It's honestly a perfect game. The game itself is extremely entertaining and fun to play. The graphics are beautiful. The story and the voicing of characters is very captivating. There isn't just one way to get from one place to another, you can get as creative as you want, provided that you have stuff to grapple onto. It's honestly just brilliant.

The only thing I'd say is a downside to it is that some of the rocks you need to grapple are positioned a bit weirdly, so when you grapple them, it's difficult to get to the point you are supposed to."
4849,Fun game. but I hate Maddie
4850,amazing
4851,"A Story About My Uncle is a lovely little time-sink.  The story is serviceable but nothing mind-blowing.  The game is just simple relaxing fun.  If I had to nitpick, the character models are nightmare fuel and the voice acting is underwhelming (this game was developed by a German studio so English was probably a second language for all the voice actors so I get it) but this is an indie title and I can't expect the world from a $12 game."
4852,"This was a very interesting game. 

First of all, it's very short. Took me a little under 2 hours.

Very unique and original story. I loved playing this game. 

The characters work very well, at the voice acting is pretty decent.

Game play is fun and keeps it intersting by giving you new upgrades for your suit. 

The scenery is gorgeous and the world is very fun to explore and see how many ways to you can to a certain place.

There's a few collectables that act as kind of a reward for traveling off the beaten path, nothing too hard to find though.

All in all, I loved this game and highly recomend it. Even at the $12 price. (I got it on sale for $2)"
4853,"This is a cool little indie game, definitely recommend playing, especially if you like puzzle games. 

PROS:
- good story
- graphics are nice for what it is
- controls are easy to learn
- grappling hook + rocket boots = feeling like you're an ultimate ninja warrior

Cons:
- minor grappling hook glitch where you sometime pass through objects if grappling an awkward spot, but not game breaking, more of like a little cheat/life saver at times.

Overall 9/10 (:

It suffered a little bit from the ""Perfect timing required"" issue that others avoid, but I did eventually get the hang of it. It played through in about 4 hours, with a few breaks. That felt like just the right length. The story was cute, and added a little to the game, though the puzzles are more of the reason to play it than the story.

4873,"[h1]Overall = 6/10[/h1]

A short adventure which lacks polish and finesse, but is a good time while it lasts.  The gameplay is relatively shallow and repetitive, but has a good level of challenge and a forgiving checkpoint system.  The first person platforming does make for some hair-raising moments, but also gets frustrating as you fail the same bits again and again due to minimal timing or accuracy issues.  The poor implementation of the ""extra gameplay modes"" also adds to the frustration.
The graphics are good but basic.  Some areas are visually great, but too many are dark and very similar.  The story is very simple and a bit lacking to be honest ‚Äì the characters you meet are a nice surprise, but nothing really happens.  The narrator‚Äôs voice acting is a bit awkward as well, especially as the story is both told in past & present tense simultaneously."

4884,boring. dont waste ur money.
4885,"good
"
4886,"The game is colorful, pleasant music and nice voice-acting. 
...aside from that, I didn't find it to be much of a game.   It's a platform jump/grapple challenge and that's it.  With few exceptions, the expected route is made fairly obvious so there is very little actual problem solving involved, just aiming and timing.  

The story is simple with little to no depth or mystery and a particularly wtf?-level of ungratifying ending.  Despite passing through multiple populated areas and being encouraged to look around, you only interact with a grand total of about 4 characters throughout the entire game. 

If it's on sale for a few bucks, if you like first person physics challenges, and if you're only looking to kill maybe 2 to 4 hours (about how long it took me to beat it in one sitting with a food break mixed in there somewhere), pick it up and support the developers :)  

....otherwise, there's really not much here for most people."

the story is good

nice animations
some levels are difficult but still can manage to pass through
nice soundtrack or fx?

4888,"Another awesome Coffee Stain game. There is a level of skill in making all your different gadgets work properly. Which is what makes this a very different puzzle game. Same ball park as Portal games. I wouldn't say it's for kids under 12 because of skill required. 
Great art. Great story."

4891,"*SPOILERS*

Good casual adventure game with simple yet fun mechanics that will keep you busy for a few hours. The calming voice of the narrator adds depth to the already interesting story. On the surface it can be seen as a fairy tale story of a man from his childhood of his adventures with his uncle who traveled to a magical world where frog people exist. However dig a little deeper and we can see that the game shows the story is about a little boys alternate perspective imagination, coping on the loss of his uncle from a climbing accident. The game gives hints about this throughout the game, including secret words of the 7 stages of loss in each level (Denial, Isolation, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and finally Acceptance).

Overall it is an amazing fun little game, and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a casual game with a good story.

4903,"Was wanting this game for a bit of time. got it in a giveaway. Until now, the best game I've ever played in my entire life. <3"
4904,"[b]An adventure platformer that revolves around grappling and momentum. Its concept is fleshed out and entertaining, providing gameplay that feels both precise yet flexible. The story is intriguing and heart-felt, somehow managing to be both surface level yet endearing. While it's only several hours long, this largely plays in the game's favor, delivering something that's fairly accessible and concise. It has a few rough spots, but nothing that condemns the overall experience. While it's surprisingly well-made, but it's difficult to recommend at the current price range.[/b]


In all honestly, I had always heard mixed reviews about this game. That it was frustrating, poorly-paced, short, and boring. Despite going in with all that negative stigma, I couldn't really find anything wrong with the game. It's all around exceptional work.


The gameplay revolves around using the several inertia/momentum-based movement mechanics to traverse various obstacle course-styled levels. When on the ground, you can perform powerful jumps upward, or bounding leaps forward. When in the air, you can utilize an energy grapple to latch and gravitate to far away objects, or utilize rocket boots for short bursts of aerial speed.

The movement mechanics are quite robust. You're given quite a few movement tools to solve problems. At the same time, you can use these tools to improvise whenever you make mistakes. All of the movement guesswork comes naturally on the fly. Occasionally, I'd miss a jump, only to then recover from a seemingly inevitable loss using my rocket boots or grapple. It feels awesome to pull off a clutch recovery in the face of an immediate failure.


As you traverse the varied locations, you're stopped at story checkpoints, which fill you in on the plot. These are few and far between, helping to break up the monotony of the longer platforming sections. For the most part, the story is fairly surface level, yet surpisingly robust for such a small title.

The story is intriguingly told, as it's not presented in a traditional fashion. The secret really is in the name, as it's not a story about the protagonist. It's a story about your uncle. You're more of a spectator to the main story, watching as the plot unfolds for other characters who are on their own respective adventures. Their story happens to intersect with your own. Since the protagonist is not the main character, the story feels a bit more natural, and ends up being more refreshing. I'm tired of being the hero, or chosen one, or gift to the world. I'd rather see something play out organically, just like what is presented here.

Special commendations go to the voice actors, who really help nail the point home without sounding overly video gamey or fairy-tale-esque. Usually voice acting in indie titles comes across as hammy or cringe-worthy. It's extremely solid delivery here. I was thoroughly impressed.


That said, I do have a few nitpicks.

The animation work is rough in a few places. It's one thing to have background characters that have low quality assets, but it's another to have a main character with a busted walk cycle. Given the quality on display here, it's kind of shocking that this made it past their radar. One of the main characters had several walk and run cycles that bordered on distracting. A second pass could have ironed out those issues.

Another issue was the inprecision on some of the movement abilities. The jump and leap abilities are context sensitive, meaning they only trigger in specific movement scenarios. To put it simply, jumping up or leaping forward aren't immediate button presses, but rather require some delayed activation mechanic. Even after mastering the movement, I would still occasionally flub a leap because I didn't hold down forward before activing the jump. Sometimes I'd fall to my death because I'd get a jump upward, rather than a leap forward. In a game about moving quickly with purpose, you kind of need all of your movement mechanics to be responsive. This came across as more frustrating than anything.

Finally, The movement mechanics are rather luck-based at times. Because you're maneuvering through the air in real time, you have very little room for error. As a result, longer grappling sections become a bit exhausting. You'll end up failing a section multiple times for random reasons that feel a bit out of your control. Perhaps you held the grapple down too long and bounced into your target, losing all of your momentum and dropping you to your death. Maybe you came at your grapple target at the wrong angle, and now you come up short when trying to land on the next platform. You may use up your rocket boots early on a flubbed jump, and now you can't make the last platform in a sequence because it requires the rocket boots to reach them.


As was mentioned in other reivews, this game is rather short, with a story mode that comes in at about 2 1/2 hours long. The game tries to supplement the playtime with features like time trials and challenges, which provide very little extra appeal. In fact, I was frankly surprised by how extremely hard the extra challenges were. For a game that is so simple and accessible, it feels weird that the bonus modes were frustratingly difficult.

Though some might see the short playtime as a negative, I ended up preferring it. One realization I had while replaying it for achievements was that the game tends to drag a bit in places. The novel grapple concept is interesting and entertaining at first, but it starts to get repetitive after a while. I cannot imagine how much of a slog this experience would be if it was 8-12 hours long.

This is where I'm going to give the developers their due credit: Sometimes you need to introduce your concept, play with it a bit, and then get out before it gets stale. Both the gameplay mechanics and story are short vertical slices of a larger idea. The game knows when to wrap things up and move on, and I ended up leaving the game with a high opinion. If it had been 8 hours long, I likely would have hated it before the end.

Had I paid full price for this, I don't know if I would have been satisfied with the purchase in spite of the quality that's been delivered. For the record, it's likely I wouldn't have bought it anyway due to lack of interest. At the moment, it's difficult to recommend this title at full price.


A Story About My Uncle nails its concept, provides a quaint and succinct story, has a few moments of cleverness, and is quite enjoyable to play. While it's somewhat short, it also uses its time well. It has a few rough edges, but nothing that ever detracts from the experience. It's hard to recommend this at the given price. I'd recommend getting it on sale.

4905,Is game is relax game Please Buy game is relax game
4906,Took me just over 2 hours to complete this game. Thoroughly enjoyed. A nice story with some interesting jumping like puzzles (grapples and jet boots). Would recommend as a good way to kill a few hours.
4907,"Bad:

- Avoid playing with the controller. Not tested enough and is painful for the fingers.
- Character bounces like a ball against walls, and there is alway a cliff close.
- The grapple signal is too strict, you've miliseconds to press the button sometimes.
- It's not always clear when you can or can't grab a surface or thing.
- Most puzzles rely on the sometimes chaotic engine physics, a pixel of difference can (and happens most of the time) ruin minutes of gaming. It's especially annoying when you get caught bouncing against the edge were you were trying to climb and have to let the player fall an die. Thousands of times.
- Extreme spike of the difficulty in the last stage that ruins the mood. 
- Horrible character 3d models . It's especially painful because...

Good:

- ... the backgrounds, in-game objects and lights are simply wonderful. A lot of recycle but well used.
- Light nostalgic story.
- FP platforming, when the thing works it's delightful and highly enjoyable.
- A lot of well designed Puzzles. 
- I tend to prefer short games that provides a fun experience and makes you want to play again from time to time.  Someone decided to artificially expand the game by adding  hell difficulty on the last level but it's still a game that you can finish in a few hours if you're patient.


My point:

Nice game with cool enviroments, touching story and a joy to play most of the time for the people who likes FP non shooting puzzle platformers. Unfortunately, It seems like it was finished in a rush and things like character models, controller testing and difficulty design on the last stage could be way better. There are things like adding constraints, balance the character weight, adding different levels of difiiculty (and you can see that they tried to make it easier: light marks, different paths... but it seems more like patches and there are still very painful zones) that could've improved the game. 

If you can stand the torture of the last stage and repeat a jump one hundred times without smashing your mouse against the wall, the experience of the rest of the game worth it."
4908,Game is awesome and has a lot of potential
4909,review
4910,"Don't get me wrong, I like this game and I got the game for free when it offered the game for free, but I feel like its way too vanilla for this price... The gameplay is 1-2 hours long. I like the quality of this game but I feel that I've played more fun and story driven minecraft parkour maps. Literally. Also it would be great if you could make your own maps like in Portal 2, so that there would be more replayability, but that would be too hard to make. I also kind of wished that it wasnt a bit, well repetitive, especially for a short game. This game is worth it in a discounted or maybe even, free price range."
4911,Interesting little indie game. Nothing spectacular.
4912,NICE ONE
4913,Fun platformer game with a wholesome story and great artwork. Would recommend.
4914,"[h1][b]A Story About My Uncle[/b][/h1]

I hardly play indie games. But this game's reviews grabbed my attention when I got it last year. Whatever, let's come to the PROS and CONS of the game-

[i]PROS-[/i][list]
[*]A charming story.
[*]Beatifully crafted environments
[*]Graphics is not ground-breaking but acceptable
[*]Puzzles....Though most of them are too easy
[*]No bugs or glitches[/list]
[i]CONS-[/i][list]
[*]Puzzles are too easy.
That's all. I cannot remember any faults of this game, seriously..[/list]

[i]Overall my rating - 8.5[/i]

Indie lover or not, you must try this game...."
4915,"Great story but controls are annoying as hell, sometimes the level design was fun and it was flowing smoothly but other times due to unresponsive controls/ poor level design its just frustrating 3/5"
4916,It is a fun game but I am unable to save my progress.
4917,"So I'll start with the graphics, they are great the game can run on my Macbook(That's saying something) so I can play it everywhere. It is of course an indie game and 3-4 hours is good for a story, however I think they had a lot of potential, once you've completed the story, the game is kind of done. How much better the game was if it had Steam Workshop support where people could make their own levels or Servers like Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Good game for a couple of hours."
4918,"Excellent game with great gameplay mechanics, storyline, and amazing graphics considering the roughly 1.4GB the game takes up. The only downfall is that the game isn't long enough lol.. I got to the end and was like ""Is that it?"" It only took me about 3 hours to finish the game and for something I enjoyed that much left me wondering if at the end another chapter or something would begin. 

That's the only thing I don't like about the game, its quite short. I'll be looking at what other games the developers have made or will be making.

Bonus points for being free also ^-^"
4919,"Well, the official description is quite accurate.  The game mechanics feels very good, which combines with the nice visuals and BGM. Despite the name, I wouldn't call it story-focused - bits of the (short) story appear throughout the game, providing some motivation and explanation.

I don't normally play platformers, and I was lucky to get this one for free, so I perhaps can't compare well to other similar games (if any exist)."
4920,"I just started the game and saw that MAP is wrong. Fix it asap. There is the country Georgia, and it is not a part of Russia!

4921,"Nice game, but short :/"
4922,a charming game to play if you miss bed time stories
4923,Great game !
4924,A lovely combination of a puzzle/adventure game and a story game. I loved the slow pace and the imagination of this game. Truly an unique experience!
4925,"It was fine....

It left a bit of an impression on me but I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it."
4926,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game all around. It reminds me of the Portal series in that it takes you along a journey in the form of puzzles and character development while providing a unique story to remember. The format to this game is quite fun because it is like you are spiderman where you swing from obstacle to obstacle trying to get to the finish, and as you do this you are told a engaging story. You are taken to places that make the game interesting like caves and cities, both of which combined with the great graphics add different flavors to the game that I truly enjoyed. The only downside to this game is that it is pretty short. It took me around 2 hours to get through and when i got to the finish line I didn't want it to end. Very good quality game in a short time length. (9/10)"
4927,It¬¥s wonderful ...
4928,cool
4929,"Absolutely i adore and recommend this game. A great adventure. A really good pick up and play without effort game. The setting is great, the story is great, and the platforming is absolutely amazing. It is very responding and you get the feeling you are in control. 
The thing i do not like is that the game is a bit short. 10.2 hrs was not enough for me. I wanted more. 
And best of all there is more than one way to reach your destination, so it is has a really good replayability value.


Pros: 
-Easy to pick
-Great platforming
-Great story
-Great artstyle
-Feeling the sense of speed
-Good voice acting and ambient music.

Cons:
-None"
4930,"A fun little game for you to play during a rainy day . Not too hard or easy , just in the right spot. It's not perfect or a must buy   but if your into short and sweet platformers  or are simply looking for a change in pace, I would suggest buying this game if you have the extra cash."
4931,"Simply not my style of game ...

People may like it granted. And it's probably best to play this game with a controller. Because I found the controls with keyboard and mouse to be quickly frustrating(everytime just missing a jump and falling down gets boring after a while). I never really get the 3D platforming stuff right, so it's probably my own fault.

The story seems shallow too. But hey I'm not complaining, since the game was for free..."
4932,"Fun but brief platformer.

Interesting grapple mechanic, occasionally frustrating."
4933,Nice story
4934,"A really short, and fun game; which could be read as a story of grief, although that may just be how I perceived it"
4935,"Though mighty short, it was a breath of fresh air for me, a non-violent, still a kind of action game, simple, while having challanging moments, achievements especially.

A nice cozy little piece of art and craft which I will remember."
4936,Great little indie game that will run on a potato. Great story.
4937,"Incredibly hard, almost made me ragequit several times; it took me at least twice as much as it should have to finish it.

Also quite short, thankfully since it's so damn hard.

Recommended only on the basis that even though I felt like quitting it several times it wasn't so bad as to actually made me do it.

Also no microtransactions whatsoever."
4938,"[b] [MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD. MAYBE.] [/b]

So, after finishing this game, I must say... it is a pretty average experience on a lot of levels. But one I still enjoyed quite a lot.

The storyline is pretty simple and straight-forward, with a bigger mystery in the background that ends up going nowhere. The few characters there are in the game are pretty bland too, with the exception of Maddie, the character you spend the most time with throughout the game. It also doesn't help most of the voice actors sound pretty uninterested in their roles, with again the exception of Maddie. It's definitely not bad, but... still pretty subpar.

The presentation is overall pretty decent, but some animations, models and effects can look pretty ugly and stockish at times. But still not too bad. 
Although, I have to say the world building in this game is phenomenal. The places you go through all feel big, extensive, and connected in a very natural way. My favourite location was definitely Star Haven, which is pretty much eye-candy everywhere you look at. It's very pretty.

Now, the soundtrack is not very present, and when it does show up, it's usually pretty simple and rather unmemorable. But still fits the atmosphere of the game pretty well. 

The level design can be pretty confusing at times, too. Although most of the places you're supposed to grapple are marked with a specific symbol, sometimes the direction you're supposed to go is not always apparent. The final area of the game is a clear example of that. I wouldn't say it's so bad you can't finish the game, but you'll most definitely get a lot of unfair deaths simply because you don't know where you're supposed to go. So again... pretty average. 

The controls and mechanics are... well, interesting. Grappling, jumping, long jumping all work fine, but for some reason, leaping and using the rocket-boots always felt very... inconsistent to me. Sometimes it worked just fine, sometimes it didn't at all. 
Also, sometimes you don't seem to build a lot of momentum when you're grappling from one spot to another. Which led to a lot of unfair deaths. Again, feels inconsistent. But not unplayable.

Overall, a pretty straight-forward, average first-person platformer. But it still managed to bring out that nostalgic feeling of exploring a magical world you know nothing about. And I still had a lot of fun playing it.

Still, 12 bucks is a pretty hefty price for such a simple and short game. I finished the game in under 3 hours, so yeah, it's a pretty short-lived adventure. 

But if you recieved it for free like I did, or bought it on a sale, I'd definitely say it's worth your time. 
I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Pretty good, but not great."
4939,"Happy I got to play it.
I liked the artstyle. It also has a nice story!
7/10 would play again."
4940,It's a decent game. A little bit unique. Some interesting platforming mechanics. No glaring weaknesses. Worth a play through if you can grab it cheap.
4941,"The Good

* Pretty graphics
* Interesting story

The Bad

* Everything else

This is a game of misplaced expectations.  Watching the trailer, I imagined myself leaping, bounding, and soaring through the air like a lovely gazelle as I made my way to my next objective.  What I got was a bloody mess of fixed paths, unclear routes, and a point of view that made it difficult to judge distances accurately, leading to many, many falling deaths.

I gritted my teeth and powered through it but I shouldn't have to.  Neither should you."
4942,"A very enjoyable platformer with neat graphics and a good story. The levels were all very beautiful, and well done. However, during the final bit the difficulty really ramps up. Other than that it's a pretty good game."
4943,"For what I've experienced it is a child-friendly game that rarely seen on Steam. The game was supposed to be a relaxing 3D platform jumper but my palm sweated as I was really clumsy playing with my controller.

Edit: After I used keyboard and mouse, things got slightly better, but a clumsy player like me still fell countless times and occasionally got stuck. The game is not extremely hard, yet it is far from easy.

P.S. The game achievements are very hard to achieve."
4944,"Very calm story driven game, Levels are well made and difficult here and there just to keep things interesting, Lots of unlockables and challenges, Alot of fun, enjoyed it alot, Highly recommended"
4945,sweet game i liked it
4946,"a very simple game,nice game to play"
4947,"Cool game and nice to the eye graphics. The only criticism I have is that you seem so low to the ground - like you have no shin or thigh bones. You're basically a boy that has a head, one visible hand, and two feet connected to his hips. Jumping and leaping is pretty cool. Even cooler that he can do it without shin or thigh bones."
4948,:3
4949,"Alright,
So to be honest, i never experienced such a nice and intresting short game in my life.
This game is worth this price!
Graphics are very nice, whole scenerio is AMAZING!"
4950,just play the damn game it's a truly great experience
4951,"I finally got around to finishing this game after getting it from a giveaway a while back. Get to the end if you haven't already, it's gorgeous!

"
4952,It is a good game but i dont like the controls.
4953,it was a really good game the gameplay mechanics where really fun and i just had a good time playing it so yes i do recommend you get it its a good game good story to
4954,"The story is well made, the gameplay feels amazing and smooth, recommended game to play."
4955,Not what i would call enjoyable. Annoying controls!
4956,"doesn't let me alt+F4

horrible"
4957,"Masterpiece. I wouldn't have bought this game, if it wasn't have native GNU/Linux port."
4958,Really Good Game. Story and Mechanics were great!
4959,"I rate this game a 7/10.
If you love games with high mobility then this is for you, it's very fast paced with unique mechanics that is easy to learn. The story itself wasn't great but the way of telling it is. This game has beautiful art and has some amazing views. The atmosphere of the game is very calm, especially with the Narrator talking. There are a few noticeable bugs, but nothing that will affect you too seriously. If you pick up the mechanics easy enough and don't pay too much attention to the background then you can go through this game in under 2 hours easily. I recommend it, but only if it is on sale for 50% off or more."
4960,The best game with story!
4961,"I think there should have been more diverse layers of complexity for understanding the core message of this game. Same with the actual game play and navigational problem solving. Things are either too easy and in your face, or tedious and vague. Appreciate the unique approach to story-telling though."
4962,"Really good game, but it's littlebit too short. I passed main plot in 2 hours. Good 4 speed running"
4963,amzing very worth it!
4964,"Satisfying gameplay parkour things.... i love it 
Recommended for you who likes parkour game like dis :)"
4965,A good game ruined by the fact the [b]fuc[/b][b]king[/b] controls dont work. (the running jump works less than half the time)
4966,"Not done yet, but I'm really enjoying the story telling and the nice atmosphere of the game."
4967,"This is a good platform game with good landscapes and interesting mechanics. I have the feeling they wanted to make more, because it kinda feels too rushed, in my opinion. It's like, when you get close to the end, you keep wanting to ask  the game ""Okay, so? What now?"""
4968,"[h1]VR REVIEW ONLY[/h1]

You can check out my VR gameplay here: https://youtu.be/QmN8IEsuf6A

I am not reviewing the game. I am reviewing playing this game in VR and some of my impressions. I used Vorpx and the Unreal Engine 3 profile. I had resolution at 1920 x 1080. I got a steady 45 frames per second for the most part. I used FULL VR MODE with Geometry 3D reconstruction. I set 3D strength scale to 1.25 and 3D FOV Enhancement to 1.00.

Unfortunately, the textures were muddy in VR. So while everything was in 3D, the 3D didn't really pop. I finished the game in Non-VR and the textures didn't look bad on the desktop screen as they did in VR at the same resolution (1920x1080). As such, none of the visuals look really good in VR and I can't say that playing it VR looks better than playing it on the desktop screen, even with the 3D visuals.

However, the gameplay is more fun in VR. A lot of that has to do with the first person view point of this game along with the head tracking from using a VR headset. You really get that sense of rush from swinging across the map or the vast jumps you can master. You don't really get that same rush from playing it on the desktop screen. VR also brings added difficulty as it can be easier to lose your bearings and you do have problems sometimes noticing depth / distance from different objects.

All in all, it was enjoyable to play, but there really isn't enough eye candy here for VR. Since I already finished the game in Non-VR, I'm not sure that I will complete the game in VR as the 3D experience just wasn't good enough with Vorpx.

[b]VR Rating 6/10. Not bad. If you already have ASAMU & Vorpx, then there's no reason to not try it out. However, I wouldn't recommend buying either just for the VR experience using Vorpx.[/b]"
4969,A very good short game that had a cute story line and good play feel
4970,"Cute short 3D platformer. Quite a neat idea.

Two things to complain about however:
1. Game is missing a restart map button, need to go back to main menu to restart map.
2. Unskippable dialog, bothersome when trying to do all achievements."
4971,wow
4972,Game is good but i don't like game like this
4973,nice game try it.
4974,"Looks pretty good and the environment is beautiful
but the npc are bothering me (quality/gestures/other movement),
The way the story is told is really good(i like it) but it's just too short, like i completed the whole story in 2h...
but well if this game is on sale i highly recommend buying it.

the story got interesting elements but it seemed like it was missing something...

(secret options are pretty funny gotta say XDD)
pretty much after the story you got these options
1.collect all papers from machines over the place (also an achievement)
2.try to get really good at ""time trials""
3.try to get all of the achievements
4.play the story again"
4975,"One of the greatest games that i've played , good story i give it 7.5/10"
4976,"A cute little game that will keep your attention for about 3 hours, maybe 6 when it comes to time trials. I'd say just wait for a sale."
4977,"So many similarities with Avatar /Movie/, need more story. If you like to get goosebumps, play it!!!"
4978,"Very enjoyable 5 hours platform game. A lovely voyage through awesome sceneries, matched with chill-out music.
NIce game overall, but i didn't really like the dialogues: the other characters are going to talk as in a first person story (directly to you) but your character is talking as in a third person narration anytime he has to answer back. that being said i really appreciated this game and the few hours spent on it."
4979,It is an alright game. Nice to play once but not something i would jump at again
4980,short game but good
4981,An underwhelming story about this guy's uncle.
4982,Very good but it's very short
4983,Great game
4984,little short but nice game :)
4985,amazing platformer with charming story not worth the 13 euros in my opinon wait until sale
4986,"Not a long game to beat but enjoyed every second of it.  Fun gameplay. Beautiful world.  Amazing Story, most of which is narrated as you play.   Highly recommended if you want to enjoy a short but sweet game."
4987,"Good game
But the achivement really hard to achive."
4988,"So it's a fun little game, mainly a platformer with this grappling gimmick ... it kinda reminded me of portal in a way ... I had fun with it, a few mechanics get added in over time to keep things varied, towards the end I had had enough though and was just trying to get it done so I could clean it off my computer. But all in all worth the time.

I got this free somewhere, I'm guessing humble (can't remember) and seems I got a couple hours of play from it, so if you're looking to buy it then I guess just weigh up whatever it's going to cost you at about 2 hours of entertainment."
4989,Hello from the land of Belgium i just wanted to say this game was pretty damn fun to play and i thought that the fact i got it free made it even better. Much love to the team that spent their time working on it and i hope to see more of this in the future !! ‚ô•
4990,"Bland story, ok platforming"
4991,"This is one of my favorite games ever, it has an amazing story and amazing gameplay. Highly reccomend"
4992,cum
4993,Great game to kill time with a nice asthetic and casual story
4994,"I got this game of off Humble Bundle for free a while back. I didn't expect much, but saw some footage online and decided to play it. Although short, it was a very good experience and one that was much better then I expected. The story had me very interested, and the gameplay was kept fresh with new upgrades and challenges without feeling like too much was thrown at you or that it was too challenging. Although easy to get accustomed to, there are so many things you can do with the grappling beam and some momentum in the game.

All in all, This is a great game that I would reccomended to anyone wanting to have some fun or just enjoy life for a bit. I am also hoping that someday the creators make a sequel, or come back to the game."
4995,"Decent first person 3D platformer, but it doesn't last very long."
4996,"Magic enviroment, cool story and good puzzles"
4997,Nothing but praise for this game! Simple concept but the gameplay is fun and calming.  Even though its old the map art still looks great.
4998,Good..
4999,"Short story ,but realy good."
5000,"A Story About My Uncle has simple yet engaging visuals, few controls that are easy to master and a plot that doesn't get boring. The narrative is wholesome and friendly and throughout the game you're met with a unique world that keeps on giving.

This game is perfect for late night relaxation or entertaining time-killer. 
The puzzles that you face are always different and you're faced with an ever increasing difficulty which progresses as you get better.

The only downside I notice when playing is the voice acting, although minimal, since you are mostly left to your own self throughout the game, it is obvious that the voicing was performed too closely to the microphone, as the voices are soft yet loud.

Great game, only wish it went on for longer."
5001,"this was great! finished it in 2 hours. was super fun, especially the floating boxes.."
5002,"I Definitely recommend this game to anyone who's thinking about buying it. its kind of sad that its short but the story was worth it for me. I kind of wish there was a sequel just so i could know what happened to Maddie and Fred but judging by how the story ended, It's sadly not likely"
5003,"I cant remember buying this game, but its pretty good : ) But the night I bought it must have been better ; ) #whathappendlastnight #drunk #cantremebershit"
5004,"It's a really beautiful game with a sweet, yet sad story."
5005,"A Story About My Uncle is a simple game, with a serviceable story. The game is very repetitive in nature, short and has quite an anti-climactic ending. It is a few hours of fun if you can pick it up on sale, but other than that, I wouldn't recommend it at full price."
5006,"Great Game. 
You Just Should Buy it"
5007,Nice
5008,It was a fun adventure.
5009,"Amazing, one of the few games that actually made me feel anything but horror or excitement. 10/10"
5010,Old game But still good <3
5011,perfectly spent Sunday afternoon
5012,"A true gem; worthy of your time. The narrative is great, but not too overwhelming.  The visuals are simply amazing, however the music is a bit repetitive if you don't finish each level within a reasonable amount of time. 

Parkour weaved into a fantasy narrative -- how could you go wrong?"
5013,Awesome game! too short.
5014,good game unfortunately it is difficult to open an achievement
5015,"incredibly beautiful, easy to learn and sometimes makes me sit for 10 minutes to figure out what i need to do. perfect balance between fun, challenge and story."
5016,"Best thing about this game is that you set the pace how easy or hard (fast) you want to go. Game leaves the experience completely in your control. There is no sense of urgency like most of games try to create. It's falsely accused because of this for being too easy. But I think it is intentional and supports the story & mood it wants to create. Overall, very good game!"
5017,Very good. They Know Portugal. Much Love From Portugal. :D
5018,Amazing game 10/10 good story and easy to use mechanics flares a little buggy tho but besides that everything is good
5019,"My god... This game is just a piece of art, a masterpiece, It's just something else
It's kinda short yet so fun and entertaining
It's just something else
Ok I'm out of words right now but you get the point, this game is just cute

also It's raining outside rn üñ§"
5020,Underrated
5021,Boring and lame
5022,Inconsistent gameplay full of bugs. Not worth paying for.
5023,on map of this game Georgia is shown in russian federation. people who made this game don't know geography
5024,"Amazing gameplay, good story a little short for 14$ therefore get it on special."
5025,Just relax and play. Good story and soundtrack.
5026,This is one of those steam games that has no audio in full screen when connected to the TV via HDMI. I reached out to their support  and didn't receive any reply. I also reached out to steam (as I identified their buggy client as the root cause after some experimentation) to no avail. Total waste of money and time. What a shame.
5027,"the physics are a little wonky in some areas and the game likes to reset my settings often. I like the idea of the game and some of the settings are really pretty, and the mechanics are really great in concept. I feel like the game would be better on a different engine, or if it had tighter controls."
5028,"I love the game! it's so fun and sometimes if i'm honest kinda scary. It feels SO real! I recommend this game if you like action or adventure with the Smallest dash of horror, because them jumps sometimes MMM They scary! All and all I LOVE THIS GAME! It's so adicting and play!"

In summary, this a short but cracking game and well worth playing if on offer!

There are only a handful of levels, but the journey through each is exciting as you 'reach' for the next handhold, or platform, hoping you don't fall in the abyss...

Its extremely rewarding and at times forgiving, as you'll no doubt miss your handhold/foothold many times only to save yourself by 'reaching' for an outcropping rock, before quietly breathing a sigh of relief!

Looking at the reviews, I appear to have put in more hours compared to most - completing all the steam achievements.  Based on that the main achievement most of you might be interested in is collecting the 25 collectables, where you will be rewarded with the ability to spin, twirl and more while also jumping and using the beam.  That said... the real challenge are the time trials... where those of you who enjoy parkour will love it.

Overall, this is a great game and one worth playing.

Highly recommended!!"
5034,"I really liked the story, the gameplay and the soundtrack was awesome, but the story could have been a little bit longer but I think it's reasonable for it's price."
5035,woa
5036,The game it's overall amazing. The gameplay is great and the story is entertaining and immersing. Despite getting it for free I believe it is worth spending money on it. The game takes about 2-4 hours to complete depending on time you spent exploring everything. 10/10
5037,"Very positive, very creative game. Nice mechanics, but story could be more complex and puzzles can be huge win for this game!
Keep on with good ideas guys :)"
5038,"Best parkour experience,
I love that game.
+TRY-IT =))"
5039,Not a bad little adventure to go on. $13 seems a bit steep for how short it is though. Wait til it goes on sale.
5040,great game mechanics
5041,"A fairly short game but fun none the less.

From the get go the game is full of charm with an art style that matches. The gameplay is good with consistent and predictable abilities that are gradually unlocked at a comfortable pace. Level design gets more complicated as the game progresses with the exemption of one area about 2/3 of the game which is significantly more challenging than the rest of the game. Apart from this area most levels are quite simple, although it provides less of a challenge to complete, these levels are hard to master in the time trail mode, a welcome edition in this type of game. Another aspect of the level design I enjoyed was the ability to take alternative routes and explore the level or try complete it faster.
The story is very simple yet sweet which makes sense given it's a father telling a bedtime story to his daughter. The characters have that warm feeling you commonly get from children's story's. Unfortunately, the children's book charm the characters carry also leave them shallow and simple as their story book counterpart."
5042,Delightful story with great grappling mechanics to maneuver around the game. Definitely worth a buy if you want a relaxing game to play in your free time.
5043,good game but short
5044,good fun

this game reminded me of him"
5047,"[h1]This game surprised me![/h1]
Unique gameplay, nice graphics and interesting story!"
5048,It was a good game. well suited for a casual player. it was immersive. memorable and the controls where pretty easy to get use to. the plot was pretty good and you can finish the game in one sitting. Where ever Fred is and his nephew I hope they still have a great adventure ahead of them. would play again 10/10
5049,Pretty fun to kill some time.
5050,"Amazing visuals, sort of slow dialogue and corny cut scenes, but all that aside 9/10."
5051,"Even though I got this for free I would say it is worth the price.

Honestly the atmosphere the soundtrack the gameplay was all perfect. The story telling was very interesting and just matched the atmosphere so well the game played fully in 2 hours but I still enjoyed it and its a nice relaxing game to play over and over if you are bored, just want this story to be retold to you or play the time trial and unlock the achievements.

Overall 10/10 just for the story it played calmly enough to basically be a bedtime story, going to sleep now."
5052,"Good game, I got it for free."
5053,"The gameplay kind of reminds me of the Portal series with parkour added to the equation. Otherwise its very different from games that I normally play such as Ori and the Blind Forest & Airscape - The Fall of Gravity as a platformer. 

I really think this type of game would be even better with VR support considering the excellent first-person experience. The VR potential is there."
5054,"Alright story, fun gameplay and amazing scenery pretty good for a 2 hour long game."
5055,"[h1] Review [/h1]

I don't know how to describe [i] A Story About My Uncle [/i], but a very good game and takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete. The story is simple, yet captivating. The atmosphere and the environment are beautiful, and the game mechanic is easy where you grapple and use momentum. There is no puzzle and the path is linear, similar to a 2D platform game. 

The only complaint that I have is that there are times where I became frustrated over a section of a level that took many tries to get to the other side. Usually, the issue comes from the lack of momentum.

[h1] Verdict [/h1]

Sound - 10/10
Environment - 9/10
Graphics - It's alright
Story - 9/10

Score - 8.5/10"
5056,"deep story, plenty of plot, but doesnt save your progress"
5057,"Fun game, possible to sink many hours into! For the price, this is an amazing game. It has some flaws, but overall a good game"
5058,Great game. Moving ending...
5059,"one of my favorite games, with a unique story and a wonderful world to explore"
5060,"lovely game, if you have a chance to buy on discount don't miss it, if you love adventure game you will love this one"
5061,"Amazing game , so beautiful and colorful , great story with amazing sounds and voices ."
5062,"A lovely game, i'm done with it and i'm waiting for more nice games like this one!"
5063,"A wonderfully fun and cute indie game. Not the greatest, and not fully bug free, but the passion put into the game and it's world shine through in spades. Absolutely recommend at play through."
5064,"[h1]
+/- Liked the game up until I got into the huge cave‚Ä¶ Couldn¬¥t make my way out of that damn thing! Rage quit! 
[/h1]"
5065,"Could have been a fun simple game, but the margin for error is too close and not worth my time."
5066,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is a first-person platformer. The graphics are nice, the movement through space is varied and interesting, and the narrative is curious. But it's a bit of a wanderer as far as reasons why you should play. 

I'm not a big fan of playing a game just for the sake of playing it. Do I care about the kid's uncle? Not really. The kid had some relationship with him, and he sounds like a weirdo, but I didn't see or experience that and so I have literally NO relationship with him. Do I have any reason to jump across a vast expanse and grapple to an orbiting rock other than simply to jump across the vast expanse and grapple an orbiting rock? Nope.

The reason a game has conflict is to drive the plot forward and give you reasons for engaging. This game has no conflict. 

What I find is ""A Story About My Uncle"" believes too heavily in the ideology that if you build it they will come. There's a point early on where I'm not sure why I'm playing. Do I like swinging and solving the mysteries of how to move through space. Kinda, for a bit. But Why? Why am I putting myself through this? Why ? The motivations for this game are simply to get to some nebulous and unclear ending by way of a sort of complicated but repetitive path of swinging and jumping.

So I close ""A Story About My Uncle"" and find another game to play which motivates me."
5067,"I've had this game on my wish list for a while and I heard it had become free to play, so I was thrilled to try it out. I'm sad to say I can't really recommend it, even for free. The story is uninteresting, unintelligeble and sometimes even anoyingly slow. I love certain walking simulators, but this was emotionally bland and boring and had some of the worse voice acting of all games I've played so far. 
The game mechanics could offer some relieve, but are quite repetitive and often frustrating. Falling to your death takes way to long and the fixed route you should take is quite often unclear. 
I've finished the game, but I felt no drive to go after all the useless collectibles or try the time challenges. 
I'm sad to say I can't recommend playing it"
5068,"This game is a really mixed bag. Gameplay is really good. Everything feels really smooth and fast. Great sense of speed. The momentum while grappling could feel a bit better.
The worst part of this game is by far the story. I've never played a game other than Celeste with such a horrendous and cringe story. The writing is bad, the voice actors are mediocre and the characters look god awful. The developer is probably some kind of other-kin furry and tried to push his wicked agenda with this game.
If the developer removed the cringe, increased the gameplay length and drop the price to below $5 USD I would totally recommend this game.
But as it is right now I urge you to stay away from this piece of filth."
5069,Seemed fun at first but after a bit the grappling and rocket boots and constantly not getting far enough somehow even though doing exactly what I was suppose to just really ruined the experience.
5070,"A fun game with nice platforming and an intriguing story that makes you want to keep playing, the only downsides are that it's quite short and has no real momentum, when you are 'swinging' it feels like there's no speed build up at all."
5071,"Wish the ending with Fred was different, but still, a great game to play."
5072,pretty good
5073,"Relaxing and easy game to play, I recieved it for free but for the average gamer the price is just about right if you seek a relaxing experience. The storyline is kind of cliche but it does the job. Graphics are also nice but its easily noticed that the developing crews budget wasnt the highest, but thats fine since it gets this indie look."
5074,"I don't get why steam users praise this game. It's trying so hard to be beautiful and smart, but it fails with the terrible script, and voice acting. Gameplaywise it is enjoyable for a time, but in the end it gets pretty hard, and not in a good way. For me it was really frustrating to finish it."
5075,Cringy graphics
5076,"I absolutely do NOT recommend this game.
If you want this very experience and for a far cheaper price, just buy Grapple.
The best way to describe Grapple is if you took Spiderman 2, Spiderman Web of Shadows, and Insomniacs Spiderman and boiled it down to it's purest, most injectable form, you'd have Grapple. This game is when you try to do that exact thing, but end up with it being 90% sticks and stems. I cannot express this enough: Just get Grapple you fucking neanderthal!"
5077,"This game is amazing and its storyline is a creative but short one.

opinion - amazing game and love to play it again but it is to short and took me 2-3 hours to finish :/"
5078,"Short and sweet, the story itself wasn't very in depth and the ending was pretty bland, but it's still worth playing."
5079,"""Facinating"""
5080,"I got this game when it was for free, but I would recommend it at full price too. It's a fantastic, short little game that I had a lot of fun with. I'm glad I got it, and I've played it a lot."
5081,short and sweet
5082,"Unique style of game, doesn't take very long to complete, definitely recommend. 8/10"
5083,"The first time I saw this game I was watching Leafy, now if you do know him you may or may not like him, regardless I have to thank him for showing me some gameplay of a good game.

The story can be summed up by the title of the game because it is ""A Story About My Uncle"" well not mine, but the main character's uncle. I do like how the story is told as a bedtime story, it adds some sort of charm for me. I do wish this game was a bit longer though, it only took me 3 hours to beat it, but I did receive it for free so it's not too much of a bother for me, but I personally wouldn't pay the full price.

Graphically the game is fine, it's not groundbreaking in any way, but it does have some nice and bright environments here and there.

The gameplay is a bit mixed for me, while overall it's fine it just doesn't entirely feel right. There would be times where the crosshair will light up indicating that I can grab on to a rock or whatever else it'll be and sometimes I can never grab on despite how many times I press a key/button. I feel a lack of momentum at times as well, where everything will flow fine and I just lose all my momentum missing a jump. I have also run into occurrences where I will jump on a ledge and I'll slip off, this and the crosshair thing have definitely made me rage quit just because of how annoying it is at times. I do feel like the game itself is stretched out to make the game longer, it isn't entirely too much of a bad thing for me considering the game was short, I got it for free, and the gameplay itself is simple, but it can definitely get boring quick. 

Voice acting is also pretty good for the most part, but there are a few times where the lines just come off as unnatural, maybe because of some sort of accent/dialect/language kinda deal. Not bad, just kinda off at times.

Do I recommend A Story About My Uncle? That's a yes. Now I personally wouldn't pay $13 for this title as it's too short for the price imo, but if you really want to play it that bad then go ahead, it's a fun experience nonetheless."
5084,"A very nice platformer game
idk/10"
5085,"ehehe told you, you couldn't do it"
5086,Short but sweet
5087,Unique game play and an engaging story line coupled with some beautifully diverse environments. Its not a long game but it takes time to master some of the mechanics.
5088,"I mostly enjoyed this game, but it was not without frustration. If you enjoy platformers, this is a great game for you. For me, the movement was a too floaty, but I also acknowledge that is merely a part of how the game is supposed to feel. If you are like me, and are hot garbage at any platformer, you won't like this game. I stopped partway through to see how long I had, and I was 2/3 of the way done, so might as well finish it. I got this through humble bundle, but the regular price for 12.99 is too high for the content I got. The story is nice, but mostly hidden in collectibles around the game that I honestly didn't care enough to find given how often I died just going to the next checkpoint (which are plentiful, thankfully.) If you want a short, straightforward platformer this game is for you. If you only want one half of that, I'd suggest you keep looking. 

While Steam forces me to give a yes/no recommendation, I'd rather not give one, but since I'm forced to, I'd have to say no. I do feel bad about saying no, but them's the breaks."
5089,"10/10 play it now

It has an interesting story, reminded me of Subnautica a bit, a magical experience. It is beautifully narrated, there is a little character interaction, and lots of parkour with cool gadgets, 

The devs did a great job, the ending is a bit sad thou :/ they do a great job making you connected to the characters, so at the end it's all sad. I wish more triple AAA games of today did this well on story telling and character creation."
5090,"Decently fun, with good mechanics. I only have two complaints. The first thing is that the story ends very abruptly-- I wish there was a final boss or just some more time with the character you go to such great lengths to reach. The second thing is that the voice acting for the adult version of the main character sounds extremely unnatural."
5091,A very heart warming game with a beautiful story and art style i would recommend this game to everyone to play at least once.
5092,heartbreaking story about losing a loved one as a child and learning to let go
5093,its a good game..try it!
5094,This game is extremely relaxing. The story is pretty basic but not necessarily in a bad way. It‚Äôs a fairly quick game to run through but I don‚Äôt regret buying it at all. The main thing I like doing on this game is mostly just speed trials. I recommend this game if you‚Äôre looking for something short and sweet or just looking for a game to listen to music and chill out on.
5095,"I like how the game never tells you what you should or should not do to get past an obstacle, and that they give you opportunities to be creative with how you advance in the game. You could sail through the story by using the grappling hook extensively (but not exclusively), or you could add some power jumps and sprints into the mix if you feel like you don't want to swing around so much.

The graphics are good, and I even found myself staring a lot at the landscapes across multiple levels. The story itself is sweet, and even if it is a bit short, I enjoyed it all the same."
5096,"Pretty good game, would recommend - has a great story and fun mechanics.

As of 3/4/19, I have none of the 15 achievements after the first play through. I will attempt to unlock all of the achievements."
5097,"This game was up for grabs for free some time ago, and being curious as well as a freeloader, I leapt at the opportunity.

I just finished playing it and the feels are still overwhelming. I have next to no spatial awareness and sense of direction, I'm an expert in getting lost and am afraid of heights, yet I could get it done in a single 3,5 hour run. But those 3.5 hours were full of feels, good feels. Maddie, the villages, the sights, everything was friendly and comfy. 

Even though I fell maybe 50-70 times, I never felt annoyed by the level design (which in my 20+ years of experience is a rare pleasure), and I could even laugh at myself. There was no pressure to excel or achieve, just go find your uncle. Even when Maddie posed her challenge, it wasn't frustrating, or something for the elite few. so when I actually managed it, it gave me a purer sense of pride and accomplishment than many big budget games out there.

Thank you very much for giving this freeloader so many good, warm, fuzzy memories."

[h1]General Thoughts: [/h1]
-This is a really fun puzzle platformer, it's short, sweet, and to the point. It's a unique game akin to Portal, but instead of solving puzzles using the portal gun you're figuring out traversal patterns you need to take using your spiderman hand 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
-Spiderman: The main mechanics of this game are running, jumping and swinging around like Spiderman. The progression of unlocking more abilities and interacting with different objects in the environments makes for a good pace and a nice new challenge. The feeling of accomplishment is great especially after you‚Äôve been beating your head over a difficult part and the game rewards you with a freeform easy to navigate section right afterward. 

Navigation/Puzzle: The game is a puzzle platformer the main puzzle in the game is figuring out how to traverse to the next area. It doesn't directly tell you how to get from point A to point B but the environment is clearly designed leading you in the general direction and you have to give it a good look around. Sometimes the game will even throw a few red herrings in your way so you have to be observant as to where you should be going. 

Environment: The game's environments are really beautiful and varied from each section. Between jungle caves to caves filled with darkness to open sky to ice caves, there is a ton of variety in what the world feels like. Alright so there's a lot of caves but the games make a good job making each fill different between dealing with a monstrous worm to using falling stalagmites to traverse each one has a unique mechanic that changes up the gameplay. 

[h1]Neutral: [/h1]
-Story/Characters: The story is kind of bare minimum, you are the narrator and you're telling a story of how you went to a strange world and looked for your uncle. Throughout it, you meet like two or three characters who just kind of go along with you. A lot of the dialogue is told through clunky lines like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit in here‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wanted to protect her‚Äù even though none of it is shown. Whenever the narrator is talking it's relatively fine and enjoyable but when you interact with characters it a bit lacking. The game also gives you extra story bits if you find random things in the environment to trigger it, it's a nice incentive to explore but it hinders the game's story further if you haven't found all of them. 

[h1]Cons: [/h1]
Humanoids: As pretty as the environments are, the humanoids in the game are terrifyingly unnerving. They try to make them move and look around as if they were interacting with each other but it just looks stilted and unnatural. Their eyes are so large it's hard not of focus on them and they just blankly stare off into the distance. It just makes them creepy looking. 
"
5099,A really nice game. Short gameplay but stunning graphics and environment. Really recomend!
5100,The story keeps you hooked and with the constant dialogue throughout the levels it keeps you intrigued but when i started the game again after i had not played it for a couple weeks also having left my pc afk the game took me only 2.2 hours to complete so its not worth the ¬£10 i got it when they were giving it out for free so i would recommend this but only if its discounted or free
5101,"Nice game. I can have relax and fun, when playing this. Ty for developers and artists)"
5102,"Nice if you like falling into the pits. Movement is bad and story and locations are often boring, I felt it was waste of time for me so I cannot recommend it. Go play Quake Defrag or something."
5103,"I thought this game was a really great one. Beat it in 5 hours so it's not crazy long. It is a chill game. The story isn't very wide, but the environment is very deep. Great mechanics. Can't wait to beat it again."
5104,"Great game, some of the character design is a bit weird, other than that it is a great game to play to relax."
5105,"I have a fear of heights, so this game is rather difficult for me to play. That said, what I saw in my short time with it was really interesting. The sound was very pleasant and the visuals were pretty inspired. Bouncing around didn't feel bad or terribly difficult, but flinging myself into the unknown still causes my butthole to pucker even if the checkpoints and respawning are smooth and forgiving. I wish these devs success in what they do and look forward to seeing what they do next."
5106,"I cannot recommend this. Maybe it is worth it at 90% off or something. The plot is simple, but it does take you to a different dimension or planet or something and your character doesnt bat an eye and neither do the locals. The graphics and sounds are great. The gimmick gets old after awhile. The puzzles start to become rather obvious. The controls don't handle super well, but they arent bad. Their inconsistency was frustrating though. As well as some inconsistency with landing some jumps. At times you land on a rock and it's all good. Other times to pushes you off the ledge."
5107,"A game based on a children's book story.
I recommend the game !!!"
5108,"got this btch for free
its cool"
5109,Really pretty game with a nice story
5110,"A charming little game with fun platforming, a cool world to explore and a simple but nice story. Definately worth a buy. Been hoping for a sequel for ages but I don't think it will happen. :("
5111,"Simple, Short and Fun.
Moving Story, beautiful art and scenario.
Good game mechanics.

Overall 10/10.
Great indie game."
5112,kirain ceritanya pamanku
5113,"unique gameplay, but it's quite confusing"
5114,"I almost gave this game a bad review just because the ""super leap"" (right click ability + shift) sometimes doesn't work when holding down multiple other buttons like the left click, WASD and shift. It isn't noticeable in a normal playthrough because you won't be pressing the buttons that quickly then, but when you are doing a speed run in the time trials this ""bug"" can ruin the whole run.

Anyways, the story is MEH but the game has a good movement system that is satisfying, even though it is a little clunky. If you are going to be buying this game, I suggest getting it when it's on sale."
5115,"Great game mechanics with great graphics with a great structured story.
A very good little game."
5116,"Simply 10/10. Best indie game I played in a while. Made with very high quality, sound, graphics, gameplay - almost flawless.
Story is simple but quite nice, the game takes you by its hand the whole game. I highly recommend anyone who has something left for indie games to play this gem."
5117,"its worth it. it was not saving my progress first i played for 20 mins than after few week i played for at least 100 mins but when i started again my progress was gone. i googled to fix it but could not. so i watched the rest of it on youtube :).
its a beautiful piece of work . thanks ."
5118,"Very nice game. The narration is really soothing and you get into the story. The mechanics are quite fun as well, you really want to explore your surroundings. Fun to play if you have a few hours to dedicate to a nice first person bedtime story."
5119,"Hello. Nauseous gamer here. This game provides good story telling with interesting gameplay. You get to be Spidey for grappling around rocks. Though the graphics aren't as competing as other Unreal games, the gameplay and story itself takes it away. As innocent as this game is, I expected to kill the worm. Overall I give this game a sqrt(17) / 5.

Too bad I get easily nauseated lol."
5120,"Pretty cool first-person 3D platformer, with very high jumps, a grappling ""hook"", and a short burst jetpack. Haven't finished it yet, but it seems worth a few hours of play before I'll get sick of it. It's on 75-80% sale pretty often, so definetly worth a go if you are interested."
5121,"the stupid blue girl makes me wanna kill myself, but the rest of the game is very relaxing."
5122,"This game was great. I really like how nice and polished all the graphics are. The gameplay is nice and smooth and doesn't run too poorly, which is very important to me. Although i did get this game for free, i feel like this game should have a cost of around $30 (22.71 pounds). I only have played about 30 mins and i can say i had a phenominal time with it. I would recomend this game."
5123,I really enjoyed the story and it got me hooked in. It is beautiful. Although it's not very long.
5124,A fun game to play. But not many levels
5125,"NOT FUN, story is practically nonexistent, characters annoying fucks, voice over meh, platforming is punishing and frustrating,
want to leap to this platform ? land on edge,slip off because fuck you, play Frostrunner instead."
5126,"Awesome!

This game features a short but great story. This combined with the fantastic grapple-hook style mechanics results in a great experience. Graphics are decent, voice acting is pretty good. There is not really much to complain about besides the short playtime of around three hours. I feel like that is justified by the low price and the fact that the game is otherwise very well made. When you are done with the story you can do the different sections of the game in time-trials which is heaps of fun."
5127,"For a free game,‚Äùnot anymore‚Äù, i bloody loved it, was long enough for me to actually enjoy the game, some of the jumps you have to make are a little buggy but overall its a really good story/parkour game"
5128,"I'm not a single player guy. Haven't played a single player for more than 5-10 minutes in years.
but
I loved this game. The story, the voice, the mechanics. It felt like I was no more a 22 years old man, but a 8 year old that is listening to a story. I wanted to discovery more and more. 
I even made small brakes just to make the story/game longer. I didn't want it to end."
5129,"This is such a great visual game with physics involved. It was challenging and though the story was good, I felt the story was a bit lacking but honestly it was still good. The game worked with no hiccups and smooth. I do recommend getting something called Goat Mode. You'll thank me later :-) . Good game and I recommend it"
5130,Honestly for something I picked up for free (some kinda of weekend promotion thing) I'm pleasantly surprised by this game. It's calming and a decent story with good voice acting and gameplay that reminds me a bit like portal.
5131,This game is great in my opinion. The game is perfectly balanced between challenging and fun. I never found myself stuck for more than 3 min. The story is great and nothing feels forced. I would recommend picking it up if you have the chance!
5132,"That's gold, Maddie! Gold!"
5133,"I would not recommend this game because for the first 30 min you know what your doing but the next 1hr and 30 min is just complete bullshit. You dont know what you are dong or where you are going. My friend played this game and agreed with this. It only takes 2 hr to complete.  The story is good especily the suicidal girl who jumps of a cliff several times. In the last part i might have been stupid but i had no clue what i had to do and i found the way out by complete chance.

Overall i would not recommend this game. Its fun and is short. But Bullshit at some points."
5134,"Great game, but short."
5135,"Got the game on sale, and it was one of the best things I've bought on Steam.

Charming story, completed in 3h, and got 0 achievements.

ACHIEVEMENTS TIME BOIZ!!!

10/10 will play again."
5136,"Really Good game, its kinda short but really worth it, its calming and fun to play
"
5137,good
5138,"I got bored(and sometimes infuriated) playing this game. 

The gameplay itself is fine. Grappling hooks are always a cool mechanic but I wished they gave us better control for it. I tend to overshot everything which angers me a bit but the game did provide some control over the grapling hook but it wasn't enough.

The story doesn't interest me. I knew I won't like it because the previews for the game felt like a walking simulator with a grappling hook. The grappling hook did make the game a bit more enjoyable but the story still didn't grab me.

The characters are....eh. There's only a few of them but Maddie was the only one who stood out for me because she was a companion(for a limited time) and annoyed me by giving me a challenge that wasn't necessary but my brain said otherwise.

Overall, I don't like it but I don't hate it. Not sure if I can recommend this since it felt a bit boring and the price tag on my country is Php. 379.95 and that's alot of money for me. Try it on sale or whenever it gets free because that's how I got it.

"
5139,"What a delightful surprise this game was. Had no idea what I was getting myself into when I first started it up. Ended up beating it start to finish my first playthrough (game is only a couple hours long). Story is just okay, but the characters are somewhat interesting and the game mechanics themselves are fun. Rating: 7/10."
5140,I like it! It's fun to fling yourself through the air. It's relaxing and not too serious. The people are a bit uncanny valley but that's more of a personal preference.
5141,Good game recommand to play this game.
5142,"There is something very mysterious about it,
Buy it and you'll find out."
5143,"Hey you. Yeah, you. The one looking through the reviews to see if you are interested in buying this game. You are most likely here because you happened to find this game on Steam, and realized that Leafy used it for some of his videos back when he was relevant. I was just like you are now, accept I didn't look at any reviews. Well, I'm here to tell you that I have never disliked a game as much as this one during my initial blind playthrough, and just in 2 hours I have a multitude of complaints that I should not have.

I will give this game a few positive remarks:

The gameplay has many minor innovations that make it feel fairly well polished. It starts very basic, but you end up with many new abilities I never would have thought I could have gotten at the end, and I can appreciate how this game plays (mostly). A minor issue I find with the gameplay is the new abilities not being added to the help menu. I played about an hour of the game, sat on it for a few weeks, and came back to forget about an ability I had just picked up. The game had no indication I had just picked it up, and I had to go watch a speedrun of the section I was in to realize I had picked up a new ability before I quit playing that made the section ahead of me possible.

The backgrounds are pretty neat, especially the one in the second to last section where you can see the last section off in the distance. There weren't any times I was taken aback by anything presented visually in the game, but there is clear effort put into the backgrounds and sceneries and I have to point that out as a positive.

But that's really where the positives end.

The thing I see the most from other reviews are complaints about the abysmal story and voice acting, and this is my biggest complaint with this game. The only character I felt any remorse for throughout the whole entire story is the daughter of the narrator for having to sit through such an anti-climactic and boring bedtime story. The voice actors all feel like robots, slowly and inhumanly reading through very awkwardly written dialogue they were programmed to read from. Nothing said in this game feels naturally said, and the biggest thing people look for with voice actors is how natural they make the scene feel. Well, I was so negatively impacted by the voice acting at first that I had to turn off the voice volume during my first session of playing through this game because I couldn't handle it. I eventually turned it back on after the stupid frog lady left me alone, and thankfully there wasn't much for dialogue from that point forward so I could handle it.

Although the gameplay was the best part about this game, it also dragged my enjoyment of it down a whole lot. The crystals near the halfway point that refill your grapple are the worst part of all of it because you have to be at a very specific part of the world for each of them to work. I spent at least 10 extra minutes dying to parts where I needed to refill my grapple, where I missed the one specific part I had to do it from, so it wouldn't activate until I came back and tried it again. The physics are also fairly janky to begin with. Some sections feel like pure luck if you get past it because the game decides to fling you in a direction that makes it 50 times harder than it's supposed to be. I started disliking the gameplay so much around an hour and a half in, that I just rushed through the rest of the game as fast as I could in order to stop playing it. Luckily this game is only 2 hours, so I was able to handle it for that small of a time period.

I have never seen character designs as ugly as the characters in this game. I get the people I'm meeting are mutant frog things, but they look so disgusting I wasn't sure if I was playing a N64 game or not while looking at them. Their bodies are fine, but the way everyone's faces are designed is vomit inducing and I had to stop myself from laughing every time I looked at anybody because of how ugly everyone is. Even Fred, a normal human being, has design traits that make him look abhorrent. 

Overall, I really liked this game to start out with, but being subjected to 2 hours of the janky and clearly unfinished gameplay, and the horrific voice acting and story line, makes this one of my least favorite games I have on my Steam library, and I would not recommend it all."
5144,"The best way I would describe the feeling this game gives you is like being inside a story as its told. The main voice actor has a nice narrating voice which aids this. 
In a way the experience is similar to hiking, It has challenging elements but is always peaceful, and often times stopping to take in the view is part of the experience.  

So if sitting back, listening to a story being told while you take in varying wondrous scenery, as you navigate via neat energy grapple and a few other things sounds like a good time, you'll likely enjoy this.

To give you an idea of play time, I played this through in 2.5 hrs. i wasn't racing but i was going fairly fast and am quite good at grapple games.
There are some extras which can be unlocked, such as a speed run option and a few other neat things which i haven't gotten all of yet."
5145,it a horrible game.
5146,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamazing
5147,Love it! very fun and interactive platformer. only slight problem is sometimes it gets confusing with what you need to do to get farther in the game
5148,"What a wonderful and beautiful game, Yes it's short but the scenery and story and the whole game mechanic make it perfect!
The Achievements are hard and challenging.
definitely recommend it."
5149,"Great game with a great story, it has an amazing gameplay and it's fun."
5150,"It's just like JustCause3, but without guns, cars, enemies, open world, achieves... Sorry, what? You're saying there's nothing left but cool spider-man grapple and beautiful sceneres? Exactly!

I would love this game when I was 3. Or 4.

I use Steam for 8.5 years. I have ~75 games. I played here for ~2000 hours. Finally, the moment has come. 

Lads and Gents, for the first time I'm pressing REFUND button. For the game I've bought for 1$. For the game with 92% positive reviews. Sorry."
5151,asdfasdgasdfasdegarswdysedfhbsdrxhftg
5152,this is a wonderful game it may be short but the scenery and story telling is amazing even if you character models are not very good i liked it very much i loved the smooth grappling physics and the parts that were a tad challenging.
5153,"[h1]One narrative revolving around your parent's sibling.[/h1]
I got this game for free. Yay.

tl;dr It's basically a walking simulator + grappling hooks simulator.

Yes, there's [u]a linear story about your uncle[/u] in this game. No, the game is mostly a platformer.

The story consists of a monologue of the main character telling a story to her daughter(?), while the game plays as an enactment of the story. So, you'll be grappling through floating rocks with your character stopping at some places and continue telling the story before moving on again. Along the game, there's some NPCs that talks to you, they serve as nothing but talking entities.

Overall, the game contains 51% platforming, 29% dialogue, and 20% linear story. Platformers aren't my thing, so I seldom play this game. I don't think you should play this game too, there are many other interesting story games that worth your time.

[h1]This game, explained in terms of other games[/h1]
Platformer + Visual Novel"
5154,"its alright, i did get this for free and it was fun for the first hour but its not my type of game i dont recommend it because its a pretty niche game for a niche audience"
5155,trash
5156,A good story with great platforming and a nice visual style.
5157,Short but sweet. Decent story and beautiful atmosphere.
5158,"To start off, it's a great game with a great mechanic and I would recommend the game if you are looking to have fun. The game overall isn't too bad to play although its not the most complex and the story is very short (2.5-4 hours long). If you are looking the play the game for the story, I would strongly not recommend the game based on the story, but for the fun factory. The game consist of 2 characters whom you would find through out the game: your uncle Fred and a humanoid frog named Maddie. As you explore around with the grappling hook (gloves?), you slowly unlock upgrades which would help last you on your journey to meet your uncle. Now enough of this and lets get to the pros and cons of the game.

Pros:
+Fun mechanics involving with the grappling hook as you play the game.
+A nice game to play when you have some free time to spare around.
+Good sounds.
+There were some levels which were a bit difficult to pass.
+The upgrades is a pretty nice addiction to the game.
+Overall, a chill game to play if you just want to waste some time.

Cons:
-The story is very very short (2.5-4hrs).
-The story isn't all too complex. Don't buy the game for the story.
-The voice acting was just horrible.
-Most of the levels were just plain too simple and easy. 
-The characters absolutely made no sense at all.

Neutral:
-The graphics are alright for 2019, but they weren't bad to say the least.

Overall, the game itself isn't too bad and if you just want to have fun with some spare time, you should play it just for the sake of having fun. Just don't delve too deep and find a complex story because you won't."
5159,Pixel perfect puzzles spoiling experience. Especially room with cubes and following ascending. Why it should be so hard?
5160,Floating blocks... Floating blocks... FLOATING BLOCKS!!!! (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
5161,i loved this game.easy gameplay and good a good story.it was beatiful UNTIL  i saw a character in game.it was just so bad.this game was 9/10 if there wasnt any npc.but now after that eye bleed its 5/10.
5162,"Man I really wanted to like this game, but I did not at all. I just wanted to swing around and have a joy with the grappling. You will not get this from the game. It really offers nothing. The story is bland and get in the way the entire time. He you just had some fun swinging?  Lets take a few moments to lock down all your fun movement and speak exposition at you  have meaningful ideas behind horrible execution. 

I gave up in the ice caves. Randomly falling block with a bad frame rate and no real innovation in the grapple from the first minute of playing. I give up. This is one I will never come back to."
5163,"I LOVED THIS GAME, IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES, 1000 STAR RECOMMENDED, I MAY SOUND LIKE A BOT RN, BUT NOPE, I ACTUALLY GENUINLY LOVE THIS GAME (Just wished they added a lot more stuff, like creating your own levels, and more levels the develpors makes, and shit like that, and hope there is a sequel, proly not tho)"

Comment:
Yes but wtf happened to my suit?"
5165,"I have never enjoyed a game so much and been equally frustrated with it then when I played this game. Very good story, SUPER tight controls (recommend bumping up sensitivity if your using a controller). This is a 1st person platformer with grappling mechanics (somewhat like bionic commando) that has unique levels and great music to match. Level layout can be a bit frustrating as some of the time your not sure where to go, usually have to make a blind leap towards a grapple point to go around corners. Wanted to rage quit several times but stuck it out to the end. Recommend playing in chunks if you get frustrated easy. Overall 4 out of 5

Pros:
Unique Levels
Great Music
Super tight controls
Infinite retries with check points

Cons:
can be confusing on where to go
blind jumps around corners sometimes"
5166,pretty fun wish there were a longer story tho
5167,"Relaxing and a enjoyable game, Must try!"
5168,"I got this game for free as part of some promotion or another and it just sat there in my library for a while. 
When I finally decided to play it I had no idea what kind of game it was. 
Here are my thoughts.

It is a beautiful, non-violent game (apart from falling to your death all the time) with a touching story, well done voice acting and great mechanics.

Something for players like me, who aren't 16 anymore, don't have the most expensive controller and maybe not the greatest of motor skills: This game is too hard for me. There are jumps I simply cannot do. In part because I often do not know where to go or cannot find the one point where my Grapple might attach.
If I could change something about the game it would be more grapple highlights. 
I also have a low frustration threshold for redoing things. 
This could be where I end the review with a ""Cannot recommend"" for a player like me.

But the developers did something very, very clever, something I miss in too many modern games. They added cheats. 
From unlimited grapple to straight out flight, it's all build in. 
So where I would have given up in frustration in many other games, here I could simply fly by the section I could not do to continue the game. The first was some place in the ice cavern where you're supposed to Tarzan under the ceiling and I could not find the last grapple point no matter how often I tried.
So that is a very big bonus for me. Cheats can save any game from being too frustrating and here it is well done. Flight for example automatically deactivates the next time you grapple. So it works extremely well as a ""only activate for this section"" solution. I might have cheated past three sections in total, which did nothing to reduce my fun or challenge, but instead allowed me to enjoy the whole game instead of stopping at the first block.

So if you're like me, do not like to play with mouse and keyboard but aren't the greatest controller-jockey there is: Don't be afraid of this game. It's worth it and you can cheat if you cannot solve something. 

I had a lot of fun and was really sad when it was over."
5169,"So, this was free on Steam a while back. I wasn't sure what to expect. Trine, Talos Principle, Tomb Raider, etc.?

Gameplay itself was questionable at first, but then got much better as I adjusted to it.
It's got a simple, touching backstory that leads to the more fictional for the plot of the game itself.

I died, a lot. But I found myself laughing about it rather than getting frustrated.

Definitely kid-friendly, but I ended up enjoying it a quite bit."
5170,"Relaxing and enjoyable game. I'm recommending this game for periods of time when you just want to jump around and have fun, and listen to relaxing voice of the narrator.
Cool experience, try it out!"
5171,"haha, told you you couldnt do it"
5172,"A bit slow, but in the end a heart warming story of a young boy's search for his Uncle in a strange world. The game mechanic is also quite innovative."
5173,This game is awesome short yet sweet well worth  the $3 I spent on it. Really fun mechanics.
5174,"I very liked it! Everything is on point. Aside from some glitches, but still I would give it 9/10.
Really recommend this game if you like Chill & Backstory games. Been a nice adventure to find Fred. Hopefully there's a Part 2 of this game.

Thank you for making this game!"
5175,"Well worth 2,59‚Ç¨ (on sale) for 2-3 hours of gameplay. 

Nice graphics and cool mechanics!"
5176,really boaring
5177,"Got this game for free (forgot where maybe reddit or humble) and didn't really play it. It was sitting in my steam library for a month or two when I got bored of my current games and decided to try it out. It blew me away. The gameplay was simple yet unique, and the story was astounding. If you are ever browsing for a new game or want something random to play I would highly recommend you play this."
5178,"it ends extremely abruptly

i mean, i got it for free but i'm glad i didn't pay 18.50 for a game that takes 2 hours to complete"
5179,Michael Kim has no idea what hes talking about this is the worst game that has ever touched my game library.
5180,Very good game for 2-3 hours gameplay
5181,"Nice game. 
Good atmosphere and fun gameplay. The story is far from great tho, feels way to forced.

Overall, play it if you like short experiences."
5182,Just a great game.
5183,Actually really enjoying the game - I was surprised!
5184,Fairly short game with a decent story but very fun gameplay.
5185,"Please make another one, this game is amazing"
5186,"A simply outstanding game. A little story from a little company which has the biggest heart. Well written, Spoken and animated, this isn't a game or story filled with big twists and turns and complex controls and new features every five seconds. It has two features that it nails and does so wonderfully. You could argue that its too short, but that is what i love about it and is why anyone who is looking for an uncle Fred worthy adventure should pick this up."
5187,"A simple platform game telling a story about a crazy uncle.

The story is simple yet enjoyable, it isn't anything too great, but it explains what and why on the main points of the story and gives you a purpose to keep going, plus, it also has some great voice acting.

The mechanics are straight foward and allows you to have some control to how you decide to complete each level. It may get a bit repetitive in some levels since there are just a few mechanics to play around.
The level design is well thought out but nothing too extraordinary.

The visuals of each level are very nice, it has a nice atmosphere and each region you visit feels unique from one to another, even though they all have similar design.

Overall, simple game but brings a nice experience.

6 / 10 (Good)"
5188,"Is this game worth $13? No. At the most, I'd say $7, but that's even pushing it. A lot of times you die and it doesn't even seem like it's your fault. The story and characters feel rushed and cliche. I can't stand the sound of Maddie's voice. She honestly pisses me off so much I can't take it. Overall, the game sometimes feels like a mess. 

But it is a REALLY fun mess. The gameplay is so simple, and so much fun. But don't buy it for full price. Buy it on a sale like I did. There's just not enough content to warrant a $13 price tag. So I do recommend it, but only when it's on sale."
5189,"Wow,it a great game"
5190,Love jumping around like a lunatic? Look no further!
5191,Such a relaxing and cool game with great storyline ! You are going to love this game as soon as you buy it !
5192,"The spiderman simulator you never knew you wanted. A touching story, great soundtrack and good level design. Finished the game in 3 hours in my first try with half the items collected for the unlockables. It was hard enough for me to die over 100 times but balanced enough to let you pass after a few tries. I did survive in a few places by landing on spots not planned by the game designers (I mean I abused the physics by accident here and there) but that only added to the experience since there's more than one way to progress (some times). Quite enjoyed the ceiling grappling section at the end when at first you just have to boost down and trust that the developers actually put something there to hang onto. But there were a few areas where I was cursing the developers for not putting any checkpoints and forcing us to go through everything in one go... although with enough attempts you get used to those as well. Really liked the game as an experience but I don't think I'll try to grind for the other 12 hidden items. Looking forward to more games from this studio"
5193,"I thought it would be just an exploration game with a jumping suit and a strange world. Turns out its that but with a whole plot behind it, a lot of things to make you think about life,family,relationships. Its basically a feel trip. Gameplay is good,mechanics are good enough but the story and the emotions this game can give you is what truly makes it remarkable. Just give it a try if you like a good story."
5194,"SO.

The story, it really tells alot, it has a very unique style and a very relaxing game.

10/10 - Bought in when it was on sale but would buy it even for full price."
5195,"VERRY GOOD YOU NEED TO TRY IT.
its like an adventure with grapling hook !


4 / 5 
It was a bit laggy but i have a bacd computer !"
5196,"Despite the short story, I think this game is very good, specially for having it for free. I think this game could have a longer story line."
5197,Amazing Storyline but the tutorial is outstrecthed and seems like interminable just roaming around the world in the suit with no engaging interactions or AI.It's fun to dabble around with suit but after a while it gets tedious.
5198,"epic

also for the received for free thing it was on sale for free with like only an hour left and i got it then"
5199,Pretty nice game with somewhat nice and quick story. Graphics were great but could have made some scene or cinematic for its appreciation. Overall would recommend for a quick game.
5200,This game was brilliant. Stunning. I loved every minute of it. Thank you for this treasure.
5201,Great story but kinda bad voice-acting.
5202,my fav platform
5203,"If you get it on discount - go for it. It was nice 2 hrs of gamplay, however it ain't worth that much money."
5204,very fun game for a short amount of money
5205,"It's fitting A Story About My Uncle seems to have lept from the silver screen, given it's a game all about, well, leaping. There's a touch of the Percy Jackson or Inkhart about its story in which a young boy inherits a magical jumping glove from his explorer uncle and follows his trail through vast cloud cities, mystical mountain passes, and twinkling shrines. It's pure children's adventure fantasy.

Further into this non-violent, narrative-driven platformer you discover more fantastic gadgetry. Along with the glove that boosts you 20ft off the ground after releasing RMB there's a plasma grappling hook on LMB that latches onto any surface and whips you through the air, and space-bar-activated rocket boots to extend jumps in a blurry blast. The game's at its best when you're combining them‚Äîsprinting straight off sheer cliffs, tethering onto windmills, slingshotting around great floating balls of stone and rocketing skyward before you fall too far into the misty void below. It's some of the most tight and responsive first-person platforming I've ever played."
5206,"True the game has a quirky title, but what the hell?
Game play was smooth.  The learning curve for player control quite small.  Graphics are decent enough.  Gameplay is quite forgiving.  This is a puzzle game and you will need to think about your moves.  The game is not overly challenging, well until you try for the achievements.  My first play through, not a one earned.   That does not mean they are impossible.

Overall I rate this game based on who should play it.
Non-violence based puzzle hounds four stars.

Fast paced ""No camping"" COD 'Nade Spammers, I give it a two star.

Overall Game based solely on it's own merits I give it 3 1/2 stars because there is room for improvement.

Minimum age to play 4. max age is unlimited.

"
5207,"This game is super chill, and amazing. Great relaxing game."
5208,Quick to beat. Story is awful. Gameplay is fun though.
5209,nice
5210,Leafy played it
5211,Banging
5212,Very fun game
5213,This game is just great i wanna see another one !
5214,"The game and music are both very good. But once you get to the ""challenge"" part where the Girl riding your back (don't remember her name) challenges you to get through a section without using the grapple. Heads up, turn off your voice volume. Every time you accidentaly use your grapple she says in an annoying voice ""Haha, told you you couldn't do it!"", you'll get annoyed by it very quickly"
5215,"Having played and literally forced myself to go on and finish A Story about My Uncle, I can‚Äôt say I care much for this game. It‚Äôs a 3D platform game in the bad sense of the word. There are no puzzles, no sophistication, no thinking involved. You simply jump from one ledge to the next, hopefully landing on the spot you were aiming for and not falling into the abyss below - an annoyance you will end up enduring hundreds of times, especially in the final stages which are insanely hard. The one special thing about this game is your grappling glove, which you can use to swing from one jump to the next, somewhat like Spiderman shooting his webs. There‚Äôs really not much else there, and I found this game a rather bland and annoying experience."
5216,good game
5217,Amazing and definitely worth the money and the time. Really wish the story was longer ;_;
5218,"LIE DOWN, TRY NOT TO CRY, CRY A LOT. But wait, these are tears of happiness not sadness. Really interesting story and challenging gameplay"
5219,"10/10

+ great story
+ hooking around the world just feels so good
- quite short
+ can play over and over after taking a few months break"
5220,fun game with good story and good graphics.
5221,"This was the most captivating game I have ever played. Too bad that it's so short.
10/10 great storyline :3"
5222,"this is a great game the story is a bit short but good i wish to see more of this game maybe ""a story about my uncle 2"""
5223,Great game definitely recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle platformer games with unique movement.
5224,A great story and a really nice game though incredibly unforgiving and frustrating at times.  Game mechanics evolve as the game progresses.  Good duration: longer and I would probably have given up.
5225,"A Story about my uncle has an adorable story. The game is made up like a bed time story, where a young boy goes on an adventure in an unknown world to find his missing uncle. The idea is simple, but still nice. I enjoyed it, that every time you exit the game the narrator says ""It's getting late. Should we continue tommorw?"". I know that this is just a small detail, it's a cute idea though. The design of the world you play in is unique and really stylish. Ones can clearly see that the developers put a lot of love into the game.

Despite the story being quite good, there are some things that extremely bothered me. The game was sometimes so.... dark that I had a very hard time coordinating where I am going, wether I go in the right direction or even where I have to go next, even though I turned my screen as bright as possible.  Once in a while I ran in a circle, due to the way being not clear. It was just so confusing that I had to watch a walkthrough video on YouTube to continue this game properly. In addition the game play and game control were f*cked up sometimes. Somehow things that worked 20 times in a row suddenly didn't work at all for some unknown reason, even though I did the exact same thing over and over again. Furthermore the game was bugging regularly, especially when the narrator was telling something, only the subtitles were showing and there was little to no voice to hear. Furthermore this game has basically no soundtrack. The player just has the sounds of the charakter while completing the game. To my mind the game could use some music here and there to underline the atmosphere, because this bare silence is hardly bearable. Moreover what also bothered me was the lack of entertainment, because all you do is basically jumping or flying (or whatever you want to call it) from one platform to another. It's like a first person jump and run game, because this is the only thing you do in this game.

To take everything into consideration the game design and storyline is actually really cute, but what I'm missing is the fun while playing. Consequently I wouldn't play this game again and don't recommend buying it."
5226,Good
5227,"Awesome graphic, well designed gameplay, emotional and interesting story!
If you want to relax your mind, I really suggest you this one!"
5228,settings broken unplayable DPS
5229,"The story is simple and even primitive. Visuals are great. Gameplay is not too polished - sometimes your forward-jump doesn't work as well, and instead of keeping combo-swings you can just land on a rock to replenish energy most of the time. But overall it's an enjoyable game. I would've loved it if I was a kid."
5230,nice
5231,"Short but beautiful. The gameplay is quite fluid, the grappling is done very well, and the movement is smooth. Not janky like in some other games. The sound is pleasing, and the graphics stunning. The story is probably the weakest part of the game, but even that is pretty good too. Easy 9.5/10"
5232,Very nice
5233,"A game you play because you want to experience and listen to the story. With that comes the only minus in this game; the teller/character you play has a really annoying accent sometimes. Made me wish several times I could just read the subtitles instead of hearing him. :^)

Overall a great game, got some difficult stages where, atleast, I ragequit and came back the next day to complete it pretty easy. Cute and spooky."
5234,this is a horrible game it is not playable i am struggling in the easiest levels because the game suddenly stops moving i would be move too fast for the stupid game and it lags stops i cant play it tried lowering the specs it still trash i dont recommend it at all if you want a mess about a grappling hook and a jump boost then play this
5235,"Loved this game, reminded me a lot of the Portal games. Excellent game play, great story, difficult puzzles. Definitely recommended."
5236,"Not a bad game, good story, short, average graphics, average voice effects."
5237,"This game is phenomenal, the art, the gameplay, the sound, and the story are all amazing. If you have some money to spare, and some time on your hands, get this game, you won't regret it.
I love this game.
11/10"
5238,kind of short but fun game play with a creative story line

5240,"That was a good game. once you get the frog people, I really fun."
5241,"Not exactly what I was expecting, but still a good game. Though the swinging could be better."
5242,"My 100 percent honest review of A Story About My Uncle?
I absolutly loved it! Even for its lower end graphics (which allows more players due to PC hardware limitation) it still looked pretty great. The soothing voice over was a big positive in my opinion. Now don't get me wrong, some parts were deffinetly frustrating and easily able to anger me, but other than that and the sadly short length of the game.. I find it to be a fantastic game if your looking for a simple yet fun and envolving story."
5243,"I somewhat enjoyed this game, it was something I wouldn't have bought myself as I'm not a fan of doing a million jumping puzzles but it wasn't terrible.  The art style is nice and the games cure. The story was interesting but I felt the ending is a bit weird.
Definitely give the game a go if it comes around for free again or if its on sale for super super cheap but I don't recommend it as the type of game I'd pay more than a few dollars for if I didn't get it for free!

You can always check out my playthrough below if you want an idea of the game or just want to see the story!

5244,"Horrible graphics, totally breaks the immersion. The voice over feels cheap and stale. Clunky controls. An hour has enough for me on this one, happy I didn't pay for it."
5245,"The game itself isn't that bad; it can even be a good relaxing platformer for Windows users. But on Linux, there are MASSIVE performance issues.

Like I said, it's a platformer. Jumping works. The charge jump takes a little long to work. Grappling also works. Sometimes you latch on to surfaces at weird angles and you go in strange directions though. There are stages. They're all flying rocks in one form or another. The narrative hook is that the game is a bedtime story a father tells his daughter about her inventor great-uncle. It's not terribly creative; there's not even much story there for most of the levels. For a game that's only a few bucks, I could forgive these things.

But I cannot recommend the game with this kind of performance. It was fine at first (although the menus didn't work), but during the last 3 levels the game would totally lock up my Linux rig. I couldn't get pass a ""boss fight"" without having to restart my whole computer. That is until the boss just stopped working and I waltzed past it. I get to halfway through the next level and -- guess what? -- another freeze. I give up. I got the game for free and I feel like my time was a waste."
5246,The game looks great and the concept is fun and unique.  My issue is that some areas are so frustratingly difficult that it completely ruins the game for me.  15 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to get past the same spot isn't fun.
5247,"Fun and relaxing time.


I hope that frog-salamander wannabe Maddie dies because of that no grapple achievement.


Thank you, have a good day."
5248,Good game
5249,"The game has nice graphics and art style, although the quality of both is inconsistent. Same goes for the level design which dips down the drain right after the first level. And the first level is a very good looking level i must say, almost deceptively good, abundant with details such as little notes replete with text , some photos and items, all that little details that gives story a context, which is always good.

The story is cute, i guess. I don't really want to say  anything negative about it. Anything that is not ""kill that guy, he be mean"" is already a plus, in my book.

But the gameplay, the gameplay is just a gigantic bore, lackluster. Run from one rock to another. Jump the rocks. Hover along the flying rocks. Seriously it's all you freaking do there, and not much else. The game seems stretched just for the sake of longevity, just so you don't refund it.
I found myself wishing the platforming part to end at about 15 minutes in. You jump the rock - then you jump some other rock higher up thinking it would be the end of the torture , only to find more of the same dull goddamn platforming action. Worst of all is all the dull moments are followed by almost complete silence from the narrator, because some story would greatly make up for some  the tedium of the gameplay mechanics.

I also feel like i shouldn't really compain, about it all since i got the game for free and all. But honestly i played it for 30 minutes and it already bored the hell out of me, not sure what other great adventures waited me there - i think ill better go watch the grass grow. If you respect your time - i advise you to choose some other game to play. Unless you are autistic or you just enjoy the monotone action, in which case - go ahead !"
5250,"this game is very fun , rich in story and has the perfect amount of challenge there are awesome parkour elements and its always bringing something new your way"
5251,"A short and sweet first-person platformer about finding your uncle.

Mostly consists of arena based momentum trials about using grapling hook, jumps etc. to reach the end. Reminiscent of Valley in many ways.
Some story sections in between that keeps the plot moving.

Looks pretty good, with some great vistas popping up along the way.

Can be frustrating at times, but in the end worth a try.
It's fairly short, so take that into consideration when looking at the price.

Runs well on linux with open source drivers (radeonsi), which is always great to see."
5252,My uncle raped me
5253,This Game is all about a man who got his grandfather's supersuit and flew away into another world with unusual creatures.
5254,I knew you couldn't do iiit.
5255,"Enjoyed the platformer, the game is looks beautiful and the story is touching, simple game play so it doesnt detract from the story, wish maybe for a sequel!"
5256,"Although relatively short A Story About my Uncle is a fun and fantastical romp. Movement is an engaging and evolving puzzle and the world and story provide excellant motivation and enviromental wonder.
It's a game I'm sure I'll revisit and enjoy again and again."
5257,"Fun game but it can be frustrating at points in a good way. Playing with the Steam controller is terrible, but swapped to the Xbox controller and had a great time playing. Art style is great and the story is pretty good. Enjoyed playing it."
5258,Short story but ok! 7/10
5259,"Beautiful, short, fun game about a boy who's searching for his uncle, that's all.
"
5260,"Really Nice Game 

(:"
5261,very fun to play when intoxicated
5262,LOVEE THIS GAMEEEEEEEEE
5263,"this game honestly just felt amazing to play. i cant even explain it, just feels amazing."
5264,Cool interesting game.
5265,"The mechanic of the game is cool but the graphics are always the best like seeing characters. Also it isn't ever clear when your game is save. You may play the game for the hour, like I did and quit. Then later find that you can't continue from where you left off. The game can be very frustrating and can be a bit unclear of where you need to go next. Overall not a good game, interesting story/idea and a mechanic that seems fun but can be frustrating."
5266,It took me just 3 hours to finish the game but I enjoyed it quite a bit. The story is ok but not spectacular. It's really just a few hours of fun swinging around with your grapling hook
5267,"You might want to wait for a sale for this one. However, if you're looking for 3 solid hours of relaxed, leaping fun (more if you want the achievements) then I'd recommend this game. I love the mechanics and the upgrades you get over time. The story is okay but isn't compelling whatsoever. Level design is usually good and quite aesthetically pleasing.

The only two things that I really couldn't stand were the characters/NPCs (frighteningly robotic movements and frankly terrible voice acting) as well as the sudden ending. You're hopping around having a blast... what's this? The game is over?! I feel like the game was cut short, which is a shame. The ending had real potential to be emotionally moving, but I just hadn't quite developed a connection with the characters. In the end, [spoiler] you find your uncle, he sends you back home, and voila he's gone again here's a memorial for him in his old house. [/spoiler]"
5268,great game and story line  easy to follow along and does offer some challenge but all in a good game to grab
5269,"https://youtu.be/ndnKu8efJbQ

Certainly something different - a story driven first person platformer. The visuals are very impressive, and the audio and voice acting fit well into the game. 

The controls do take a little getting used too at first, but this is not a hardcore platformer by any means. With that said there are a few challenging moments, but they are not the main aim of the game. This is a good thing as it avoids the game being too frustrating. In fact the is an all most relaxing vibe to a lot of the game and only the last level will provide any real platforming challenge, and it does ramp up the difficulty quite a bit there. 

So if you want something that is a short diversion and generally well done, and certainly different then this is worth a look, but the short playtime may make buying on a sale advisable."
5270,i sped this too much
5271,LOVELY
5272,it good
5273,this game is thus the fun game i ever had
5274,Got it for free but not worth your time. Terrible controls.
5275,"Heartwarming, short but memorable experience with lots of attention to detail in easter eggs and very nice art direction. Who doesn't love some grapple mechanics a la Spiderman?
The main (and huge) downside: achievements have been designed terribly. What should remain as chilling, almost-ASMR dialogues become unbearable lines that you are forced to listen to over and over if you want to make the perfect/limited grapple challenges. Maddie used to be my adorable companion in my first run; now that I'm hunting the achievements I want to shut her mouth for good so I can skip the mandatory dialogue scenes. Grappling is often not user-friendly AT ALL, with corners and collisions that interrupt the player's run and force him/her to start all over again. Almost seems like levels have not been tested fully to check if the achivements are viable.
But really, it's a very good game if you play it only once and will take you just a few hours."
5276,"got it when it was free, would still pay full price if i had to"
5277,"The game has a nice idea of first person platforming at first, but the narrative got old and it grew tedious with the grappling hook.  I'm glad humble bundle does give games away like this for free so people who enjoy games of different variety, but its not for me."
5278,"Great game, short but i enjoyed every minute"
5279,"Omg,even if i buy thsi game on full price it is still worth every penny. i see the game crafted with love and passion.  The soundtrack are wonderfull. The negative is it's too short for a adventure story"
5280,"I usaully don't write reveiws for games or anyhting, but i this game was so goods i thought i might as well. I played it from front to back in one siitting. Great game, would reccomend"
5281,"Great game! Had so much fun with this mechanic, swinging from one area to the other. The story was a bit strange and the ending was surprising. The characters didn‚Äôt look so great, but it didn‚Äôt matter because the mechanic fixed everything. I definitely think that this game is worth its price, although I got it for free.

8/10 - Very good."
5282,"To be perfectly honest its kinda boring. 

Dont get me wrong. The controls and the settings are very solid. The Story is decent but a bit short for my taste. 

All in all i needed just short of 2 hours for the whole game.

Id say get it if you like a relaxing game you can casually play on a thursday night."
5283,"This game was available for free for a short time and I decided... Why not? I installed it and I was pleasantly surprised by what the game had to offer. It was very peaceful- except for one part which I wont spoil but was still really interesting- and I could play it again to get all the achievements if I had some more dedication, haha. It took me about 3 and a half hours to complete but I tend to be a little slower at completing games because I want to see everything so... I'd say the typical play time  is about 2 and half hours at a steady pace. All and all, 9/10. Good graphics. Good story. Good gameplay."
5284,"It took me way too long to finish this game compared to other players, but it was so worth the time. In A Story About My Uncle you become a part of a simple story. It pulls you into a beautiful and magical world you get to jump through. Even though I was somewhat impatient at times, I felt relaxed playing this game. The ending was touching, so you might have to get yourself some tissues. I highly recommend going to explore this beautiful world :)."
5285,great but short
5286,"[list]
  [*] Atmospheric sounds and music
  [*] Storytelling is done very well, it has a simple plot but is told in a way that will make you interested in it
  [*] Movement and impact on landing really feels the way it should, I would sometimes move IRL and look like an idiot due to immersion
  [*] The level design is properly made, sometimes I felt lost but I think I was supposed to, even though I've always found the right direction
[/list]
   It was free like a month ago but I'd gladly pay for it, because every dollar/euro/powercore would be well spent."
5287,The Best Story game I ever played. Love this game. Very Goog Job !!! I hope you make a second part.
5288,"Enjoyed it a lot! The mechanics are great fun to play around with. The levels progress in design complexity at a nice pace, always keeping it interesting. Finished the game in  a few hours, which was ideal. The story is a bit simple and childish, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. A short well-made game which is great to spend a few hours on."
5289,"After 1 min: Oh! He jumped so high.
After 5 mins: Wow! Super jump!
After 10 mins: HOLY SHIT!!!"
5290,Fantastic adventureÔºå Thanks

5293,A Story About Maddie
5294,"Great Game, with amazing visuals, satisfying controls, an amazing story, and just the right amount of challenge!

If you think it was too difficult, git gud son :D"
5295,This is a great parkour game that has a good story. 11/10 for all the upgrades and interesting mechanics.
5296,yes
5297,"this game is good in the form of graphics and gameplay but you can tell the developers didnt focus too much on minor details and the ""vagueness"" of the quest. often times you will find yourself confused on where to go and what to do. would recomend if you have a lot of time and patience, otherwise, just buy another adventure game."
5298,Great fun little game
5299,"pretty good game
it short, good difficult curve
but story real bad, feel like written by child simple brain
story either boring or so bad and cliche that I laugh like a fucking monkey"
5300,"This game  has an amazing story, and very immersive. I was into the game the whole time, and it was a blast the whole time. I never got bored, but the game can be somewhat challenging  at certain times.  Overall, it was really enjoyable and beautiful.Thumbs up. :) Would definitely play a sequel."
5301,"Fun parkour, beautiful graphics & great story"
5302,A game for those that want to play the same thing over and over and when you fail you go back far enough that you have to work to the point you want to play over and over. The devs rely on checkpoints way before hard parts to make it hard. Unoriginal lack of creativity.
5303,"Very kind and pleasant story.
Gameplay just perfect for game like this.
8\10"
5304,"Short, but nice little indie first-person platformer.

The game mechanic revolves around navigating obstacles by using and changing momentum with a grappling device, that let's you move toward a given object.

Fun, but almost no story and, again, very, very short. Pick this up for a Euro or two, but not more."
5305,"Atmospheric first person platforming jumping challenge vignette with a story and perspective from a child's eyes looking for a lost uncle in a fantastical world. Controls can have vastly variable responsiveness on different systems. Considering the age & engine the game was built on the graphics are decent for the time. There is no death or failure state so the efforts are in chipping away at the jumping challenges with regular checkpoints autosaved for convenience. More complex jumping paths are added with the main challenge in  positioning the camera for mid flight course corrections. Easter eggs are left by the developers for users like collectables, a goat mode (related to a previous game the developers made), translating the secret messages and more. I would recommend it for someone with a certain game system, if they enjoy first person platforming challenges and they are looking for a relaxed setting. Unfortunately I had to switch hardware for a bit of this, (found the controls less relaxing), and without the offer may not have seen it and then missed the story."
5306,"Played through the whole game in one sitting (2.4h) and enjoyed it very much.
But 12,99‚Ç¨ is too expensive for such a short game."
5307,got this from humblebudle and it is fun but kinda small
5308,"Not Very long but for the time i played it, it was very fun and sometimes made me rage but what doesn't make me rage.

Graphics are amazing and was one of the best parts of it. Seeing all of the creatures in detail was amazing.

Story is short but enjoyable but it is mainly the mechanics that make the game great. I didn't care about the story i just found the visuals and exploration fun.

I would recommend buying but wait till it is on sale don't get it full price for 3 hours of gameplay."
5309,its cool.
5310,it was a pretty short story though
5311,"A droll platformer that is as dark as deep space, even on max brightness"
5312,this game is complete ass coz its too short
5313,"Awesome game!
I had a ton of fun playing it"
5314,"Buen juego, jugue esta en mi cuenta anterior durante muchas horas, pero jugarla de nueva se vuelve un poco aburrida"
5315,Fun to play. I like the enviromental.
5316,Story line is really good. Highly recommend if you like single player games.
5317,"Too hard for my casual ass.

But really, fun at first then tediously repetitive. It was nice to see something kinda new (the blocks) but that was only for a small amount of time. Frustrating sometimes, and the ending was short and disappointing.."
5318,"Beautifully crafted, relaxing. Don't expect crazy action, this is a lovely bedtime story. Cheers!"
5319,The controls are uncertain and inconsistent which  gives  a hard time (not the fun but the annoying hard time) i wouldn't pay for it if i were you
5320,Really great movement mechanics make up for it's slow pace. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in a physics platformer with lots of swinging.
5321,good game to go for a adventure.
5322,absolutely loved the game
5323,"Good and emotional story. I like this game, but some bugs are spoils the feeling of the game."
5324,"It is an OK game. If you know what you're getting then get it on sale.

I found it to be one-dimensional, and tedious within 15 minutes of play.  I can't seem myself carrying on with this when I have 50+ games waiting to be played in my library.

I'm  not saying it is a bad game, but it is shallow and does nothing to hook the player. If you see more than 20 minutes of playtime its because I'm idling for cards.  This game bores the Sh.. out of me."
5325,"A boring platforming walking sim.

For a platformer the first thing that is needed is to make it feel good to move around the 3D space and have it control good.
This game does not"
5326,Great story and puzzles
5327,"It has a dynamic feel that brings a very satisfying feeling, this game made me rage so much because of how responsive the controls.
9/10"
5328,"interesting and very enjoyable game which finished way too quickly. the achievements aren't easy to unlock,  the game itself is amazing; great story and even greater graphics."
5329,"VA's a bit annoying, underrated game"
5330,"Rather short for a story (only 3 hours!).It is however a creative Gameplay idea,(not helped by the games constant hand holding)while this product proved worth my while it's flaws are in the *NPC's!*. Can I even say that? they don't really move or do much unless they are important/interact with the player.the textures are dated.Like no shade to the dev's team but like,
the Rocks and miscellaneous item's look better than the *NPC's* do. 

this game is great and I would definitely recommend if free.But is simply to short and low quality to buy."
5331,sicc
5332,Amazing
5333,Beautiful fantasy worlds perfect for parkour gameplay :)
5334,"Good story and mechanics, I'd like that suit in all first person games :)"
5335,nobody EVER has played this game for the story.
5336,"Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good commentary and I like 2016"
5337,I loved ASAMU it was a wonderful narrativley told story that had such amazing graphics to it. I loved the voice actor and his ability to tell the story while I was re living my moments as a crystal freak spiderman. The ending was absolutley amazing! Well done guys!
5338,"Indie first person platformer. Yes, I know, totally recipe for disaster right? Well the saving grave here is that as well as jumping you get a science-y hookshot thing and a pair of rocket boots so you're not relying entirely, or indeed often, on pixel perfect landings. And for a decent chunk of the game it works; grappling around the place is great fun and it becomes more of a Spiderman simulator than anything else. Things take a turn for the frustrating though in the last level when the difficulty jump up and by the end of that level, which feels like it goes on for fucking ever, you're happy for it to end. It's a shame as there's definitely potential there, but in the end the randomly varying difficulty (you'll breeze through huge swathes of it then have to re-try a particular section twenty times) and the fact that it's not always clear where you're supposed to be going take the shine off it. I imagine the latter is to give an open enough design for speed runners to pick different routes through, and certainly I expect to find YouTube video full of people doing jaw-dropping stuff with the game, but it just annoyed me personally."
5339,Whacky first person puzzle esque adventure game
5340,"it's now running for 3 hours straight while i can't do anything about that. i can't uninstall cuz it keeps running, When i close steam the app also keeps running"
5341,"This is a game that made me wish for a middle-ground rather than a 'yay/nay' system. It's not that it's a bad game, it's fun, but my 'recommendation' has a few caveats. 
If a friend were to say they were interested in this game, the first thing I would tell them is that you are at the MERCY of the physics engine, and it has none. You will feel cheap fall after cheap fall and wish there was a clamber system or your character could reach out and grab the edge rather than slide their face against rock.
Don't get me wrong, when you're running and swinging, timing momentum and leaping across floating platforms, this is an AMAZING game. Exactly the type I wanted.
My background is that I played 'The Unfinished Swan' and fell IN LOVE with that style of 'simple indie game with one fleshed-out mechanic and a family-friendly story', and this certainly falls into that category. If a friend was truly interested in this game, I wouldn't turn them away, but you should be prepared for cheap deaths and frustration.

On a technical note, I want to talk about 'cycles'. from what I can tell, this game runs on 'global cycles', that is to say, when you respawn, the platforms were still in motion; not reset. If frustrated from a 'near miss', then you may rush ahead through a section you completed only to find the platforms are in different spots than the last time, and die again. 
While I know patience is the answer, frustration melts patience faster than ice in boiling water.

Edit* later on, after the game introduces rocket boots, the already spread out levels stop pretending to be puzzles of any kind, and deveolve into 'find the only thing in range and grapple to it'."
5342,"Beautiful game.

The movement system is very fun and sometimes challenging but extremely straightforward and the areas are fluid.
The graphics are very nice even for a 5 year old game.
The story is pretty good also."
5343,Pretty crap overall story bad graphics bad i didn't like it wasn't interesting or fun
5344,Very enjoyable and well made.  The developers deserve a round of applause.  Great mechanics and interesting parkour
5345,:(
5346,"Got this game during the Steam giveaway and never really touched it since I downloaded it, until now. It turned out to be surprisingly fun, very short tho!"
5347,He did things
5348,"Nice game mechanics, story is a bit cheesy"
5349,Probably the best 2 hours in my gaming experience (4 hours afk time)
5350,"Hey! I got this for free a while ago, finally got around to playing it the other night and was pleasantly surprised! Thanks for making such a kiff game."
5351,"Great game in the line of ""Portal"" or ""The Talos Principle"", if you like FPS puzzlers.  Even with a few rough edges, like the room of falling blocks, it's still generally a great game that does a good job of gradually introducing mechanics & incrementing the difficulty as you learn them.

The story's decent too."
5352,"Notice: this game is not for people who are afraid of heights/falling! And you will fall a lot..

This game is somewhat similar to a game like Portal, you have to keep jumping and flying and try and fail and try again to reach that next savepoint. There is a backstory of trying to find your uncle, which is rather meagre but still arguably better than trying to complete one test chamber after the other because of reasons, although it is understandable that a game like this misses the humour of a game like Portal and in many other ways other than the basics is not comparable to it, as one is made by a big studio and the other isn't. But this game is sometimes beautiful, sometimes frustrating, sometimes sentimental, it is not a big game and I am not sure it has much if any replay value. The way the game is also a little frustrating, the distance at which you can grapple seems completely arbitrary and sometimes jumps/grapples fail even though you feel you did it exactly right. But there is is enough fun to be had that I can see potential for a sequel and for a reasonable price, such as the equivalent of a movie ticket or less, I would buy it, for that is about the amount of entertainment you get, although without the popcorn, you will have your hands full as it is. You can have many unanswered questions about this game and it would be nice to see more of the world it takes place in. If they do this, I would recommend fleshing out the story a little and providing a little more closure."
5353,"Best storybase game 
This game makes me always emotional when I play"
5354,"Pros:
- Fun parkour mechanics
- Multiple ways to solve most sections
- Very satisfying to pull off a string of great moves

Cons:
- Too short (it took me 2 hours to complete the game, but about 45 minutes of that was on trying to get that damn ""Maddie's Challenge"" achievement)
- Horrible writing
- Hilariously bad voice acting
- Atrocious 3D graphics for the characters (the rest of the game is fine, but I can't believe how bad the ""people"" look)

I got this while it was free. I recommend this game for free, as well as for a few bucks. But anything more than $5? Nah. There are plenty more parkour games like this that have better bang for your buck."
5355,"Kinda crappy tbh. Its a super cool concept and mechanics start really nice but the further you go and the more mechanics are introduced the sloppier it gets cause the mechanics arent tight or responsive enough. Its also super buggy, ive fallen countless times cause the grappler just wouldnt grab onto something that was clearly reachable, gotten stuck on walls several times, and numerous other annoying albeit minor bugs.
Level design leaves a lot to be desired, especially with such a potential for something exceptional in this area, but apparently its still important to keep kilometers of space below most levels just so you can fall and have to wait half a fu∆àking hour to respawn.

Idk, just a lot of things rubbed me the wrong way about this game and they kept piling up to the point were i just couldnt recommend this.
Cool, potential, but just super sloppy execution."
5356,"This game in short was a great platformer that many could understand and enjoy. For me, this easily satisfied my gaming style and opinion of freerunning/platformer games. Great game, should buy."
5357,"An immersive, extraordinary game, tha reelly dirrerent from the others. The game itself is simple but very enjoyable.  It is exciting and also cute. I never have a so good experience like this before.  It is a short game, but it is worth that small amount of time.

I finished the game from zero to hero in 3 hours."
5358,"WOW! 
I just finished the game and it just blew my mind! 

It felt like a dream and it was a wonderful one, i dont even know what else to say.. 
It is an amazing experience and you should definitely try it!!

10 / 10 !!"
5359,"Once upon a time, my uncle put on his magic suit and started exploring a magical world,
he jumped off cliff - on to a another cliff with target painted on it... and then!  he jumped off another cliff, on to another cliff with target painted on it, AND THEN! he jumped off another cliff, on to another cliff with target painted on it... 
....but this time he missed and he died, 
So he respawned and tried again, but he missed and he died again!, 
So he respawned and tried again, but he missed and he died again!, 
So he respawned and tried again, but he missed and he died again!, 
And then he gave up!

Good Night!

5360,"Nice game to play on a sunday night! Quick interactive and the ""story"" is quite good,"
5361,Good game
5362,Nice little story would recommend if you just have two hours to kill or if you want a quick movement based game.
5363,a bit short but nice experience :)
5364,Really Fun Game
5365,"If you want to buy this game. BUY IT RIGHT NOW!
 ==============================ùìüùìªùì∏ùìº===================================================
-The story is so good even if it's not that complex it's just a little story about you finding your lost uncle
-The mechanics in this game are so well made
-The parkour is way more better than the one in Assassin's Creed

I give this game: 9.5/10 with a gold medal!"
5366,"I have to say, this game was so much fun!! I just wish it was a bit longer... I really really enjoyed it, a bit of a break from all the evil shoot and kill sort of games. This was just a chill and relaxing game. I would  recommend this game highly."
5367,Me me sad :(
5368,Great Story. Great Game. 9/10
5369,"My Uncle touches me in my no no spots, is this normal? Please send help!"
5370,A good game to just ride along with.
5371,Got the game in a 5 dollar 10 steam keys pack and I gotta say it's a good game
5372,Fun
5373,"Pretty cool game!  It's a great puzzle platformer where the difficulty and challenges ramp up at just the right pace.  I played through the first half with a controller, but had to switch to keyboard and mouse once I got to the last act.  The story is a bit cliched and the voice acting is mediocre, but it was touching nonetheless.  The world looked fantastic.  I'm a sucker for starry skies.  If you've got a couple bucks and a few hours to spare, definitely give it a go if you're looking for an easygoing adventure."
5374,"This is a great game with a pretty good story

I just wish it was longer with more to explore"
5375,Its has fun gameplay
5376,"This is game gets you in a ride that you will love , not only for the mechanics and the complexity of some levels , but the story is kinda interesting . But , the only bad thing that i can say about this game is that , it is too short, and that shows by my only 2 hour playtime of the game, and i've got this game yesterday.
Other than that, this game is awesome and you should definetly pick it up for a great adventure."
5377,This game is soooooooo nice!!!!
5378,Â•ΩÁé©
5379,ehh
5380,"Awesome game!
I had a ton of fun playing it , the storybase is pretty decent and every world has it's own unique beauty and style to it!
I recommend this cool game to any adventure lover! 
"
5381,good game
5382,Good game 10/10. I enjoyed my 4h on this game.
5383,"My expectations were certainly way higher.
It starts pretty good, but it gets boring way too fast.
The further you get into the game, the cheaper and unpolished feels the experience.
I'm sorry, but I didn't enjoy playing it, at all."
5384,"10/10
Intense, challenging, and fun.
"
5385,extraordinary
5386,"The game is amazing
Graphic : 10/10
Story : 11/10
Music: 10/10
it's amazing when u can feel the movements of ur character 
U should try it at least one time
and it's fast to play and fun too."
5387,Grappling hooks. They're great. They're a great mechanic in pretty much every game that has them. This game is based entirely around grappling hooks. This game is great.
5388,"A really nice game. I feel that gamemakers should strive for this kind of game, it presents you with controls, let's you get familiar and then ramps up the difficulty. I feel that it could benefit from being longer however, otherwise 10/10.
Edit: After playing the game more it has replayability, but it's just not enjoyable. For example, I wanted to get a few of the achievements such as completing a level under a maximum amount of jumps or without dying, but you have to complete them in story mode for it to count. This means waiting through cutscenes and having to go back to the menu to reset. I also feel that although the chasms level is interesting when you first play it from a narrative standpoint, it just becomes uncomfortable when replaying the level on its own. Revised score 8.5/10."
5389,Storyline is quite good but there is low replayability and it‚Äôs quite short. Reccomend to buy during a sale :)
5390,Lovely üíï
5391,Yes.
5392,"Granted ... ive only played 1.2 hrs of the game .. but .. The 2nd area killed it for me after i failed to get a jump of which i tried at least x30 times. 

Because I cannot get any further in this near precsion mouse aiming game, the game ceases with not much else to do :(   

Seems a casual game .. imo its not .. so if u want a challenge then its the game for you!

Update ... got past it but had to get my nephew to do it xD"
5393,"Great game just beautiful
"
5394,Perfect
5395,"Got this game for free
Not a bad game just too short, if you are not into speedrunning or achievements it will be over shortly :)
Graphics are nice.
Sounds were a little buggy at times, but not in my style.
Free 10/10 recommend
not worth 13 euro 
"
5396,"Its such a nice Game with a very cute good looking world. The Story is exciting and you want to go on and see what will happen. 

There are some Achievements you can get, so will not be tired about playing a level twice.

Its a littlebit short if you just wanna play it till end, but if you take your time to explore world its totally worth it.

7/10   Just a good Game :) <3"
5397,"I'd say this is a pretty good game. It's short, so it's perfect to get into when you can't invest too much time in games for whatever reason, or maybe you use this as one of those 'in between' games you play when you're not sure what big game you wanna jump into next. 

The platforming is good, but it can feel a bit floaty; sort of like you're lacking momentum at times. 

This game also has a story, and just like in the title of this game, it's a story about your Uncle. It's rather interesting and I like how the story is narrated by a father telling his daughter a tale of his past regarding him and his Uncle. The voice acting is surprisingly well done, especially by the father.

The graphics; they get the job done. Up close, it ain't much to look at, but when you view these landscapes at a distance while traversing the stages, they can look pretty damn cool."
5398,Nice athmosphere
5399,Really fun gameplay.
5400,nice game
5401,"Suprisingly good platformer with beautiful locations. Frog people look a bit weird and the interactions are a bit cheesy.  Nonetheless, It is a gripping experience that definitely worth a try."
5402,Nice game dude
5403,This was a fun game. A bit short but the story was good. The art was good and the game was smooth. I loved all the small details like how a hard landing would shatter the ground. It was pretty easy up until Maddie dared me to do a challenge. It was hell but worth it to prove how awesome I was to an NPC. ... the fact that an NPC could taunt me like that means they did a good job on the character. 9/10 rocket boots (which are a true rush to use)
5404,"WORST NAME EVER! People see this in your status, they think you're being abused as a minor. Fortunately this is NOT a pedophile tale but a fun basic grapple hook fly fame. Again I understand people not wanting to play this because just the title makes them feel dirty."
5405,Great and engaging storyline combined with interesting mechanics make this game a worth playing masterpiece.
5406,It Epic
5407,"Unusual and great story, nice graphics and good gameplay."
5408,"Cool game, Relax, Interesting to play. In this game you have to fly. Good voice acting. An interesting gameplay. In general, the game is top"
5409,Spiderman + Ironman
5410,"I think its an very cool and relaxing game,I hope there will be a part two or Another story,realy enjoyed it."
5411,Awesome graphics and gameplay.
5412,"A great short game to play in one sitting. Good voice acting, heart warming story, and easy to learn and play with the controls too. Only downside is you can finish the game in less than 4 hours which is sad because it was such a gem. Got it for free during a give away but even on sale its a steal. 8.5/10"
5413,"Awesome game, would recomand for anyone that has time for a 2 hour adventure.
This game just got me sucked into it's little univers and i loved it.
The landscaps are beautiful, so is the music and the way you evolve throu out the game is amazing.
10/10"
5414,"fun game, even better that it was free! took about 3hours to complete. didn't really pay attention to story but the game play was fun. would recommend."
5415,Great game
5416,"omg, another cool game that i should play more, the graphic is good and the story is interesting, it feels good when i play it, it tests your creativity and skill, i hope i will fine some free time to play it more"
5417,"a story about ma uncle is a game where you start in the middle of greenland in a secret bunker and then you teleport to a underground weed house looking for small crystals that does nothing, 2/10 XDXD"
5418,"Got it for free, 90% finished and was stuck at the long-run last cave (my pc is not so good for high graphic, so it was really dark made me can't see things clearly too keep the swing). So I had to finish it by watching Youtube.
Nice gameplay, unique idea. the story is kinda short tho but I think it suits perfectly or I will be super dizzy playing it longer.
Anyway I still think the father was just telling a fake story to his daughter so he can have a good sleep. because no real person can freaking survive in such journey"
5419,nice game
5420,"Pros:
Awesome game play
Challenging mechanics

Cons:
2-3 hours story only
Main character is never named... just bothers my personal immersion

Summary:
Get this game... Its kinds of like portal but you have a grapple instead. It is very much worth the investment."
5421,"Got the game for free from the dev's free copy giveaway

Not really into this type of games, bu this one really gave a good impression. Definitely worth skipping class just to get a key"
5422,"Great game, great gameplay with simple controls, the plot is nice and is fun to follow along. requires patience for some areas as repetition is required."
5423,This is a really awesome take on 3D platformers. It's also one of the most chill games I've ever played. The graphics are beautiful and the level design is really unique. The difficulty doesn't scale well though and it ramps up really quickly. Overall the world building and story are fun to uncover and it's great the way they told it through the child's perspective.
5424,"This game was great with no big problems. The story was a good length, (though the ending was slightly anticlimactic). It took me about 5 hours of gameplay to complete. The level design was pretty nice. The mechanics were great and so were the graphics. I would play this one again."
5425,Amazing story!
5426,"A small but pretty fun game, it's also fun for getting in places that you shouldn't be in."
5427,A story about rage quitting the falling crates section.
5428,"dont think much about this gaming , the story is just perfect , game just works... just buy it and you will thank me later <3"
5429,"I really recommend this game ,  it has great movement and physics , a well done story and much more."
5430,"Just finished the game so I am changing the review.It was great,I just got pissed when I got stuck on ice stage."
5431,"its a refreshing game, made with simplicity made from childhood imagination.  Finished the whole thing in 2 hours, its good but I dont think it worth 12 dollars. Anyway, do pick it up if you found a good deal."
5432,"I am glad to have been able to play this wonderful game. It's graphics are pretty and the colours just make me feel good. I really recommend it, even if there is about 3hrs of gameplay. It's totally worth it."
5433,I really enjoyed the mechanics of this game. It's just so much fun to run and jump around and grapple onto platforms. It's a short game that you could probably finish in 2-3 hours. There were some tough moments in the game that I had to redo multiple times to proceed but it's easy overall.
5434,This is a BRILLIANT but unappreciated game. You should seriously get this! Such a casual masterpiece of a game.
5435,"A very good game, yes indeed. What made this good was, well, being the game. This game was not extraordinary, or super fast paced. It was calm, yet challenging and irritating, which, be honest, all parkour games are like that. I admit, there were a couple of bugs, and the face animation only decent. But it was good, there is truly nothing you can do to make it better.
It was, a really good game."
5436,"Dont worry about weather or not you like the game cause you will, trust me. nothings better than going 300mph into a rock"
5437,"gamenya bagus2 aja sih, aga pendekan ceritanya, kdng2 kesel bbrpa kli ga bisa lewat, tpi ya gtu dah. lumyana lah game gratis, dah tamat story focused 2 jam lah, klo asal maen mngkin 1 jam ga nyampe."
5438,The movement system is amazing to play with and the puzzles are just complex enough to have a good time. The only downsides are the character models being... jarring and the voice acting being very stiff.
5439,"I really like this game, I'm a BIG fan of grappling hooks and general platformers. The story is really interesting, I haven't finished the game yet but its a lot of fun so far."
5440,Great game! Awesome mechanics! Great story! Well paced progression! did not face any bugs! I could definitely play more of this! definitely worth it!
5441,Great game
5442,The gameplay Is great and all but the story did make me shed a tear at the end maybe because I'm a huge pussy or something but honestly the Ending elevated the game from good to great at least for me.
5443,"A great game in total , It has good graphics , and a fun gameplay , the story is decent."
5444,"good game
"
5445,"Stunning Graphics, simple but ok story, not so bad character design, low requirements but very short playtime, it took me about 2hrs to finish the game, and that's it.

Overall 7/10"
5446,A very nice and relaxing game to play
5447,A good adventure game
5448,"First off this is a jump challenge game with a little storyline tossed in.  The major problem with these types of games is that they never come with a difficulty setting.  If you cannot estimate the distances and stick the landing then you will never finish the game, because it never gets any easier.  I have several friends who give up on God of War for that very reason.  You can make the monsters easier to kill but you cannot make the traps or jump challenges any easier to navigate.  

In addition to that, these types of games educate the player via death.  Meaning the only way to find out that you cannot make a jump is by dying.  Add into it that the protagonist is a child with a little girl on his back and you are intentionally and repetitively killing children all throughout the game.  As this game is targeted for children, I found it a bit unsettling that the Salamanders had no regard for the dangers of falling.  So, I wonder how many little boys and tom girls broke a limb in the real world because they tried jumping off of something they shouldn't have?  That is, I mean, ""after playing this game.""  This sets a bad example for children to trivialize dangerous behavior of any kind.  What's worse, Maddie dares Timmy to do a very difficult part without his grappler, which exasperates the trivialization of it.  

[i]If you don't think so then the next time little Timmy falls to his death, try imagining a real child screaming in gut-wrenching terror as he soils himself falling to his certain death.  Picture that in your mind and see if you still want to play.[/i]  Children are experts at intermingling with just about any narrative which is the foundation of all pretend. 

Honestly, it did not have to be that way.  Most games have a set back method without death.  For example, considering the light gravity Maddie could have had the ability to fly which would have explained how they effectively live in this world.  When you fall she could catch Timmy however He could weigh too much to fly against the wind, so they are carried back to the last save point instead.   Considering the floating nature of this world, this would not be that far fetched.

[b]Aside from that the story was very short but ideal for children.[/b]  The Salamanders could have been modeled a little better so that their movements were a little less cartoonish.  Maddies speaking animation is top-notch! Congrats on the Dev that animated that sequence.  The unlockables are totally not worth the time.  Even children turn them off after a few minutes.  Especially acrobat and goat modes.  Aside from some very inconceivable sections in the ice cave that I am sure many players cursed at, nothing was impossible to jump with enough deaths.  The only thing that would have made the game better would have been more storyline.  Increased Father Daughter dialog and interactions with Maddie offering lore or tips.  The price is right for the content and I got six hours out of the game, just taking my time.  

[u]I look forward to seeing what this Gone North Games has to offer in the future.[/u]"
5449,"Some interesting jumping about a bit, and fun mechanics, but ultimately hampered by cliched level design, poor character animations and sub-par voice acting."
5450,Very nice game
5451,"A 4 hour long walking simulator about using a grappling hook and brain dead platforming. 
The main problem with this game is a whole story and justification behind it - something that you would think that a walking simulator would do a way better job at it.
 
The game is about listening a so-called ""bed time"" story which is just mind boggling stupid. 
This game could be easy something far better, like on Stanley Parable level of script
or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter dialogue. 

Gladly the story gets a bit better and more interesting plot points during second half of the game but unfortunately the ending is just pure hot garbage.
So much that NOTHING was achieved. The whole game and so-called ""adventure"" was for nothing. 
The game even try hard to make you feel sad for character you barely even met (while playing generic sad music #7) and fails so much at connecting it that its actually really laughable.

Heck, A Story About My Uncle would be so much better game if there was LESS narrative and dialoque while progressing through the unknown, mystical lands in full silence, trying to figured out the story about uncle on your own by investigate every single trace that uncle left. 

Instead its a monotonous listening about a guy talking to his child while also listening a useless female frog creature that is shoving a random odd bullcrap facts in your face that doesn't even make any sense to be in the game (and to be fair) nobody will even give a damn 
about because this is a short video game about using a grappling hook and platforming while walking from point A to point B with a bit of fluff text. WEEEE. Lets jump there. And now there. WEEEEEEEEE.

Thats all it is. Why developers are keep trying hard to tell us otherwise?
That this game is something bigger, more ambitious? Well, its not and let's stick to that.

At least gameplay is fun enough to save this game in my eyes.
If only puzzles wasn't so boring easy and checkpoint system wasn't such a pain in the assssss at the end of the game I would give this game more than 6/10."
5452,"Its that type of game that put your mind working, the puzzles are funny and the story its amazing."
5453,Probably the best short game I've played. Very good design with a nice story. Finished it under 3 hours.
5454,Dis a gooden
5455,"I'm not crying, you're crying."
5456,‚†Ä
5457,"Great, short game. Engaging story, pretty graphics and fun puzzles. The ending was fair.

Length of the game was also appropriate; the mechanics are a blast the first time, but one could get tired if forced to go on for too long. This game would be great on VR; on a superhard mode. Definitely worth an evening."
5458,I like this game!Is very fun
5459,"A Story About My Uncle is a charming first-person platforming game about a kid searching for his adventure-loving uncle. The kid will meet fairytale-creatures and reach breathtaking heights.

You're very free in your movement in this game. Flying through the air gave quite the rush sometimes. The game was given away for free some time ago, but I'd say it's still worth the money! If you like cute stories, good platforming and simple fun- this game's for you!"
5460,Certainly worth the time. Beautiful levels and very satisfying platforming
5461,Great little story.
5462,"its terrible whenever i get out of the game it says it saves my game but when i get back in ive lost all my stuff and i have to start again i recommend you dont get it
"
5463,This game is so f*cking create !
5464,"I could not get into it, people like this game and I can understand why but not really my thing. It was free on HumbleBundle, get it on sale, its an okay game."
5465,"It's a story about your uncle.
You do parkour with an alien child on your back

10/10
would piggyback an alien again"
5466,"[h1]Crude & Annoying[/h1]

I assume A Story About My Uncle was made by a very small team of developers, and I hate bashing it because I do know how hard making a game is, but, despite that [i]and[/i] the fact that I got this for free, I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend it.


The core gameplay consists in jumping, grappling and/or boot-rocketing your way from one platform to the next. That's all. Focusing hard on a few core mechanics is not wrong per se, but in this case it's just... not fun -- it's annoying, and quickly becomes boring.

And it also has a bunch of secondary problems...

Sometimes it's not clear where you must go/grapple to. Sometimes one checkpoint is too far from the next, and you have to re-do the same part over and over again until you get to the more challenging point where you keep failing. Sometimes a jump is too much of a ""close call"" -- if you press Space a step too soon, you won't reach the next platform. Sometimes you bounce off the ground when landing hard and just fly off into oblivion.

Every time you die, you gotta wait some 3 seconds while your character falls into nothingness before you can respawn. You often can't tell whether you're in range of something ""grappable"" or not -- you gotta take a leap of faith and, once you're in the air, about to fall to your death, try and see if your grappling hook can actually reach it. Sometimes you're sure you're close enough for a hit, and yet it doesn't connect.

Some of the moving platforms you can pull yourself to move in weird ways, throwing you in somewhat awkward directions (you grapple these platforms and get pulled towards them as they move, so you can then release your grapple and keep the momentum acquired). 

The level design is rather basic, and the 3D models are pretty bad. The [i]character[/i] ones are dreadful, and possibly [i]the[/i] worst I've seen in a game in the last 20 years or so. They feel more like placeholders than final assets -- including their animations.

There are some ""secret collectibles"" to find -- some things like telegraph machines hidden here and there. When you find one... nothing happens. The machine stops operating and making noises, and that's it. There's no text, nothing that reveals some detail about the world or the story, not even a UI feedback like ""You just found a secret!"" or something of the sort.

I didn't finish the game but, as far as I went, the story didn't appeal to me either: you're a kid chasing your recently-disappeared uncle into a [rather empty] whimsical world of childish nonsense and, eventually, I guess you either find [i]him[/i] or [i]what happened[/i] to him. Given that some people have enjoyed the story, I wouldn't discard the ending being another one of those ""(...) and now that you have won, you realize you were actually a kid in a hospital bed dying from scrotum-cancer all this time!"" endings. But I don't really know.

The voice-acting is also quite mediocre... actually, it's below ""mediocre,"" since these days the average voice-acting tends to be good enough. Here, you can easily tell the narrator's voice (in particular) doesn't quite match the emotion the text is supposed to transmit.


In short, A Story About my Uncle is a [i]rudimentary[/i] game based on a premise that [i]seems[/i] somewhat interesting but is not, with a subpar execution and an uninteresting story to match.

I'm usually happy to see indie games being sucessful but, in this case, it's actually an offense to all the teams behind [i]many[/i], [i]much[/i] better titles which, sadly, weren't nearly as profitable as this one.

I honestly have no idea how this game got so hyped. And I'm pretty sure its developers don't either."
5467,"very nice game 
good stories 
and good game play 
"
5468,grappling fun

5470,nice gameplay
5471,"PERFECT 10/10.

5472,"I enjoyed it.  There's a couple times where the puzzle is really annoying, but only a couple.  Overall the gameplay was fairly simple to get through.  Really good story.  A nice coming of age type thing."
5473,"Excellent little indie game. The story is hit or miss, but the level design is on point throughout, and the swinging mechanics are great fun."
5474,"This game is very short but very pleasant and relaxing to play, the graphics are beautiful (overall) and the gameplay is a pure pleasure to play.
A very good little game."
5475,"Bom, Jogo de Aventura"
5476,This is truly a amazing game. The story is so dynamic and unique. The physics are astonishing and the movement flows like a spring river. There are words in this game that are a made up language and me and a friend deciphered it and i thought it was so cool and fun. Truly a amazing game 10/10 its worth the $14
5477,"A short run/jump/grab game. Just like old Nintendo games, just 3D. Some places were quite annoying, the story itself is a collection of lame cliches, but I actually had some fun while swinging from one rock to another."
5478,"I really enjoyed this game. Even though the parkour was annoying to get through, it was still fun overall. The ending was really confusing and I only understood it after I googled it. I actually was kind of sad when I learned of Fred's fate. 

Overall, loved the game and am hoping for a sequel."
5479,"Good time waster. Nice story, nice graphics. It's not like any other parkour game, definitely would recommend getting it."
5480,"IF you like walking simulator and parkour, simple story line (for children), and puzzle, this game might be for you. I like the environment and the music but I don't like puzzle games, that's make me have some kind of mix feeling about the game. In the end, I may not touch this game after this. But still, recommended for those who like the genre, espescially if you're a kid or have kids; they might like this game."
5481,"there are places where if u jump u can get stuck between 2 rocks good thing u can ""respawn in last checkpoint"" in the menu
other than that its a great game with a story following u as u move ahead

5486,About the game you can say a lot. But to say it's not enough. We need to play and experience these feelings. I recommend to all!
5487,"I don't know the exact words to describe my feelings with this game, but I'll try my best.

First question: do I recommend this game? Eh, maybe. It really depends on what you want out of it. 

Do you expect a great story and world to get lost in? Don't buy this.

Do you expect a fun mechanic, albeit one that isn't explored to its full potential? Buy this.

Do you expect a well-designed physics puzzle game akin to Portal and Quantum Conundrum? Don't buy this.

Did you like the grappling in Batman: Arkham Asylum and wish somebody would make a full game out of it? Buy this.

---

PROS:

- Really good graphics.
- Fun easter eggs, a lot of neat nods to Goat Simulator (another game by these devs).
- Fun mechanics when the devs actually decide to use them.
- Being short, it's a great timewaster for the afternoon.
- Collectibles, albeit 25 of them total.
- There is SOME story, although I found most of the characters unlikeable and the sense of ""purpose"" to be all ove rthe place. In this game, your goal is to find your uncle, who got lost in some alternate dimension(?). [spoiler]You find him, you talk for about a minute, and then he sends you home and you never see him again.[/spoiler]
- The sound design is top-notch, except for the voice acting. It can really do without all that.

CONS:
- Puzzles are too obvious, you're in for one of those ""follow the shiny markers"" Q.U.B.E. type adventures.
- Mechanics sometimes just don't work. God forbid you click too fast.
- Items come and go. You'll see game reviews say things overstay their welcome, but this game does the exact opposite. Hell, [spoiler]one part rewards you by giving back an item they took away for no reason.[/spoiler]
- I seriously hate the characters in this game, all of them are either annoying or not very smart.
- Just when you think you might like this game, it ends. It's only about 2 and half hours of gameplay if you don't plan to 100% it, not worth the price.
- Unlockables just step on top of eachother. [spoiler]You get to change your laser color, and then it doesn't matter because it's replaced with a goat tongue.[/spoiler]
- This game explains nothing. I don't know where I am, I don't know what anything is, I don't understand the logic of this world. There's no lore, and no expansions that might explain the lore.
- I still don't know what the hell that skeleton wants.
- While all-around a pretty decent game, minor negatives add up and ruin the experience for me. Is it bad? No. Would I recommend it? Only if you REALLY wanna play it.

This game has been haunting me for weeks now. I don't think I like it, but it was good enough for me to go ahead and finish it. If it's on sale or free again, go ahead and try it, I guess. This isn't Might No. 9 ""dear god WHY"" bad, this is just ""clearly an indie game that bit off a bit more than it could chew"" mediocre. I'm voting ""no"" becuase I wouldn't play it again, but clearly a lot of people enjoy this game for the pros I listed. Up to you, man."
5488,It's a pretty fun game but some characters look like 2001 characters
5489,"Pretty good game, a little bit touching at the end. Controls are kinda clunky, but you get used to it. Some areas are frustrating, especially in the later game. 7.5/10"
5490,this is a game focussed around the challenge of listening to an annoying ass narrator preventing any chance of you getting invested in the game world.
5491,"Neat mechanics that get old pretty quick, story doesn't carry it"
5492,Gordon Freeman gets a cool new suit to find his long lost uncle.
5493,Short game but it's pretty beautiful and I enjoyed it a lot. Play it PLEASE.
5494,"Beautiful game(mostly), interesting start with frogs(really nice heartwarming introduction for them), but after that everything went to over9000 jumps with no meaning beside increasing playtime. Dumb ending. 
It looks like there was interesting plot. On paper. Or in the scenarist head. But it was cut from the game.
What do we have here - is more like demo version."
5495,this game is very good. The story was great and allowed for some exremely imaginative moments. The characters look very uncanny  bu that is just a minor complaint. The platforming aspects of this game make it one of the greatest I've ever played.
5496,NO COMMENTS!! [spoiler] MUST TRYYYYyY.. [/spoiler]
5497,"great game, great story, great mechanics.

the world feels very open yet you always have one clear way to go"
5498,Damn i never thought i wud get so interested in a game like this..great job devs!Hope u guys make a 2nd game!it was definetely worth an experience!
5499,story telling is good and what can I say more? oh it's fantasy..
5500,This game was one of the best games ever i enjoyed the story line it was amazing but it was a little sad and a soon storry to end and i wish that this game could get a sequal or a nother story to download for free or something like that 10 outa 10 would play again !!!
5501,"For a free game I was actually really surprised how fun this game was.  Short and sweet - the story was kinda nice and the mechanics were really cool.  The atmosphere and having to look around to figure out what to do next was a fun journey.

I definitely recommend everyone give it a try."
5502,"This was a lovely way to spend 3 hours. A sweet story, and enjoyable platforming."
5503,"This game is just so beautiful swinging through the skys with a teather i wish it never ended. 

would recomend this game to people who want to sit back enjoy a puzzle first person adventure game"
5504,"A genuinly well put together and heartfelt game.  Never thought I'd find 1st person platforming fun but this was, and the movement felt fluid and smooth.  Plus I honestly found myself tearing up at the end."
5505,"Very enjoyable little game with relaxing, mesmerizing atmosphere. Jumps and movement mechanics is almost perfect: it feels very predictable and natural (which is very important for a game with gameplay mostly based around jumps). Story and narrative is quite interesting and well presented. 

Game works natively on Linux without any issues."
5506,"This game is just beautiful.
The gameplay itself is pretty nice and feels very good - i am totally happy with that. The jumping and climbing feels pretty good while there is some challenge to it.

But even better is the atmosphere and the story telling. I like to watch something while playing games but I enjoyed this without any distraction and it was worth it.
It is quite touching actually.

All thumbs up, I am happy I tried this one."
5507,"Fair warning I got this for free during a promotion on steam, so my review may be skewed a little.

Great platformer, simple but stunning scenery, controls do take a little bit to get used to.

Would recommend!"
5508,Good story and cool ways to move around the map 5/5.
5509,Amazing game. Fun for about 2 hours. Slightly frustrating. Best spiderman simulator
5510,Oh man this game is legend and i joined a compatition in my country algeria to write about anything and a found out that this game deserve to be in the story but i have some black spots so if u can contact me and send me the game main consept of story ill be honored and thanckful to you .
5511,"Nice little game...Love it, fun to play and it's just a fun game to play."
5512,"great game, amazing immersive story. But quite short."
5513,"Nice game, I enjoyed playing storytelling mode. It has replayability with time trials mode and unlockable modes, which I personally didn't unlock yet, but it's a really nice game to chill from online expiriences in MMO's. Story is relatively short, it took me 3 hrs to finish, but I'm definitely coming back for more. Recommend for every age!"
5514,"Nice story, breathtaking scenarios. Simple short game. Absolutely recommended."
5515,This game is good I speed ran it so I could refund
5516,"nice game

"
5517,"Super nice game, story mode, and the sounds makes me feel like that I am actually there. Def. worth paying for."
5518,"I really enjoyed the game. It is a relaxing game with a nice story behind it. You are thrown into a big world and must do challenging obstacles to progress in the game. The game can be a bit challenging at times, but you always know where to go which is nice. The game should take you around 2-3 hours to complete depending if you can complete the challenge. If you need to relax with nice story telling this game is for you."
5519,"absolutely amazing.
short
fun
great story
love this game so much"
5520,"Honestly, this game is beautiful. The visuals and the short but sweet story just sort of wowed me. For a game made 5 years ago, it certainly holds up as a great platformer."

A Story About My Uncle is a first person physics based platformer. The main character reads a bedtime story to his daughter, about his (You guessed it) Uncle Fred as you play through the game. You explore the deep caves and strange world as you try to find him. You are there to answer the many questions you have about your uncle and what he has done. 

Good:
- Pretty and unique Environment
- New ideas
- Interesting story delivery 
- Sense of freedom
- Very fun to parkour around
- Nice soundtrack

Bad:
- Tedious at times
- Quite short (<4 Hours)
- Little replayability 
- Can be frustrating 
- Dialogue is meh

Gameplay: (Terrible) (Very Bad) (Bad) (Okay) (Good) (Very Good) (Amazing)

Graphics - Okay
Soundtrack - Good
Atmosphere - Okay
Controls - Good
Overall Gameplay: Good

Difficulty - Not too hard
Replay Value - Very low
Worth - ¬£5 

Overall Rating: It's a very fun and interesting game with fluid movement. It has a pretty environment and a good storyline, even if its kind of strange. If you enjoyed games like mirror's edge, I recommended playing this one through, just for the fun of swinging around like a crazy man. Buy on sale!"
5522,What a nice game.
5523,"A Story About My Uncle is a magnificent, simple, heartfelt, and well-told story about a boy, his beloved uncle, and an adventure they share together. This game is a work of art, touching heart and soul with its simple, sincere, and honest words, inspiring a person to live a greater life. This game is a very personal experience.

The mechanics of the game are simple and effective, and the gameplay is classic jump gameplay with grappling hook, power jump, anmd short rocket boost(among a few other things). There are easy and hard areas, with simple ledges to various moving pieces to move across and jump on and off of.

I thought the power forward using right mouse button while sprintg with left shift key was odd, but it was easy to get used to.

The game is immersive and can inspire imagination. The mix of child-like honesty and the guiding adult voice of the narator put a person in a relaxed state of mind.

The few difficult parts of the game can be frustrating(and if it wasn't sometimes difficult, it wouldn't be worthwhile, so this is a good thing), but they are well-balanced with easier portions, providing relief after becoming detrmined to get past difficult areas(and finally succeeding, which is VERY satisfying).

The game can be played through in about 4-6 hours, and every moment is going to include soemthing more to see in the background as you move form one part of a level to another(not a huge amount of detail, but even the simpler details in the early level caves are beautiful and highly varied).

10/10 No problems, no errors, played smoothly, loved it. I was not interested in jump games in the past, but if they are like this, I would try more of them."

Comment: The game is AMAZING. One of the best single player games I have ever played. The story and the atmosphere.. everything was just fantastic. Loved the ending it was so touching.. This game needs a sequel or a part 2 someday.. I just wish the boy could stay with his uncle.. and maddie and the frog people!

My rating would be 9/10, i wish the story was a bit longer."
5526,"good game with good graphic, easy to play. recommended play on curved screen."
5527,its interesting to say the least i honestly didn't find it that fun 5/10 if it were cheaper i honestly don't think it's worth $13 but maybe wait for a huge sale where it is MUCH cheaper
5528,amazing game!!!
5529,Great graphics / gameplay.
5530,"I don't usually like platformers, but this game had that extra something which made it really enjoyable to me."
5531,"This game was truely something. The story was very engaging, and the grappling mechanic was on another level. The adrenaline you get when you are grappling from rock to rock, or when you are hiding from the worm thing, is amazing.

I really enjoyed this game, and recommend this to anyone who likes parkour."
5532,A little bit on shorter side but really enjoyable with good gameplay
5533,"I loved this game!  The graphics were very well done, the story line leaves you wanting more. The grapple is hard to get used to but once you got the hang of it you are zipping through the game. I love the challenges you face in the game. It's a short game but very much worth it.  I do want to see another one, this could be the start of a wonderful Adventure for more than just the Story teller."
5534,one of the best games i have ever play
5535,"A story about my uncle wasn't a perfect game and neither was with no problems, but was indeed an enjoyable experience. The game is told as a bed time story for the protagonist daughter about a quest he went to in his youth. Story is simple and has six important parts which starts with Fred, also known as uncle, goes missing and the protagonist who is Fred's nephew sets out to find him in a different dimention. The only shame is, there isn't realy a character development throughout the main campaign.

The game is basicaly a 3D platformer with enjoyable machanisms. It includes the grip, power jump and as it proceeds, the flying boots. it mainly is about jumping from one flying rock to another. But by using different terrains, game has avoided  repeating itself and becoming boring; which came at the price of finishing the game too soon. the game is mostly two hours or so if you play it without falling or losing your way and before you know it, you have reached the end of the game.

Then we have the very heart of every game these days which is graphics and audio, which is not exactly the highlight of the game but is fairly acceptable. though since the game uses a very few number of platforms, it could've used higher set up but unfortunately didn't happen. 

should you buy this game? yes and no. if you have better games in your wish list with the same price, go for them. But if you are bored, A story about my uncle is a nice experience to have.

6.5/10"
5536,I have played this game about 57-58 minutes and i am already shocked..The story is very good and the game as i thought.beautiful.BUY IT...
5537,"A game with very special meaning that is hard to achieve in the gaming industry. A Story About My Uncle at first glance is a game that is a platform style game put into a 3D environment. It can be very relaxing and just fun trying to swing around. But there is more to this game if you are able to let your mind open up and experience the fullness.

Looking more at the core of the story, you find it is about a nephew who created a story about his uncle to help him cope about the loss of him. There are hidden words, music, and descriptions that breaks the barrier on the true meaning of this game. If you are able to get to that level of understanding on this game, it makes you cry, your feelings on what loss can feel like arise, thoughts & emotions on losing a loved one re-emerge, and if you are empathetic you can feel incredibly sad/sorry for the loss of the uncle at the end. 

The music is incredibly beautiful by itself, which you can freely download at the company's website. Mixing the soundtrack with the storyline and gameplay, you have yourself a great novel with lots of emotions. 

For those looking for a fast pace, shoot up half-life style game, this is not it. There could be tremendous value to this style of game created with a deeper meaning. Those who are experiencing or experienced death or loss, this is a great medium to let your thoughts & emotions flow if you are able to grasp the fullness of the game.

EDIT:8/18/2021

As of today, I myself have cherished this game beyond any words. As my original review stands to help one through grief. As a testament to how helpful this game is, my father passed away recently and this game has allowed me to express my own grief. The symbols in the game, music, story, and final ending all fit into accepting & saying goodbye to the deceased. The game may seem like a symple platform jumper, but underneath that simple grapple system there is a strong story and meaning to this game. I even used the music in this game at my father's memorial, especially the epilogue. Wish there were more games like this."
5538,"Great Game 7/10, kind of buggy with the grappler at times but great atmosphere.
Spoiler Alert Ending Theory
"
5539,"A Story about My Uncle is a pretty good first person platformer where you utilise a very cool grappling hook to traverse a fantastical world. 

Overall it was enjoyable. I liked the story, the pretty world the game takes place in, and the interesting paths you have to traverse to progress. 

What detracts from the experience is how frustrating it sometimes is. To indicate a surface can be grappled, the reticule changes colour, but the colour change is so subtle it's hard to notice. I also never figured out how close you need to be for the grappling surface to be in reach: so many times I felt close enough to a surface to grab it, but would fall to my doom because the reticule did not switch colours. Clearly was not close enough!  It's often hard to judge how far you are from things mid-flight, so I feel the game could benefit from some kind of system to help the player gauge distance better. 

I'd also say that playing on controller is just not good: as an input method it is not preciseenough.

A good game. Fun, but often frustrating. Play with mouse and keyboard for the best experience."
5540,Very cool adventure game.
5541,great story
5542,"It was a good platformer game with rich in story. Though, I think that the ending chould have been better."
5543,"Amazing story, great charachters, relaxing music throughout the whole game, cool gameplay... All in all, an amazing game. 10/10."
5544,"took me a while to finished. after wat ive been thru, he asked me to go home right away hahahahah i feel bad for taking his jumpad. 

gud game 8/10."
5545,Fun game with very interesting bedtime story about his uncle and his adventure
5546,"everything is great but the npc animation look a bit weird, need part 2"
5547,"This game was the perfect mix of relaxed free roaming parkour and an easy truly heartfelt story line, would reccomend it if your going through tough times about a lost loved one as the author of this story creates a wonderful metaphor for life after death."
5548,"It is rather short at 3h, but this was an amazing game. The mechanics were smooth and highly enjoyable, and the story that goes along with it is spectacular. Even though I received it for free, I still would have thoroughly enjoyed the game had I bought it on sale."
5549,k
5550,"Aboslutely loved this game, so exciting yet so calming. Great story and design, I would kill to have A Story About My Uncle 2. I definitely recommend this game."
5551,"A lot of fun. The controls were perfect. I could never say ""it was the controllers fault."" The game was way too short though."
5552,"its pretty good, recommended !"
5553,I just want to find my uncle!
5554,"Got this game free from some deal or something. Pretty cool in theory, found it pretty boring.  I beat it in about 2 hours. Its all about jumping and using physics. Would have been upset if i paid for it. Neat little game for free. Narrator told a neat story as you played. action/adventure."
5555,Small but such a great game...thx uncle fred for the adventure
5556,A Story About My Uncle is good game with fun grappling mechanics. It's very short to play through and the story is intriguing to play it in one session. The graphics are good enough to be in awe at some points in the game. Some locations looked beautiful while others were just on par. I liked this game and recommend playing it.
5557,Pretty nice and short first person platformer. Story is average at best but I gotta say that the ending was really sweet
5558,"A nice short game. Moving from platform to platform using your grappling glove and rocket boots is very fun and fluid.
9/10"
5559,i d k
5560,"i recommend for everyone, it's good to spend a little time for this game."
5561,"Keyboard & mouse here.@ least you can macro the keys which is sweet, but the precise jumping with no save option is a pain,just means more backtracking & time waisting.Otherwise it would have been 8................6/10


Maybe a difficulty setting for the hardcore & one for tourists.

Or maybe increase the size of the trigger piont for jumping."
5562,"This game was great, from the mechanics to the story everything about it is fun the one thing i am sad about is that is a bit short but defenetly worth its weigh in gold 10/10 game"
5563,Overall an amazing game. Fairly simple mechanics but still challenging. Beautiful atmospherics. Highly recommend!
5564,overrall fun game
5565,"Soooo i have a few things to say about this game. Firstly: The graphics and controls are spot on and very well put together. Very few games can give you that pit in your stomach as you catapault over heights mere mortals dare to dream of. The setting of the various zones are fundamentally gorgeous and breathtaking with interesting artwork. 
But, this is where the review takes its negative turn as there is an abundant of issues with it. For one the characters are...dull. They just arent flushed out too well with people being introduced that are bland or downright annoying. Maddie for example is infuriating as a character and is obnoxious to listen to about how her, a creepy frog girl wants to be around a middle aged man. Little odd to me. Second the ending is a cop out plain and simple. It just ends for the most ridiculous of reasons and the ending level was hyped up to be difficult or challenging but was incredibly simple to do compared to the previous area. 
So do i recommend it? If its free yes, but frankly 13 dollars for a game thats only about 4 hours long is simply not worth it"
5566,"Simple but gorgeous game! This is a platformer, but not quite a puzzle because it's pretty straightforward, with pretty sufficient hints as to how we are supposed to progress. 

There was a particular part , however, that was a bit frustrating to play and reminded me of Getting Over It, but overall I very much enjoyed this experience! A generous 4/5 from me :D"
5567,amazing very amazing
5568,"Free games doesn't always sucks, like this one. I'm being carried away by the story with the beautiful landscape whenever I go. The grappling mechanism is interesting too~
For me, this is 10/10 overall!

[spoiler]PS : Goat Mode is also fun![/spoiler]"
5569,Its good
5570,"A Story About My Uncle is one of the greatest games I've ever played. I sat down with it to see if it would be a good game to stream and I just couldn't put it down. The platforming is at times finicky, and frustrating, but it never feels impossible. The mechanics are inventive, and the levels are well designed, giving you multiple ways to complete. 

The story is solid if short, I would love to see the world more flushed out. The characters grow on the player, as this coming of age story becomes more and more relatable as it becomes more fantastical. The feeling of loss at the end of the game, of all that progress the charcater made, and to lose the person he loved most, it speaks to the feelings of futility and loss that I have had.  The final scene, closing the circle of the game, speaks to my own hope. To feelings of missing loved ones, and feelings of what's to come. The dialoge the character has in closing is too similar to ones that I've had. 

This game does what many games try and fail, it sends the player through emotions, makes them experience what the player is experiencing. And it does so by avoiding dressing up the story as something it's not, there doesn't have to be the expected happy ending. The ending doesn't have to be the end. 

All and all, this game is worth every penny. 9/10"
5571,"No blood, no violence, no piled corpses, no weapons, no nudity, no strong language, nobody dies.. nice and fluffy game XD"
5572,"Cool game

Bad mouselock"
5573,"This game is just lost potential,the voice acting is terrible,the story is terrible and the main character does not even have a personality.
If you can't tell a good story from just dialogue at least make the main protagonist silent or remove the whole telling a story to your kid shit .Personaly i hate jumping puzzles,but some parts were legit fun. My main problem is the storyline,its to fucking short and doesn't either build up or have a satisfying ending . When i approched the ending,I was like :This can't be the ending,no way they gonna end it like this,but they did.
God awful,I would buy it only for 2 bucks nothing more,4 if they include the Steam workshop for people to make custom maps"
5574,Its a great game if you're doing a commentary and you need soemthing cool in the background of it. Dont need much to run this u could run it on an intel core duo with like 6gb of ram and a gt730 2gb. However lets be honest if you're doing a commentary I would reccomend a quad core like an i5 4590 or better and a gtx 1050 2gb and 8gb of ram.
5575,"DISCLAIMER: I claimed this game when it was free on Steam.

This game is amazing. I completed the story in about 3 hours, so it's kinda short, but you can play it as many times as you want and hunt achivements or try time trials :). There are many interesting ideas and mechanics in this game (for example [spoiler]your companion Maddie[/spoiler] will climb on your back so you don't have to deal with AI not being able to follow you). The controls are okay and responsive although I had to rebind some of them but that's just my personal prefference. The jumping and flying itself feels really good and you have many options which ""tools"" you choose to complete each level, you can also challenge yourself ([spoiler]or your companion will :)[/spoiler]) to complete a part of a level for example only by using grapples or not using any grapples and you'll get an achivement on some of them. But the best thing about this game is it's amazing locations. The maps look stunning, especially the caves with all the shiny crystals and letters on walls. And mostly you won't notice the 2014 textures (which are not that bad) when you're in the air most of the time anyway.

Overall this is a pretty good game with decent story, good gameplay and amazing locations. The 13 ‚Ç¨ Steam wants for it at the moment is fine if you want to play it more than once, for example if you want to hunt some achivements or find secret locations which contain additional story. But if you want to buy it just to play the story, wait for a sale."
5576,Pretty interesting game and cool for people who like doing parkour!
5577,"I grabbed this game when it was free.

I wouldn't have paid the full 13,99 for a game that took shorter than 4 hours to complete, but that doesn't take away the fact that this is a great game to play. I'd probably pick it up in a 50% sale.

I liked the story and the gameplay, the graphics were decent too. Can't add more than the top reviews I am seeing.
7.5-8/10

5578,Leafyishere needs to come back
5579,"A fun and sometimes challenging game that gets all it can out of its innovative game mechanic. My only issue is how boring the story and characters are (even the narrator sounds like he's falling asleep), but the gameplay makes up for it."
5580,Just finished its truly an amazing game if you have 3-6 hours of free time i suggest play this game its for sure worth your time
5581,hey what's up guys leafy here
5582,"The story is nothing special, but the gameplay is fun WHEN it lets it be fun. For one thing, checkpoints are way too sparsely located, especially during difficult segments. You can go through a long difficult challenge with no checkpoints, then you find a bunch of checkpoints here and there during easy parts. Also, the game is AWFUL at communicating where you are supposed to go which leads you to having to basically try a whole bunch of shit hoping it works (same once you get a grapple, some things can be grappled, some can't, often not communicated well). This wouldn't be that high of an issue, except for that checkpoint problem. Oh, and do yourself a favor by 1) playing with mouse & keyboard (I have health issues & I tried gamepad for this reason as sitting down in an armchair is easier than my desk chair, but I wish I wouldn't have because it's so much easier. I had to switch to mouse & keyboard for the last couple of challenges & wish I had done so from the beggining) & 2) crank up the brightness when you can't see. There are sections where I honestly couldn't see what I was supposed to be grappling, I wish I had cranked up the brightness earlier too. 

That out of the way, the platforming is very fun - with cool gimmicks -  when it works properly & beating the challenges is satisfying. If you like physics-based puzzle-platformers. I would recommend it.

Score-wise 7/10."

5586,good game
5587,"An exploration/puzzle platformer - told from the perspective of the nephew as a bedtimes story for his daughter, its pleasant and intriguing, albiet quite short. 2-3 hours playtime. The voice acting is a little odd, it sounds like a portion of the actors aren't native english speakers, but they only rarely stress the intonation of a word oddly. 
"
5588,"a heartwarming tale, and something i thought was very beautiful. great story, short and sweet, and an extreamly fun traversal  system that is great"
5589,"A fun, short game."
5590,"So, this game is told via a bed time narrative to a girl from her father. While it seems kind of creative at first, the gameplay is a complete drag. The game is a platformer and the platforming is generally quite bad. When you are jumping and grappling between points in the level, sometimes the grapple is lit, but doesn't fire. Other times, the momentum carries you in unintended ways. So, while a great concept, it's a terrible execution. It could have definitely used some refinement. Better luck next time, devs, but thanks for offering the free copy to try out."
5591,Nice game but needs VR support
5592,"The feels.

A fun and dynamic game. It is challenging but the narrative-type of storyline is what keeps you going. It's a bit short (it took me a bit over 4 hours to complete it) but I feel like I could replay this game later on a lot of times. The artwork is great, the gameplay is interactive and you can easily make a connection with the characters involved in this story. 8.5/10"
5593,A nice story and good voice acting. Little dissapointed it was only around 2 hours long tho :(
5594,"It's short, but not ""too"" short for me. I'm not a huge fan of platformers, but I love the grappling hook mechanics and really flying through space can be a lot of fun. The story elements were okay; but didn't really do much to draw me in deeper. The same game devoid of the story would be just about as good for me. Though I do like achievement hunting, I didn't get a single one and probably wouldn't go back to try again. Probably would be a lot more fun for platformer fans. There's moments in here that I think most players would enjoy, but it's definitely for platformer fans more than anyone else."
5595,"I got this game with the weekend promotion. As it was already installed, as this was a requirement to acquire the game, I decided to give up on my frequent go to games and dive into gaming experiences again. 

I think that at the start, where you encounter a lot of Easter eggs and don't really dive too much into what is written everywhere and all the pics. I of course did not know this and went directly into watching every little part on the wall. The way the game was narrated seemed to indicate a very detailed and complex game. There even is a link to a Youtube video on a post it on a wall in particular at the start of the game; and I saw that a lot of commenters went there because the saw the same post-it in the game. 

This being said, at that particular point I expected quite a lot of the game, but of an adventure game, so it was pretty confusing when I started to jump all over the place. Fun no doubt, but not really what I had hoped for. Anyway, I do give a game a chance of at least 1 hour (unless its a disaster, really boring or terribly glitchy), and overall, I did not regret it. Perhaps I would have gone for a different game I had already installed, but even the title is catchy.

The game itself is not bad. Gameplay is entertaining although perhaps a little bit repetitive, I would have liked something extra towards the end, a new cool movement or something else. 

It takes an average of 2 hours to complete the game. The music is not bad either, the graphics are fine, and the sphere of the game is well done. Only encountered one glitch in the whole game and was able to overcome it eventually. 

The only hard negative about this game is that perhaps there is a lot of build-up toward the end, and I think the final part of the story is somewhat disappointing. I was expecting more to be honest. They could have done something more mind-blowing. 

Anyways, if you have the game, give it a go."
5596,"You should create an open world game like this. It's super fast and smooth on my computer, can load large objects from afar, and great gameplay mechanics!"
5597,"Hi guys, I just finished this awesome game.
Seriously, this game is amazing.
This game relaxes you, be sure to take a cup of tea or coffee before passing.
The story is great, at the end I just cried, I would really like to see a book about this game: D
Perfect graphics
Everything is done very high quality, I'm surprised.
If you can't do something, you're not angry, but just trying to do it somehow differently. Pleasant music
Nice characters
I really love this game, and I would like to see the continuation of this story. It is a pity that it was all over.
Have fun, friends:3"
5598,"Great game. Nice graphic and start to get harder at the end of the game. Simply wish story wasn't told by a ""robot"". Felt like the guy speaking didn't have any emotion"
5599,"Best game I've played in a while.  Outstanding.  If you are looking for something different, this is for you."
5600,Awesome game with round about 2 1/2 hours of playtime. Buy it!
5601,"This game is 9/10 and I ll tell you why is not a 10/10 . The game is chill, you ll have a lot of fun playing it and the story is great, but it s a short game.. :/ i would like to see the part 2 : with this guy's daughter going in the same adventure to look for maddie and uncle fred, it will be cool to find his skeleton and a message from fred to his nephew. The other think is that the games is pretty expensive for a short story :(. But congrats, the game was Perfect ! Hope for part2."
5602,"What a story... 
To everyone about to play it. read everything there is. You'll figure out the whole story"
5603,Swingy fun time
5604,"Spiderman simulator 2019 









p.s. this game is adorable, buy it and prepare for Zen time"
5605,"I really liked this game. I am not a fan of first person plateformers but this one was special. The graphics are pretty, the BO as well. The story may not seem crazy first, but there is so much implicit. It is beautiful!"
5606,"Buy it Story is very good but it's very short too
In the end of this game very sad for me
i know it's crazy but i wan't episode 2"
5607,"well 9/10 i mean , the game is just pretty good overall ,but its too short , only like 2.5 h."
5608,A pleasant game to play
5609,A lovely story but definitely not worth the full price for only about 2 and a half hours of game play.
5610,cooluchi
5611,"Good game, has some fun mechanics. Honestly story was kinda weak but journey was nice. Sadly it was short"
5612,Game is too shitty
5613,"Why Must Frog if Fox Far more Beautifull...
i wish Uncle Fred make Experiment About Fox so There Would be  Anthro Fox :u
if Only Maddie is A Fox... or some Furry Creature... i would Buy This Game"
5614,"Wow.
Just, wow.
This is really, really good.
I haven't finished it yet, but its so much fun and I love the story. Its such a beautiful and interesting game, and Im so close to beating it. I can't wait to see how it ends, but I don't want it to ever.
I got this for free during a one day sale thing, I would absolutely pay the 12.99 for it though."
5615,"This is a great little game.  I say little because I finished it in under three hours.  It would have been two if I didn't get stuck trying to complete Maddie's game before cracking the shits.  For the most part, I felt like a steampunk Spiderman slinging around in old caverns, which was great fun.  I only wish there were side missions or something to give it more play time."
5616,An incredible experience!
5617,"This is a great platformer game and has a very unique and fun playstyle that's not really been done before in a first person game. The story is horrible, but it's pretty clear that the story was aimed to be simple and something even a child would be able to enjoy. It'll take you about 1-3 hours to finish this entire game. However there are workshop maps that you can try out if you feel like it. There's a couple of fun achievements you can try to go for (If you don't mind listening to minute long unskippable conversations that forces you to stay and listen) However i don't think the game is worth it's price tag. If it's on sale or up for free again then go ahead and purchase it. But if you're paying full price for it then it's not really worth your money in my opinion."
5618,Such a wonderful game with beautiful sceneries. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
5619,"For being a relatively short game, it had a pretty decent story and interesting movement. I enjoyed the playthrough of it and found it fun to grapple through the caves. Not sure if I'd pay any more than $5 on it considering how short it is but it was still worth it for what it was"
5620,Noice
5621,"Wonderful game. Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable, Mechanics are accessible and understandable while still offering paths of challenge, Story is engaging and entertaining, and the extra modes past the base campaign are fun. Settings allow for customization for every person. Overall everything about this game is enjoyable, but the story is so enjoyable that its ending comes far too soon. You won't want to stop playing past the ending."
5622,"Interesting take on the First-Person-Platformer-Genre. The gameplay is decent and the world looks lovely. 
But what in my opinion really stands out, is the atmosphere and the way the story is told. The ending also leaves room for a lot of interpretation (ref. top review)

overall solid 9/10"

5625,Nice Game
5626,"Got this for free and can say I was not dissapointed. It has an easy and effective story. Not a huge heartbreaker but it does its job and makes you think for a couple of minutes. I really liked the soundtrack and the level design, although the graphics could've been better. Though I usually don't give one damn about graphics in games so it didn't bother me. The game also has some ""mystery"" feel to it, at least in my experience, because you never know what the next location you visit is going to look like, apart from conjectures you form after listening to tales about these places. It also gets a bit challenging at certain moments towards the end so you can definitely count on that.
Most importantly, though: is it worth spending $13 on this pretty short game? Well, decide if the overall theme, the setting and the atmosphere are anyhow enticing to you. And if the answer is yes, and you also have some spare cash an and evening, then why not?"
5627,The controlls are awefull with absolutely no feedback and the voice-acting of the Father I assume is bad aswell. I could not play this game more than 10 minutes. I am really glad that I got it for free so I do not have to anger about spending money for such a bad polished game.
5628,"A story about my uncle is a cute parkour game, the story is being told as a night time story by a father (I believe) to a child. The art style is amazing and characters look beautiful. Maddie is an amazing character that just wants to be accepted by her own people. 

The game is lacking a few things, the voice acting goes flat from time to time, as if the characters read their lines. Controls does not always works such as power leap and grapping. The game is too over priced for such a short game (2 hours). 

I gave up after 8 hours of controls not working and the lack of directions in the game. Half the time I didn't know where exactly to go and just guessed where to go and just ended up at the same spot I started on.  The controls didn't work and especially the power leap.  By the end of the ice berg I totally lost interest in the game. No directions on where to go more than ''Go back'' while half the place collapses. 

The first two ''levels'' had me going and all excited about the game but after the village everything went downhill from there. I'm happy that I got the game for free cause I wouldn't wanna pay for this game"
5629,"A very very pleasant story and adventure!

I picked up this game in the last hour when it was free just for a ""maybe later"" game but these days I had nothing really else to play with so I started it and it was a really really good experience. I like that it's not that long, and you can get to the end of the story in 3-4 hours, but if you want to complete it 100%, it surely takes you time.

And boy how challenging it is. Some sequences took me like 20-30 tries to complete, I haven't raged so hard on a single player game since my childhood when all the games were based on this. But it was a pleasant rage, and the feeling of accomplishment when I was indeed able to pull off those difficult jumps...worth it!

I recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a nostalgic experience because this game offers you that, but it also gives you a new kind of story you havent experienced before. I have only finished the story now, but I will surely give a try to get all the achievements.

TLDR: good game, it is worth around 3-5 euros, I wouldn't really buy it over that"
5630,Nice game
5631,"It was alright, very short and definetely not worth $14 (although I received it for free). The movement feels very slow, especially with the grappling hook, and I found myself getting bored of it even though it was only 2 or 3 hours. Some of the dialogue/subtitles are poorly translated, and the story overall is meh."
5632,"The campaign of this game can be summarized as such:

""Where's Fred?  Have you seen him?  Have you seen him?  Have YOU seen him??  Oh, hi Fred!  Bye Fred!""  The end.

I tend to like to story-driven games the best, but I hear your dissent.  It doesn't need a compelling story to be an enjoyable game.  I agree, and while the gameplay concept had potential, the hyper-short campaign and the clear lack of any rigorous beta testing really made it fall short of that potential.  The game gives you access to a handful of free-range parkour tools and leaves you to navigate the level designs.  Tools like a power suit with a super-jump ability (and I really mean a SUPER jump), shock-absorbing boots, and a super-sprint ability, later to be modified with a tractor-beam-like grappling hook that has a limited number of uses before it runs out, and a rocket propulsion system for your boots.  You're then left to find the correct combination of moves to advance across arrays of floating rocks and platforms.  There's very little handholding in this game, and I like that.  However, if you're going to give the players the tools to reach virtually any place in the level, you're going to need to expect them to reach almost every place in the level.

Just 10 minutes into the game, I got myself stuck between 2 rocks, and only narrowly managed to glitch myself out.  On some of the larger floating rocks in the third level, I didn't see the obvious path and started jumping and grappling around and easily got myself to the peak of the rock, where the designer clearly foresaw no one going.  From there the mesh didn't align with the textures and I could see through the whole map.  But even the main path wasn't without it's own problems.  The windmills in particular in the third level don't play nicely with the grappling tool, even though you're supposed to use them to advance.  Sometimes the grappling tool would cling to the windmill, and sometimes it just wouldn't.  Twenty failed attempts later and I decided to pull up a walkthrough, and when even the walkthrough's advice is to just glitch your way through the windmills, you know you did something wrong when you built the level.  Seriously.  It said that.


As you can see on my review, it only took me 3 hours to complete the campaign, in spite of the numerous fails and entrapments I fell into.  I by no means played a perfect run.  There were several points in the game where I got held up for 20 minutes trying to find the right path.  A more astute player could probably finish the campaign on his first try in less than 2 hours.  Speedruns of this game would likely put Super Mario 64 to shame.

Overall, I thought the gameplay mechanic was a much needed fresh take on a parkour adventure game, but one that sloppily built and wasn't fleshed out, backed by a lackluster campaign with flat characters and cringy voice acting.  Normally I'd say to buy the game on sale because, I don't know how the developers can justify charging $13 for the lack of work they put into this game, but I got it for free on a weekend deal, and I still wouldn't recommend it even if they have a repeat event.  I'm not saying I want my 3 hours back, but my life would've been no less complete if I had never installed this game."
5633,Two hours of fun!
5634,"This game is a pain in the ass. Takes an average of 2 hours to complete. 
I'd say this is one of the best adventure game out. Do give it a try, you wont regret it. Or would you? Who knows."
5635,"[H1]The plot[/H1]
""A Story About My Uncle"" is a specific game. The father tells his daughter the story of his uncle's disappearance, in which he participated. We travel the same places from the perspective of our father and the same adventures as the hero of the game, and the objective is to find the missing uncle Fred.

[h1]Control and physics of the game[/h1]
In the game, we move around using a costume that allows us to move over long distances. The glove allows us to attach to the walls, but not all of them. In addition, we jump higher and run faster. Unfortunately, the control of this costume is not always perfect. Often the game reacts differently than we would like, which makes it difficult to pass a given level without death.

[h1]Locations[/h1]
There are not many of them in the game, we will find ourselves mainly in caves, iceberg and in one open location, whose openness lies in the fact that we are not in the cave. In every location you can find Fred's machines, but they are not necessary to complete the game.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Locations in the game are made nicely when we look at them from a distance, but from close up there is nothing to admire. I often managed to get into textures and even go beyond the map.
The characters we meet along the way are stiff, made fast and do not make a positive impression on the player.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
Throughout the game we can listen to the soundtrack flying in the background, which is pleasant to the ears and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game.

[h1]Game modes[/h1]
In addition to the usual storyline we can go through each level in the time mode, where our task will be to beat the level in the shortest possible time.

[h1]Summary and rating[/h1]
""A Story About My Uncle"" is a short game with an interesting plot, perfect for playing in the evening when we have a little more time. Unfortunately, bugs and frequent lack of cooperation with us can be annoying.

5636,I would recommended anyone to play this game
5637,Good story!
5638,"A great, unique platformer with a touching narrative. Probably wouldn't have bought it full price, got it for free."
5639,"Dear Developers
thank you so much for this gem you gifted us i suggest everyone to try it and you won't regret !
"
5640,boooooooooooooooooooring
5641,I loved this game and i cried at the end. 11/10 would play again
5642,Este un joc distractiv si foarte misto
5643,"I got this game when it was free not knowing anything about it. The name sounded interesting and I thats about all I knew. After now completing the story line I can say this game is absolutely incredible! I would recomend it to anybody who likes story driven games and/or parkour games. The controls are awesome after you get used to them, the narration is top notch, the lighting is stunning and the character development is 10/10. This game slowly makes you fall in love with the quirky, well-written characters as you explore dangerous environments with high mobility, speed and precision.
The only con I ran into were a bug or two here or there, all of which were only minor. Sometimes you would get stuck a little out of bounds or your grapple would fling you off in an odd direction if you were too close to the platform you attached to.
Over all this is the very best parkour game I have ever played! It can be as deep or shallow as you'd like. Want to speed run? Have fun! Want to explore every nook and cranny? Have fun! With hidden easter eggs and unlockables the game has some re-playability, but mostly it just feels so good to swing and jump around in this facinating universe somewhere on the other side of a sci-fy trash chute."
5644,"A Story about my Uncle

The characters were alright honestly. the story could have been better, and the gameplay is simple and fun, i got annoyed at times but I still loved it. But it lacks a feeling of replayability, one of those games once you play and your over with it you dont  really re-visit."
5645,"Extremely short, but a very enjoyable experience. Get it on sale."
5646,"I went into this game with very low expectations. I saw it randomly installed in my game library and I was bored. This game was amazing! 5 stars! Great story, great idea! Absolutely phenominal game! Even i fit only has 2 hours of gameplay for a first-time player, it was still super fun! Loved t!"
5647,"(spoiler) creepy lizard fish dudes, and graple hooks"
5648,"This game was honestly breathtaking at times. Personally, I'm the kind of person to play a game based on how good it's visuals, soundtrack, story, and gameplay are, and honestly: I really enjoyed it.

 In my opinion, the soundtrack definitely added to atmosphere, and really created a sense of beauty towards the game, where it be the emotional sounds in the village, or the thick tension in the deepest depths of the caves. It ended up really engaging the player in the experience, and created real feelings, whether it be shivers, heartache or warmth. Defininately a win in my book.

The visuals were incredibly stunning and breathtaking. Entering some areas leaves you jaw-dropping, while cruising the landscape from your grapple, looking for points to land or sling, was just an immersing experience. Some parts do glitch, and look a little plain, and the character models aren't the most impressive, but the landscape and map are indeed worth the good reviews.

The story was quite interesting, and it was a nice way of storytelling. As you progress, so does the story you're telling, both in narrative form, and in cutscene form. Sometimes the story can, however feel slightly off, with some parts maybe needing a little more added. All in all however, the story is indeed a vital touch to this game, which makes the game feel really spectacular.

The gameplay was indeed quite enjoyable. Although some parts seemed tedious at times, and others just plain frustrating, the overall experience of this first-person platformer is quite joyful and exciting. The controls feel good, and the movement through the air feels polished. Except for a few terrain glitchinges, and the occasional problem with the grappling arm, moving about feels generally fun. It really does feel like you're flying through the air at high speeds. Overall, the gameplay was not perfect, but definitely very good.

Receiving this game for free, it was an honor to play it. In my opinion, the game may not be worth ¬£10 to its full capacity, as it only lasts 4-6 hours (depending on how long the player takes), and replayability is generally quite low, except for the occasional achievement hunting. However, I am also a student with low income, so I may not be the best person to ask about finances. If I could play this game again for the first time, I definitely would. Even for the price, it's worth playing."
5649,"It's okay. The environments are fantastic, but the animation looks like the live-action Pinocchio movie, and the characters range from looking pretty good to unintentionally horrifying. At first, I thought the story going to have a plot twist, but no, not really. I thought this because the story is so bad I couldn't take it at face value. There is technically a plot twist, but you have to read between the lines to figure it out, and it's not good either. [spoiler] Uncle Fred actually died in a climbing accident, and the protagonist just made up a scenario where he could still be alive. This is kind of a lame twist.[/spoiler] The voice acting also ranges from really good, to kids show quality. The gameplay is pretty good, it has a nice sense of flow to it, but there isn't a lot of variety in the abilities, and towards the end, it's kind of hard to tell what you can grapple on to and what you can't. I was just kind of bored by the end of the game, even though this game is pretty short."
5650,Story is alright. The experience comes mainly from the music and just jumping and grappling around. The atmosphere of the game is very nice and I 10/10 reccomend picking it up.
5651,"This game had a very nice story and was enjoyable to play. To note the game wasn't super long so I do recommend to get it on a sale. Also, it is an easy to learn hard to master type of game so there may be times where the game may frustrate you but it is very satisfying when you finally reach the next checkpoint. Overall, this is a game I would recommend others to play."
5652,"Nice, but not for me.
From about half way in the game there is no more flow as you try over and over to solve the next sequence. And the next. And this one takes 20 tries.  The next just 18. The next 35 tries.
I quit on the final & hardest chapter and watched the rest on youtube.
As I read later this is rather recommended to play on m&k, I played on controller. So maybe I will give it another try."
5653,"A fun game with a good story.
Would recommend."
5654,OOF
5655,"Almost cried. Almost.




I cried."
5656,great game
5657,A very great game with a very great story !
5658,Beautifull....but boring
5659,Good Game... Would be better if the story was longer than 2 hours tho!!!
5660,"Damn boi very nice game 
great gameplay ,unique world (great for screenshots :v), very good level design
i got it for free from Humble Bundle but anyway it worth :3"
5661,"Beautiful story, beautiful graphics, fun gameplay. Although it¬¥s a bit short, it¬¥s definitely worth it if you like this kind of game!"
5662,Amazing game. Best platforming game I played.
5663,im just be honest.I suck at these kind of games(really try as hard as i chould) n i can easily get headache at these stuff.Sorry for those who like this kind of games.Its fun just that im bad af at this game.
5664,"Nice story and i really enjoy the gameplay.
I also like the world building and soundtrack, 
even though it was short but very wholesome.
Very short buy i enjoyed nonetheless."
5665,"Got it while it was free, 
pretty good game but really short, i finished it in about 2 hours according to steam.
Not sure if i would pay money for this though"
5666,"a good story with good graphics

thank u <3"
5667,beautiful scene
5668,i like this game :)
5669,"Good storyline, pretty scenery, good movement system. Game can be finished within 2-3 hours. 10/10 would recommend"
5670,when ur home alone with ur uncle
5671,Got this game for free. Want my free back.
5672,"I was lucky enough to get this game for free when I logged into Steam at a random time.
I think I'd seen a trailer for this game once and didn't know what to expect aside from some platforming puzzles.
Overall, it was an enjoyable game to play through but lacking in polish.
The gameplay is fun.  Grappling around on floating rocks feels smooth and fairly intuitive.  I say 'fairly' because the grapple operates as a straight pull with no 'swing' to it as might be anticipated by general rope physics and the games 'cover art' as seen right below the community hub button.  This means pulling yourself towards any object too long will lead to bonking your head and losing all momentum.  There's a certain finicky-ness to the technique the game is asking you to master that might put some people off.
Story-wise, it felt fairly forced and unconnected with the world.  The game is infrequently narrated by the protagonist telling the story to his daughter many years later.  Not a bad device, but there were long stretches where there wasn't anything to for the character to comment on.
There are a few speaking characters encountered in the game who outline a bit more of what's going on, but the story they're telling doesn't make much sense.  It feels like someone had a outline of a world then threw some para-science mystery stuff on top of it.  
I would still recomend the game.  I value unique experiences in gaming and this had plenty of that.  Grappling is usually a lot less free-form and I was able to enjoy dashing around randomly.  Has this game made it to AGDQ yet?  I would love to see a speed runner's take of this game.  I need to go check after finishing this review.
On a final note, I've completed one playthrough of the game and only earned on achievement so far.  The majority they have are for completing portions of the game without dying and using a limited number of grapples.  These are the kinds of achievements I like as they encourage playing through again with more of a goal. 
"
5673,Amaizing story hidden in plain sight. Loved the mechanics of it though at the end it became a bit chunky it still felt amaizing soring through the sky.
5674,"I have got this game for free and I wouldn¬¥t mind giving developers some money. It is nice, friendly, kinda relaxing game. It¬¥s a shame that the main story is only for 2 hours, but I have enjoyed these 2 hours a LOT. More games like these please, it¬¥s really nice. I recommed for everyone."
5675,Pretty nice surprise having received this game for free on humble bundle. It's a fan 3D platformer with a quite unique approach. It's short but this short amount of time ist packed with gameplay. Good game!
5676,YES
5677,"In A Story About My Uncle you are searching for your uncle in a fantasy world by using hooks, fast jumps and jet boots.

[b]cons[/b]

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
A Story about my uncle is a challenging gaming experience with punishing platforming with an average story. Only recommended if you are interested into this game or if you are too proud to admit that you might be bad at platforming.

Genre: first-person platforming
Replay value: low
Rating: don't know
Recommendation: It depends
Special endorsement: No"
5678,"The concept of swinging around with a grappling hook seems cool, but A Story About My Uncle doesn't really do much with it. I'm a sucker for fast-feeling games, and this game has a real lack of feel when it comes to the grappling hook. It doesn't... feel as fast as it could (Yes, I'm probably nitpicking, but overall the gameplay doesn't feel super enjoyable). Apart from that, well, it's a short game where you're occasionally brought to a max speed of ""casual stroll"" so you can watch a ""Half-Life 2 cutscene""  where people talk and all you wanna do is just keep playing the fucking game already (and it's jarring how instead of talking to people, the narrator/protagonist says something like ""I said this""). It's a pretty short game, and if I hadn't gotten it for free I'd probably consider refunding. Not that it's awful, but it's nothing to write home about and there are more interesting games to play."
5679,"So I got this game when they were recently doing the free giveaways... And I am so happy i did. This is a stunning game, amazing story line, and generally put together spectacularly. I would definitely recommend, it is well worth the money. I have not yet completed the game but I am excited for what lies in store ahead...  So happy I found this game. This would also work amazingly as a VR (if there isn't already... I'm not sure). Play this game!"
5680,I bought this game for free but if i had known this game was this good i would give double price. I wish this game to have second game.>>>>>> You can start second game from last place you left. The portal starts without want and teleports to the other universe. Then you see a suit. Better then the one you weared when you were kid.<<<<<<< The continue story might be like this
5681,great story but ..@#%!ing game play ... i almost smash mouse some of the time ... :angry:
5682,"This game is a fun responsive platformer with a story that feels complete and actually is pretty good. Its reather cheap coming in at 12.99 USD and feels polished to that level. The platforming is challenging (sometimes) and really satisfactory. Your character feels like they have real weight. The game looks good, not amazing or anything out of the park, but good. My only real complaint is the length. Clocking in at 2 to 3 hours its a rather short experience that I wish was longer. I also got this wierd clipping problem sometimesa but it didn't break the game so I gave it a pass.

TL;DR
Fun responsive platformer with a good story, but short.
8/10"
5683,Great Platform concept; a little treasure in the genre
5684,"Nice story and nice atmosphere, game play is just ok, overall THIS GAME IS GREAT! give it a try."
5685,"Nice game, received it for free, but it is worth to buy.
Game perfectly runs on a laptop.
Adventure game, parkour game...
You can watch some walktrough on youtube to see the awesome graphics.
"
5686,What a great game! I was amazed how it allowed a continual sense of exploration and the feeling of freedom throughout.
5687,Short but amazing
5688,"Great game, visually stunning and a story line that made me feel like I was actually in the world. 9/10"
5689,"Nice storyline, enjoyed it till the end, but the time trials are little bit unforgiving, especially on the first one, where hooks are not available mid run."
5690,"A Story About My Uncle is a good adventure game, with easy-to-learn controls, a good storyline and great environments. I rate it 9/10, would recommend."
5691,"emotional story, buggy gameplay but cool enough for time pass."
5692,very nice 2 hour long story
5693,"When i play, i am like become a spiderman."
5694,I don't know how the fuck it got me but it's pretty fun and challenging
5695,"I literally can't stop saying literally like literally its really hard, leafy ruined this game while literally saying literally 500 literal times"
5696,"Great Indie title with particular strong points, it offers a unique way of moving through the levels with an enormous sense of freedom and agility, although in the ending chapters the maps are more complex in order to increase the challenge. The story has its moments with a heartwarming and nostalgic feel to it, but in my opinion where this game really stands-out is in the art department, you can really tell that there was a lot of creativity involved in it, most of the maps seem like something that probably most of us have dreamt about, which mixed with the music make it for a memorable experience alone. Obviously due to its short duration I would have to highly recommend this title if it is on sale."
5697,"A really nice, cute & warm game with interesting physics & movement. Sometimes you don't need a compagnion cube, just some rocket boots & a friend ;)"
5698,A great game for free a little short though but thats ok I had fun all the way
5699,A short but sweet adventure. I wish Gone North  had spent their time developing a sequel rather than a bunch of stupid goat games.
5700,awesome gameplay but too short...way too short....
5701,"I found the hidden mercy main inside me.
This is soooo soothing and drags you in bigtime.
Kudos to the devs, the world is beautiful, gameplay ultra responsive, a fine overall idea.

If I would buy it myself? No, but that's me having a contract with the devil to spend money only  on multiplayer games.
I highly reccomend it though"
5702,Very gud game
5703,Great story. Good mechanics.
5704,"This was a lovely game with a very nice story a good ending and good controlls

overall a good game"
5705,A Story About My Uncle is a great game to play when you just wanna rela- ... I SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT JUMP WHAT THE FU-
5706,"6/10

Decent first person platformer, beatable under 3 hours. Jumping and grappling is pretty fun, but getting a bit tedious near to the end, because of the not so great level desings. They are okay, but thats it. Sometimes lighting isnt great either, and the voice acting is just bad, honestly. The plot itself is decent though. Also I hate when collectibles doesnt affect your gameplay. All they do is unlock some modded versions of the game (which you wont play anyways).

13 EUR for a 6/10, 3 hour long game? Nah bro. I got it for free, but the maximum I would pay for this game is about 4 or 5. Typically one of those you games what you buy during 70-80% off.

Agains all its flaws, I would still recommend playing it once. The core mechanics of the game is enjoyable."
5707,"Amazing Game 8/10 Bit buggy with the Grappler sometimes.

A Story About My Uncle was Fun but sometimes Glitchy. Experience about what happened/were your uncle went. You have to Travel though an amazing atmosphere and meet Interesting characters along the way to Find your uncle and you get to use a variety of different tools/Weapons.

Overall its a good game. I recommend it."
5708,"[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i]

I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a short but good story. The game itself isn't that big. The story is short, the graphics are not the best and there is not a lot of options to configure. I did complete the whole story in just two hours without going too slow or fast. 

The gameplay is unique which makes it stand out from other games. You are in the story as it goes on. You start of in a small house where you find a robotic suit. Shortly after you enter a portal to a whole other dimension with platforms in a big cave. You use your suit to parkour around from platform to platform and learn new jumps as you progress. While playing you hear a narration talking inside your head about the story.

The controlls from the beginning are not hard at all, and you only learn a few more as you progress. There aren't a lot of techniques to learn which makes the game easy to progress. Even if the games is pretty straight forward there are some challaning parts towards the end which I had to play over and over several times till I completed them.

If I would want to change something in the game that would be to add more interaction. As you progress you don't get any sort of options how to continue the story. You can't interact in the world in any way. I would like to be able to choose different dialogues and be able to talk to the people in the villages. Maybe even add small sidequests which would make the game a bit longer."
5709,"This is one of the best stories games i have ever played!
awesome gameplay and cute story made me wanna play it over agen"
5710,very nice
5711,"The game is ultra fun and i like it.
My only Problem is that you just play the story 3 hours  then it's over.
You just can repeat levels.

But all other is fine ;)"
5712,No words can describe how i felt playing this game. It almost felt like reading a book. Narration of the game was amazing as it compliments the depth of the storyline. I grew attached to them characters introduced and was sad when i had to let Madeline go away. If this was virtual reality i think i would never leave home. Everything about this game is awesome and i LOVE IT! 10/10 I wish the story was a litte longer as i grew to love the game. But all good games must come to an end. Well done towards the creator of this game. I wish you make more games like this.
5713,"Short but challenging.

Sad and pretty at the same time.

It is a real game, not a walking simulator like Gone Home."
5714,"One of the best games I've played in a while
"
5715,"Beautiful!
Absolutely Beautiful!!
This is one of those games which makes me realize Bioshock or Metro or Subnautica aren't the only environmental masterpieces.
And gameplay is super good as well if you like platformers."
5716,cute
5717,"Got it for free on Humble Bundle. Its a short and cute platforming game with a grappling mecahnic. I wouldn't buy it full price, but give it a try if you ever come across it. 
"
5718,"This game is astonishing and the story is heart-touching. I'm not good enough to describe how much I loved it with words, but I really did, and some tears fell off my eyes during the end. I'm so happy I gave this game a try, and everyone should too."
5719,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game, it may be short, i completed it in ~5 hours, but it is a very good story/adventure game in my opinion. The game contains a fun grapling hook mechanic, and a bunch of beautiful villages with people. Sometimes I could actually almost go through a wall, but it isnt that big of an issue. All in All 8.5/10

(By the way I got this game on humblebundle for free)"
5720,"A Story About My Uncle is a very short game that can only be described as an air parkour platformer game. It follows the nephew of Uncle Fred, who is narrating over his past adventure to his daughter as a bedtime story. The protagonist, whose name is never revealed, so we will call him Nephew, is looking for his uncle that has not been heard from in a few days. After inspecting his house, Nephew finds a suit that allows him to jump high and far, as well as not take any fall damage and grapple from almost anywhere. He then finds an observatory pad that takes him to another world. From there he has to traverse amazing locations to find his lost uncle, encountering his creations along the way. 

The story is simple but perfectly done it almost brought me to tears. The plot reminds me a lot of the plot for the movie TRON: Legacy. How an idolised family member makes an amazing other world for the young one to explore later on in life. I won't spoil anything but they are very similar.
The graphics, although over 4 years old, still hold very well to this day. 
The movement at times can be a little annoying but otherwise done very well. 
The game is around two hours long which leaves you wanting a lot more, however, you can go back and do a time trial on some areas. 

Although it is only around two hours long, this game takes you on a wonderful journey through amazing landscapes. Definitely worth every penny and worth two hours of your time. I want to experience more in this world.

5721,It's a bit hard to get a feel for the range of your abilities but other than that this is epic and you should play it
5722,Best Free Game I have got so far!
5723,For a First Person Puzzle Game its really awesome i love how the mechanics work and the Beautiful Scenery and heart-touching ending ill give it 9.7/10
5724,I love the concept. It's a bit tricky getting used to the controls. Still learning.
5725,long story short this game good
5726,Kiddie game
5727,"The parkour is fun to an extent, but not good enough to make up for the dialogue, voice acting and characters."
5728,"""I made a flashlight powered by crystals!""
*Crystals glow on their own*
Bad writing, good gameplay with terrible checkpoints and a sence of direction. They could have made it like mirrors edge catylist, where it's a semi open world, but no. Very small ammount of air control, at least to the crazy surfing source games give you. Maddie's challenge sucked, because you had to do 3 extremely percise sprint jumps. But what do you expect from the creators of goat simulator?"
5729,"40% enjoying the game 
60% confused"
5730,"Good game but I'm a bad platformer player so the gameplay is very frustrating to me, have to trial and error every jump, and fall a lot of time. Other than that it's all good."
5731,+rep me
5732,I can dig it
5733,"A great game with adventure, story, and mystery It takes a new look on platformers"
5734,"First and foremost, I got this game for free. I state this because I'm genuinely glad I did because I would have regretted spending the $$ on it if I did buy it. Honesty inbound.

I'll start with the good. The environment is easily the best part of the game, Star Haven I'm looking at you. The maps are nice and it feels like you've actually stepped into another world at times. The inhabitants of the first two maps are unique and I genuinely would have enjoyed learning much more about them and their different cultures than you really see in the game (although I'll admit that the tag-a-long you pick up nearly took a very long flight through the void during a certain challenge, simply because I got tired of sliding off the side when I thought I had more ground than the game did and grappling to save myself) and the grappling sets it apart from other platformers in a way that's eye catching. 

The story is decent for such a short game and has a cute undertone of being a bedtime story from a father to his daughter, but I would honestly wait for one hell of a sale before picking it up. You'll get 3-3.5 hours out of it if you take your time (or are really bad at it like me) since the maps are very linear and don't allow for exploration except for the purpose of collectibles. 

Now why am I not recommending it? Well, the price is too steep for a handful of hours ($14 CAD), and it's way too easy to rage quit because of clunky mechanics. The dialogue is okay for the most part, but there are some points where it's just awkward to listen to. The grappling system is enjoyable and interesting, when it works. Other times, it'll be just too far to reach and you'll have to start back from the last checkpoint for the hundredth time. I lost count of how many times I thought I had ample clearance for momentum only to smack my head into the rock I was swinging from and come to a screeching halt and a very aggravating fall into the void while staring up at the rock that did its best Scar impression to my Mufasa. 

Though the game is almost 5 years old at this point, so there's a lot it can be forgiven for due to age. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel like I could be playing a much more enjoyable game at the same price for more than twice the amount of replayability. 

Final verdict? Eh. Not worth the $$ at full price. If you really want it, wait for a sale when it's listed at $5 or lower."
5735,"short, good game, loved playing,"
5736,"U know first when i got the game i said to myself: this games looks terrible.
Well now that i've played it till the of it's story, eventhough it only took me 100min to end the game it really gave me a good feeling in the end.
When he was reading the ending message I was deep in the story.
I really wish it was longer so i could see Maddie and Uncle again with their new lives ;D 
"
5737,"Yes i got the game for free but i will try to be honest with my review:

It is hard to say. First of all this is not bad game, but i cant give medium recomendation so here is why i gave Not recommend.  

It is too short for current price (13‚Ç¨) really 2 hours +- of storyline which is too linear and realy not replayable. I doubt that i will play it again. 

The enviroment and level design is not terrible but i would like some more freedom of movement around and maybe explore some hidden playces or just something more like go the other way and see more about story about things that you meet. Who or what are they ? only explanation is in the end.

Story telling is not so rubish but the dialogues are just not going to get you involved much and they dont tell you a lot. And also there is not much time to tell the story remmember 2 hours.

Equipment: you have your suit with grapling device, rocket boost and jump charge.
You are going to use all of them but the controls are a bit clunky and woukd be nice if we had some more stuff like glider (which is prop in game or something else what could help in making the game longer.

Owerall if you like to fly and jump around in adventures feel free to buy this game but when its on sale."
5738,"I'm bad at platforming, the frog people are creepying looking, the voice acting isn't the greatest, and I haven't had this much fun in a platformer since Portal 2 introduced more ways to science.

A very well made game. The levels feel very well designed, the story is simple (so far, haven't finished), and over all it feels like the game concentrates on what it wants to be: a platformer.

Unfortunately, the game won't start anymore as it continually minimizes itself. Anyone know a fix?"
5739,"So I just played this game for the first time last night and I must say, I loved it! For I game that was built like a steedrunner's deam. It was beautiful, fun, and with a nack for storytelling I have not seen it other games like it. I have started my adventure and I hope you try if for yourself and to all of you I will see you on the other side.

5741,"I loved playing this game! It's quite a ""jump all the time"" game but the story is great, concept is fantastic and the gameplay is addictive. You can't go wrong with your choices. It's a vast map and the whole point is to explore it as much possible. Sadly it only took a couple days to finish it and I wanted more. You can of course play it again to get more achievements (I might do that in the future).
I hope there will be a sequel to this.
"
5742,This is one of the best games i have ever played. Its been ages since i have felt so much enjoyment playing a game. Everything in it is perfect making it a fun experience but i would have liked it to be longer as it was under 2 hours
5743,Short but sweet game. worth picking up when it's cheap if you enjoy movement based adventure games.
5744,this game is super cool
5745,"Just... aweful story telling. The whole thing is just blatently uninteresting as a concept, the platforming is completely disorganized and suffers from way to much openess at most parts. The actual controls are kinda wonky, and while theres a varaity of different ways to do each secton, its mostly through abusing the mechanics.

The only actually gameplay part of it really comes down to finding these little machines with paper that comes out of the, a total of 25 hidden that gets you unlocks. I got the first, which is just a different color beam (which you use constantly throughout the game) and thats really all there is to it. Theres goat mode and something like free athletic mode or something like that I forget the name. But nothing actually worth getting.

Basically you wanna play the game for the story itself, and the story is just plain crap. It seems like its written by not native english speakers, but even if thats the case, the structure and flow of everything is so off, its like a 10 year old wrote it.

I just... I can't exaggerate how terrible the story is, and its the only reason to even play this ""game"". Ive heard worse stories in games, but not many. Im pretty sure I got this one free, still feel like it wasnt worth playing.

P.S. really boggels my mind that anyone would upvote this game, or claim the story is any good. I forgot to mention theres like 2 voice actors in the whole thing. Theres portions where, basically the whole time your reliving the past, so the narrator should be talking as his younger self. The character you are playing. But where he should be talking as a young boy, the narrator talks over as though narrating a silent protagonist. 
For the love of god, don't waste your money on this game."
5746,"Really short, but really worth it. I'm not usually one for story, but I really liked this one, and the gameplay is fun too. Totally recommended."
5747,"What a amzing Story, I love it, too bad it is 2 hours long. The gameplay was amazing and additive i wish that there was more"
5748,"Got the game for free a while ago from humble bundle. Its pretty buggy, even as for a free game, but overall it was a fun experience."
5749,This game has one of the best story line and indulging experience. The atmosphere is so big and the narration really adds to the touch of colorful emotions. Need to play more of such great stuffs.
5750,Chinese! We need Chinese!!!!!
5751,"A wonderfully delightful little game which transports you into another world.  You can play it in the time it takes to watch a good movie. 
The mechanics are very satisfying, allowing you to soar through different worlds."
5752,"Pros: 
-Portal vibes
-Cute, short story
-Creative world design
-Fun and intuitive gameplay
-Was released on my birthday :)

Cons:
-Graphics are a bit dated, but still pretty
-One of the voice actors is a bit mediocre"
5753,"The best falling simulator that I've ever played.

5754,"Graphics: Poo

Audio: I have no idea can't remember.

Visual Scale: Massive 

Story: Just, play it. If you're a human, you will get it."
5755,"I first saw this game as the backdrop for a youtube video where the youtuber just talked and talked, and it piqued my curiosity...
After getting the game, i am pleasantly surprised by how good the game is. As an Indie game, expectations were a little here and there, but after spending a few hours playing the game, I can recommend this as a must have for gamers.
Light and casual, yet heavily dependent on physics and timing, this game is a great option for gamers, young and experienced alike."
5756,It really makes you FEEL like Leafy
5757,"[b] Great game 10/10. Relaxing and good story. If you are looking to buy it, it is definitely worth it. [/b]"
5758,"Huh... I honestly only wanted to play this game for a bit of fun due to the movement mechanics reminding me of Dishonored and to a lesser extent Portal 2's high-speed antics...
The story though... It's strange for certain... But pleasant... And it leaves you with a touch of melancholy - not too much, but... just enough.
I think I'm gonna play it again... Yeah."
5759,This game is really good and definitely worth playing if you've got a couple of hours to spare
5760,Even i dont like platforming but this game is so good
5761,muinto bom graficos otimos!
5762,don't even bother yourself playing this game there are no hints and the gameplay is absoloute BS
5763,"I like the concept of this game, however the frustration is the part forbid me to actually enjoy ""A story about my uncle"" but what is worth of the game is the adventure which is kind of amazing.... and therfore I change my mind .... maybe I would recommend some players who like to be challenged"
5764,Flawed and unfinished feeling mechanics. Poor animations and voice acting. I suppose it was free for a reason.
5765,"10/10, played through it in one go, the gameplay is awesome and satisfying, the story is great and interesting, and the visuals are amazing. thank you for this game"
5766,beautiful little masterpiece here man 9.5/10
5767,"Im usually not one for reviews but this game is worth it. I got this game for free and did'nt expect much of it but played it none the less. Maybe it was the low expectations but i was completley blown away by this game. from the art to the gameplay it got it all right for me. It's a simple game but i had more fun in the 2 hrs it took to finish than i have had in games ive spent 20 hrs in. The story isnt perfect but its for sure one i will remember fondly. The levels have various challenge levels but none were too difficult imo, but all of them were fun. My only critisism of this game is its length, i loved every minute of this game and was a little heart broken when the credits came. I was falling in love with this game and it was all over too soon. Still well worth the time and money"
5768,Amazing game with clearly alot of dedication put in. I received it for free but would of gladly paid 10+ for it. Great game
5769,"Nice story telling, graphics and mechanics. Some levels are challenging, but not too hard and it takes about 2-3 hours from start to finish. It's a solid game, 

BUT

It destroyed my save game. This issue has been reported numerous times but the developers did nothing."
5770,It is a fun game but with a subtle and anti-climatic ending. Liked the gameplay but the ending could have been better. ( got this game on the free weekend deal)
5771,very emotional and goot loved it
5772,"As one of the further reviews said: 
Take some time, get some tea and enjoy this beautiful story game."
5773,This is a to out of ten game for me nice easy relax game great story only took me 2 hours might be a bit short but really fun overall
5774,"This game is decent , only took about 3 and half hours to beat , only recieved one achievement , which i may go back and play from time to time to unlock more. Unique grapple & jumping game, i just wish there were more dynamics to the game like puzzles to unlock secret areas or to unlock more of a story line arc, maybe throw in multiple endings based on choices made through dialogue (no choices can be made during dialogue) , which its not a bad thing just would like the option. 

Landscape visuals were great, sound was great, fluid movements were great. Story could of used a bit more , but it did its job. I'd recommend getting this game if you like adventure type games."
5775,"Beautiful. Just beautiful. There are no words that can describe this masterpice. Even if i got it for free, if i would have heard about it sooner, i would actually bought it. 10/10 Would play it again"
5776,[b]6.5/10[/b]
5777,just... not fun
5778,"Nice idea, but frustration grows. After you emerge from the first ""inside"" levels I was in awe of how the landscaped looked. 

I got frustrated because the save points get further apart from each other and after having done a certain part for the 5th+ time it gets old really quick. You cannot have a moment to think when you are mid-air. The grappling hook disables itself when it reaches its destination. I think it would be more relaxed if I am allowed to hang from my grapling hook so I can look around and plan my next move, no rush. - The current game needs you to fall (fail) so you can try again (some parts are near impossible to complete if you have never seen them before), it is made so by design. I don't like this. If a part between save points consists of multiple obstacles I don't want to do them 5-10+ times. It's too hard. Either have more save-points so also marginal progress is kept or allow a dangling grapling hook or an auto-anchor-line so I can continue from my last object I attached to. The game has a nice story, but during some parts it demands too much from me while being mid-air. 

So at the moment this games does not make me happy and makes me feel frustrated by its fall-and-try-again mechanism again and again."
5779,A beautiful yet sometimes frustrating platform focused adventure game with a heavy focus on narrative storytelling that will only take you about 3 hours to playthrough
5780,worth 12 bucks
5781,Its a wonderful game but its only single player :)
5782,Very cool at first I had no idea what was going on but then later on I played to find out
5783,"Overall: This game is simple yet is an amazing game to play. The developers put alot of effort on the small details. I totally recommend try out the game yourself. 

Pros: 
1.Amazing soundtrack I must admit.
2.Good grappling system. 
3.Simple graphics with good textures.

Cons:
1.Glitch (Some spots you can't grapple , you can stand at some unintentional area)
2.Anoying character hurrying you (Kept saying ""HEY OVER HERE"" for the whole game)"
5784,"This was a nice surprise for a free download. There's real heart in it. The story was pleasant, the gameplay had a solid core idea that it stuck to with elements of challenge (occassionally). It was short, but I'm sure there's replayability in the other modes. Had it been any longer, I think it would have suffered."
5785,uncle flashbacks
5786,"Good job, you just made my day! I really like this game because of its game mechanics and the story.
Totally recommending everyone!"
5787,waste time?? play it
5788,"as a person who afraid of height, this is the game make my hands sweat. not even horror game can make me sweat like this."
5789,"Not much content here for the price, however I would pick it up for sale at around 3 0r 4 bucks if you can. 
There are some segments of the game I feel like I lucked my way through with the buggy grappler.
The rest of the game I sped through like there was no obstacles. Recommended for a rainy day."
5790,"Love this game. Nice story and mechanics.

But I need to know what happened to the Uncle!"
5791,"Saw a pop up about the game and decided to give it a try. It's pretty short, at about 4 hours long depending on how naturally you find the platforming in the world. There are 4 zones and they all look beautiful. I really like the simple controls, yet there were parts that were quite frustrating. Luckily, there are so many auto save points that you aren't punished for making a mistake, and that is a nice change of pace. The last zone autosaves are fewer and that can get tiresome, but this is also where you have the fastest sense of movement and the most difficult moves. The ending leaves a lot to be desired and felt rushed. Worth looking into, especially on sale, if the idea of a fantasy-style Mirrors Edge (though far less ambitous) appeals to you."
5792,"Atmospheric platformer, fun three hours."
5793,"Storyline starts with a father telling his daughter a bedtime story. 
As the story unfolds you play through this bedtime story and relive it.

Pro's
- Great first-person perspective with beautiful scenery and a captivating storyline making for a very immersive playthrough 
- Great levels with varying complexity
- Controls are intuitive. 

Con's
- The main campaign took me about 4 hours. 

However, there are enough challenges that you can pursue after completion, such as:
- Time trials
- Steam Achievements 
- Finding all the hidden collectables 

All in all a very enjoyable game! I would highly recommend it! Great ambiance."
5794,"It's a short, solid game with unique play, simple but beautiful graphics, and a calming score.

I had a terrible day today, and this was a wonderful way to wind down at the end of it.

Worth your time."
5795,"game is bullshit,dont waist money,game wont save file locations you need to play it from one go,cant fix game,stupid devlopers!!"
5796,Good game  I got it free but its cheap on sale recommanding it
5797,"So picked this little gem up while it was free and I gotta say, i did really enojy it. Now its not a very lengthy game, and sure there is room for work on certain pieces but its one of the better games i've played for a while and I would reccomend it to most people. 8/10"
5798,"i received this game for free thanks to Humble Bundle and I'm very glad I did. I had always seen footage of ASMU in the background of commentary videos on youtube and thinking ""huh that game looks neat."" Finally sitting down to play it was quite the treat, so i'll discuss each aspect in detail:

Story: While not immediately deep or profoud (that requires some analysis on your part) at face value, you're getting a whimsical bedtime story that a father is narrating to his daughter, where he traverses a mystical world in order to find his uncle. The story has some extra meat to it with a small narrative about salamander people that Uncle Fred befriended, but it's not much. Still, the story does a great job at making the journey fun and creative. The small anecdotes the narrator tells from time to time help ever-so-slightly build up the world in his story and in real life, too.

Visuals: to put it bluntly, this game is pure eye candy. Each of the locations is gorgeous and fun to traverse. There aren't many locations, but each one is varied and eye-catching. My only gripe about the visuals is the character/NPC design, which segues into...

Characters: There's a small cast of characters to be found, including the narrator, his uncle and daughter, and the salamander people. They aren't too deep as characters go but they do their job well and good. Unfortunately all the characters are incredibly stiff. The NPC models are low poly, stiff/jerkish, and unpolished. The voice work is also a little stiff- especially for the salamander people, who have odd accents that, while i'm sure were meant to sound foreign and exotic, just sound stiff and stilted. This is probably the only grip i have and it's very minor.

Gameplay: One of the shining aspects is the gameplay and hoo boy does it deliver. After getting used to the controls, its easy to lose yourself in the action of swinging from floating island to floating island. Its all super refined and tuned, allowing for precise control and smooth-as-butter grappling. While the grappling can be a tad wonky at times, it's very responsive most of the time. The game does a good job of giving you a general idea on which path to follow, though it does somewhat encourage sandbox-y approaches to obstacles as well.

Any other gripes?:
Aside from the NPC thing from earlier, i believe the only other grip I have with the game is that it's woefully short. The main game is only around 2 hours to complete the story, maybe 3 if you go for collectibles and extras. It's definitely a small package but thankfully it makes the 2.1 hours i spent on it very enjoyable.

Verdict: While it's definitely a bite-sized, short romp, it's a fun and eye-popping one at that. The game (for the most part) is very polished and plays like a well-oiled machine. My only regret is that it left me wanting more grappling action only a sequel could fulfill. I give A Story About My Uncle a 7.5/10."
5799,This game is like being forced to read the back of a cereal box for 2 hours after you finished the cereal.
5800,"I dont know what to say. I knew this game had pretty graphics and a fun traversal system. I had no clue that there was a heartwarming story sitting beneath it all. This game is great, it's definetly worth the price. So do yourself a favor and play this incredible game."
5801,"I loved it. It had a great story and great gameplay. I did Maddie's challenge, it was a pain in the neck, but I eventually did it. I hated Maddie for a while after that. Ending was bittersweet. Overall, it was an awesome game."
5802,"i got it for free, its a fun game but i would not pay money for it
good story, decent graphics, well optimized"
5803,"Pretty good story although short, gameplay is fun but was also quite frustrating at times whilst falling on the very edge of a platform. Full price doesn't seem worth it if the story only takes about 2-3 hours and you're only planning on playing through it once, but nontheless it's still decent."
5804,"So much crystal meth in this game, I like"
5805,"So, after playing through this, basking in all of it, took it all in, I'm glad to say I got this game.
It was a short but wonderful experience, wish it was longer I suppose, but it doesn't need it.
Wish I bought this full price, and I'd happily recommend it to others.
So pick it up, put about 3 hours of your life into it,
and listen to a bedtime story about an uncle, and his nephews journey to find him, and finding more in the long run..."
5806,one of the best adventure games
5807,"One word. Fun.
Enjoyed the challenge, enjoyed the gameplay, enjoyed the visuals. It is well worth your time and money."
5808,"Really nice game, good for background gameplay for videos and a great story aswell!
it is kinda short tho, but worth it

best 2h spent"
5809,<3
5810,nice game
5811,"Just beat the game in just under 5 hours. I recommend this game! Loads of fun, and can be pretty challenging at times. Loved it!"
5812,"Probably one of the best atmospheric games I've played in quite some time. Had a very good balance between obstacles that made it so not only was there room for mistakes but there was room for being able to enjoy the pure beauty of the game while gracefully falling. Very nice smooth implementation of more and more difficult puzzles with more added energy bars and the rocket boost ability. The only thing I would warn others about before buying this is the lack of length to the story. But I wouldn't say it's anywhere close to a deal breaker for a game of this depth, beauty, and complexity with a simplicity of understanding how to conquer that complexity. A Story About My Uncle."
5813,"Great game with great story. I am so tired of AAA titles and CS:GO. It was funny, relaxing and different. 9/10 overall"
5814,"storyline not that bad, i liked it"
5815,One of the coolest games I have ever played. I really like the immersive storytelling and the fact that it is in the setting of a bedtime story. I really like the gameplay mechanics and soothing soundtrack.
5816,"Such a cute story, and the game is pretty short, but you should definitely experience it."
5817,Who left this bowl of onions here?
5818,"This game is a game
"
5819,"Loved this game, have beaten the Main Story with 11/25 collectables, took 2.3h, but I enjoyed pretty much all of it."
5820,Not good..
5821,Fun gameplay and emotional story. The game is only 2 hours long but it's a blast all the way through.
5822,"Wow, I really loved the experience actually. It's a kids story done in a VERY beautiful way !!! Recommend!"
5823,"I am not a fan of platformers, just boring gameplay to me."
5824,"this game makes me feel good


then i look again and i feel bad


7.5/10"
5825,It is a great game to play and has very fun mechanics.
5826,"Good game, the story is about 2.5-3.5 ish hours long
You pretty much play as Spiderman with rocket boots"
5827,fun game I played as a kid and got to replay again 7/10
5828,This is one of the most beautiful games you will ever play. It is so charming and the art style is amazing. The ending made me cry but it was so worth it <3
5829,"[b]Avengers: Codename Uncle[/b]

‚Ä¢ Monkey people
‚Ä¢ Linear grappling hook game
‚Ä¢ Searching for Tony Stark"
5830,can be buggy at times but very enjoyable!
5831,"very good game. rlly love it. thx you guys )
"
5832,Don't spend too much time with your uncles kids
5833,really good game would love to see a continuation of this game
5834,"Really good game! Doesnt last that long, but still a great game! 10/10"
5835,It was a very nice story and cool levels with the mechanics of the game.
5836,"Although I played a lot of good games like Assassin's Creed II or Dying Light, I would not give any of them more than 8/10. The story about my uncle, I can safely say, is the best game I've ever played. Pleasant to the eye graphics, nicely done animations, perfectly soundtrack or gameplay itself make this short, inconspicuous arcade game something unbelievable. With a clear conscience I give you 10/10.
P.S. I downloaded it when it had a free weekend or something like that. In my opinion, the normal price is a bit too high."
5837,"I though this was going to have a sad story but in the end it suprised me! 
I trutly recommend this game!"
5838,"Ez speedrun in less than 3 hours. But for real tho, this game has a decent story about this character, well by the name of the title, this says half of it and you really find your long lost uncle. Now this story goes well because the person you as (The Nephew) looks for his uncle and he has not been seen by any of the friends you meet for a long time. The art style even with its age is still beautfiul and has the content in this nice, succinct and short with the difficulty level on the obstacles you have to make through at the right difficulty where you wont struggle for a very long time with it and at the same time not too easy where you can just slide by at ease. The game is fun and even though I did not buy it. It is worth its money. I rate it a good 8/10. Would fly through it again."
5839,Didn't want it to end..
5840,"Very good, short plattformer. The atmosphere, enviorment and graphics are cool and you want to explore the world and it's creatures. You can move with a hook, jumpbootes and jetboots. It's not really a fast platformer, it's sometimes a bit like portal or other ""puzzles"", where you have to think about your next moves before you start going. 

It was just long enough, to tell a good story with an end that is open for interpretations.
If you consider that this was the second game from the developer. after Goat Simulator, I wonder what they do next time.

[b]8/10"
5841,"This is a 3D jumper.
Not for people afraid of heights.
You will die many times, from falling into the ambyss.

Sometimes after you make a really difficult jump, there is no savepoint.
Can be frustrating if you die then.

But, after you become better, the game can be very entertaining.
Not my favorite genre so I am probably subjective and too negative. That's why I am giving a positive mark.

And yes, I am afraid of heights. 
"
5842,"**Got it for free but not from a developer or the like, it was a gift**

Started the game to farm the card drops, played for an hour and I'm loving it.
"
5843,"Now this is what you call a game! 

A fun and well thought out game!

This is gaming at its best fun, casual and simple!

10/10 Would grapple again!"
5844,"spoiler***

u have a daughter and u will tell her a story about your adventure of finding your uncle Fred. u go into his laboratory or some kind that shit and u will wear a custom suit which was made for u. As uncle Fred is easy to forgot a thing, he left his laboratory open and you the main character will be jump into the world which is full of frog people. they all kind and you will meet with Maddie (frog girl) then you will meet with very old male maddie :))) then u will collect 3 crystals and you will jump jump graple jump jump fail and do this again until you get to a new village, oh and u will find flying boots. By the way you will meet with one eyed large dick shaped centipide before u get to the new village. And maddie stays on the new village and you go to ice mountain to find ur uncle. then u will go there and jump graple, broke your boots find some tools fix it and jump graple until you find your uncle. Then your uncle tells you about how he loves that place and lets you go home. You will spend almost 2 hours on gameplay and spend only 2 minutes to talk with your uncle. Seriously. I want a new ending. Some invisible ninja is cutting onions in my room again fuuuuuck.

oh and i didnt achieve a single achievement lol"

5846,"This is an amazing, beautiful game... I loved it so much! The story is interesting and narrators voice is pleasant. The game mechanics are also great. I'd give this game a solid 9/10, although it is rather short."
5847,"One of the best 2 hours I had while playing a Video game.

Very awesome game. Only negative thing i can say is that its only 2 hours. Maybe 3 if you are a slow player.

I got it for free but its definitely worth 13$ for the experience."
5848,"Really great short game, nice level of challenge and beautiful game design !"
5849,Beautiful Jump and Run-storygame with an fabiolous gripping end.
5850,Love the game! The way the story is told is very good!
5851,"An excellent game. Might be a little nerdy, but a great story behined it and a nice game to relax."
5852,Love it! The story is beautiful and the platforming is great!
5853,"Great game but short, only buy on a steep discount."
5854,"Gameplay udah bagus
tapi ceritanya jelek + singkat"
5855,"I thought everyone played this as a kid but i was wrong. Everyone ive asked said that they have never heard of this game. Its amazing. I played it when i was 12 and i played it again, and junt now finished it again.
Story:7
Voice acting: It was pretty bad to be honest i wasnt really impressed by it. (4)
Graphics:6 (for 2014)
Gameplay: 8
Its really enjoyable if u ignore the amateur voice acting. And even if u dont ignore it its great."
5856,Im lazy to write one but it was epic i can say
5857,"Amazing, loved it. I got it for free but honestly, worth every dolla this one costs 'cause it's just so good. It' short, maybe 4-6 hours to complete if you just sit down and play it, but man, the gameplay is so fun and the story is nice. 10/10"
5858,the NPC's look like crap. compared to how great the enviroment looks this shouldnt have been a problem.
5859,Who else received this game for free? Great game bTw. The graphics are mesmerizing and can run in a potato pc. 10/10
5860,10/10
5861,"It's a good game, quite poetic.
Replayability is limited regarding the storyline. Challenges are fun tho. 
Price is a bit high IMO, would never have played if I didn't receive for free."
5862,"not worth the price tag because of how short the game is.

Maybe if the game was 10 hours instead of 2 it would be worth it"
5863,"Goodlooking game with some pretty great core concepts but it's shortlived, i'd give it a solid 8/10, Great for $20 AUD or less. a lot of potential for growth, given the toutorial stops maybe 20 minutes before you finish the game."
5864,"Beautiful game, fun to play, give it a try! 9/10 (9 out of 10)"
5865,why am i shaking and crying after finishing the game :-(
5866,"Decent, but not my cup of tea.

Pros:
- FPS platforming decent (controls can be tricky if poorly timed)
- Short length limited the frustration (~2hrs)

Cons:
- platorming difficult spikes on the last level (e.g. too few checkpoints in one section)
- voice acting was below average
- character models and animations were jittery
- story not particularly memorable"
5867,"A perfect game to grab some tea and spend an evening or two. The whole game is literally a bedtime story.

You'll find the game very relaxing and satisfying. The gameplay consists of running, jumping and grappling through caves and floating rocks while listening to some cute dialogs from time to time. Maddie is a very nice companion.

You also may spend some time writing down the fictional alphabet and decoding messages throughout the game, which is a little bit fun too.

However, if you are determined to get all the achievements, the experience will be quite the opposite. You'll have to replay every single level of the game dozens of times because mistakes aren't forgiving and lead to starting a level from scratch. I didn't have a lot of fun doing it, but if you enjoy challenges, this game definitely has some for you.

I got this game for free on a giveaway, but I'd gladly buy it on a sale."
5868,!!!
5869,"A story about my uncle, well that's a short story. He was arrested for assault towards a minor."
5870,"Another wonderful game.
Personally,I just felt I was wandering in the space.
When you are jumping or dragging yourself to another side,you will just have a fantastic feeling of flying which may a little like 'Just Cause' series but far from the same.
Though I always lost my way(I think it's my problem),the scenery is still attractive and relaxing enough.
The story doesn't have much plot for it's just a little thing while it is good enough to make us think."
5871,"PROS:                                                                                                                                                        CONS:

-Nice feeling of progression
-Accomplishing and satisfying gameplay"
5872,Great game
5873,"A very story-deep and interesting game. I would definitely recommend playing it as the experience is overwhelming. However, the game is not too long but the mechanics, the narration and the story make up for the duration of the game. 9/10"
5874,Really it is one of the better story games that i played but it kinda takes some searching to find the next check point and uhh yea
5875,The best real life simulator ever
5876,Instant butt clench simulator. 10/10.
5877,"Overall rating: 5/5 Would recommend.
- Length: 4hrs

+ Story: 5/5 Simple, yet intriguing. Main focus of the developers. Don't expect sudden plot twists but feelings and an interesting adventure of discovery instead. The writers are clearly talented and know how to convert a good story into a game.
- Voice acting: 3/5 Not spotless but good enough. Doesn't ruin the experience.
- Characters: 2/5 Mostly clich√© characters but as the story doesn't revolve around their personality much, the game can get away with it.

+ Gameplay: 5/5 Fun. It has multiple parkour elements unlocked to the player piece by piece, preventing it from becoming repetative.
- Player Freedom: 2/5 This one has a linear gameplay. Only one path is walkable and altrough you can wander off a bit, you have nothing to find, except some collectibles which the game rewards you for doing so, eventually leading the player into trying and bug out of the map all the time, expecting something to find. [strike]Also that scratching beeping sound still haunts me at nights[/Strike]
+ Navigation: 4/5 Having a linear course makes the game easier to navigate with little to no tools to show the correct way, as well as the targets are easily recognisable. The game is naturally easy to read without an arrow above our heads to look at.
+ Difficulty: 5/5 The game is challenging enoug yet provides a helping hand for noobs as well which also builds smoothly into the story. It provides an even experience for most and a chance to learn the game properly. 

+ Graphics, textures and models: 4/5 Not the best I've seen but it's good enough to tell the story the game has in store for us. 
+ Visuals: 5/5 Even with the inperfect textures and models, the game looks stunning from afar. And most of the time, when you need to see something, it's gonna be something quite afar. 
+ Sfx and music: 4/5 It's nothing special but it is well fitting. Lives up to the expectations.
+ Environment: 5/5 Simply beautiful. Maybe it's because of my obsession for [spoiler]Glowy flora, airships and basically everything that floats[/spoiler] but this game built an awesome fantasy world of it's own.

+Details: 5/5 Incredible. The game has a good job at painting the NPCs as a living society as well as building the environment in a way that it tells a story about that place or how could it be used and what could've happeend there without actually saying a word about it's past.
+ Extra content: 5/5 I'm not saying the game is full of secrets and easter eggs but that's because I haven't found all of them. The devs deffinitely were in a fun mood making this game and blessed us with a lot of cool stuff and references scattered across the whole game. I had just as much fun discovering them and had a good few chucles when I noticed one.

[b]Overall rating: 5/5 Would recommend. The game does everything good what it needs to do good and the rest is alright as well.[/b]

Thanks for reading, have a nice day Stranger^^
"
5878,"Its a fantastic game but is far too expensive for the amount of content. 1.5h game isnt a 13 dollar game. I got it when it was free. 
WAIT FOR SALE"
5879,"What a heartwarming little masterwork of a game. Seriously, this game had me all stuck in with it's story, characters, music and especially visuals. For a small production like this one, this has been a fantastic experience. I can only encourage everyone, who likes to be caught in exciting, moving [spoiler]and maybe a bit tragic [/spoiler]stories, to buy this game and play it. You won't need long to play through the whole story, but afterwards you'll feel like it just NEEDS to be longer. You'll feel the emptyness, I promise. But it's worth it."
5880,"This game is pretty bad imo... I wanted to like it but the checkpoints were too far apart and the gameplay is frustrating and the story wasn't great. I paid for this game too bad I took to long to play this or I would have refuned it.

2/10"
5881,It was an awesome game. I really had fun playing it. I fucking broke in tears at the end and i don't usually cry.
5882,Great game and all but waaaaay too short. gameplay is fun but you can complete the whole thing in just an hour or so. probably wouldn't buy it at full price though.
5883,"Really enjoyed the different style of play that this game offered, so challenging at times that I didn't think I would finish some sequences but I persisted and did. Short, but very sweet."
5884,This is actually a really fun game to play.  I wasn't expecting much but its a really impressive game.  The story and voice overs are top quality and the action and gameplay is what puts the cherry on the pudding.  I'd give this 8.5/10 and really recdopmend it/
5885,"A story about my uncle is a good game, but I don't realy know why. The momentem based first person platfoming is fine but nog as good or precise as in mirrors edge, the story is quite absurd and doesn't have any real intresting twists or even an intresting plot. The game has a great art style except for the frog people, they don't look too good. But there is something about the atmosphere and flow that makes it feel good. Perhaps it's the excellent voiceacting or how it is all told as a bedtime story for your daughter. It has a charm over it and allong with the satisfaction you get when finaly finishing a hard platforming part, I really enjoyed my time with it."
5886,great story
5887,"Unique intro, good gameplay, also good story
although it's too short"
5888,Yes 3 hours spentendeded. Veri nais.
5889,Short but fun to play
5890,"It's an amazing game (if it has a discount), but for ‚Ç¨12,99....mhehh."
5891,An adventurous indie game with a deep and intriguing story. Beautiful environment and entertaining gameplay. Perfect for one to chill and pass time with. Thumbs up.
5892,Simplistic puzzles and not very long. Was more frustrating then difficult. If you really want to enjoy the game just watch some youtube videos.
5893,...>>
5894,"a really nice bedtime story!
definately worth to play if you like rocket boots, swinging around, puzzles and adventures with exciting scenery."
5895,"i really liked this game, it was deffnetly worth spendng about 2 hours playing this game, i had some trouble knowing where to go at some times but it was still good. i felt like for the price there should have been more content but i also feel theres only so much of this game you can go through in one session and the story wouldnt have been as good if it was longer.
if you have the money to buy the game and you feel like you wont miss that money then definetly buy it but if you can only buy one game buy something else, the story is really good and the gameplay is also good but its not really worth the price if you only do one playthrough, im glad i got it while it was free because otherwise i would not have been able to experience this"
5896,"its a fantastic game i love the story but its a bit too short they need to do a second part or a DLC.

Love that game."
5897,"Steam'de zamanƒ±nda √ºcretsiz olarak √∂ne s√ºr√ºld√º zengin bir hikayesi olmakta oyun gayet baƒülayƒ±cƒ±. Ben ≈üahsi d√º≈ü√ºncelerim adƒ±na oynamanƒ±zƒ± √∂neririm.

5898,"hella good but a lil short...
i really enjoyed it. 
:)"
5899,"I thought the idea of grappling onto stuff would get repetitive but it actually didn't. There was always some new challenge to get used to to spice up the adventure. There were times where you wouldn't know where to go next, so you'd be jumping up and down trying to figure out what platform ou're supposed to jump onto (some kind of audio queue would be nice). The narration was very good. You wern't left alone for too long, and it wasn't interupting any gameplay. The game was short. (My playtime is how long it took me to get to the finish.) So if you're into speed running I imagine this would be a good game to play.

On the second hand... what were those aliens dude. They looked like they had all done drugs and broke their hands, feet, and heads. Like I get that kind of animation is difficult, but now I have nightmares with those things in it.

Overall, I don't think I would pay for this game. Just doesn't seem worth it to me. I got it during their free giveaway thing and if you can get it for free, do it! It's an entertaining 2 hours! Not intertaining enough for money though."
5900,I completed this game in one sitting and honestly it was the best experience I had in a long time.
5901,"Pro's:
- Enjoyable game mechanics
- Well designed surroundings
- Decent voice acting
- Interesting story perspective (Bedtime story)
- Small collectibles reward exploring

Con's:
- Short playtime (Main Story took me <2 Hrs)
- Limiting level design (Not a lot of paths, rather restricted)
- Bit overpriced for it's length

Conclusion: Fun little game for a relaxed afternoon. However, due to it's length I'd recommend buying on sale UNLESS you want to support the small studio that made this game (9 people)

Rating: 3/5"
5902,"Even though i got this game for free, i tried it coz i was done with my life....jokes 
it was really good on how uncle fred guide me along the path and this uncle knew that I(the char) was a curious child.
put an adventure on him, to follow what his been through. That was cool 
i can really feel that i am him while going though those difficult paths, .... close to finising this foking ice cave....

Definitely worth to buy even though i didnt buy it hahaha."
5903,"Got it free, would be worth if I had paid"
5904,"It so beautiful!
"
5905,"
At first, I thought it was some kind of stupidity. Then for playing the game for an hour and seeing beauty. I've played the whole game and I'm not very easy to tell you. I really like all the praise!"
5906,Great Game! Amazing storyline & Gameplay but the game is kinda short only takes 2 hours-ish to complete and no free play mode after but otherwise its really fun.
5907,A lovely little game. Took a few hours away on a saturday morning.   Had I payed ¬£10 I may have been left wanting a little more though.  If they released a DLC would I buy it? Oh yes. Only I would hope that content stretchs to more than 3- 4 hours max. Great potential for a full game in the future or if they expand on the story/ contet more.
5908,I didn't buy this game i got it humble bundle for limited time though i still wanted this game. Alright so my problem is this is 2 hours short. 2 The grappling when u grapple on to somewhere there is a chance that u will get launched. I don't recommend this game. My rating 3.5/10. Dissapointment.
5909,"A fun way to spend a few hours. Really fun mechanics, and a nice little story in a good looking world."
5910,Ridiculous difficulty spikes.
5911,Wow
5912,"Aweseome. Great storytelling, nice puzzles, well done!"
5913,Quick little first-person movement-based platformer intertwined with a nice story. Thanks HumbleBundle.
5914,This is a game really worth your time.
5915,Finished it in 2 days. Great storyline. Great environment. Hoping they'll make more games like this in the furure!
5916,"It's awesome! I felt like Spider man when i played it.
You should buy it or download it."
5917,Awesome story and awesome gameplay 10/10!
5918,"I do have a few criticisms of this game, like the fact that you have no air control after performing a long jump but overall, I think this game is really good. The controls are, for the most part, reliable and the graphics seem well optimised."
5919,It's a fun game! There's a short but beautiful story. If you are looking for a short game I highly recommend this one.
5920,can be short
5921,Boring asf
5922,Really good game better than triple a titles
5923,this game dosnt have Map ? :)
5924,"fuck graphics and story,just parkour"
5925,Very good game and interesting story
5926,"would recommend if your into adventure games.
but not if your afraid of the dark."
5927,"I knew this would be a simple game but man did I feel empty after finishing this. I thought, maybe the story will get more interesting or the puzzles will get more fun. Nope. Grappling is mostly annoying and that's the main thing you will do in this game.

I couldn't connect with the characters and the entire ending area was the most dull. I just don't like the feeling of this game. At least it was free but I kind wish I didn't get it for free because I wouldn't have wasted my time playing it then. Oh, well. At least most people enjoy it."
5928,"Were to start. At first I had very low expectations because of the slow opening. And as I continued to play, it got more and more interesting as time went on. Towards about half way through, I started to notice the true heart and creativity that went into this game. This game is short and sweet, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in gameplay. This is an extremely fun fast paced platformer that I can not recommed enough. And it managed to keep me wanting to come back to play more even though i have completed the game."
5929,It is a very short game took me 2 hours and that is also taking breaks while leaving the game open. However the game mechanics are really cool and fun.
5930,"Though I got it for free, and didn't buy it like everybody else, it has stunning visuals and complex levels, I'd love it more if it was a longer game."
5931,"This is one of those games that is short, but has so much to offer.

By FAR the visuals are my favorite part, I was completely blown away with how incredibly beautiful this game is. This world feels so incredibly tranquil, breathtaking, and unforgiving at the same time.

Interesting plot, eye candy EVERYWHERE, and platforming is an absolute treat.
I highly recommend this game."
5932,10 seconds in and I see a map of the earth with no New Zealand on it. Glad I didnt pay for this......
5933,This game is awesome.
5934,"Good gameplay, beautiful graphics. The storyline is great, and fits well into the gameplay. The game feels complete, and the controls are simple. There are not very many bugs that I can find, but I found that if you grapple underneath an island and hit the ceiling in just the right way, you will get stuck. The only way out is to superjump, which will launch you extremely high up and out of the rendered world."
5935,"it's a nice game, very good graphics and story, nice to play and perfect in length."
5936,Good platformer
5937,"It truly is a story about your uncle so 10/10 on that front.
I'll at a bias that I'm not very good at platformers and this was no excpetion, some of the parts frustrated me but when I pulled them off it gave me a sense of accomplishment.
The story isn't much to write home about and you probably won't think much of it given it's around 2-3hrs long if you are medium to low skill.
Graphics and audio are pretty decent excpet character models but those aren't the focus of the game so I won't fault them.
I recieved the product from humble bundle and given the length I feel anything more than 5 USD is probably a waste, wait for a sale if you're considering the game."
5938,"Great story, 10/10 Gameplay, great idea, good graphics. Overall, a well rounded game for everyone."
5939,this game was free about a week ago on steam and i wasnt going to pass up the oppurtunity i havent finished this game yet im not sure how long it is but it is quite fun and interesting i will update this review once i have played it but it seems like a solid game although if you are paying full price i think you could be dissapointed but if it goes on sale for cheap (idk if it does)  or is free again i would recomend it based on my (limited) current playthrough of the game but dont be expecting too much out of it as it is just a small indie  title that is a fun playthrough if you have a few hours to burn
5940,"Picked this up like a lot of others did with the free bundle.
Some points
1) Plenty of people who picked this game up didn't really give it that much of a chance. It's a fun grappling game thingy and the story is relatively deep if you put in the effort and repeat playthroughs/ speedruns the game hopes you will.
Literally one of the pieces of dialogue is like: ""Hey, remember that ancient language that your support character translated for you? Turns out it's alphabet is literally a one to one translation into English* (and I presume whatever other language you might play in)"" and your character goes: ""Damnn. If only I could remember the translation from earlier. If only I had some sort of ability to redo the past or remember events exactly as they happened. But ah well... Guess it's just lost forever!""
Hopefully at this point the player will realize: ""Hey since this is in fact: 'A Videogame' Why don't I pop back to that section with the translation and see if the game has something deeper going on here?
AND TADA. IT MAKES THE (perfectly fine ending imho) REALLY GOOD!
2) I personally enjoyed the physics and controls and had no issues.
3) as you can probably guess. I was too lazy to actually go back. so I just looked it up. Literally one trip to the game's guide section and someone has already posted a guide. But I did finish the game before going looking.
4) So all in all I have to reccomend. If you are only getting a ""parkour platformer"" for a single playthrough in order to get to the end of the story (this applies to mirror's edge as well) then imho you're kinda playing it wrong anyway. The game is built around multiple playthroughs and challenge runs but is fine if you're an absolute cretin who only plays it once (like me).
9.3/10 I just don't have time to invest deeply because of the six million other games in my backlog."
5941,Would happily pay $60 to play. My only regret is that you can only play it for the first time once. 10/10 would ride this emotional rollercoaster again.
5942,"Too hard, could not complete it cuz of the difficulty. I am glad i did not have to pay for it. Get it if u like rage games. Nothing for me."
5943,"very short game, its very good but i only recommend you guys to buy it when it has a good discount"
5944,"Really nice game with a really nice story. Good gameplay too.

Got it for free and if you didnt then its still worth to buy  it anyway. Support these devs."
5945,"I received this product for free and half an hour into it, wasn't pleased with it unfortunetly. All you do is swing like some Spider Man places to places and listen to the story. Not much interactions... Also talking about the other characters you'll meet, my... They look so out of place. Couldn't stop laughing how they looked so odd, graphics look fine but the character I've met were hideous. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for it, looking at it right now it cost's ¬£9.99... Not worth it and would not recommend it really..."
5946,meh
5947,"Great game with great story. Not too hard and not too easy. The zones are beautiful and unique. It's not a long game but definitely an enjoyable experience.

8/10"
5948,I really enjoyed this game. :) I'd love to see more games like this.
5949,Dear God! Has Man gone crazy with their head this game isnt real i refuse to believe this has happened! I Am Triumphant For getting this game for free!
5950,One of my favourite games! Cannot reccomend enough! brilliant story and great voice overs
5951,"i really wonder why it is only 2gb..graphic's rly good and game's pretty long,it's taking me pretty much to end it."
5952,"i can count on my fingers how many SP games i have finished and i am proud to say this is one of them!! story : 11/10
"
5953,"Pros:
-Simple game to pick up and play
-Can easily do small sesions with it that doesn't have a lot of time commitment
-Focuses on a single gameplay aspect (platforming)

Cons:
-Game picks up too slowly
-Proper story telling isn't used (structurally not presentation)
-Parts of it become a walking simulator to tell story (especially during the beginning)
-Game doesn't have a proper attention grabber in the intro
-Enemy design leaves much to be desired (why have them if it doesn't add anything to the gameplay)
-Large hand in corner of the screen that obstructs more than it should (It is a good idea for a hud but a hand shouldn't be perma in the corner of the screen)
-English voice acting is terrible with no emotion behind a lot of performances.

Overall:
You should get the game if you enjoy platformers and don't mind the game lacking in everything else, but for me I cannot recommend it. The hand in the corner reminds me too much of the horrible theif game. The English voice acting really ruins the experience of the story on top of it being structually bad."
5954,"Adventurous, breathtaking, grand and just plain hella fun. That's how I would describe this epic story. Without spoiling too much, you're thrown into a crazy, immersive fantasy world in a wild chase for your uncle. This world has more secrets than you could ever imagine. If you like crazy parkour and climbing mechanics it's definitely a must have!"
5955,"This game is awesome, its emotional, i think everybody should play it, i wounder what happend to Fred and Maddie
on a scale 1 to 10 i give 11 :D"
5956,That's what I said.
5957,"I am glad I was able to play this game. My computer is the definition of a potato and yet the game still ran well. While short, the story was quite interesting and well done. The movement is incredibly fun. There were some issues with the grapple connecting, but some of that is due to my coumputer. If you have an empty afternoon, it is a good game to play through and I am excited to see what these developers come out with next."
5958,brilliant
5959,"Amazing, fun  and enthralling. a perfect little game in my opinion"
5960,"Up-most perfect, an excellent game and it was great from start to finish! To bad it was so short, but nontheless one of the best if not the best game of this kind i have ever played. Also miss you Mad Maddie <3"
5961,"NEVER BEEN SO FRUSTRATED
The story is short and bad, and the mechanics are unreliable
Stay away from it 1/5"
5962,a great little game
5963,"I don't normally do reviews on games but this one is a special case. It popped up in my Steam News as a free title. It looked nice so I decided to give it a go. Can't go wrong with free, most of the time. 

This game takes about three hours to complete, delivers some of the best storytelling I have experienced in many many years and at the same time it delivers some good platforming without being too difficult. 

Kudos to the team that made this game a reality and to those who have yet to enjoy this story I say this: 

What are you waiting for?"
5964,"One of the best games i have played. Even if its small, its keeps you involved the entire time. But it gets frustrating sometimes while you have to repeat the same things again and again to clear an area. But the story is awsome and the ability of this game to invoke your emotions is fabulous. I played this game as I got this for free. But I think its worth spend some of your money on this even if the game ends within 3-4 hours."
5965,"I never told my mother about that day. I don't think she would have believed me. Can I believe it, after all these years? Uncle Fred, thanks to you, I have found an even greater adventure. Thank you."
5966,"This was a wonderfull story telling game with jumping puzzles to interspace to narration. There were some difficult moments so if your not into parkour esc puzzles then this probably isnt for you, but if you dont mind flying gracfully throw the air swinging your self  from flying rocks its a great few hourse of play. would recomend"
5967,"Ever feel sad after finishing a game? Because I am, right now. I like it because it has a short meaningful story, but I'm also sad becaaaaaaause it has a short meaningful story. Damn lucky to get it for free. <3"
5968,Nice game over all. I loved to play it the first time and the second as a speed run against a friend was great too. Recomandation for all who loves games just to play in not so long secions.
5969,This game is so damn cool
5970,Awesome.
5971,Movement is great. The story is very short. Only about 2 - 3 hours long. The graphics aren't amazing but they have their own feel to it and the story will leave you with the feels.
5972,"When the credits started rolling I thought to myself: well, the level design was great but the story was kind of mediocre.
And then, although I didn't plan to, but it happened that I waited until the last line and found myself playing the bonus scene and things suddenly made perfect sense and thrilled."
5973,sooo funnnnnn
5974,Enjoyable and relaxing.
5975,YOUR GRAPPLE WILL TURN OUT TO BE YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY
5976,"Good game.
Lame ending.
Bad graphics. 
"
5977,"Absolutely Phenomenal. You start the story with so many questions, then as you explore the game fills them with answers. The parkour is easy to learn, hard to master and it feels amazing to do some of the jumps. I have two problems tho. (mild spoilers) one, as you progress further, you can see the detail going into the characters start to diminish. two, THE FUCKING EYE. THAT BIG EYE SNAKE IN THE CHASMS. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY RIPPED IT FROM UNITY OR SOME 3RD PARTY SITE AND SLAPPED IT IN THE GAME. THE LIGHTING IS OFF AND THE SOUNDS ARE UNDERWHELMING. ok im done"
5978,"Great game. I loved the story. Simple but very enjoyable. Its possible to get lost sometimes, but the checkpoints always point you in the right direction. Not really a problem. The price may be a little high since its not very long. Definitely worth grabbing during a sale."
5979,worth two hours of your time
5980,"I got this game when they were doing a giveaway for it on steam I think on like the 14th of January or so. GREAT GAME. I would happily pay $15 for it but for free, yes!!!! Has a great story and even though the ending was kind of abrupt, it was a 10/10 game especially for how small the team was for it. Great work and would love to see more games like this. I'm now more open to smaller games, as I usually go for the more popular gory/violent games, this was a small but great break. If you are thinking about purchasing this game I say give it a try, atleast for an hour or so and return it if you're not into it."
5981,Interesting story and gameplay. 8/10 though I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it (I got it for free)
5982,This is a nice and puzzled game.
5983,"the game was ok, but it wasn't very rewarding. the story could have been interesting, but the ending was lackluster leaving me feeling ""that's it?"" the characters weren't interesting either. you're never made to care about any of them so the emotional strings they try to pull don't work. maybe if they showed flashbacks of them interacting more? meh"
5984,VERY FUCKING NICE
5985,So um.. I beat it in 95 minutes? Super fun but would no not buy for more than a few dollars.
5986,very god game with great story
5987,"really good, not worth 18 dollars though"
5988,"I really loved it , the story was interesting . Is it bad if I cried a little ?"
5989,"There's a lot about the swinging which I wish was more Bionic Comando-like and less ""press a button and go here"" but it's a lot of fun and if you can find it cheap I'd recomend it, even if a few later levels feel more frustrating than they should be."
5990,"I love the grappler it's a really satisfying game mechanic!
It's a shame there's no Steam Workshop for this game because 
I would love to create and play some custom maps"
5991,"Between the breathtaking atmosphere, the interesting technology, and the sense of purpose the game provides you, A Story About My Uncle is, in my opinion, the best way to spend an afternoon."
5992,beans
5993,A nice story and the game runs smoothly .
5994,Really nice game! would reccomend
5995,Amazing story 10/10
5996,awesome game. got it for free.
5997,"Crabed this on the timed free ""giveaway"" and gived it a try because i saw some gameplay of it few years back and i had to say, it was a wonderful experience.

The beatiful details of the vast enviorment you see in this game and the interesting story with a suprise at the end wich took me by suprise actually and the platforming feels unique with the suit and the grappling powers and the boots you get o about 50% mark, If you're investing hours on this game (like me) you can play through this in couple hours (without brakes or anything) i was suprised i was at the end already when i game back after playing almost all night and now finishing it felt weird. Because i expected lot more and didn't realise how long i have been playing and i mean this game can suck you in if you're determinted enough


if you wanna give it a shot GO AHEAD! you can refund if it's not your cup of tea (rememeber to refund it before 2 hour tie limit)"
5998,"I would say I recommend it because I don't hate it. It's just not got much for me in it. 

It's an OK game. I liked the traversing aspect of it but it's very bland on the gameplay front. It's supposed to be a narrative driven platformer but I found the voice acting ruined it from me from the start. The character that sits on your back called 'Madeline' has one of those voices that you can hear every mouth noise whenever she talks as if when recording the lines, she had a dry mouth. Everytime she spoke I shuddered. 

I got about 4 areas in (about an hour and a half) and the graphics were very good. As said before, the traversing was fun enough for it to make me want to retry failed jumps over and over again but honestly, the voice acting is where I had to draw the line. 

I found that when I finished an area, it would just fade to black and then load me into a new area with no narrative, or indication that I had progressed which made the game feel empty to me. There are no enemies or combat, and it seems that the one trick that made the game playable to me wore thin. 

Gameplay: 2/5 - The traversing was good at first but became boring when you realise that this is all the game is.)

Graphics: 3/5 - Yeah, it's ok for what the game needed. Not groundbreaking in anyway but not bad. Reminded me of Quake with the jumping aspect. No fancy bloom effects or realism. Always has a white mist over the screen in dark areas where turning the gamma down to 1 just made it too dark with the same mist)

Sound: 2/5 - The sound of the adventure suits jump and grapple features get old really quickly. The voice acting is terrible. The sound of you landing is ok. There isn't really much more sound in the game. No soundtrack that I remember or background music...just emptiness.

Story: 2.5/5 - It's a story that a father is telling her daughter about their uncle. Not very convincingly I might add. 

Polish: 2/5  - Not dreadful. Not great. I've found no bugs and I haven't seen any game breaking glitches yet. It looks like an empty Mod for quake or unreal tournament 2003. Lots of flourescent plants. 

Overall: 2.5/5 - Good to kill an hour on or for the cards but don't expect a AAA title here. 
Thanks for reading."

6001,"Its so cool, its a cool game, i really liked it
2 Questions . 
1. Its going to be a second part?
1.2 If that is affirmative, It would be a continuacion ?
2. Why is so cool this game ?
So insteresting"
6002,its a pretty good game so far its something diffrent
6003,"Absolutely amazing, the scenery is gorgeous, the physics are smooth and the narration is Morgan Freeman tier. I got it whilst it was free and what a steal! The only negetive I have for this game is the ending, the build up is great but the ending wasn't much at first glance. However, when I started thinking about it, it seems understandable and gave me a sense of succession.

But that's just my opinion."
6004,"A really good game that I just can recommend. It's like an jump and run game with a hook you swing through the different sceneries and monuments.

Story 7/10
Map 9/10
Textures 9/10
Character animations and textures 4/10"
6005,"Beautiful Stories, Beautiful Soundtrack, Beautiful Sceneries , and of course Beautiful Game :'D 10/10"
6006,"Good game, but the goulart does not know how to play"
6007,Execellent game for a chill day. But some platfroming levels are a tad bit fustrating but eventually you'll get there.
6008,pretty good job so far.
6009,"This was a kinda good game.

It has a nice story, runs great, and a somewhat new-ish gameplay.

But it was hell of a wonky and hard sometimes, so it took me about twice the time to complete. Which is why I in the end do NOT recommend this game - only for free maybe. I got it free.

The game would take about 2 hours to finish if not so lame player goes through like me.
There could have been a ton more in it, but I guess that wasn't the point of this project anyway.

Overall: a lot of missed opportunity and very short. Still, a fun little game for free."

‚ûñ The game fails to explain where you are, what's the logic of that world, what's the lore, what can we expect. But, due to it's short nature, this can be overlooked.

CONTROVERSIAL OPINIONS CHECK
[/h1]

üì¢ The game is so short that it can be finished in 2 hrs ‚ûú False (imo)
[code]I think it took me 3-4 hrs at a regular pace. I don't see the point in speed running games on the first run. I was playing it for the fun & story.[/code]

EXTRA THOUGHTS
[/h1]

üîô If you don't feel like watching a movie in a boring day and previously enjoyed watching warm ""Pixar""-like animations, I think that you will find this to be a good title as well.
üîô I really want to see more games with this much creativity.

6011,"Great game design and story line (too short). Sometimes grappling movement gets annoying.
The only feature this game is missing is co-op.
Overall I'd rate this game : 8/10
Not worth buying at full price. 
Buy during sale or greater than 50% off."
6012,Warm story I did not expect. The atmosphere of the game is calm and relaxing. The voice over is remarkable. Worth the time. loved every minute of it.
6013,"Recommended it is good and challenging, it is worth my time cause it is free."
6014,nice game .
6015,great game
6016,"very detailed, very fun, epic surroundings. definent buy. Kirby approves."
6017,"I like it.

Plus a breath off of shooting aliens :)"
6018,"I came here to play, not to feel"
6019,"What pleasantly surprised me is that A Story About My Uncle doesn't focus exclusively on the story itself, but puts great emphasis on the simple yet engrossing narrative. This results in a high sense of immersion which becomes apparent only at the very end of the narration. A Story About My Uncle is certainly a non-violent interactive story videogame that pushes the genre one step forward, through its platforming mechanics. For anyone who thought Dear Esther as a surprising alternative to conventional gaming, A Story About My Uncle will certainly not disappoint."

[h1]Personal Opinion:[/h1]
I am [i]so[/i] happy I finally got around to playing this game. I've had it for quite a while and meant to play it, but never had the time. I new this was a story from the start, so I wanted to play the whole game in one session, and I'm glad I did. The experience comes together a lot more when you don't take breaks in between story elements. Overall I think this game is a fantastic experence. The graphics, the story, the characters, the mechanics. Every key element of this game was presented in a comfortable way to the player, and was executed very well. Everything comes across how it is meant to, and that can't be said for a lot of games, especially in this price range. I think anyone who enjoys a good story should play this game. I was compelled by the story from the very beginning. The characters were convincing, the plot was interesting, and the soundtrack brought it all together. I am a big fan of 3D platformers, and this is one of the best I've played. This is a go to favorite for anyone looking for a good mix of mechanics and story.

[h1]9/10[/h1]"
6021,It was fun to swing around and stuff but it was quite annoying at times and almost boring.
6022,beautiful game...
6023,It is a very fun game!
6024,A very relaxing platformer. I very much enjoyed it.
6025,"I enjoyed this game 

[h1]Thumbs Up![/h1]"
6026,"This game is a nice little adventure. From the soundtrack to the scenery, overall it was a pretty enjoyable experience. It had a nice story, I also enjoyed the bits where the narration would kick in. The controls and gameplay weren't too difficult, 10/10"
6027,"Great aventurous game. Highly reccomend this. Got it for free :)
-Easy to play
-Requires time
-Heartwarming
-Aventurous
-Action
-All ages
-Color/beautiful world of graphics"
6028,"great game ,good background story"
6029,"Fun gameplay, beautiful settings, good story.  This was a nice, quick game to kill a few hours."
6030,leafywashere
6031,"Frustrating at times cause you will constantly fall till you learn the flow, but this game is amazing. Beautiful story. ""Warning"" If you're afraid of heights you might experience vertigo. Other than those 2 things, it's a must buy. Enjoyed it very much."
6032,a real touching story.
6033,"Awesome game. Didn't have much expectations when I installed this game, but I was absolutely blown away by the quality of it.

From the story to the visuals to the physics and mechanics of the game, everything felt so smooth and polished. Nothing too elaborate about the game and I think that's what made it so enjoyable; it was a nice change of pace from modern games.

Definitely a game I would recommend everyone to give a shot to and would probably play this again just to experience it again."
6034,"This game is very good, the story is intreauging and fun, and the platforming is difficult, but not tedius. The music makes the atmosphere come alive, Honestly the only bad thing about this game is I had to play it windowed in 4k. Definately buy.
This is a geme that you can explore, and you don't always have to stay on the designated path.

Ps the story writers and the timing is pro, first thing i did is stand on a panel, 1 sec later it explains it is for dumping trash, so I got off, until I had to."
6035,"Great game with a great story, great atmosphere and great gameplay will definitely reccomend this to the Mystery Diners Crew, But first I must release the drones.
"
6036,very good game.
6037,"Good game, but kind of sad"
6038,"The game is really short (2.5 hours), but I enjoyed every minutes of it.
It has an incredible atmosphere,
good sounds,
good story,
and great controls."
6039,actually really enjoyable. slow at times but good payoff and enjoyable
6040,The gaem play was fun alothough a bit iratating at parts. I enjoyed the story and the enviroment and the voice acting was pretty good. I got this game for free but i would buy it if i hadent.  9/10
6041,"After completing the game I felt like I had to write some kind of review. I've had very nice moments going through this piece of beauty. But also some frustrating moments. Sometimes it's been counter-intuitive and sometimes it's been too easy. A mix of everything. If you're going to play it, just use the common sense - the path to follow is never overcomplicated. Oh, by the way, I completed almost everything in 3h. 
TLDR; beautiful, emotive, well ambiented, nice voices, but not-so-polished gameplay. I'd give it 3.5/5."
6042,that's wow... :/
6043,nice little atmospheric platformer
6044,"Its got poor graphics. It's a tiny bit buggy here and there. But screw that! ITS FUN! The controls are tight and feel great, its story is short but relatively deep, and the damn thing is just so lovely."
6045,Fun but short platformer game
6046,"The story is a bit sparse and shallow, but the gameplay is good fun.
The first playthrough is fairly short and not too challenging. It would be nice if there were more variety of puzzles or more possible solutions to the ones that are there."
6047,fuck maddie and her bullshit challenge
6048,"Decent platformer, and the grappling mechanics make for fun gameplay. But once you finish the game and really reflect on the story is when it really shines."
6049,"A Story About My Uncle is honestly stunning...
The story is great and it gets a 10/10 from me.
Its not rage inducing. instead of you getting mad when you die. you find a new solution to progress. 
"
6050,Thank you humble bundle :)
6051,"By ignoring some elements, the game is very similar to Celeste. But in first person. Overall I loved it, very good storytelling, great soundtrack and a mostly calm experience."
6052,"I don't usually write reviews, but I got the game for free, so I thought I should. It is pretty good. Reminds me of quantum conundrum, but with better platforming."
6053,I got this game and tried playing it a little and lost interest fast. A little later on down the line I didn't have internet and decided to give it another shot and I'm very glad I did. The story is awesome and the ending is cool!
6054,It's pretty fun. keep this on the backburner for when a sale rolls around
6055,very good
6056,"I think most people recieved the game for free, while it's an enjoyable game and deserves a thumbs up because it is an enjoyable game, but if I paid 9.99 for this I'd be very dissapointed.

"
6057,great game
6058,"Step 1 : Download
Step 2 : Play
Step 3 : Enjoy The game :D"
6059,"Love this game, 3-4 hours of chilled gameply, great music, beautiful story, i would recomend to anyone who is looking for somthing difrent. Im sad it is over"
6060,"This single player game comes with nice puzzles, charming characters and wonderful atmosphere. But I loved playing it for two reasons: One is a solid movement mechanics that is fun just to zip around. The other is the fantastic voice acting - I could have listened to father and daughter all day."
6061,"A fun little first-person platform, story-oriented game. Takes a few hours to complete. Honestly, time flew by as I played it. It was a really exciting and thrilling adventure at some points. Good for time killing. It's a 1-time play but it totally worths it. And the story is pretty good. The extras, collectibles, achievements and challenges are pretty challenging."
6062,11/10 Would grapple onto a ledge and fall to my death again
6063,"a very naice game
"
6064,"Great game. It's short, but the story is good and the gameplay is solid. If you can get over the fact that LeafyIsHere played it, then 100% get it. Bismarck approves."
6065,"The game has very unpleasant control and movement system. For one, there is no sense of distance here, the rocks can appear very close, when in fact they are kilometers away. The grappling is unintuitive and feels broken, you often find yourself in a situation where you're sure the rock is close and you can reach it, but no, you can't and you just fall to the abyss. Also you aren't really swinging, when you grasp a rock with the grapple, you are actually closing very fast to it horizontally, without the actual physics swing. Jumps are annoying, especially the long jump. Also I found myself often loading straight up jump and then pressing space (a habit from all other games) which cancelled the power jump and I again was falling into the abyss. Sometimes the levels look pretty but the sense of scale feels disturbed, and again, there is no sense of distance, no sense of speed because of no sense of scale and distance, and all those factors distort your sense of orientation in the end. I understand this is an indie game, but I am glad I didn't have to pay for it, because I would be mad. I wish the studio all the best because the idea was fine, and I hope they learned a lot during the development and will make better games in the future. Not recommended."
6066,It's a nice game to play when you want to calm down after playing a fps game or something of the sort.
6067,"Stumbled up on it for free on a ""download now, keep for ever"" kind of deal here on steam. So had nothing better to do than to download it.

It's around 2.5-3 hours to play through casualy. The graphics is a bit dated. Story is okay, but feels a bit forced. The game do not evolve much, but since it's a short game it has not enought time to get tedious, but I whould not play it again.

The price right now is about the same as going to the movies. Don't think I whould pay that so will not recommend it."
6068,its too short
6069,Really fun and unique game.
6070,very nice 10/10
6071,very nice yes
6072,I like the gameplay the graphic content of this game and more.
6073,"It's not often that I write reviews for games on Steam. But this game... This game deserves it. 

I spent a total of about 2 hours in it. Those 2 hours were fun, exhilirating and mindboggling. The fact that these guys have made a game based on a grapplehook and rocketboots, and made it into a puzzlegame? Simply amazing. 

The story, even though it is short, is such a sweet little homage to the adventures of youth, it strikes home with the feeling every kid had when they went to do a sleepover at their grandparents or some other family. 

I got this game from Steam for free, but I actually wish I could pay these games to make more great games, I solidly recommend this game!"
6074,"Amazing story, 2hr play, platforming"
6075,"graphics aren't bad
immersion is very cool.
storyline is meh. 
a lot of grappling just to find your uncle who promptly dismisses you. wish could've stayed to linger in villages and hang with FrogGirl."
6076,"A great game in it's genre, the mix between the gameplay and the rich story is cool."
6077,"7/10 gameplay 
3/10 story 
overall: i recommend this game for ppl who like to experience tarzan in a cave
"
6078,"Well this is just a beautifull non-violent game that helps relax and think.It's parkour assets and the whole gameplay is smooth in potato PC's too.It's low price also helps.
It is just a great game."
6079,igrica je za kurac
6080,You can jump and you can run. So it's a Jump and Run game.
6081,Fantastic story to be told here! It was so entertaining. The gameplay was very enjoyable also. thanks goes to the team who put this together so i can enjoy it! <3

6087,PLAY. THIS. GAME. NOW.
6088,Amazing
6089,really a good game
6090,"This game is full of bugs,graphics is shit,story is boring and not so interesting.This game is only for rage so it's stupid as fuck.
Textures on high are shit and some are just textures not platform that you can stand on it.It's not so open and you just need to follow story you can't travel where you want.And grapple gun is sometimes broken so you just fail mission beacuse grapple gun is broken.This game is not worth of buying for 13$ it's more like 3$ for this game if you are looking for good graphics,good story and good adventure."
6091,"Nice game, definitly fits to even anyone who don't like violent games so if I ever happend to have child(s) of my own I could easily let them play this game. 13 bucks might be too much for this game, I'd say 5-6 bucks would be more fitting prize tag to this game."
6092,fun
6093,"A very cool game , the sad thing is the short story for the price. i got it for free and i actually enjoyed it . If anyone is thinking about getting the game think that is a story for about 3 hours but the game is really cool. 
 Recommned 10/10"
6094,Good game but it was too short and the storyline wasn't that good. Great way to test your platformer skills though!
6095,Excellent and loveable story... it¬¥s worth going through the game. 10/10
6096,For a platform game this is a really great game and story 8/10.
6097,Don't recommend.

6104,"Fun little thing. Nice motion-puzzles, even if the whole thing was a tad on the short side of things. Got it for so i cannot tell you whether it's worth ""the money"" or not, but it was an engaging two hours for sure."
6105,I would say this game was something else. this needs to be the level of adventure other games should aspire to match or better. first single player game in years that has been an amazing game from start to finish. although i would love to see maybe a second game with more gadgets and whatnot. Im always looking for good adventure games and this one just set the bar high.
6106,An amazing game with beautiful graphics and story 9/10 definately worth it for a 3 hour story
6107,"seems nice enough, dont know about 13 euro... might wanna wait for a sale or smthing"
6108,"This game is very interesting. It's nice to play if you just want to relax but i found the game a bit slow and boring. The storyline is somewhat interesting but as i said it goes to slow, in my opinion :)"
6109,"sooo hard parkour made me rage but if you like to rage i sugest this game and it has great grafics.
it is ealy fun and ive playd for about 2 hours and im sill not done with the game so realyfun,long, and hard. 


                                                                                   :D <3"
6110,"one of the worst games i've ever played
even though i add it free it doesn't worth the time!"
6111,"Wow, this is quite the hidden gem!
Pretty short, but developed with exquisite care and love!

Absolutely recommended, even if the game can be beaten in less than 3 hours.
The length is it's only downside really."
6112,"What a great little game. Got it for free but it would be worth paying for. Voice acting is good, graphics are very reasonable, audio is great, music is nice, story is cute, game performance is exactly what is required. all in all a polished game. Kids and adults will love this game and be challenged by the coordination required. heights heights heights..."
6113,"As someone who loves story games, And movement games, I personally love it. If your doing it slow, It should take you round about 2 1/2 - 3 hours to complete the story. Overall great game 
 
[b] ------------------------SPOILER------------------------ [/b]
[spoiler] The final cutscene is a bit buggy at times, nothing major but it does kind ruin the immersion, like the photo he picks up is delayed for about 2 secs so it looks glitchy af but other than that, i never had any problems. [/spoiler]"
6114,More than a bed time story despite the storyline of the game.. Fun to play nice story tottaly worth to play.. 8/10 for a singleplay game..
6115,"This game is great.
The core of the gameplay involves grappling around with this energy beam, which is a lot of fun.
I was surprised by the story.
I found myself involved with it more than I expected, and it really pulls on th ol' heartstrings.
Took me just 4 hours to finish.
Well worth it.
4 hours of quality time I have no regrets spending and would do it again if I'd bought it.

6118,"Kinda fun, but pretty short."
6119,"We need chinese!!!!!!
Thanks."
6120,"Beautiful Game, Great Story. I'd play it another time."
6121,"Great atmosphere, interesting story and ending, likeable characters.

The controls are clunky at times, but the game is short and sweet and I can easily recommend it."
6122,Best Adventurous game i've ever played
6123,"good gameplay, nice grafic, easy to play."
6124,This is the best game with a perfectly short storylines. Hoping a second part when the Nephew see his Uncle when he grew up :>
6125,personally i belive this game is great i think that the story is alittle strange but still interesting it looks great an almost cartooney real world vibe i belive its worth the money and its a fun little game while playing you feel floaty and have a decent amount of control of what happens
6126,"I got this from the free giveaway, but I would've paid money for this! A fun, cute, and exciting platformer."
6127,"Got this game during a giveaway, so I can't complain about much, but I really do wish it was longer,though,since it was really fun."
6128,"I spent three hours... THREE HOURS... spending my time trying to defeat a level without grappling because my partner told me that I ""couldn't do it."" I would have NEVER done such a thing if I would have known that the peak of happiness from doing such a task would be a sad and depressing, ""good job""...... I despise this game and my life as well. Good bye. Do not spend money. I am upset and I got this heap of trash for free."
6129,"This game is awesome and would be fun for all but I'd specifically recommend it to fans of parkour, adventure and people which like to use their brains a little bit more than usual in video games.

Awesome game."
6130,Cool game with challenging but achievable levels and great atmosphere
6131,"Good game, takes about 4 hours, glad it was free."
6132,"This game is sooooooo awesome!! At first I thought it doesn't have that much of awesome graphics but with every minute of the story, I felt warmth of the story! This is where graphic does not matter even though the graphics of this game is good but not awesome!  At the end of the game I literally cried and couldn't control my tears  üò≠ 
I recommend it everyone who's looking for an awesome story which will never be forgotten and specially for the people with mind discord! It looks like just the story of a chaotic mind's dreams!"
6133,"finished in 2 hrs, played the ice cavern again just bc it was such fun. dont play platformers but got it for free and it was awesome.

i like R6/OW/ witcher/ Mass effect/ divinity/ resident evil series etcetc. but still enjoyed this and going to listen to the OST on yt for awhile after."
6134,"Thanks humble bundle for this nice 2-4 hour game. I definitely recommend it. Only beat story mode, and it was time well spent.

[Spoiler] If you observe the sticky notes in the Uncles house there are 2 youtube video links on the post-it notes. So I typed them in, and found some weird things.
Here is the 1st one: https://youtu.be/B1laJSZoTHo
Here is the 2nd one: https://youtu.be/EU2AIxkxiwg?t=437 [/Spoiler]
"
6135,Short one but nice one. Good game.
6136,"Overall a great play.  I liked the physics and mechanic involved even if I did sometimes finding myself hitting the item im grappling from.  

With more maps I could see this having much better replay value as it was fun just getting up there and seeing what the suit is capable of.   If there were the ability to make user created levels it would kick the fun up quite a bit.

Story elements were good and the voiceover was a good continuation of the intiial story to keep that thread going.  

I normally dont post reviews even for the games I paid for but this one has me thinking about it even after completing it last night. 


"
6137,"This game is by far one of my favourite games I've ever played, however I would like to see either a followup or a point where fred can actually believe it exists by being ablet to go back as an adult, This game has great mechanics although a few clipping issues but overall a great game."
6138,Holy moly
6139,"A Story About My Uncle, has a long title. But it's a short good game. A little girl asks her father to tell a bedtime story and the game is as follows. Uncle Fred is an inventor spelunker kinda guy and is lost. With an adventure suit this nephew ( dad) goes off jumping, grappling and exploring the trail to find him. That's the game, you play as nephew (dad) looking for Uncle Fred. Think Portal, and puzzles and Pitfall. First person plat former style. It's challenging and the story is neat and as a parent one story I know my kids would love.  Is it just a story? No crazy action or blood and music of doom. Think casual and brain teaser. Jump were? grapple where? rocket boots?! Enjoy and yeah, the achievements are no falling and time runs. Good luck on that!"
6140,"I got this game for free and so I went in not expecting much. But in the end it turned out to be a beautiful little game. A light and interesting narrative coupled with mechanics that are easy to understand made the game enjoyable, and in some parts, challenging. For the most part, the graphics and music are extremely calming, and you can relax as you grapple and soar through the air, hopping from rock to rock. I definitely reccomend!"
6141,I really enjoyed this game it was smooth and very relaxing but also ducking your head like your about to hit something esk game. The story was short and simple but managed to still get you attached to the characters and feel for them even in the short 2 hour game. And the ending made me feel even if you dont relize what actually happened at first(which i didnt). All in all for what it is its a 9/10 game that I very much enjoyed and would recomend to anyone who wants a short and fun story game that can still make you fill emersed.
6142,"A STORY ABOUT MY UNCLE - 7/10

Basic Info
-----------
Genre(s): First Person, Platforming
Game Length: 2 - 3 hours
100%: Length: 10~ hours
Achievement Difficulty: 7/10
Missable Achievements: No

Brief Synopsis
--------------
When your daughter asks for a bedtime story about adventure you decide to tell her about your old Uncle Fred, an explorer who went missing one day when you decided to set out and search for him only to discover far more than you bargained for.

Pros/Cons
---------
+ Beautiful environments
+ Relatively good character animation
+ Fun gameplay
+ A decent story

- Can become frustrating
- Unskippable dialogue
- Not much freedom
- Poor voice acting

Details
-------
+ 3 out of the 5 areas are really beautiful to look at, especially the fourth one. While I won't spoil anything, even though the game is small some of the areas really were awe inspiring.
+ Although there are not many characters, the main side character Maddie has great animation which I found really surprising. She makes unique facial expressions and her movements are realistic. Although this should be a given in some games I felt more compelled towards Maddie because of how well she was animated even though it was very simple.
+ The main grapple mechanic is very fun although does take a while to get used too. Swinging around feels amazing and the different areas introduced give a real sense of freedom.
+ The main goal of the game is to follow your uncle Fred. You can tell where he's been so you follow along and the things you discover are very interesting.

- Because the main mechanic is platforming with what is essentially a grapple hook, there will be times where you come just shy of a platform and fall to your death. There are many frustrating obstacles where you need to use a combination of mechanics with precision. I didn't even feel comfortable with the mechanics after I beat the game and it took a bunch of speedruns to even felt like I was doing ok.
- Although the first time around this isn't an issue, if you plan to go for achievements there are multiple areas of the game where characters talk and you lose your grapple powers as well as sprinting, and these take up quite a few minutes at a time. Considering how often you're going to be retrying the whole mission for these this becomes VERY annoying.
- The game is A to B linear with little to no experimentation of your grapple. Some side obstacle courses or randomly generated levels might have been nice but as it stands you're basically just grappling onto floating rocks in a line for 90% of the game.
- The voice acting is really quite bad. It's obvious they are reading off a script and each word is stuttered, so I don't think English is the main language of any of the voice actors.

Personal Thoughts
-----------------
I liked the game but I found many parts very annoying. I never felt like I was having a major amount of fun but it didn't feel like a chore either. You get rocket boots about 3/4 of the way through the game and I think, to me, this was a totally unecesarry add-on. You're already near the end of the game and they don't really add anything, it's more just an excuse to place the platforms farther apart. The achievements are really difficult and I gave up trying to get the no death/limited grapple achievements for the final levels. They will take alot of time and practice and the levels are quite long.

Tips
----
- You need to let go of an obstacle mid-air far earlier than you think you do to have enough momentum to reach the next obstacle. This will require alot of practice.
- You also have some degree of control in mid-air while grappling so use this to skirt around the obstacle instead of flying straight into it. Grapple near the side of the object, let go before you reach it then hold left or right to have the momentum to fly forward but also be able to narrowly miss the object you grappled too."
6143,Recevieng it for free wasn't enough. You need to pay me money for playing it.
6144,Pretty good game though short.
6145,Amazing game with a amazing and heartfelt story that I enjoyed very much I hope the developers see this review and any like it and hope that we see some more content added or maybe open up a community workshop to allow the community to make some maps for like with Portal. the voice acting is ok but you really get a feel for this game and it's amazing ability of flying through the air on an energy grapple hook. I went through the entire game again once I unlocked acrobatic mode and spent long painful hours of trying to flwaless the levels but with this game it felt worth it. I may have gotten this game for free but I would definently pay the $13 dollars to play. really hope some more content for this game comes out.
6146,"I got this game for free, and to be honest i didnt expect much. I thought oh boy another free indie game to waste my time. I can confidently say after completing the game though that i would pay money for this were it to disapear from my account. I definetly recomend it, its short and sweet. What it does it does wonderfuly. They story is whole some, and there are even times in ominus gets creepy really making you feel alone. It has a wonderful ending and a great build up. For being so short the game play was really good. A uniqe platformer/puzzlie game. after you beat the gaem there is time trials too, but the game has so many paths for you to take that each time playing isnt the same. While teh story doesnt change you may end up finding a diffrent path whether it be easier or harder. all in all IGN rates 9/10 ""too much water"""
6147,"I dont make a whole lot of reviews but this one really deserved it. Stellar game. graphics arent the best and they can be choppy but the game is getting old now. but their actually pretty decent. the story is simple, but equally captivating.. the game is not very long either but the simple concept allows for decent replayability, like trying to get through the stages as fast as you can. upona second playthrough, i paid more  attention to the characters and noticed a surprising amount of depth. love this game, and even though i got it for free, i would buy it three times over just to play it for 15 minutes."
6148,"Atmosphere: 9/10,
Voice acting: 6/10,
Story: 8/10.
Pacing: 6.5/10
Sound design: 8.5/10
Graphics: looks like a charming indie game, still manages to look very pretty without 2018-looking graphics.
Amount of Maddie: not enough.

Short and sweet. Some characters look strangely stiff at times, and the voice acting, well, it does it's job, but overall the game is a really charming and enjoyable 2-3 hours, would definitely recommend if you're looking for a short, touching story."
6149,It was a very good game.
6150,"The game itself is a masterpiece. As a frequent FPS and more action based games person, this was an amazing break from all of that. The story is basic but really enjoyable to follow. The few bugs in the game are annoying, but no doubt will be dealt with swiftly. I would 100% recommend buying this game if you like story. While I obtained it for free, I would surely buy the game again."
6151,"Great game! Having a great time with it.
[spoiler] Madeline bet that I couldn't go without using the grapple, boy did I show her... she's dead now. I chose to plunge down into the cloudy abyss instead of letting her be proven right, until finally she wasn't able to hold onto to me any longer. Then I grappled to a passing rock and managed to make it out alive. Still have nightmares about that fall, but it was worth it so Maddy would learn not to make stupid bets anymore... in my world anyways...[/spoiler]"
6152,"nice Story in a short game, gameplay is ok, first person jumping puzzles, graphic and setting is very nicely done!"
6153,This game is sooo beautiful
6154,"The graphics are good for what the game is. It's a good casual game and most important it has many save points, which brings me to my next point. While trying to grapple the mechanics are sub par at best which results in a very frustrating time. you will constantly either bump into rocks and lose all your momentum, or you will come very close to landing just to slip and have to start over. For free it's alright but for 13 USD I cannot reccomend it."
6155,"Decent (but also kinda short) story and gameplay. Wouldn't have minded a quick-restart button though, to cancel out those wasted seconds of falling to your inevitable doom after you waste your grapple-hook charges or miss a floating rock or platform."
6156,I got this for free. I literally know nothing about the game and never knew it existed untill a couple days ago.
6157,"Levels are all very beautiful, very different, Avatar-esk. Lovely story, nicely told with feeling. Fun exploration style platformer gameplay. Great satisfaction achieving things that initially look absurdly ambitious. Difficulty was pretty much spot on, challenging throughout, only once or twice got briefly stuck for several attempts. The grapple hook mechanic mostly works excellently, with only the floating/falling box room proving a bit frustrating felt a bit like I was trying to do something that wasn't quite meant to be possible (maybe I was but couldn't see another way to do it). Lovely game overall. Steam says it's taken 4.7 hrs to complete, which for me is perfect.

Never would have noticed this game, being an adventure game and given its title neither makes it sound like my kind of game, but as it was free and just about reminded me of Portal (another non-shooty FPS adventure/puzzle that I would never have looked at but came free and ended up loving) gave it a go and really glad I did. Nicest game I've played in a while, and altho before trying it probably wouldn't have bought it, now that I have if I had paid for it would have been happy to have done so (weird catch-22 I know, maybe it would have needed a free demo)"
6158,"A nice game, funny and beautifull. Loved it!"
6159,Nice story and levels.
6160,Fun little game took about 2 hours to complete but very intresting and worth playing!
6161,"A Story About My Uncle is a platforming game told as a bedtime story about a guy trying to find his Uncle.  The story could be interesting but it doesn't seem to give enough to hold interest while you move in silence through long pointless platforming sections.  The atmosphere of the game seems to be lacking as the graphical representation is not bad but not good either and if there was a soundtrack or musical score it wasn't anything memorable.

The controls if played on an xbox controller don't quite feel smooth when trying to aim from section to section with the grapple device.  The game also has a jump button and a seperate ""power jump"" button that requires sections where you also hold a sprint button while also trying to aim and shoot a grapple device. It's alot of buttons for very few actions.  The end results are you smash your face into rocks constantly while trying to grapple from stone to stone.  

In my short experience with the game there was nothing other than sections of grappling to be seen.  No simple puzzles or anything different to break up the monotony that the game quickly becomes.

For all achievement hunters out there, just stay away.  The achievements are all ridiculous ""do this without falling"" kind of stuff that just adds frustration to an already frustrating experience.  The most common achievement has only been completed by 9% of players which tells you something.

I'd advise against paying for the game but don't listen to me, do what you want."
6162,"At first I thought this game was just about the parkour/platform element of it since that was all I ever saw as gameplay, but then I got into it myself it was the story I played for. This game really made me relax, sit back and enjoy a simple but amazing story. Yes, I did get this game for free on steam, but I would defenitely have paid 5 euros for it."
6163,"A fucking story about my uncle, incredible game, imersive and deep narrative, i love so much this experience, thank you <3"
6164,Its a pretty good game
6165,great quick free game!!!! loved it
6166,"I bet its good on k+m but since i bought this to play with kids and have some cartoonish chill time as we play i can say:
This game with controller is more stressfull than Nioh was. Just trial and error to aim and shoot at the right time. 
And i cant suggest a game with supposed controller support that cant make it at least a little enjoyable and not feel like i punish myself becouse i want to play on TV+coach instead of monitor+chair. Not recommended at all! Unless you love trial and error jumping simulators..."
6167,"Nice game, very short tho. Beautiful graphics and i can admit that it is one of the best games i have ever played."
6168,The game takes you on an adventure where you have to jump from one platform to the other with a wanky grapling control device. On some occassions I died like a 100 times so this game is obviously not my thing. I lost interest afterwards but if you like Tarzan movies this game might something for you.
6169,"Very much enjoyed this game. I loved how it was about exploration and not combat. While it is fun soaring through the air on the grapple, I did occasionally have trouble finding the next point to grapple, and there seemed to be some incosistencies in the distance that the grapple would connect."
6170,This game was amazing. from the story being short yet sweet to the little things that made the game alot more fun. the challenge with maddie for example. you could just do the level normally or you could take her challenge and try to not use the grapple. meeting her and the villagers then the stray was a sweet little thing to experience while searching for fred. the game also had some sad and happy moments like having to part with maddie. but knowing she will we happy and accepted with the stray. if you dont have this game id highly recomend it for the amazing experience. and if you find yourself with nothing to do after the game give the time trial a go or try redoing the levels and getting all the collectables
6171,Waste of time for me because story basically dont exist and gameplay is mediocre.
6172,Nice little puzzle platformer  :)
6173,"Neat concept ruined by bugs and inconsistencies in its core mechanics that make moving with any specificity an infuriating exercise. The writing, acting, and animation are also all not very good, which makes it harder to get into the story, and the game is surprisingly short and easy, which makes it hard to justify the price."
6174,"This game takes me back to when games were games, with simple yet amazing ideas. This has given me a feeling of pure joy and contentment. Beautiful art all around. The ending tugged on my heart strings a little too. Props to all the people behind this game. Definitely worth the playthrough. Great experience"
6175,Good platforming game
6176,Perfectly made. Great game with such an amazing story. Absolutely love it!
6177,"I left a review only on the game that, although old, has left a mark in my soul. And that game is called Half-Life, but this game... An impact that I just felt only in Half-Life. I added it to my collection when it was free on Steam. I add free games quite often, but I have not played the majority. This game seemed to me rather interesting. It took me 4 hours to finish it and I want to say that now it's my favorite story game. The game is quite simple, with unique mechanics, beautiful graphics that run on the weaker PC's too, and the story... I can say it was one of the most beautiful stories I've ever seen in a game in a long time. I recommend it with the greatest pleasure, it is very relaxing and addictive and I hope to see games like this more often but longer and with more interactions with the characters and also the map should has more, how to say, ""happenings""( like the monster in the cave)."
6178,Good game but kinda short.
6179,"Good movement mechanics and gameplay overall. Ugly salamander people. 

7/10"
6180,"I recieved the game for free like a lot of other people as it was being given out. However, this game is amazing, the story is great and I really enjoyed the gameplay. 

Some of the mechanics can be a bit buggy,  but what can you expect from a game with few developers.

Overall was a really fun game and the story was touching (and the most liked review has a great theory of the true story behing the game)
Rate: 8/10 <3
"
6181,Not worth 10 quid
6182,"A little diamond whose existence i was  unaware of.Been away from PC gaming for quite some time,that game attracted my attention.A decent puzzle platformer,simple and beautiful graphics,makes it enjoyable all the way,
Received for free during Steam promotion,it deserves its price!"
6183,"A beautiful story, with fun and immersive gameplay and a beautifully built world."
6184,"A really fun game with good story. The mechanics of the game work great and it's a lot of fun to play. It's not a very long game, only about 3 hours, but it's 3 hours well spent. The game also has a pretty good story with some fun characters, and I like that the story is told like a bedtime story to your daughter. I really enjoyed this, I may have gotten it for free, but I would say it's worth ‚Ç¨13. Really good game!"
6185,Great game !
6186,Really Good! Truly Inspiring
6187,"Literally the only the I could possibly complain about is that it only lasted 2 hours.Spent another hour or so doing the time trials at the end. Atmosphere is great, and you're basically spiderman."
6188,"Very good game , the history is very nice , ambiance to 
Pefrect game but short hehe :p"
6189,"I recommend this game for people who loves adventures and challenges. I liked this game a lot, and story itself was perfect."
6190,"Whilst I got this game for free during the small event I'd already played it a bit before. After almost 3 hours I completed the game. Did this feel short? No. The story, about my uncle, was complete. Ending on a sad note, starting from the point where Maddie... No spoilers here. The challenge in the game is good, I didn't find any level particulary difficult, some were challenging, sure, but most of them I got in one to five tries. I do have 2 cons about this game. 
1: Sometimes a rock, cliff or whatever responds in ways they shouldn't, for reference. During the Maddie's little game portion there is a long jump almost at the beginning of the game. Here there are some rocks floating underneath the target platform, one of them I could stand on no problem, the other, thinking It'd be the same, I fell right through. Now I get this is hard, in a game with as free of a movement system as this one, to get every single rock and corner perfect from all different angles and approaches. Yet, another time it got me more. In the Ice Caves when you climb up a 2 tower vertical part I was almost at the top, missed a jump and through the rock at the bottom of the 2nd floor I slid down and fell all the way to the bottom of the 1st.
2: The way they take away your Rocket Boots, just, no. They break from a fall which isn't even that high considering every other fall. I get the challenge of not using them, however, I feel there would be beter ways of losing the boots. Like giving them away for example.

Other than these 2 points I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Would I buy it at 12,99 euro? No. Why? I have a personal rule of thumb, where for every euro I want an hour of fun, just an easy way to decide for myself if a game would be, or was worth it. I think I'd be able to get maybe 10 hours at a maximum, playing it once or twice with a friend for example. I myself aren't interesting in speedrunning this game, though I can say that the game has been designed with that in mind! Sometimes giving faster, but harder routes than the ""main"" route. I mixed and matched these two options and can tell you that the mechanics feel at their best when doing this, being very satisfying. I would recommend this on sale for sure, or, if you are into speedrunning (like) games I'd say full price is worth it.

TL;DR
If you aren't someone who'd like to speedrun this, wait for a sale, put it on your wishlist. If you are though, full price is worth it!"
6191,"It's a nice game. I didn't feel moved or anything by the story, and the fact that you can't talk to any villager or npc, they just stand there like background made it pretty hollow. 
The graphics and mechanics are good,  and I had some fun but it was glitchy and buggy (specially in that part where it's full of boxes.) I wouldn't buy it, but It was okay for being free.
6/10"
6192,Really great Indie game  although small has a good story[spoiler] of overcoming a death of a close friend[/spoiler]
6193,"great lil' game...weird story and presentation in places but the gameplay is solid. runs buttery smooth and looks/sounds pretty decent. for a free game on steam i'm pretty impressed...

not that long, should last a couple of hours...

(wasn't gifted or given to me, was just free)"
6194,"This is NOT a bad game, but I can not recommend it. Unless it is under ‚Ç¨5 Mostly, because it is just shy of 2 hours long if you get a hang of the controls quickly. So depending on your skill it can be 3 hours. If you manage to play the game without frustrating controls, and physics then you could probably finish in 60 min. 

Having said that, the good about the game is the effort that went into what the game is. It has an interesting world and story basis. Yet, the bad is the story too, it feels way to basic and rushed. The ending is so anticlimatic its dissapointing. The graphics are just average, especialyl for the Unreal engine they look very basic and the animations look lazy. I understand you can not have every game to be AAA, but if you want money for something it should entertain you long enough and make you feel like it was worth it.

In Short, Game is OK on sale of maximum ‚Ç¨5 - the story is so so, the gameplay is alright, and the graphics and animations are below average. Yet in the end its not a scam, I just think its overpriced for what it is. Even the voice acting is borderline."
6195,"Fun, chill parkour game. The game is only ~ 2 hours long though so I would say only buy if on sale. Story is ok but nothing insane. Graphics and animation are immersive enough for you to feel pretty badass."
6196,"This game was so much fun and the story had me wanting to beat it in one sitting. I just wish the game was longer, but it's still one of the better games out there."
6197,"THIS GAME IS FACKING SHIT I WOULD WIPE MY ASS WITH IT. DO NOT RECOMMEND INSTANTLY AS SOON AS I STARTED TO PLAY IT I FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN I FELL ASLEEP THE WEIGHT OF MY MUSCULAR HEAD LANDED ON MY DESK AND KEYBOARD, SHATTERING IT RESULTING IN BROKEN KEYBOARD AND MOUSE AND A MONITOR."
6198,Short but very nice game
6199,short story but fun
6200,I love this amazing and fantastic story
6201,someone is cutting onions
6202,"Got it for free, 
Worth it."
6203,AWESOME JUST AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
6204,"Ok, this game came free this week on either humble or steam, can not remember which I got it from.
It has been one of the most enjoyable non-combat games I have played in YEARS!!!!

The story is fantastic, the movement is fluid, and the tools you are given are fun yet difficult enough to be challenging at points.

There was a real moment at the end that sparked my emotions, and im still not sure if it was a nod at american phrasing or an actual part of the storyline but the whole thing ties together.

Would highly recommend playing through this if you like puzzle games or games with great story."
6205,love this game u must play this if you consider yourself a gamer
6206,"Its a good short story about uncle. Looks like simple game but if you wanna play get a lot of patience. Anyway, good game highly reccomend for everyone."
6207,Good Game 10/10
6208,"I just want to begin with saying that I got this product for free, so I don't feel right giving it cons. So here are my thoughts about the game.  

Graphics/Visuals: 
 They are done beautifully, everything feels in place. Every rock, tree, house... Although random characters can use more work but for random characters that are just there to fill the spot I think it's perfect. 

Gameplay: 
 The gameplay is fun and it will take a long time to get bored. The concept sounds simple, a grappling hook and a super jump. Not hard a?
Well, it's not. That is once you finish a story mode. You then can test your skills on time trial where you can get a achievement. Other than that there are some nice easter eggs once you collect all collectibles. 

Story (Spoilers):
 Fantastic. What can I say? A father telling his daughter a story of his adventures with his uncle, and bonds they made. It's really well done. Comparing the very 1st level and very last. You can see that you grew taller. Indicating that you were a kid. It has even great moral of the story. The lore is also rich.
The story is short but I'm guessing it's intended towards younger audience. 

Finishing thoughts:
 The game is great, with a great story and everything else. Maybe some kind of expansive lore would be nice about the world but it would defeat the purpose 
of a father telling to his daughter a story. Maybe in the sequel? In any case, if you are thinking whether to buy it or not I will make it easy for you.
YES! You will not regret it!

"
6209,"Wonderful game! The story is short but very intense and the visuals are stunning. If you have a couple of hours to spare, grab some snacks and play this game."
6210,"I don't know why I like it, but I definitly do."
6211,"Its a Story About someone's Uncle, but not my Uncle."
6212,very very gud me happi
6213,"This game is beatiful, everything about it is amazing, I adore this game. I recommend it. 

This game left me speachless, there are no words to explain how beautiful the game is, ya'll did an amazing job with it."
6214,too short.
6215,"Could'nt stop playing until the end
Has one of the best story lines ever
Huge respect for the developers for creating such a masterpiece

A Game U Gotta Play

6216,"Great game, lovely story with a ever so slightly sad ending. Loved the game from the begining till the end, as its a great game to cool off to. + Points for the soothing voice of the narrator."
6217,"[h1] This is an [i] amazing [/i] game! [/h1] Although I was among the lucky few who grabbed the free download, I would say it's worth the price and I would have happily bought it. (the things marked as spoilers are found in the first few ""levels"" of the game, but they're hidden for those who want to go into the game [strike] pretty much [/strike] blind)
[list]
[*] As far as graphics and worldbuilding; it is [b] BEAUTIFUL!!!! [/b] The [spoiler] glowing symbols [/spoiler] and [spoiler] the floating islands [/spoiler] are really cool!! Some of the more complicated things like [spoiler] the frog people [/spoiler] and the [spoiler] grappling mechanism [/spoiler] are a bit buggy and clip a bit, but that's to be expected. 

[*] As far as game mechanics; the mechanics take a bit to get used to using, but they become a bit repetitive. You could easily get through the game in a day or two if you sped through it, but I don't reccomend it!

[*] For replayability; it might be fun a few times, and there are many things you [i] won't [/i] notice on your first time playing!

[*] [strike] noot noot [/strike] Narration!! I really liked the narration and how it was an older version of the protagonist telling the story to his child as a bedtime story. I thought it was cool how whenever you interacted with something, you'd get more story.

[*] And finally, story! The story is awesome!! Some may not think so, or think the ending was boring, but I really liked it! Without spoiling it, all I'll say is that I liked the symbolism of the whole story."

6225,"unique gameplay within a weird but oddly satisfying environment and a neat atmosphere to the world, quite beautiful

the game will keep your buttcheeks clenched throughout the whole experience while you're kicking yourself through the air and swing along the scenery

while the game itself will only last you for 2ish hours to complete the first playthrough, finishing the challenges will keep you busy for quite a while and the time trials might pose somewhat of a risk to your surroundings if you let your temper get the better of you"

But incredibly fun."
6238,"Simple but effective. 

The music was very peaceful and made the whole experience immersive. Whilst the story on the surface is relatively simple, look for deeper meaning and it shows how creative & subtle the team were when writing.

Not good if you have vertigo, my partner felt sick a few times! But for me, a great game :)"
6239,this game is just 11/10 the gameplay is good but its kinda buggi because its 1 gb game and it was free the best emotional game i have ever played 101% recommended
6240,"My pc is low end pc but this works amazingly smooth. 
A must play game for low end PC's."
6241,"if you are a lonely person get this game :3

also Death is here"
6242,"Nice little indie game, doesnt try to do much, and its as long as it needs to be without it being repetitive."
6243,"Reached the power jump while sprinting phase. Couldn't move beyond it. I sprinted and power jumped like it told me to but it wasn't enough, repeatedly did this for 5 mins, had enough and now I'm uninstalling."
6244,Absalutley recomend this game is quiet fun very interesting story. it didn't take very long to finish (not sure if there's anyway to extend the game). therefore im giving it a 9/10
6245,LeafyIsHere Played it.. it's good.
6246,"This is one of the most amazing games i have ever played, the story is good and the gameplay.
I didn't think i would get so hooked by this game  but i did and i look forward to see what they will realease next"
6247,i love the story . gg
6248,"Had a short bug regarding the mouse sensitivity in the options, it's basically where even if you set a certain sensitivity for your mouse, it'll still mess up what you input. Quickly dealt with and it didn't affect my immersion that much in the game.

So far the controls are fluid and the graphics are very nice and calming and the time challenge is also a good feature for added replayability. Although short, the price is a bit big for a 2 hour game and you can speedrun if you know a few tricks and cuts. Overall, it's still a fun game overall.


8/10"
6249,"Good Story
Good Game
Repeating mechanics

6250,"Picked this game up for free because it looked interesting, ended up keeping me up at night just thinking about the plot. I won't go into detail, but this game is a must play for pretty much everyone."
6251,"Clunky mechanics, linear levels. Not much variety in the gameplay, up until the last level, where the game breaks its own rules, making for a very frustrating experience. 90% of the challenge comes from it being impossible to see where to go next. The levels feel like they were made with swinging in mind, but the grapple pulls you towards objects, making you collide and lose all momentum. The flow is further hindered by limiting the number of consecutive grapples - you can only grapple three times before you have to touch the ground. High jump is slow, forward dash is uncontrollable, and rocket boots take forever to use. You can't grab ledges, so there's no grace recovery for narrowly missing a jump, and when you fall, you have to wait seconds until you hit the level floor to reset.

Special shoutout to the fifth and final level, where the game repeatedly breaks its own rules. You can't grapple to walls as you could before, except it throws in sections where you have to grapple to the ceiling to traverse. You usually need to grapple to objects marked with shining runes, except it throws in pitch-black unmarked stalactites that are impossible to see unless you crank the gamma to 2x. The only way to recharge grapples is to land, except you now have crystals that you can ""grapple"" (without actually attaching to them) to recharge, but to do that, you need to have a spare charge, otherwise you will fall to your death with the crystal staring you in the face as you click it in frustration. One time you need to do a leap of faith to grapple to a ceiling of a ledge that's below you and is genuinely impossible to notice, and there's another part in the beginning where your success or failure is entirely dependent on the random placement of terrain.

The graphics are passable, but the character models look genuinely ugly. The voice acting ranges from quite good (the protagonist/narrator) to terrible, with terrible being the median. The story boils down to ""the princess is in another castle"" with no real depth - rather disappointing for a game with the word ""story"" in the title. The soundtrack is fitting, but forgettable.

I wanted to like this game, but for me, it's a death by a thousand papercuts. It doesn't have a satisfying level traversal, and it has nothing to offer besides that. It doesn't feel like there's been enough thought put into the execution. It's not a good value even when it's free. If you are looking for a good first-person platforming game, Mirror's Edge is leagues ahead."
6252,"Game created for fans of parkour and Stories. Mabe Graphic is not so good but it is still playabele, I mean that it is not coliding with game. When I was playing my story  I found only few misteakes with map like in all games. Mostly you have to use your parkour abilities but game is not so fustrating so gameplay is quiet paceful. I passed game in 4h with looking in lot of palces so usualy most of players will pass it in 3 or even 2 hours. Story is very good but translations don't work so good so you need to fallow narrator voice in english. Game isn't boring so you can play it many times."
6253,"""Wow, this is fun, wait, why are there cutscenes""
""Alright, hurrrry uuuuuuuuup, I WANNA SWING!""
""I'm not crying, you're crying ;'("""
6254,"Great game, fun gameplay mechanics, and a touching story. Not a commitment at all, probably only takes about 1-2 hrs to finish, if you're taking your time, like I did."
6255,Story was a bit to short and It was just confusing. No epic boss fights kind of a very short indie game. But it was decent for what it is. Would i recommand it. It's kind of a mixed for me.
6256,Very fun but graphics aren't the best.
6257,"Got it for free as part of a promo.  I enjoyed it, world is expansive, but pretty linear.  If you'd enjoy the replay to try more challenging ways to complete the game (not my style), then it's def worth it."
6258,Frustrating and addicting
6259,its good
6260,"I have enjoyed the game so far, with a bit of frustration here and there. On the plus side, visually it is a very beautiful game. Somewhat simple in the task go forward through the story. No open exploration because it is linear and has a path for you to take. A very specific path. And sometimes they require you to do specific patterns of movement (Grapple, Jump - Rocket, Grapple, Recharge, Grapple Grapple Land) that become frustrating. I like the narration/storytelling aspect of it, and LOVE the frog creatures throughout. Overall it's an interesting game, worth a playthrough, but at a lower price. If you don't like free-running/parkour type games, this isn't for you."
6261,"I found this game extremely interesting, the gameplay itself is phenomenal with the controls being extremely responsive with me only running into the occasional bug or flaw in map design. My main problem with this game is it's length, though I recieved it for free a price or 12.99 for a maximum or 5-6 hours of story seems, absurd, the premise itself seems amazing and I would love  to see it adapted to so much more, though I will stand behind this game the price is one of the few disappointments."
6262,"This is a beautiful game.
It's essentially a parkour exploration of a fantasy land where you use your skills and special abilities to leap and swing ""Tarzan-like"" from one floating island to another above a river far below. There's no death or violence - if you miss a jump it just reverts to your last save checkpoint.

There is no tutorial, so you learn as you go. The pacing is very well done, exposing the player to a new mechanic and unlocking new commands at just the right time. I felt I was given ample time to practice with each ability before unlocking the next.
When a new ability is unlocked, there is a simple pop-up message explaing how to use it then you are left to practice for a while. I have to say that a couple of these messages vanished before I was able to read them, so I was left to experiment on my own where I could have done with a bit more help, but this is a minor quibble that can easily be fixed.

This is a first-person game. The controls are (mostly) configurable and you can use either controller or mouse & keyboard. The graphics are also configurable from low-res for older PCs right up to high definition for people with better monitors. I think this game would really suit VR, but that is unfortunately not available.

Response times are excellent. I'm playing on an Intel i7 CPU with 16gb of memory at 2560x1440 resolution and I never encountered any frame rate issues.
The music was pleasant and never got in the way of the gameplay.
I enjoyed the voice acting too. I don't know if the voice acting was professionally done, but the actors were believable and never sounded stilted.

I think this is a great family game, though younger children might have difficulty because a good level of dexterity is required when negotiating some of the trickier terrain.
Travesing the landscape becomes second nature after you practice your skills for a while, and there is something exiliarating about swooping down toward the water only to lasso a flying boulder that flings you high into the air where you land on a narrow ledge and pause while you consider your next move."
6263,"I got this game for free so I didnt have any high hopes or anything but this game surprised me. The graphics are pretty spectacular for the size of everything and knowing that I got it for free. The story is a pretty nice story which actually surprised me. It had a meaning towards it, the end helped tie everything together, and it was just a great game. Only problems about this game is the short length. It took me about 2 to 2 and a half hours to beat the game. Their is a goat mode and some collectibles but Im not interested in replaying for those. Another thing is the voice acting wasnt that great, but yet again free game. Besides some of the little problems, this game is a great game. I'd give it an 8/10!"
6264,really awesome
6265,1.3 hours of my life I'll never get back.
6266,"A very solid game. Movement puzzles do a good job of feeling natrual in their progression and how you are allowed to solve them being very open to many solutions intended or not. And their are many other modes and side things you can go out of your way to try and solve and complete both as a part of the main mode and side modes.
My time of completion beign four hours being due to how stubborn I was over completing one of the challanges the game makes you aware of at one point.
I haven't played any of the other modes at the time of completion but there is a lot there for you to get into if you do the other activities the game offers.

The story is a very heart warming one, even if there is only a little there to help move the game along. A simple one that will leave you feeling satisfied on its completion.

Visuals are a solid if not a bit dated but it hardly takes away from it due to the age of the game and it's over all very homey feel. It has held up fairly well in a lot of aspects minus the few very noticable instances.

I personly did not exprience any issues or bugs with the game in my four hour play time so that is another plut to thir lovely game."
6267,"A solid unique game. The movement feels awesome and you constantly challenge yourself to do it a much harder way than it needs to be.
When you die, there is no annoying death scene/screen or other obstacles. You just respawn at the last checkpoint and the narrator doesn¬¥t stop speaking. 
That brings up a cool and defrustrating gameflow, which I really love.

The story is pretty chilled and a nice thing to hear while your flying through the environment.

I hope there will be more games from these developers with this cool movement system in the future. I would definetly buy it with no doubt."
6268,"Great game up until I found a jump I could not get past. After 15 minutes stuck at that jump, I got frustrated and uninstalled the game."
6269,"Short game (2 hours). Still enjoyable.

I got this for free."
6270,"Just go for this game! It's awesome
It starts with a pretty scene where a father is recietng a bed time story to his daughter and all the adventure starts from that! Play the game I won't spoil it for you :)
And it's worth it!"
6271,One of the best games ive played beat it in three days with plenty of space in between
6272,"even my shitty computer can run it with barely any lag and it's litteraly a laptop with almost no memory left

so dont worry that you cant play it cause your toaster cant handle it
because even my potato can

10/10
graphics are good
story is good
bought it while it was free
and i accidently just pressed the goddamn restart button"
6273,"Overall a really enjoyable game, different from any other parkour-esque game that I've ever played. I would definitely recommend picking it up and playing through it atleast once. The character animations are a bit stiff and the story is very stale, there are some walls that you should've slid down but are instead acting as an invisible platform. Something I would recommend adding to the game is a level editor, where we can create our own levels and upload to the workshop. 8.5/10"
6274,Nice Heisenberg easter egg.
6275,"I really don't want to hate this game, the gameplay is really fun, and humble. I really really enjoyed the gameplay, it's just the story. The story ruined this game so much. You get so hyped up for a good ending, and then you get the worst ending I have ever seen. Only get this game for the parkour, don't get it for the story."
6276,"Inconsistent, linear, and boring.

It is fun for the first hour. then it just becomes tedious. Not worth more than $5."
6277,"Really good.
Not what I expected, story-wise.
Ice cave serverely needs more checkpoints."
6278,This is an amazing game. The only part I didn't like was the monster worm thing with one big eye. I didn't like this part because the animation was so basic that it kill the spooky vibe of the game. Otherwise please make a second game I would pay for it. AND PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE IT LONGER. Thank you so much I definaty recommend this game. P.S Devs this concept is spectacular.
6279,"would recomend to all of my friends, has great replay value. 8/10 would really play again."
6280,AMAZING GAME GET   IT    NOW
6281,"Excellent game with impeccable graphics, wish the story was a bit longer and more mechanics than grapple and power jump. 10/10, me 
-I recieved this game for free during January 2019 giveaway, but this has not changed by opinion of the game."
6282,"""...gives the player a wonderful sense of speed and freedom.""
""freedom""
There is exactly one path forward, and the swinging mechanics are a bore."
6283,"When I was starting to enjoy it, the game its fun and unique but it ends, this should be a  2‚Ç¨  game not a 13‚Ç¨, I took my time and it took me 100 mins to complet it, there was a frozen giant whale at the end that I would love to go in and have a level tehre but no, it just ends."
6284,"Common praise for good platformers is ""tight controls"". This game has the opposite of tight controls, and some other annoying design decisions. The same frustrating shit happens over and over:

- Inconsistent air control. If you do a sprint jump you have zero air control, but in all other cases you do
- Running off a platform and the jump not registering, because there's a downward curve at the end and the jump doesn't register midair (if you've played a Bethesda game you'll know what I'm talking about)
- Different grapple hook points have different grabbing distances. There's no consistent way to judge so it's trial and error. Some things can be grappled from far away, some things you have to be within a couple of metres of
- Grappling into something and making contact will stop grappling. There's a section with rotating windmills that have to be grappled when very close by, except if it randomly pulls you in too close you'll drop and fail. The next try it won't pull you in too close for no discernible reason

Other reviewers have discussed other negatives like the annoying unskippable dialogue, and the positives like the world and graphics. So I won't go over that

For me having so much INCONSISTENCY is the biggest sin for a platform game that markets ""tight and responsive controls"". Trial and error, doing the same shit and having it work only sometimes is not fun.

Compared to games with tight platforming and air control like Super Meat Boy, TF2 rocket jumping and Surfing it feels really bad.

EDIT: 
- Yes I recieved this for free.
- But as it isn't free anymore I'd reccomend Downward. It's similar but has way tighter and more varied platforming and parkour, better level design, it's longer and has more replayability, AND it has skippable dialogue"
6285,"One of the Best speedrun Parkour Game.
I suggest to Update performance for Integrated Graphics...."
6286,Awsome Game
6287,100%
6288,Although a managed to play through this in about an hour the game is fun and looks stunning some of the jumping puzzles are quite challenging. all up worth a play through 9 / 10
6289,Great game and nice story
6290,"Flying around at high speed is great fun. It's well-written, too."
6291,"Its like a 6 out of 10 not very hard the story is ehhh, can't replay it not worth the price tag like a 5 dollar game intresting game the uncle is a pedo who stays in a new planet?? with a frog little girl"
6292,"Great little game made with alot of heart.

Just right for a little break from ""general"" gaming eheh"
6293,naisu gaming
6294,I like this game alot its recommended for all ages :3 :3 :3
6295,"Although i had the game for free and i doubt that i coud even know it existed if not for steam, im glad i found such heartwarming game.Playing this game i felt at first that it was challenging, i didn't really get at first what was it about at the beggining,just another parkour game, i thought. But moving on driven by the porpuse of finishing it made me realize later that this is one of the best storylines i ever read, although the gameplay was too short, i mean look at my gameplay, and the voice acting could be improved.But other than that i find the game truly remarkable, and it plays heavily on your emotions. If you're reading this after finishing the game i recommend that u look for a review made by ""coobot"" (here on steam) about his thoughts of the game, don't ask why, just do it for more depth in the story. Finally i would love to give this game a rating of 7/10 and i hope the developers keep up the amazing work."
6296,very nice game
6297,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE EVER PLAYED
6298,Great sp chill game
6299,oh my god this was so fucking fun dude i havent completed it but i havent had more fun with a platforming game before 10/10
6300,"the game was great, the mechanics felt responsive and most important of all they were fun and felt fresh unlike most plataformers recently. The only complain I have is that the story felt too short and like it ended abruptly I hope there is a sequel on the way or something like that because I felt it needed more closure"
6301,Wery good game !!!
6302,"It's an easy to play and relaxing game. The ambient and the music are incredible and everything flows smoothly. Loved it, recommended."
6303,"An awesome game!
1- The animation is amazing, so much character with so little (2 hands)!
2- Story's great. I'm sure with some digging into the lore you could get a lot more.
3- The physics engine is outstanding beutiful.
4- The over-all vibe/mood this game sets in beyond belief awesome, through caves, ice kingdoms, vast open town.
5- Great tutorial, as it's Built-into gameplay, and is VERY easy to learn VERY hard to master!

While i've only played through this once, definitely would be worth $13, (I got this game for free)
The only problems I had were a few clipping issue on area you're not really meant to go.
For problems not related to bug/glitches was the frankly ugly models, (referring to characters, not the landscape. Except for your own hands, which are great.)

In conclusion, a solid 8.5/10. A little short for $13, but very well made & great replayability"
6304,"Got the game for free on Humble Bundle.
Amazing game, the story is heartwarming and the gameplay is super enjoyable and relaxed.
Please consider trying it out, you won't regret it."
6305,This is a really good game and you should check it out
6306,!
6307,"Very nice game, I really enjoyed it. I just wonder if 12.99 isn't a bit too much for a game that you can finish in a few hours. It was nice anyway."
6308,well this games shows that most of the Uncles aren't that bad afterall lol ......all jokes aside this game is great and is a must play.
6309,"Sad it's that the game is pretty short (3 h or less) but its just aswome,i wish there was a dlc or something to this game.TBH i didnt think that this game will be this good,yeah graphics arent that good but....ya'll should give it a help
"
6310,"I finished this game for 3h, maybe it can be longer.
Story is amazing, but for short gameplay 8.5/10"
6311,"This game is a walking simulator with platforming added in. The platforming does serve as a nice way to occupy your mind while absorbing the scenery, and the engine is just smooth enough to let you enjoy it.  Unlike other walking simulators I've played, this game won't try to freak you out or mess with your head.  It instead focuses on a feel-good-with-sense-of-loss storyline.  If you'd like to spend time in an emotional allegory exploring the subtleties of grieving a lost loved one, you might really enjoy this game.  

In short, everything in the game does a good job highlighting a well-crafted story, but that story is very depressing."
6312,"It was amazing üòç
I passed this game for 3.5 hours and got unforgettable emotions that affected my feelings... 
The game isn't difficult and pretty cute.
That's all, thanks for masterpiece."
6313,"Can't even finish the story because of an in-game bug that 99% of players experience.
Devs don't even update the game to fix the bug eh?"
6314,"A Story About me going and rekting in a strange world
"
6315,"Not worth the money, but atleast you can complete the game in under 2 hours and refund it"
6316,I like this game a lot
6317,i just did my first playtru of the game and half way i got curryes about the text so i looked up what whitch letter is and i came to notec this lovely adventure is about learning to accept that somebody you love is no more from the weird and complex feelings you have whit deniel to the fall into depression to the rise to acceptence and this game does it so well even in the lvl desine and at the end i had 2 feelings 1. i wanted to play more but 2. i had a feeling that the game ended at the right time becos if it  would go on longer it would have missed the hole point of the game. so to the game creators i just want to say thank you for making this and thank you for reminding me of the peple i lost in my life and all the good times i had whit them
6318,"Ever wanted to play an unlicensed Spider Man parkour game? Well, then there you go!

Too short, awful storytelling, subpar voice acting. Avoid it."
6319,"Got this game for free, it is hard to point the recommend button between ""yes"" and ""no"". The game has nice graphics, has the atmosphere and it feels mysterious. But if you are choleric person as I am I dont recommend the game to you. The neverending fails with the grappling hook to atach to the land or floating objects, even tho I was in range and was pointing to the bluish runes, was testing my sanity the whole gameplay. So most of the time in the game I enjoyed falling into the deep dephts of the hell.... 
I hope I will be able to beat this game at least once. 

pros:
- nice atmosphere
- was for free
- enjoyed the flying

Cons:
- the checkpoints could be closer to eachother
- Grappling hook was not working properly
- story could be more deep"
6320,(:
6321,THIS GAME IS EPIK 3h - 4h
6322,An amazing game
6323,"Really glad I didn't miss the promo and managed to grab a copy for free, don't think it would've caught my attention otherwise. Quite immersive and sometimes challenging, great change of pace from games I normally play."
6324,"This game was a great journey. I normally don't review things, but this game was great. Short and sweet. Picked it up for free and I'm really glad I did."
6325,"This is firsthand the best game to tell a story I have ever played. When i first looked at this game i thought it was gonna be either a rage game or a wacky phisics game like Goat Simulator. Boy was I wrong. I just finished it and thought to myself, I have to write a a review for this. It's the best story I have been able to listen to in a while. A Dad telling his child a story for bed. I remember listening to stories before bed when I was younger. The feeling you get while listening to a story is one-of-a-kind. The ending took my emotions for a wild ride. In the 5 minutes that i got to see Uncle Fred made me emotionally attached instantly. That's what I exprect from a video game. Especially story driven games like this.

My Verdict Take 3 hours and play this game."
6326,"Great Gameplay, Great Story, Kinda Short, and a Few Minor Bugs When Trying to Stick to a Surface That You're Underneath.

7/10 Would Recommend
Highly Suggest Buying If it's On Sale."
6327,"I wish I had an uncle like this,
all my uncle does is touch my bootyhole."
6328,It is a nice game but average story. All you do in the game is grapple and jump. Not that it is bad game just not worth spending $8 for just 2 hrs of gameplay.
6329,"Altough i received this game for free, i feel that i kind of robbed the developers on this one because you can see that they put blood,sweat and tears to make this game.That being said i don't think that it is worth 13 euro since it has almost no replay value andis sometimes glitchy.This game is a bit tedious sometimes, especially the grappling (sometimes the player looks and acts like a drunk spider-man), and i think that this is a tiny problem which could be fixed if the air mobility of the player would be increased.What has broken the immersion was at the village mission where theoretically you could talk to other citizens however the game doesn't allow that and the player is forced to ignore them and head to the next objective.Because of that i really did not have that feeling that Fred should stay in his world because i simply couldn't care about them (except Maddie but i am sure she would have got over it).Overall a good game, challenging but not too hard, a good story but a bit overpriced in my opinion(maybe wait for steam sales to buy this game?). 8/10"
6330,A very short game with a decent narrative. I do enjoy the art style of the world and the platforming that can be a little tricky sometimes but all in all a pretty good game if you have some extra money to spend. I wouldn't say that it is worth $13 especially for short story line but maybe half the price but still worth getting regardless.
6331,"Very enjoyable, relaxing game. I don't really know its price, because I caught it for free. The only drawback is that it will only last for five hours about. This minus is small when we look at the terribly relaxing (I know that I've already talked about the fact that the game is relaxing in itself) way of moving around the world, which the game offers us. Once again a very pleasant game!"
6332,"Super game whit super story, whit super gameplay"
6333,"very good game i really liked the story behind it overall wiked game 
"
6334,"This was a little game that caught my eye. I rarely get on Steam but I just happened to download this yesterday. This game was a short-lived yet very fufilling adventure. I wish there were more areas and creatures to meet, but unfortunately the end of the game was just too good. Adding more would ruin the rich, colorful story. Thank you to the developers for giving us such a wonderful tale."
6335,had a great time playing was really suprised ! thx ;)
6336,"ƒ∞mmersive and quite fun to play. While the little platform puzzles give you the thrill you seek you can feel yourself submerging in to the storyline and having a quite little frog girl piggy-backing on your back helps a lot with that definitly a nice get away from all the worrys and problems you have and a nice opportunity to flex your brain muscles and relax a bit in the same time.
thumbs up!"
6337,What an amazing game! It felt like magic playing this and the developers sure did an amazing job. Congratulations!
6338,Amazing game.
6339,A short but fantastic game. 10/10 Good Job devs.
6340,Awesome game!
6341,didn't enjoy this much really not a very good game sorry even if free
6342,"Nice adventure game, awesome story, decent gfx."
6343,"Good concept, but at the last part of the game was so poorly designed I couldn't keep playing, because after 3 hours, probably more, of dying because the parkour mechanics were so poorly made I just gave up.

Long story short, parkour without the fun."
6344,"This game is kinda short, on the other hand it has a really great gameplay, story and interesting characters. I had a lot of fun playing it and Im really glad that I tryed it."
6345,"i would rate this game 9/10. it is a very great game the graphics are good and the story is great to. the mecanics and the gameplay are fenomenal. the only minor thing that i may have disliked is that when you get to the ice caves, it's kind of hard to know where you need to go."
6346,"This game is amazing: it has a realy good story line, the nuration is so good I can listen to his voice for 24 hours, the map is beautiful and the parcour mechanics are realy unique. I downloaded the game for free and I did not know what to expect.
The first minute of the game I knew it was going to be a fun experience and when I finished the game I wanted to play it again. I realy recomend it to everyone.
"
6347,This game was awesome. It was a little bit short but I enjoyed every single second I played. I¬¥m looking forward for some simular games.
6348,"What an incredible piece of ART, got this game while it was free some days ago, I was expecting the same crappy free game as always, but no. 
I was completely wrong, this game is pure art, the story, the soundtrack, the landscapes and the gameplay felt soo good.
I was about to cry at the end. Thank you for this little jewel."
6349,Kinda short depending on your playthrough but really good! Overall had a really good experience!
6350,"Expect a quick finish for the storyline, but engaging from start to finish."
6351,"Truly amazing game.
Atmosphere is on point, and the story telling is really well done.
Totally worth whatever you're gonna pay for it."
6352,this game is rly good the controls isn't very hard very fun good little storyline too but a little short I only got 3 hours of gameplay but recommend it tho
6353,Top notch.
6354,"10/10  wish it was longer tho
"
6355,The game is very good. It's like a big adventure. I recommend it for those who want to relax and chillout. Have fun! :)
6356,"Looks good, plays well, feels great! Not too long, which sometimes can be a good thing, and to the point. Definitely entertaining and time worth spending."
6357,"A very cute adventure game, suitable for all ages."

3/5 ‚òÖ's

The game is very fun
But i seem to get lost sometimes and dont know how  to get further"
6359,Worst game i¬¥ve ever played
6360,"I SERIOUSLY THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE WHOLE GAME AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENECE, the music, graphics, gameplay, EVERYTHING! Loved it EVEN MORE after reading on the explanation of the whole ending.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING IT FREE for a period of time, definitely one of my favourite games now!

6361,I loved every second of it. I hope there is more in the future!
6362,"Maybe I'm a jaded cynic, but I can't reccomend this game. I'll start with the mechanics that put me off, then rail about the narrative for a bit.

So, the game's a hookshot platformer, which I love to death, but the hookshot platforming is incredibly linear; the only time the path branches is to up an easter egg out of your way. This isn't bad on your own, mind you, but after the first level, the game robs you of the thrill of exploration by introducing frog people NPC's who tell you where to go to find your uncle.

My single largest complaint about the game is the grapple beam itself; It, as the name implies, rapidly pulls you towards whatever you hook it to. That would be fine, if not for two large problems that compound eachother.
-Activating the hookshot either removes or reduces your momentum.
-There is no way to 'swing' from it, you either pull towards the object or let go.
These problems compound, since a good 50% of the puzzles are about horizontal gaps where, instead of swinging in large, graceful, momentous arcs (like spider man would) you instead kinda float towards the rocks and try to slingshot yourself past each one without slamming your face into them (A difficult feat, since your grapple accelerates you towards them.)

You -can- swing beneath rocks, sometimes, but the moment you pass underneath, the grapple starts gobbling your momentum as it pulls you up and back. An easy solution to this that I'm astounded the devs didn't include would be to have the Left Trigger (currently unused) stop or pause the acceleration part of the grapple so you can just use it as a tether to swing from. That alone would make this game feel better, but between that and the hookshot gobbling momentum like a starving syrian when the red cross comes to visit, it was just -really- hard to get into the joy of swinging around.

Furthermore, each of the 5 levels has a gimmick of some kind, and some are better than others. After obtaining 3 charge crystals (that let you grapple 3 times before hitting the ground) you find a huge ass worm monster who will use psychic wind to blow you backwards off the platform if you move while it's eye is open. So, you make once section of the level, then you wait. Then do the next. Then wait. Then the next. then wait. Then you fuck up a blind jump because you couldn't see where you were supposed to go, and repeat the process. Except this time you're impatient and you try to do two sections at once and get blasted into the abyss. So you do it again. Slowly. Agonizingly slowly. (I think I made my point here, but TLDR, WAITING IS NOT FUN.) The rest of the gameplay was pretty good, but having that intensly frustrating experience so early in the game soured the rest of it for me. 

 The story, while beautiful, was incredibly simple. Childlike almost, as if young children are their target audience. Maddie particularly, a frog person you meet early on who accompanies you through a level or two, sounded so empty headed that I wanted to drop her off of a cliff. The game is visually stunning, with vibrant, fascinating locales, and I cannot stress that enough; the natural beauty of the scenery is almost enough to carry the game on it's own, and I -really- wish the game had more the feel of a solo exploration story, instead of havingt to stop every so often to talk to frog people who haven't yet evolved to the poiunt of meaningful intelligence. Example; at one point, Maddie finds some writing on the wall proclaiming 'DON'T MOVE WHILE THE EYE IS OPEN.' You then later find the giant eyeball monster I mentioned above, and she says something along the lines of 'holy cow! I think i figured out what that writing was talking about earlier. Remember! You're not supposed to move if the eye's open!"" Yes maddie. I'm not a toddler. I remember what you said literally 3 minutes ago.

All in all, the game's hookshot mechanic is decently at best, the story is passable, if incredibly ham-handed, and the scenery, while breathtaking, could never be enough to save this game's grace. I wish steam had a 'meh' option, because that's how I feel about this game. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't love it."
6363,"Even it's a bit short, the game is beautiful and the story is emotional. The parkour is so well rounded. Big up."
6364,"lovely gameplay and visuals, not bad story"
6365,"Short, 2 hour long story with decent gameplay and lovely atmosphere.

+ grapling mechanics
+ movement is really smooth
+ interesting characters 
+ everything is just so cozy
+ story your character says is very good
+ very good graphics and artistic style

- frost caves can be little frustrating
- i dont think its worth 12 euros, maybe 5-8? 
i got it for free"
6366,So far i love the game.
6367,Basically it's Spiderman with pretty good (possibly amazing) web-swinging mechanics.
6368,"I finished the game in 3 hours according to Steam after getting it in a giveaway. I wish there were more content, but it currently only costs $13, it's a very nice looking game, and it runs really well on my Intel HD 5500 GPU (except the MSAA option does nothing), so I can understand that. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but the Chasms seems too dark, like it needs a touch of the HDR effect found in Half-Life 2: Lost Coast.

The grappling hook aspect feels more like a tractor beam because it pulls you towards what you hit at a fixed rate, nullifying any other velocity you had (much like Portal 2's excursion funnels), rather than swinging on what you hit, which means if you grapple the ground while falling, it appears to slow you down. Regardless of how exactly it works, the grappling hook is fun.

Prepare to fail many times, it might not seem fair, but you'll get it eventually."
6369,Game with very well made story and gameplay not hard nor easy. Very good facial expresions of NPC.
6370,"A game with an interesting and captivating story, although it is still somewhat bugged ... But in my view it is a game that is worth of playing.

PS: Sorry for the english, because it is not my first laguange......



"
6371,VERY RELAXABLE GAMEEE EVEEEEER!!!!!!!!!!1 11111/10
6372,"~4 hours of great, clean fun"
6373,A gorgeous game that touched my soul. Passed in 90 minutes. It is a pity that a short game
6374,It was great
6375,"what a nice surprise, I received a copy from humble bundle and I didn't expect much
but it was a fresh short game, I loved the idea of a narrator telling the story while playing
the game.
And the game was beautiful, it's a short game so everyone should try it."
6376,Awesome graphics but the blue girl looked awful
6377,"Even the gameplay is short, I like the challenges. This games remind me to Portal. Find a way to escape, without a weapon, interact with some stuffs, and has a good storyline."
6378,"Boring story and gameplay that gets dull after 10 minutes (if you can actually get to the gameplay, that is, considering how the story takes presidence). A pretentious pile of *rse that isn't even worth the 2gb it takes up on my drive.

Sh*t game"
6379,"Amazing story, amazing narration, 10/10 for me"
6380,"Nice, calming platformer with a wholesome story.
Took me about 2 hours actually playing the game to get through, but I am pretty sure that if you played it as intended, you could reduce the playtime under an hour.
I actually got the game for free during the recent... how do you call it? Free weekend? Probably. Who cares. Anyways I wish I actually bought it, 'cause it's actually really well made, and I can easily see myself replaying it multiple times before I would get bored of it.
It feels a lot like a quality cs:go surf map, but with more overall content, and some interesting quirks. 
I wish they've made some sort of sequel, with a slightly longer playtime."
6381,I wish it would be longer but its great!
6382,Beautiful!
6383,"It's a great game, good graphics
but the story is short so if there would be another game longer, doesn't need to be the same story, i would buy that"
6384,"Aboslutely amazing game! Although the story is quite short I still loved it!!
The idea behind the game and the way the story was told is very nice and just the game play was astonishing for that that I bought the game!
If your looking for a fun and adventures game. This is exactly what your looking for!"
6385,"good but short
"
6386,Extremely good game. It has very well made movement controlls. Only about 2 hours long but has Extras game modes that will fill some more time if you want to play more. Recommended.
6387,"I needed a game like this, a nice enviroment, good characters, and above all, an excellent story.  11/10 :)
"
6388,holy fucking shit. just buy this game. thank you devs. thank you.
6389,Decent but old game
6390,A very unique expierience to say the least. Really recommend it to anyone who got a little bit of spare time in their day. Its not a long game or anything but it is truly a masterpiece.
6391,"My favorite game TNH  Gone North Games
"
6392,fuck this game what a pile of buggy shit and fuck all of you as well fucking freaks
6393,Great Game To Play And Have Fun
6394,"Too short :((((((

amazing game
reminds me portal (a bit)"
6395,Nice game got it for free really liked it
6396,"I really love this game so much, its so amazing the graphics are so good, the mechanism of the game is so well made the story's are so easy to understand, guys its worthAbuy"
6397,"The atmosphere in this game is really impressive, Im an hour in now and I can already see how much love they put in this game. The areas are absolutly amazing, and I these kind of games should be considered as art. Be sure to play this game, it's something you dont wanna miss out on! 

Edit: After finishing the game, I really think this is one of the best platform games I've played in years. The story is told fantastic.

The only less fun thing was that the grappler could be a bit buggy sometimes, but it didnt ruin the experience for me.

Check this game out!

9.5/10"
6398,shit game
6399,"man i knew this game for 2 years now! and i did not even know the name of it..
but when i was scrolling down the Steam Store i saw this game and i thought ""Wait, i think i know this game""
and when i clicked on it, it had a ""Free Giveaway"" and i was so happy. 
i don't have that good computer and the game lags ): but i hope when i get a better PC i'll play it."
6400,should play
6401,Lot of Fun while playing!
6402,R.I.P my 12.99$. One of the shittiest game i've ever played. Just wanna delete my 2 hours of memory thanks! It could be much better if i stare clock to see hour hand's movement
6403,that story almost make me cry
6404,"Good game, very interesting first person adventure game"
6405,"Beautiful story, Nice game sir :D"
6406,"Hope that the creator can add a target director in the game so that I know where to go.
Otherwise, it's great."
6407,Give it a try if you like platforming games
6408,Got it for free and didnt expect much but it is a really nice relaxing game! My only wish is that it would last a bit longer:)
6409,"I liked it,
 pretty smooth story and gameplay for a relatively simple game
[spoiler] I died more in the Madelaine challange than anywhere in the game [/spoiler]"
6410," Great Game 9/10 The story was so good and i think this game is so worth it
i give 9 because i just got problem when i use the grappler
but for all its good

sorry for bad english"
6411,The game is absolutely beautiful even tho there r a few minor bugs that doesnt affect the gameplay pretty much or at all.....overhaul its a great first person parkour game with a beautiful story worth playing and the sound track too!!!!!!!!!!!its just a true example of what a masterpiece really looks like.this game's story and soundtrack is what makes it stand above the rest and gameplay too is great.it really is a great game worth every penny :')
6412,"Nice idea, but the execution is bad.

You cant tell the difference between the rocks you can and can not grapple, to make things worse, it's really hard to see if the indicator is lighting up or not, at flying speed that's a huge problem. Also the hitbox seems off for the crystals, all of those made the game more frustrating than fun.

And the story is just ""It got to have a story"" kind of story, it's better off without one In my opinion.

In the end, I was just relieved it's over. I didnt have a great experience."
6413,"My favorite game for now ! :P I love it, so chill and nice story ! <3 <3 <3  :3"
6414,"Worth the time for sure.Never really knew about this game but the experience was hella good.i received this game for free after seeing the steam pop up.Gotta say that if i knew about this game earlier,i would have definately brought it.Give it a try if you are a casual gamer and likes to relax while gaming as the game mechanics are good and has a very beautiful environment"
6415,It was an amazing expirience i sugjest  you get it for free while you can a lilbit too short tho........ Make a sequel...
6416,Spiderman Simulator
6417,this game is amazing even tho im played it for 15 minutes
6418,Amazing game. Great story and I couldn't stop until I finished!!
6419,"This was GREAT game really enjoyed it. amazing music,fascinating scenery, great storytelling, and nice mechanincs.
I Loved It!"
6420,Got it for free seems fun by the limited gameplay ive seen
6421,"I have to give this game a thumbs up for managing a short, sweet story that honestly gets those emotional synapses in the brain going. Expect only about a 3 or so hour game, maybe a bit more if you are going for the collectibles. I can easily see this game being a speedrunner's wet dream, especially with all of the options available to you mid to late game. And that's the kicker for this game. The gameplay: while incredibly simple, for the length of the game, it's actually very well paced as the momentum-based platforming gets a little more complicated as the story progresses.  
All-in-all, it's just a short afternoon's worth of gameplay, it's quality throughout, especially given how small of a team worked on this.  I am glad Steam gave me this game for free so that I can spread the word about this little gem of a game. I'd say worth your purchase unless you are a time slob, in which case it's still worth it in a bundle or for 5 or 10 bucks."
6422,"A Story About My Uncle is a great narrative. The story is touching, yet simple. The levels are a lot of fun and can be challenging at times. The ending is beatiful and the music fits very well throughout the game. 

The only complaint that I have is that the some of the characters aren't very nicely animated. Besides that, I have nothing negative to say about this game. Definitely worth playing."
6423,This game is best when you go in blind so just take an 2 or 3 hours to play through it and i doubt you will regret it
6424,"That's so cool.  Spend a little time to translate all decrypted phrases. There are a lot of hided elements and puzzles from developers. But i didn't understand digit combination in the end 67,83,59.... Don't have ideas what does it mean(
I found even a snowman from Frozen Heart =) 
Unbelivable atmosphere. +REP"
6425,Got it for free.  Wished I payed full price.
6426,"amazing 10 of 10 ,this game have everything:
-athmosphere
-good gameplay
-and a good story"
6427,"it's a good game, it's fun to play when you've got nothing else to do, my only complaint is that it only has 2 hours or less of content"
6428,"I really enjoy the story, and the amazing world that we discovered. Really good game, graphic, gameplay and story. It's FUN. XD"
6429,"It took me exactly 100 minutes to beat this game. It was mildly entertaining, but repetitive. No depth to the gameplay, the mobility felt a little clunky, and the voice acting was mediocre at best. There are only 3 areas to this game, and each instantly lose their novelty when you begin to do the same puzzles you did on the previous area. Little to no explanation of any of the background to the story, and many of the puzzles had exactly one solution. I got this game for free during the free week or whatever, so I don't feel bad about it, but if I had paid any money for this game, I would be sorely disappointed. This game will stay at 100 minutes played for eternity."
6430,Perfect. My only regret for getting it I didn't get it sooner and i wish the gameplay was longer :( I really enjoyed this game.
6431,"Very good nice work, i hope you make another great game !"
6432,"Deceptively simple game with well=done mechanics that mesh parkour and alt spiderman perfectly. 

The story is also sufficiently poignant ... to better complement the smooth sail if not short adventure. 

7.8/10

PS: Did I mention the game looks really good despite it's relative age. Yeah. It's one to waste time on definitely."
6433,"Absolutely wonderful. A SAFE game for kids, no violence, but full of adventure and story telling."
6434,this bitch is crazy
6435,The game is short but level designs and playability make it fun.
6436,its okeay..
6437,"Muito bom o jogo!
A Hist√≥ria apesar de ser simples e rapida de se completar, √© muito atraente e te faz querer ver o final.
""maddie i miss you"""
6438,<3 <3 <3
6439,"What a unique and charming little game. 
The puzzles and mechanics are challenging but you can get the hang of them with enough practice. 
The story is mysterious and interesting and creates a pretty well fleshed out little world. 
Environments are detailed and eye catching and fun to traverse. 
Games like this are always a nice detour from more main stream titles.
The achievments are considerably difficult to get though so dont expect to get them from just playing through it once."
6440,"Not a bad little hidden gem this one. Nice controls, graphics and an endearing little story.

Don't expect hours of gameplay and huge indepth storylines. Its the kind of thing you would play when you are persuing your games not knowing what to play but wanting to play SOMETHING, and are looking to mindlessly burn a few hours without thinking too much. Kinda relaxing.

Might start it up again to do some acheivement hunting down the track but thats probably about it for replayability."
6441,"Game has one serious flaw right at the beginning. You recieve a grappling feature with your hand that allows you to swing from one element to another. You literally fly through the air and land on small islands at the beginning using this crucial feature. I spent about 45 minutes trying to grapple from one location to the next and COULD NOT DO IT (legit tried every possible thing I could thing of). I finally said ""screw it"" and looked up a play through to see what I was doing wrong so I could progress through the obstacle... So after watching the play through back and forth about 8 times I finally realized that I had progressed through the map with only 1 grapple... I really should have had 2 grapples where I was in the game. I clearly had flown over the progression marker where I was given the second grapple due to the the gravity in-game and wasn't given the 2nd grapple. I tried to work my way back to the point where the play-through player was given the 2nd grapple and it was just too much. I'm pretty much going to have to restart from the beginning and hope I don't miss the 2nd grapple check point. This game has serious potential and looks really fun but this really rubbed me the wrong way not going to lie!"
6442,I want to see next gen adventure like dad and daughter this is about me (dad) and yes good graphic gameplay but short story but everything is good only sotry is shot is not ok for me
6443,"I've played videogames all my life but found myself losing interest in new games really quickly.
This was the first time in years I was genuinly hooked in front of the PC to finish the game. 

Absolutely beautiful, thank you Gone North Games <3"
6444,ok...just play it it! you`ll see
6445,"Jumping lame simulator with a nice story but that's it, good that i got it for free otherwise it was really stupid frustrating. Controls are terrible, you have to jump perfect and grab yourself perfect as well or you do not advance no where. A to B boring game. I got so far to the falling boxes and after 30min wasting there i decided to direct uninstall it and give it a negative review."
6446,"A good game:)
Simple, nice to look at
7/10
"
6447,"I got this game free from giveaway but i wish i could know this game earlier to support the dev
This is such a great game"
6448,"it take me 3 hour to finish the game and included walking around the village and some background view(looking for more detail from the game)! this game is worth to use more then 3 hours to play and i really really recommend this game to people looking for good story and gameplay. I got the game from free copys and I would like to buy this game as a gift for my friend to play as well. 
The only problem of this game is the direction guide. In the later game i found it is hard to find my direction the next place that i need to go and sometime I found out i have skip some save point as well but skip most of the save is when i get the fly booster it helps a lot for me. 
PS. there are 2 save point you may found very difficult to pass and both point I have try more then 10 time to get it pass!!!!!!!!!!!!FFFFFKKKKK you may feel exhausted but don't worry just give yrself a rest and come back later! : )"
6449,"Spoiler!!!!!









i played for about 2 hour and done, that's it"
6450,"turned out way better then i thought, all together it's a very good game, worth the time."
6451,good game but i would have liked it to be longer maybe in a sequel but all around a 8/10
6452,leafy
6453,"Best if you play it straight from start to end. I got it for free for some promotional thing and decided to give it a shot. Couldn't stop playing until I actually had to. RN I don't have much incentive to continue it. Story isn't that great, graphics are mediocre, gameplay, albeit interesting and fun I'd rather play the new Spider-Man game on PS4 if all I really did here was grapple hook from rock to rock and super jump through obstacles. I think its a good game, just not for the full price."
6454,"This game is absolutly amazing
great graphics
great gameplay
amazing story
runs very well
its captive
brilliant 
10/10 well done devs"
6455,10/10 would get emotional again <3
6456,"I never play these types of games. Never. I noticed that it was given away yesterday, and decided why not, I'm bored out of my mind anyways. Of course, as soon as it had finished installing I forgot it. Played it today though, and I must say, it's a beautiful game. I loved every bit of it, and I already miss Maddie.. I cried in the middle and the end. Thank you for this experience, phenomenal."
6457,This game while short was a ton of fun and has such a great stroy!!!!
6458,"Great game , but a little bit short , want more and next time i will buy it ! :D"
6459,great game and nice story
6460,"this game is really great for a f2p game, i dont know what to say about this game, it's not just because this game is too short, but the story is good, very recommended to play :'D



and my rate for this game is 8/10
"
6461,"Short story line (avg 2-3 hrs) with realy nice atmosphere and sound environment. Great characters and voiceover. Intuitive and involving gameplay.  
Very very good for small game.  10 \ 10."
6462,Rage free game suuure
6463,nice
6464,It's great game and reminds me of the refunct in high quality version
6465,"The game is great. I totally recommend playing this game. It's worth your time. Everything is great, the atmosphere, the gameplay and the story. But, the game is sometimes buggy with the grappler, and frustating at times. A hints feature should be added. 9/10"
6466,Very good game! I love this‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!!
6467,That were 3 well-spent hours.
6468,A cool game with a cool story. I like it!
6469,"Very great game. Got it when it was free on 1/12/2019 and absolutley loved it! A little challenging, but an overall great game."
6470,"So after two hours of imersive gameplay, i really love this game. The start of this game is very imersive and the few seletoin of charaters in the story are charming and unique. Tourds the end of the game it gets a little dull but the end is worth all the challenge and wait."
6471,This game is dog shit.
6472,"Honestly a pretty decent game. I was expecting some weird twist at the end where the daughter was actually a wierd human/frog-person hybrid in some weird ""This is how I met your mother"" sort of turn, but what I got was a punch in the feelings and a few manly tears.

Really liked the verticality of the gameplay, even with the occasional inconsistencies with the grapple (which I only experienced a few times in a solid run). My biggest issue with the grapple system is the fact that there's no gravity to the swings which frequently causes you to smack into rocks, killing momentum (and you if you don't have a backup plan).

Now onto visuals. This game came out in 2014 and even by that standard, the character models are a bit ""Meh"", but given the fact that the developer's only got one other game listed on steam, it's reasonable to assume that they're not the biggest studio out there. Environments, however, were absolutely stunning. The particle effects were nice, too.

I give it an 8.5 overall. Short experience if you're only in it for the story, but given how much care and effort went into every facet of what I experienced in my 3 hours of play, I can say without a doubt that I'd 100% have bought this at full price if I'd known that it existed before now."
6473,"The parkour is pretty fun, graphic and music is great.
And since i got it for free, thanks!"
6474,Game design is awful
6475,i dont know why this game did not get the same traction as portal; but it should have...it has a great story
6476,"If you have two hours of your night to spend playing games, I would really advise getting this game. Its a game that you can really just get lost in for a while, the animations feel so smooth, and the phsyics are very nice. The voice actor in this game has such a smooth voice, and the game play is not that tasking. Simply amazing game!"
6477,Fun adventure game with decent graphics and controls. Worth buying!
6478,No.
6479,"JUST FROM PLAYING A SHORT PART OF THIS I CAN TELL IT IS ****ING GREAT THE GRAPHICS ARE AWSOME AND THE STORY IS GREAT, I AM SO LUCKY I GOT THIS ON THE GIVAWAY, IT IS WORTHY OF ITS COST 10/10 WILL PLAY AGAN"
6480,"beat it under 2 hours, story is meh, voice acting is okay, the main thing about the game the grapper fails more often than not
wouldn't pay for  it but while its free why not grab it"
6481,Great Game.
6482,"Amazing game!! Nice gameplay, but I feel the campaign is short."
6483,"Please put on some headphones, get comfy, and block off a few quiet hours of your life to play this amazing game"
6484,"You get the game for free , along with trading cards for steam funds. In terms of everything else , it's good."
6485,"Picked this game up when they were giving it away for free. It's a pretty neat game that makes you feel like a badass.
"
6486,god I hate the crystals
6487,"This game was pretty fun, but that doesn't mean it's an immediate recommendation.

The game is about $20 AUD (although I got it for free), and it only has two hours of gameplay with no replay value. The writing in the game isn't so good and that affected the already mediocre voice-acting. 
Your companion through about half the game, Madeleine, is horrendous to look at and her dialogue is cringeworthy in its finest moments. I didn't care for the character at all and this was also true for the uncle character. 
All character models in the game, including the one human, were terrible, especially in comparison to the nice looking world you temporarily inhabit. 
The music was nice but barely played, leading to the atmosphere feeling somewhat lacklustre. The one antagonist, the eye creature, was used for one section then immediately forgotten about, it could have been used as a symbolic reminder to what the game represents, but instead the game gives you none of that, except for some random foreign characters that literally represent what the game means, which makes the story even more contrived. 
The movement in the game, while fun, was excessively simple and not freeflowing, many jumps required a lot of waiting and the game was always 5 seconds in the air and 15 seconds on the ground. 

I've seen other games like ""The Beginner's Guide"", and ""That Dragon, Cancer"" which were walking simulators but left an impact on me, I thought about them. I didn't care for any characters present in this game or the story.

Tl;dr If you don't care about voice acting, characters, nuanced storytelling and dialogue BUT you like jumping and swinging for 2 hours, get this game. Otherwise, closest I'd say is the AOT game or Spiderman PS4."
6488,holy cow is this good...wow!!!!
6489,"Simple story, you can see the love in the game and i like it. Great soundtrack and good gameplay."
6490,"It was very fun and unique, but could get challenging and frustrating at times. All in all though I loved the game and it is a work of art."
6491,"Not a fan.
The use of a grappling hook is pretty cool, but reiterated over a series of steps over and over with more tedious movements such as rocket boots and more grapples in one swing. I found myself pretty bored, a brief sequence of being pushed by a dumb worm that does absolutely nothing except blow you away.
The story is similiar to any other cliche of a kid's fantasy story you imagine it to be, a long drawn out story. The characters are so unlikeable and unbelieveable you merely give little care to these characters. You come all this way to find your uncle and then he sends you back and its over. Many people said they were moved by the story, but it was barely emotional. The music was nice, but the atmosphere of using a grappling hook constantly leaves little venue to the story. 
you can have 2 stars. $18 for this garbage i'd rather have it for free or 2 dollars. 
"
6492,"I'm glad I got this game while it is free, it is not worth the $13 cost it normaly is. The game is a about 2 hours long and you get some grapple mechanics which is always fun and a nice world to look at and explore, but I was dissapointed at the lack of options I found myself in most of the time. In a game like this I'd exepct more ways to play the game but too often did I find myself with only one path to follow."
6493,Great story. The feels got to me.
6494,"I liked the game after all of that sad and dark story behind it, but soundtracks were too boring and almost repetitive.
and overall here is my score to this game
Graphics - 7/10
Soundtrack - 2/10
Atmosphere - 6/10
Controls - 7/10
Overall Gameplay: 6/10
so btw i recommend this game to you if reading this, what matters is ""Acceptence"" :)"
6495,"Now that I have played this game I would be willing 10 times to buy this game. It has a solid story  fun game play good characters and one of the best atmospheres of any game. My only complaint and the desire for more, the ending it wonderful but it makes me heart sick to leave the universe that is this game. 10/10 one of my all time favorites."
6496,"Ever since I watched Leafy's video, I've been interested in this game, however, with many reviews saying 'this game's short', I wasn't sure if I should grab it or not. I finally got the game and fount it a truly fun parkour game which offers a whole new experience. It's simply amazing (the gameplay & the atmorphere). I'd have bought it earlier on sale if I knew it was this much fun 10/10"
6497,such a nice game
6498,quick game but a really enjoyable one.
6499,"They offered this game for free for a short period of time so I picked it up for the heck of it. I was pleaseantly surprised. I am not much of a platform gamer but the story kept me playing. I absolutely had to see what happened at the end. I'd definately recommend picking this up on a sale. I wouldn't pay the full $12.99 for it, though. Only because it is so short with little replay ability."
6500,"Pretty good
"
6501,"- The gameplay is fun, you swing around like a badass
- Short but sweet story
- Great atmosphere, interesting artstyle
- Ending is heartfelt
- The puzzles near the end could get quite challenging and checkpoints get further apart
- The voice acting is okay"
6502,"A fun Parkor game :D 
This game has a really good story to it and is extreamly origanal, It's a MUST have!






A Story About My Aunt?"
6503,oh yip
6504,"awesome game thats well worth the 4 hours it took to beat, Very relaxing, i chilled out for a few hours listening to podcasts and playing"
6505,"Fun platform game.  Only got frustrating about 3 times, and not for long.  Story and voice acting are not great, but it was free so the price was right.  Would recommend if you like platform games and it is free or very cheap.  Wouldn't recommend paying more than a few buck for it, just because it only took me 3.5 hours to beat and I don't think there is much replay value.
"
6506,"positives: very nice game, no bugs, runs well, good story and gameplay, graphics look pretty good.

 negatives: a bit short (just under 2 hours for my first time)

would recommend if its on sale for sure. if you can get it under $5 it is definitely worth it in my opinion."
6507,Loved it. Using your powers in the game was VERY fun! The fun didn't really stop.
6508,great game loved it and pluse one would forever play more if there was more but on contrary it was a great game
6509,"pretty fun game, wierd controls but easy to get used to, 372/10 , recommend"
6510,"Haven't played that much yet, but still the game has made an impression on me.
The graphics are beautiful to look at and the mechanic of the grappling isn't something new, 
but executed very well.
Also the story is told as a bedtime-story from a father to his son, which is a nice idea and improves the feeling of being in this fantasy-dream-world.

Got it for free, but i would have paid for it nonetheless."
6511,"I played this game for a few hours, and unfortunately beat it. I say unfortunately because I wasn't expecting to beat it, and the game left me wanting more. The character animations of didn't look very pretty, at all, but the gameplay was phenomonal. TBH i am about to play through it again. The story was captivating, and it was told in an interesting way, but it was short. If you're looking for an awesome game to beat in one night, this is your game."
6512,"Although it is a bit short (I beat it in one sitting and it took about 3-4 hours), this game really gripped me and I was amazed by its sense of scale. The story was interesting as well. The game also looks really fantastic in my opinion, especially when you turn all the settings to max. My only gripe is that some parts were quite difficult to get past.
Overall, I'd recommend the game. I'm actually kind of sad that i finished it so quick, because it was a great experience. I did get it for free because they were giving it away, but I would say it's definitely worth the price either way."
6513,"Great adventure, Really awesome game.
I love it ‚ù§."
6514,"I love how it has a storyline :)
Amazing work!"
6515,"Should support VR, seems perfect for it."
6516,hey guys leafy here
6517,"An interesting story based relaxing narrative,
Coupled with satisfying 3D platforming."
6518,"This is a platform-jumping game.  It starts out as an exploration game or walking simulator.  Then you get a few jumping powers, and it's pretty easy to use them to get to half way through the game.  But before the end it'turns into a hardcore 3D platform-jumping game, and if you don't like those, or are not good at them, you won't like it, and you won't finish it, which will annoy you because the plot is good enough that you'll want to find out what happened.

Having said that, it has a plot line, nice graphics and a few (not many) nicely designed levels.  And it's priced correctly.  I recommend it ‚Äì to people who like platfom-jumping games."
6519,"Amazing. I'm so happy my friend reccomended me this game. The sound, detail, and story is all lovely."
6520,nice concept
6521,this game is absoulutly awesome great job i hope the devs make another one or dlc or something diggity dawg i hey its a good game i usually play games with a shit ton of gore
6522,"Very annoying/cringy diaglogue but relaxing gameplay.

Only 2 hours of gameplay, so get it for free, but not worth even 3 bucks"
6523,fun gameplay with an intriguing story
6524,"VERY GOOD GAME , GOT IT FOR FREE ON 13/1/2019, GRAPHICS IS PRETTY AWESOME AND FOR THOSE WHO GOT POTATO PCs, FEAR NOT , IT CAN HANDLE IT WELL AS THE SPECS ARENT THAT DEMANDING HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
6525,"With an interesting storyline, the game is a little on the shorter side but has a calm atmosphere. At some points, I found it confusing as to where to go, but you figure it out eventually. It can be slightly challenging as well if you're not the best at the grappling concept (like I was haha) but I would not have that deter from the game.

Overall,  it's a good game to play if you have some time on your hands, and the achievements/collectibles adds some replayability if you're into getting those kind of things."
6526,epic
6527,"Imagine playing a Mario game, but every 10 minutes Toad stops the game and forces you to listen to unimportant exposition for 5 minutes. Yes, when you get to play it‚Äôs fun, but it‚Äôs interrupted so often it ruins the flow of the game. 

All you have to do is get rid of the unskipable NPC dialogue and this would be a great game."
6528,Great game
6529,"Lazy writing, bad voice acting, jarring humonoid character models, and mechanics that only worked half the time. All in all, a bad game. Got it for free, and still overpayed."
6530,Great game! worth the money! 10/10
6531,10/10 one of the best story based games ive ever played. I would highly reccomend paying the $12.99 if you didnt recieve the game for free
6532,"Awesome adventure game relaxing and nice!
Must play it!"
6533,"Great game, so recommended for u who love a first person adventure."
6534,A beautiful game where you can just sit back and enjoy the story. Sadly it was short but enjoyable.
6535,A very good game that i think everyone should give it a try. The storyline was amazing and beautiful..so does the gameplay and graphics
6536,"A very visually wonderful game, The grapple mechanics are entertaining to say the least."
6537,this game finally made me fertile to get the kids back from karen. Thank you uncle :x
6538,"Reallly fun game, but not worth the price without a sale... Other than that I would really recommed this game, loved it. The grappel is really fun and fluid."
6539,Fun Game And Good Story.
6540,big oof
6541,"Great game a bit short though.
I think that they should add player made levels through the workshop and allow multiplayer on playermade levels so you can race or just have fun with a mate."
6542,"An interesting gameplay to say the least,
aside from people models, graphics look nice,
not a lot to talk about, just a nice game."
6543,"A but glitchy,but ok
"
6544,"Very good and fun game, but the story could be longer. Anyway, game was great adn thank you for the free copy :))"
6545,"I had a blast playing this. The gameplay was quick and fun and the story simple yet captivating. But i think 13 euros is a bit much, if you see it on sale pick it up!"
6546,"I feel like I can't be too mean about this game when I got it for free but really... no part of it was good, and I really can't recommend dropping ¬£10 on it

- First person platforming is difficult to pull off but in this case it's needlessly precise, frequently unpredictable, and doesn't feel exciting or fun. 

- Voice acting is straight-up awful. The (very basic) animations don't sync properly with the voices either.

- I found the story uninteresting and the writing clunky.

- Models and animation are all extremely low quality (in fairness, with the one exception of the PC's right hand)

- Creepy-ass [spoiler] frog people [/spoiler] gave me nightmares"
6547,"This game is a great game, however, the story can be completed in 2-3 hours on the first playthrough. However, durring those 2-3 hours, this was a great game and the only times I got up was to let my cat in/out my room. If you find this on sale I highly recommend buying this."
6548,"I just finished the campaign (2-3 hours), so here's a reflection on my time spent with ASAMU

The good:
[list]
[*]The game looks great. Massive caverns, sweeping vistas, and the setting for the final scene literally caused my jaw to drop.
[*]The gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and swinging from platform to platform is the kind of exilharating that causes your breath to catch in your throat as you wait to land a tricky jump, followed by a relieved sigh as you touch down.
[*]The puzzles are fairly linear, but present a decent amount of challenge nonetheless. They make good use of the space available, and the gameplay mechanics tie them together almost seamlessly.
[*]The handful of upgrades you get along the course of the campaign help the puzzles open up without making you overpowered or becoming confusing.
[/list]

The meh:
[list]
[*]The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's not bad either.
[*]Mady's dialogue is dry and often cliched, and she feels like a side story tacked on to the middle of your story, which is jarring in an otherwise very linear experience.
[*]Character animations can be a bit janky, but it's an indie studio, so I won't complain.
[*]The game's undersized at full price. I got a free copy, but I'd be reluctant to pay full price for a 2-hour campaign.
[*]The story ends rather abruptly, and aside from traversing the environments, I didn't feel like the player character had any agency in the plot.
[/list]

The bad:
[list]
[*][spoiler] The post-credit cutscene kind of shot the potential for sequels in the foot, and the game certainly left me hungry for a sequel. [/spoiler]
[/list]"
6549,"Overall, very fun platformer that allows you to jump around and feel like a kid. The story was ok, but could've been better. I found myself wanting more of it though, so good job developers. (Also thanks for the free copy)"
6550,I can't wait for the speedruns of this game honestly
6551,This game is pretty cool. The controls are a bit weird (i need to git gud) would reccomend on sale but $14 is too much. Get it in a giveaway if theres another.
6552,"Even though they gave it away for free - I can't recommend it
the riddles have to be solved in a certain way, you are not allowed to do anything your own way and if you get an inch wrong - spawn back - but the spawns are set in groups where they don't make very sense, but through the actual riddles you get maybe one spawnpoint after 2-3 riddles - one false inch and you can do a few more...
graphics are acceptable, but worse than common quality
story is acceptable as far as I know and that is not far.

After all, the decision to give this game away for free, was probably the only way to sell some DLC later."
6553,9/10
6554,"God, why so short? Enjoyed every minute playing.
"
6555,"+Excellent story.
+Great mechanics.
+Runs smoothly (gtx 940m)

-Too short
-Don't leave, Fred!!"
6556,Fun puzzle platformer. Decent storyline. It's certaintly one of the more unique platformers that I've played. Would recommend.
6557,"just a good game, the story makes it worthy for playing"
6558,Extremely short but great i loved all the mechanics really fun to have played
6559,Uncle molests underage frog people
6560,this is bestest gayem
6561,Ok.
6562,"Beautiful game,good story,anyone who likes parkour games needs to get this one,very nice chill game,when i finished it (in like 3h,some of best spend time) i started playing it again,good mehanichs,but little bugy with grapples sometimes (most of time it goes on your good),very likeable characters and if you find something wrong with this game (no chanse of that happening) you need to remmember that this game was made in 2014!!!"
6563,Great game with wonderful scenery and soundtrack.
6564,good game
6565,I am cs go and dota gamer but this game is so good its fast but with fantastic story really childish and cute i will believe in other worlds now... 10/10
6566,"Pretty good game! Story wise it's kinda short, 2-3 hours, but the narrative and theories on the story are fantastic. Graphics are a bit dated regarding character models but the world is beautiful! Gameplay wise, it was a blast but had quite a few bugs that can frustrate players. I'd pick it up on sale (but I got it when it was on steam for free) and would rate this 7/10"
6567,"Fantastic mechanics and an okey story, the ending was made well."
6568,"Great story, very good environment and good graphics!"
6569,"Fun gameplay, amazing story Not a long game. fun to spend a couple of hours in.
would recommend!"
6570,"Although some parts are absolutely frustrating, such as Maddie's Challenge, it came through to be an amazing game making myself wish that there was more."
6571,"Fun little game. Grapple mechanics are fun with few glitches. Story was simple, but pleasant for a few hours. Atmosphere and graphics are pretty. Overall, a fun few hours of gameplay, more if you enjoy speedrunning."
6572,I LOVEEEE that story i completed the game in 2 hours it was so imersive and addicting to play i wish the game would have been longer but still one of the best game ive played !!
6573,"Stupid game, rarely muck."
6574,"A Story About My Uncle is a game I have had my eye on for a long time now, but I only just picked it up in a free giveaway. The game itself consists mostly of narrative and jumping puzzles, with optional time trials later on. Overall I enjoyed the game, even with its very short time to complete. I would recommend this to anyone who can pick it up cheap."
6575,Free on humble bundle website (LIMITED TIME)
6576,Very beautiful game. Not a lot of content tho
6577,It's a very nice game. Gameplay and story (the whole story behind it) was really nice.
6578,"A story about my uncle is a lovely platform game with a simple story. I love the mechanics that this game introduce, because it is counterintuitive to what we are used to in platformers. However, it has some errors that worsen the experience, such as, the camera in some of the levels and the dependance on insanely precise jumps in the last part of the game.  

FInally, despite its flaws I recomend A story about my uncle to anyone that enjoys platform games."
6579,i am now leafy is here
6580,"fun, relaxing and good looking. great stuff"
6581,"9/10, GREAT GAME"
6582,"A Story About My Uncle is such a great game it is currently free as I right this comment and even if it wasnt free it is worth every penny it has an awesome story, awesome game mechanics, and awesome characters... TRULY A MASTERPIECE"
6583,beautiful game recommend
6584,yeahh
6585,"I got this game for free, but I would gladly pay for it.

Beautiful visuals, a nice atmospheric tone, and (you guessed it) A Story about My Uncle.

It took me almost 3 hours to beat it. I took my time to explore and I'll probably go back to get all the achivements too.

If you're looking for a relaxing game, go for it. :)"
6586,the game is fun
6587,"Great story, great gameplay. 
"
6588,A great game
6589,great game very much recomended
6590,"This game is so beautiful, when I finished it, I became very emotional and cried because I didn't want it to end. <3
I thoroughly enjoyed playing from start to finish. <3 Thank you so much for making this game. <3"
6591,"This game is amazing, simple controls, easy to get used to, its really fun, and it has a good story. I would 100% recomend playing this game, its short but worth it."
6592,"Ohhh, thank you. I'm really glad that I played and passed this game. This is an interactive story, a wonderful bedtime story. During the adventure you have to think with your head, get out of difficult places and, of course, enjoy the beauty of the game world, soak in pleasant music and fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this game thanks to the wonderful voices of the main characters. thank you very much Gone North Games (Coffee Stain Studios)!"
6593,It's just fun.
6594,"Annoying gameplay and bad ending. Just becuase it was free doesn't mean that it should suck this badly. ALso I haven't played whole game, I just saw ending on youtube and you should do the same."
6595,great visuals
6596,"Gameplay 10/10
Quailty 10/10
Story 10/10
Maddie... 7/10?

Conclusion:Second best game I have ever played"
6597,"A truly great game! It has a very good atmosphere and stunning visuals. The gameplay is also top notch and the movement feels fluent and smooth. The story is sad and wholesome at the same time wich is very pleasing in my opinion.

Overall amazing  game 10/10

ps: also good for speedrunning ;)"
6598,Great game!
6599,Great atmosphere and gameplay.
6600,wtf is this game !))
6601,"This was a decent game. I was looking for a challenging free running game and this was no doubt for more than just casual gamers. It's not hardcore but as a casual gamer myself it was pretty good.

The story was nice but nothing indepth, it was a classic adventure story telling game.

Pros:
- story is nice
- game play is simple and easy to understand
- controls worked fine, I just suck at it
-plenty of checkpoints
-great pacing

Cons:
-you will die 1ft away from the next checkpoint more than once all because your foot hit a small rock
...
That's it really

lols:
[spoiler]Maggie will challenge you to finish a corse without using your grappling hook. I spent atleast an hour to complete something that would've normally taken me only 2 minutes to complete.[/spoiler]"
6602,Cool game
6603,"Got it for free and this game is short, so i don't recomend buying it over 10 dollars, i played through it twice and the second time i looked around and though this is SUPER optomized, i didn't like it the second time. this is kinda a play once, toss after kind of game"
6604,"Glad I got it for free. I dont care much for collectibles and completionism, so I finished it in 2 hours. I would be triggered if i payed anything more than 5 dollars for this."
6605,"Does not work.  For the entire time I had it running, it was just a bouncing icon and Activity Monitor just said it was Not Responding."
6606,"Amazing graphics, unique storyline, entertaining gameplay. Would 3000% recommend."
6607,"At best:
Fun gameplay elements
Delightful visual design
An intriguing storyline

At worst:
Poor level design
Dull story presentation

I'm not going to hold some of the story presentation against it too much because it was obviously developed by a small team but I have to say, encountering an NPC is like traveling back to 2004 other than that some of the level designs were very frustrating. It was hard to figure out where to go or what to look for during an intense moment. I guess the thing I liked the most about it was how it actually made me feel like this kid, going on an adventure trying to find his uncle while trying to be brave against everything. Story is actually very touching and heartbreaking when you do dwell on it. Overall, it was 7.5/10 for me"
6608,"its real good
"
6609,"Man.

That was a good time. Thanks."
6610,"Great game... some parts of the game was little challenging but the story and game itself were good.

If you like game which need a little bit of brains to play it to the end. This is game for you."
6611,"First: This game is short. This is something that is a con for a lot of people, but if you understand that, then you can really enjoy playing. 

I got this game when it was free, and had an absolute blast playing. The physics are fun, and challenging at times. Although the replayability is low, i enjoyed every minute of my time playing. 

Please play this game, it will only take a very small amount of your time, and it is definitely worth it."
6612,"WOW! That game was powerful,  i loved the storyline and the animations.  This game reminded me of my uncle who is also  always on an adventure in different places around the world.  The end actually made me tear up.  WOULD RECOMMEND!"
6613,Love it!!!  It is well worth a playthrough!!!
6614,"Heads up. Very short.

Cute sad story, found a new daughter and the gampelay is fantastic. Although receiveing for free I'd pay the asked price for it. Fully voice acted and play tested."
6615,"the story and gameplay is and are beautiful, even if you have to pay, its amazin"
6616,"It's my first time/seriously/ writing a review.
The cons :
-The story was good.
-The game mechanics are unique.
The pros :
-Some procs are little bugged. (Not that critical for the gameplay)
-The ending was little bit absurd.
-Shifting between chapter were weird.(?)(Mine had no cutscene or anything to shift between chapters)
Overall score : 7.3/10 
Not that of a good game but won't regret playing."
6617,My uncle Fred is.. is.. IS.. AWESOME
6618,"I personally liked this game a lot. I don't know why people are complaining about the controls, I think they're pretty good actually. If you think the grappling hook is buggy I think you're just not that good at the game. I would actually love to see a sequel to this game as it takes me back to the days of trying Portal 2 for the first time. I think this game is definately worth $12.99. The ONLY complaint is how it ended so soon! It's one of those games that you wish you could keep going. I didn't actually collect all the secret stuff, but it took me 1.7 hours to complete the story with a few collectibles here and there."
6619,"After playing this game for 30 minutes. I can see that this game contains a gorgeously story, although, the graphic isn't a reality level like other games, but yeah it has its own charming in its graphic. With the price, I can easily give this game 10/10."
6620,"If I had to choose one word to describe this game, it would be charming."
6621,The feels for this game.
6622,"Unengaging story, game mechanics were bad a lot of times. Annoying characters. Disappointing ending. if it would've worked perfectly this would've been very fun."
6623,"Good Story, lots of imagination.
About 2/3 hours of gameplay, the mechanics were weird at the begining but settled after maybe 10 mins of playing.
Enjoyed a lot the game."
6624,"One of the best game ever i played. Really. That's great. Short, but interesting and impressive story. I got this game for free, but I would buy it anyway. Thanks for developers<3"
6625,its good
6626,"Snoozefest. This isn't a bad thing. It fulfills a purpose and function. When it is late at night and you don't want games with exciting conflicts or drama, this is the game for you. It plays like a very, very VERY watered down version of Metroid Prime, with slightly more rustic atmosphere. My only complaint is the music is excruiciatingly boring, you will want some kind of playlist such as rpg music or some kind of spiritual transcendent music in the background, and to mute the default music. Also this is good because that one youtube guy uses this as background video for your videos, so if you want a talk show its good footage to use as background footage. My other complaint is that collisions can become jittery in some instances, which interefers with the calmness of the game."
6627,Beautiful game. Great Story. And amazing platforming. after playing through it a first time theres a high chance that i might find myself playing it another time around.
6628,Reminds me of my uncle Fred. üëå
6629,"Got the game for free. It's very short, but pretty fun and the narrative is kinda nice. Worth it on sale, or free."
6630,the install and you keep it thing was nice this is a good game
6631,"Got this game yesterday and finished today. Can't believe how heartwarming a platformer/parkour could be.
A lovely story with a few lovely characters in a cozy, small but also wide world. 
The problem was the grapple. It could be buggy time to time and cuts you out from an emerging gameplay experience."
6632,nonsense
6633,This game is really calm and you need to be patient too. Graphics is beautiful and story line is great. I loved this game. I recommend it to everyone that likes nice graphics and good story line.
6634,"I got this for free, and did find this fun, unlike other reviewers I dont think the gameplay is repetitive but sometimes its hard to know where to go. The game itself is quite short, and definitely not worth full price. Only get it if it is free."
6635,"this Game is/was a great experience for me. the story is told Beatifully by the narrator and the Charakter even though they get little time are quite good. the Gamplay is very smooth and very good in my opinion, even though there are 3 instances where if you aren¬¥t psychich, a cheater or a lucker you will die cause the directions for the next Jump is unknowable.
In the End it was for me a great experience."
6636,"I just got the game for free on steam and through the look of it i wasnt super excited to play.
And let me tell you BOY I WAS WRONG. This game looked like nothing at first but the way the story is told and the parkour mechanics used in the game i loved every second of the time i played. 

Though the game was really good and fun i was a little bit sad to find out that the story wasnt super long, i would absolutley love to play more of the game if they were to release any dlc. But the way it ended without spoiling it i believe there cant be a continue. 

I would absolutley recommend the game"
6637,"I just finished it, took me 4 hours to finish and I LOVED IT.
The story is great and has great gameplay, its not too hard so even people like me who have no platforming capabilities can play, its like you're inside the story. It's amazing and you have to play it!"
6638,"I liked the game, it was very cute and short, and was overwall enjoyable. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the peoples anatomy, yes the frog people idea was very good, but it could have been executed better, as the rest of the game looks beautifull and refined. Other than that this game was verry enjoyable and I would recomend it to anyone that is concidering playing it."
6639,"A beautyful short-story with awesome gameplay.
Reminds me a bit of project nomads.
Definite Recommendation 9.2/10"
6640,"what a good game, I remocommend playing this game."
6641,A wonderfull game. You have to play it at least once in your life
6642,"This game is just wonderful

It's a very relaxing and satisfying experience as you run, leap and grapple around through this narrated story.

But what really makes this so wonderful is not the game, but the passion that the creators put into it.
You can clearly tell that the creators goal wasn't to making money of the game, but to tell a story and give you a experience that you will remember.

These are definitely 2 of the best hours I've ever had playing games so give it try."
6643,is gud
6644,"I originally got A Story About My Uncle for free from my friend back in 2019, and back then I thought of it as nothing more than just a fun little platformer. But oh boy was it something else.

A Story About My Uncle is, as the name suggests, is a story about your uncle. The way the game tells the story is fairly interesting. Usually a all knowing narrator is someone outside of the story, but in A Story About My Uncle, it is you, the player, telling a story about your uncle that liked to go on adventures.

Now, lets go to the part most of people already know about -- The Gameplay. A Story About My Uncle has one of the coolest gameplays I've seen in any game, be it singleplayer or multiplayer. The gameplay the developers went with is a risky one, as it can be really hit/miss depending on how the gameplay is executed, and oh boy is it done well in A Story About My Uncle. The gameplay is done perfectly, and the coolest thing about it is that the gameplay matches the story(telling) perfectly.

If you have gotten this game from somewhere - Play it.
If you think if the game is worth buying or not - Buy it, and then play it. It's worth it."
6645,This game has such a good atmosphere and the story is emotional. I would prefer having a bit more lvls but its a really good game! 8/10
6646,"[b]8/10[/b]

Good story"
6647,Even playing this game for the third time(downloaded online a couple years ago :( ) I still get enticed in the story and environment.I would definitely recommend.
6648,"Good fun game to play, very short and reminds one of Portal a little bit. Feel like this game/world could have been expanded more."
6649,So good it made me write a review.
6650,It was an enjoyable game. A little bit too short for my liking but I got the game for free so I can't complain
6651,"Amazing Story and mechanics
graphics aren't that good
still recommend it"
6652,"Pros:
Great Game.
Great Storyline
Great Gameplay
Very fun to play and parkour around

Cons:
Kind of buggy sometimes.
Game is short 
Can be tedious 

In all great game and im looking forward to see more.


"
6653,"Top notch story
top notch game
had alot of fun
"
6654,it's a fun game for the grown ups and the kids :)
6655,"Game won't even load, waited like 98 minutes for it to load, I am on a mac and can run almost any game that has high specs and LITTERALY all I see is ""Application not responding"" I tried the following:
-reinstalling
-reinstalling steam
-restarting computer
-validating file cache
-tampering or via looking at the files to find out the problem
etc

I did almost everything I could possibly think of and I am even an experienced computer person. I could go to the core files of my computer blind folded
as long as this problem continues and the developers won't reply to the people anymore about this problem, I litteraly quit trying.

EDIT: I figured out a why to bypass it by launching the application without steam 
the game has great designs and overall great storyline
sorry I couldn't change this sooner I got seriously busy
Might as well just try playing Far-Out (No longer a steam game due to the dev fake positive writing his game) with the longest loading time of all"
6656,"At the begginning (sorry for spelling), I was already grappeled into the story. It is hard to learn, hard to master."
6657,Good story.  A bit of clipping issues but not major.
6658,BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!
6659,"Amazing, relaxing and interesting story. Love it."
6660,"A cute, short adventure that was worth playing. Meticulously detailed world and acceptable agility-based gameplay. Sadly, just when the game started to do interesting things, it was over.

Despite this, however, I was very absorbed for the couple of hours it took to beat, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, easy way to spend 120 minutes."
6661,"Interesting game with well crafted mechanics. There are a few bugs here in there, but mostly they don't get in the way. Game itself is not hard and can be finished in one evening. The story is well put and makes you ask the questions as to what is happening. One top review (https://steamcommunity.com/id/coobot/recommended/278360/) explained the story very well."
6662,.
6663,"An amazing game, A Story About My Uncle right off the bat starts with gameplay that reminds me of Portal, this game is a wonderful platformer. The only gripe I have about the game is that the NPC models look kind of dated, but I still like their look, because the remind me of Psyconauts in a way. Would recommend."
6664,"great gameplay, very interesting story and it is a great puzzle-like game"
6665,"I have never lost my nerves like today while playing this game. If you are ready to die 20-30 times per jump, not every one, but the harder ones, then this game is for you. Graphics are great, character movement is refined, maybe a little bit less islands or surfaces to grapple on would be better because it seemes it would last you forever to reach the save or checkpoint. All around game is nice, but for me valley is a better first person platforming game. Better story, much bigger world, also you have more things to do, combining the cool grappling hook mechanics in both games."
6666,"10/10 storyline is great

only a 2 hour game, but it was amazing"
6667,I was really into it until the salamander people showed up
6668,"Fantastic game! Was a blast playing it from start to end, and the story for that long of a game was great too. 100% recommendation to anyone that wants a nice relaxing game to play one night."
6669,"Cheesy dialogue but otherwise OK game, well made environments"
6670,Good game I only wish there were a few more levels and that it would have a few more challenging parts.
6671,fun speedrun game :)
6672,"Great game, love the graphics and the gameplay, 10/10"
6673,"I got this game for free, thank you. this game reminds me of my grandpa, he told a bedtime story about his adventure when he was a kid not fancy but yes I miss him now, btw I love the graphic, nice VO, totally good. well done."
6674,"There's no sound in the game :( I've double and triple checked all software and hardware settings, and there simply is no sound in this game ...

I use Win7-64, and there is sound in all my Steam games, except this one and Pinball FX3."
6675,Stayed up to like 3 in the morning playing this.  Reminds me of the first time I played portal and couldn't put it down.    I got it for free but 12.99 seems reasonable to me.  Noticed I was sweating a bit after playing.  Some of the jumps and drops were intense.
6676,10/10 would talk to salamander people again
6677,Best chill game out there
6678,"Best damn game for the year, beat it in one sitting and proud of it also great story."
6679,Nice game 5/7
6680,Amazing game with great plot and is very creative and is now 1 of my favs
6681,too short
6682,NIcely done
6683,"This was one of the best games ive played in a while! I really recomend it, though it can hit you hard. Great challenge.

*spoiler*
*The ending was so cute, and it hit me right in the feels because it reminds me of my grandmother who passed away recently.*"
6684,"Amazing Game, the storyline and general replayability are close to top notch.
I enjoy the plot of the game and the the challenges presented. 

Hope to play some more games by this developer soon!"
6685,"very good, small amount of bugs, nice cozy storyline, amazing feeling of flying around incredibly smoothly also something very nice that there is alternative paths (is some places) so you can choose harder or easier for yourself. finished it instalty would recommend 8/10"
6686,a really good game really short tho i only beat it in 2 hours
6687,It was Just as Good as i thought
6688,Pretty decent tbf
6689,"wow it¬¥s an amzing game
for everyone who wants a beautifull game with a great story 
"
6690,"I received this game for free.

The main mechanic of the game, the grapling hook is satisfying, however the level design and pace of the game don't let the player completely explore it in a fluid manner. I can't recommend this game unless you are interested in 1st person platforming and it is heavily discounted."
6691,"I bought this like 3 or 4 years ago, never finished but from what I can remember it was a masterpiece imo"
6692,It's good.
6693,"its.. great. short, and relaxing. hit in the feels at the end. 
10/10"
6694,"Very fun game, but only 3 hours of game time. But still very worth it for the free givevaway."
6695,"a good game with an awesome plot,setting me thinking a lot.."
6696,"Just finished it and wow, it was pretty good, the voice acting was eh except for the narroriator who did a good job, the story was fine, gameplay pretty linear, but i think what really makes the game worth it is the scenery, huge caverns and floating islands with amazing backdrops. Its honestly worth downloading just for the veiws itself, about 90% of all your scenery would make for a steller windows wallpaper. A sequel to this game with better graphics and a better story would practically make this game a god-send from what it is right now and if you play this game for more then 15 minutes you will find that very apparent. But honestly considering the game is so short and free right now you would be a idiot to not atleast try it out. 

In short its a game teeming with potential and for that i reccomend it."
6697,"This is such a great hidden gem of a game ! 
This little game took about 3 hours to finish but it was a blast. Intuitive enough but still not that linear, I had so much fun gliding around the beautiful landscapes. The story is great too !"
6698,"Really fun game, I loved it."
6699,good
6700,"Great gameplay, love these types of games and a great story!"
6701,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWwYE7P55Wg
9/10"
6702,jebote bog kako dobro
6703,"This game is just amazing. Adventure - tick, Parkour - tick, Story - tick. CL4P-TP - ti....oh wait wrong game"
6704,nice
6705,"Great juicy platforming, lots of etra challenges and collectables
got this for free, would recomend at 7$"
6706,"Look, the idea is good, the powers are creative. But I think it's a well made copy of valley. I was thrilled with the graphics and the ways to solve the puzzles, but I think it should be a little more innovative because it seems so much that you just stole the Valley idea and made a new story with it. Who has never played valley until you can find this incredible game, but if you have already played you will realize how bad it is.
Enjoy it as it is still free, because if it continues like this, I think it is not worth buying this game."
6707,"9/10 good soundtrack, good environment, good movement.
spiderman for the ps4 is a great game good job gone north games."
6708,"Atmospheric and really enjoyable. Gameplay is intuitive.


"
6709,Really enjoyed the story.
6710,"cool game, great story, i recommend it fully!"
6711,"short but very nice 
it always keeps adding new movents which makes it fresh
good and short story
nice charakters
"
6712,"At the moment, i only have 38 minutes on it. I already love it. My one problem is, the frog people. They look really outdated and i would like it if the devs would update the models. Overall, already a good game."
6713,Loved the game. It did not dry to become something it wasnt. Just great.
6714,"Pros:
+ game doesn't punish you for mistakes, there are many checkpoints.
+ an exploration game, which still requires thinking and quick actions.
+ a voiced narrator provides you with the story.
+ beautiful graphics / environment.
+ in-game unlockables/ cosmetics.

Cons:
-all terrain looks the same, so you don't know whether you will die or survive if you try to land lower sometimes,
-all terrain looks the same, so it will be easy to get lost sometimes."
6715,:D
6716,"This game was just heartwarming from the very beggining.
Easy to get into and the mechanics arent too complicated.

I've played a lot of story based game but yet this game was the best
It really made me feel that i was a part of the game when the narrator spoke to his daughter and the characters."
6717,"I scooped this game for free, and you should too. Very chill, about three hours unless you want to play through again, which i recommend. Very atmospheric and not too difficult so you're immersion is not broken. Highly recommend this 3d platformer with a touching story."
6718,"Uncle Fred had an adventure alright..

(‡∏á Õ†¬∞ ÕüŸÑÕú Õ°¬∞)‡∏á       =ÕüÕüÕûÕû =ÕüÕüÕûÕû Ôæç( ¬¥–î`)Ôæâ                    
    ===B"
6719,"The game might be short, but it's an incredible adventure with fun mechanics that make me ask for more games like this. The game has some flaws, but the good level-design and gorgeous backgrounds make those flaws seem litte. 8.5/10 would tottaly recomend."
6720,"Disclaimer: I recieved the game in a limited free giveaway here on steam which lasted until January 14th 2019.

I would describe this game as alright.
 it isn't a masterpiece or perfect but I think it's surprisingly well done considering Coffee Stain had something to do with it if you know what I mean ;)
The story felt like an actual bedtime story and the game sold it as exactly that, the gameplay mechanics felt reasonably responsive and interesting but all of this isn't what convinced me to like the game right away... it was the scenery. I got lost in the prologue for way too long admiring everything in the uncles home and after platforming my way to the village I had just started going around looking for things, admiring their homes built of trash and taking in the cave with it's colorful lights all around the people. I believe that both the village at the start and also the town later on are arguably the most beautiful sites of the game. the caves felt like more of a concentration game on platforming across and honestly, I think that this in combination with those beautiful places made for a great diversity.

overall it's an enjoyable experience and worth every second of it's playtime."
6721,That Jumping over Trucks game is better.
6722,"verry amazing game <3
"
6723,Good Game. Challenging 3D platformer with good story. Now for free until 14th Jan 2019. Download it quick!
6724,"So the game isn't at all realistic with it's storyline and the name doesn't really live up to real life. This uncle didn't even try to touch me!?!? I mean come on, we all know what uncles do...

Still 11/9 great fantasy experience at least!"
6725,"that's one badass uncle
10/10 would find uncle again.....
or would i?"
6726,"Extremely charming. A Story About My Uncle has a lot of elements similar to something like SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell, but is held together by fun characters, an engaging narrator, and a whimsical atmosphere. 

With fantastic mobility, a few fun upgrades scattered throughout, and puzzles that are just tough enough, A Story About My Uncle is an incredible grappling hook platformer. 

My one complaint might be that a few areas require multiple attempts before you know what to do. For example, there's a section where you have to jump off a massive cliff with no clear grapple point in sight. The result is that you die a few times just figuring out what to do. However, this is somewhat counteracted by the inclusion of clear grapple markers left throughout the world. They're engaging and they have a reason for being in the story.

Also, it seems the range of your grapple tool is constantly changing, but I'm not entirely sure.

The more I played, the more flaws I noticed. For example, there's a time trial mode and achievements based around finished a whole level without dying (or restarting from checkpoint). It's clear these were both afterthoughts as there's no way to restart the level itself without going back to the main menu. Because checkpoints are so far apart, a single mistake in time trial usually means going back to the main menu, restarting the game, reloading, etc. I

The main story is great; past that, not so much. 

Excellent adventure. Short and sweet."
6727,This game kinda sound like a terrible rape joke...
6728,"If you have 4/5 hours of free time in your life, you should really play ""A Story About My Uncle"". And if you don't, find it. 
Amazing atmosphere, stunning music, beautiful story (it's deeper than it looks). Sometimes it gets kinda buggy but it's still a great game. 8/10"
6729,"I love this game. I got it for free, and dont know how much it costs, ut klet me sy its not that long, just over two hours. but it is grat fun"
6730,Fun short game ( works on windows 10)
6731,"Para de ler isso aqui, vai jogar logo"
6732,The final chapter is the strongest part of the game. Give it a try (especially since its currently free)!
6733,"10/10 
Cool Story btw"
6734,"good storyline , i really like it, but it too short, i wish for more ""bedstory"" or maybe the nephew going for another adventure in other world. nice game."
6735,amazing game! the enviroment is awesome and all mechanicals is greate! what would make it even better is if you could co-op on it. help out eatch other to finnish levels! :) still a greate game
6736,"A Story About My Uncle is a good quick and relaxing game (albeit a little frusturating at times) platforming game. The mechanics are a little stange at first but after a few minutes they start to make sense. The game hints at where you need to go to progress further but its up to the player on how they want to get there. The game regulary challenges you near the middle/ end to make quick decisions on how you use your grapple, jump and thruster abilities that you obtain throughout the game. The way the story plays out in the form of a bedtime story over the course of the game's plot gives you tidbits of information that are well spaced out and very well written. However, some times the grapple mechanic's range seems off in some parts of the game and makes it hard to judge how far away you have to be in order to successfully proceed. The animations on NPC's that you meet can be a little rough at times but these are few and far between.

Overall I would give this game an 8.5/10 and would reccomend to anyone interested in the game."
6737,"A fun, short, and straight forward jump puzzle type game with a decent story which may have a deeper meaning. I enjoyed every minute of it"
6738,"Good for about 3 hours, but little replayability. Up to you whether the price is worth it, but if you snagged it for free like I did, worth playing."
6739,Good Game!
6740,"Very fun game, its not only for the people that like to look at everything and explore but its also for the people who like parkour.
"
6741,This Wiggley Captain Recommends it
6742,"I got this game for free since theres now a free giveaway offer (as i am writing this) i was playing tf2 when i saw the offer and was like ""Hey,since its free..why not give it a go!"" first off major awesome points for this game is playable on mac(a lot of games i love sadly cant be played on mac"" I started playing  and i couldnt stop, the gameplay was fast as flip and it felt A M A Z I N G zipping and jumping and gappling around.The levels were great, it kinda made sense with the level transitions,and they all looked amazing.The caves are dark but filled to the brim with pretty glowy stones and shards.The ending got me to tear up a little .This game is for the journey and the ending.A little glitchy and annoying to grapple at times but its great and ITS FREE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
6743,"Got this game for free and that price is hard to beat. The gameplay was good but got repetitive near the end, and I felt like the grappling hook didn't always do what I wanted it to do. The visuals were decent and got the job done. Sound is let down by the sub standard voice acting. It wasn't the worst I've ever experienced but I felt that it was bad enough to pull the story down a bit. Overall the game was okay but I wouldn't pay more than 5$ or lower."
6744,not bad
6745,It's a good game but I wish it was longer. Only took me 2 hours.
6746,leafyishere on a quest to find his chin in the dark corners of keemstar's anal cavity hey what's up guys leafy here and i found out the cringiest kid in the omniverse the homosexual albannian billys and his future wife with her boyfriend sokol shqiptar
6747,"Its good, just a simple platformer game, with a generic but good story."
6748,"got free and game doesnt work it is just stuck on part 1 door and not moving(changed controls settings and did everything like reinstalling,etc). FAKE  giveaway distributing broken game and now get my negative review"
6749,Smurfs: The Lost Village
6750,Really nice little game with some excellent music and satisfying mechanics
6751,"A Story About My Uncle is an amazing game! I got it during the free giveaway on Steam. Thank you Gone North Games and thank you Coffee Stain Publishing for giving all of the Steam platform's users the great opportunity to enjoy such a visually stunning adventure parkour, that even has a story! The developers truly have a wonderful imagination when it comes to creating this kind of emotional tale. The graphics are very detailed and the game itself runs smooth even maxed out on most systems. There are plenty of challenging achievements to complete after beating the game. The fact that you get three free Steam trading cards for this game when you installed it for free is also cool. I highly recommend grabbing this masterpiece even if it isn't free because it's totally worth the money!"
6752,literally i want some guns :)
6753,one of the best parkour games around IMO
6754,"Rly chill beautifull and also rly intersting story, love the game. The only problem is that is too short (about 3 hours of gameplay) and sometimes tilting when controls dont work. In overall i think i rate it as 7.5/10"
6755,"This game is so much fun and plus the story aww so good, why cant games be like this."
6756,"an awesome game, very good gameplay, difficult sometimes, because you could end up getting lost and going the wrong way hahaha but outside this is very beautiful landscapes, cool story, I recommend it."
6757,Great game.
6758,hard but amazing..
6759,"I never really liked these kinds of games, but holy shit, this was great. The developers did great, I had lots of fun playing it, 10/10 would recommend."
6760,"Beatiful game. Probably one of the best story based games I have ever played. Its just a little short. But 100% worth your time! would love a sequel to this but idk how the story would continue.
5/5 would grapple again"
6761,"Luckily for me, i didn't have to pay for this game. However, if i had known what adventures were going to take place, i would have paid the full price, without a doubt. This game is brilliant and i would highly recomend this game to friends. 10/10"
6762,Great game. Very interesting concept with fun mechanics. 9.6 / 10 would totally play again
6763,Very kool game would buy next yez.
6764,"Very Fun but challenging.  It is hard, but simaller to super meat boy, death dosn't seem punishing. 8/10"
6765,"It was a shot game, but it was great. the caracters did look  a bit weird though."
6766,"Very good, the frog people look a bit scuffed but the scenary and maps look really nice."
6767,Great Story
6768,"Finished the story in about three hours, very relaxing game to pass a few hours by yourself, got it when they were giving it away for free and really glad I decided to play it. Not sure of the full price, will check when it goes back to costing money again, aslong as this is less than 10 euros its definitely worth playing, fun experience 8.8/10 would play again."
6769,Boooooooooooooring just boooooooooooooring
6770,"I'm not 100% done with the story, so this review will be based on the gameplay only. This game is a fun and relaxing experience. the movement and controls are very good, i find almost no problem with either. This game is definately worth the price (although i got mine free, i wouldnt have cared to spend $30 for the game). I find the occasional bug with the game, the one biggest problem i have with the game is that if i explore, a lot of the places you aren't supposed to be in just dont exist, which doesnt really work for a platformer with a grappling hook. Every once and a while i will jump on a rock then fall through. This game is definately not bad, and if there was just a freeroam version of the game, i would love it. That's really all that is bad about the game. If you are looking for a relaxing platformer with very little challenge, this is definately for you. 9/10, would reccomend."
6771,good game
6772,"amazing and beautifull game.
the fact that it is so short is not a downside."
6773,I always wanted to fly. Now I can.
6774,"A phenomenal story and game, definetly worth a try."
6775,Just finished this game - absolutely incredible experience. Would definitely recommend. Great job to all those involved in making this game!
6776,"Nice game, I really liked it!
Beautiful setting, overall a nice visual experience, even though it's clear it's the work of a few people, not a giant studio.
Well done!"
6777,best 2 hours of my life
6778,Most beautiful and cute experience that i've ever experienced
6779,Just a Great Game
6780,"An incredibly beautiful game with a beautiful story.  I couldnt stop playing until I had finished the game.  Beautiful graphics, as well as very smooth gameplay.  So many times in the game was I nervous, excited and happy at the same time.  Visuals are incredible and controls are very well done.  I HIGHLY recommend this game and I will definitely share it with my friends.  Best $0.00 I ever spent for almost 4 hours of incredible gameplay.   Havent tried the timed runs but will probably work on that later.  10/10 will definitely play again."
6781,dope game :)
6782,really - RMB for jump?? Waht ever happened to Spacebar?
6783,I really like the story <3
6784,Loved it. It's sweet and pretty nimble for a First Person simulator.
6785,"absolutely great game,good story,good visuals,the kind of game that you can chill and have fun"
6786,"Want to relax? Want a portal knock off that's more story driven and linear? 

It's fun but linear. Not many places to adventure around."
6787,"Perfect game for relax time. Great story but I waited for something that will blow my mind. But it did not happen. I wonder if only there was something like timed levels or something. And there are. I will play it later for sure to try out my skills and luck.  I do recommend this game for those who wants some challege but on the other hand who wnats chill out. :)
Thanks for chance to get this game free. Great experience."
6788,"A fascinating first-person adventure with an interesting story!
Definitely recommend everyone to play this splendid game!"
6789,"Very good game, has very beautiful graphics and a great story all in an hour of content with some replayability
10/10 very good game"
6790,wow nice game..mind blowing adventure..awesome astmosphere
6791,yeah
6792,nice
6793,Solid 2 hours of enjoyable jumping
6794,noice game
6795,"Great game, really like the story"
6796,"A nice little game with a great and very emotional story about dealing with the loss of a loved one. 
The gameplay also has some interesting ideas, but is, especially in the last level, pretty challenging and therefore can be pretty frustrating. Sometimes there is too much trial-and-error instead of a real flow in gameplay and often you will be lost without an idea of where to go next.
I was glad when I finally finished the last level, because it honestly is too long. But the ending was more than worth slogging through it. 
Overall, I would recommend this game for its story."
6797,"Very good game.
This is basically a parkour game with a fantasy background.
The universe is really nice & the story heart-touching.
Too short? Well for those who want challenge just try the time trials, it will give you some more (much more) time to play.
9/10 for me - the 1/10 left is because sometimes the game controls & physics are a little random - the defrag quake players will understand what i mean: https://youtu.be/R4mO88cEA7Q"
6798,"Well, the last 2 hours were filled with a really beautiful and great experience."
6799,"it is fun but gets bored after oyu played it for 2 hours straight, nice story.

Almost cryed at the end :')"

this game is amazing! the characters are a bit... strange to the eye, but you'll get used to them pretty quick and it doesn't affect the gameplay any. it's a simple concept, and with no great faults from messing up, it's perfect for anyone of any skill level! the soundtrack is great, the scenery is great, the story is great - everything is great! definitely would recommend."

6817,"This game is truly amazing, the visuals are beuatiful and the story tugs at the heartstrings. The game can be frustuating at times when I am too incompetent to actually hit a grappel but an easy 8/10.


SPOILER WARNING!!! SPOILER WARNING!!! SPOILER WARNING!!! SPOILER WARNING!!! SPOILER WARNING!!!
The ending was confusing and sad at first but as a read into it and read other reviews I learnt that there was a deeper meaning to the game and that (Theory from another steam user) uncle fred didn't create any of this and that none of this even existed, this was all a coping mechanism for the nephew who had just lost his uncle in a climbing accident where they couldn't recover the body (Thats why the memorial is in the epilogue). And through out the story the player is going through the stages of grief with the character.

Overall this game for the limited dev team and the general genre constrictions is a masterpiece. Hats off too Gone North."
6818,It's free right now.
6819,"Very zen, good for just relaxing. Great storyline too."
6820,"This game is really great with nice aesthetics and colors. Extremely calming game with decent challenges. Gameplay is around 4-5 hours with a really good story. 10/10 would recommend,"
6821,"[h1]Honestly, i cried.[/h1]

A short review: Though ASAMU (A Story About My Uncle) is my first first-person platformer game, I could feel this game is pretty much different from other first-person platformers like Mirror's edge. The Gameplay mechanics are unique. Also, this is a story-driven game, and the i wrtite the title of this review is because of that - the story is short, beautiful, yet full of secrets. I played this game as if this was a really, really great short movie. The Graphics are good, thanks to the UE4. The art is gorgeous, it really helps the world building. 9/10, that's from me.

Side note: I claimed this game for free during the limited giveaway on January 13th, 2019. If I already knew this game is this beautiful prior to the giveaway, I'd buy it though it's in the full price.

Also, I just realized Coffee Stain Studios took part in this game development, so you should expect Goat Simulator referrence inside, and vice versa."

6825,Beautiful
6826,"this game have a great story this game can be completed in 4 hours (main story only)
in this game are included: Challenges,levels, and some levels where u dont even know to go and frustrating ones"
6827,Generally great game! I like the story and the way of telling it. Satisfying movement mechanics make this 3/4 hour experience really pleasant. I recommend it for everyone that want some longer-evening chill session.
6828,Nice game.

6830,"can say that I have enjoyed every bit that I played. It's a really good time killer. 
The story ws meh 
Gameplay is good
Soundtrack is good
Visuals could have been better but are good enough for an indie adventure 
The game is short. Like REALLY short. about 4 hours (more if you want 100%) 
I can recommend this at full price"

Would love to see a follow up, maybe when he goes back to see Fred but whole place has changed, maybe they had a war or something and some new levels created."

6844,"Lame, student-quality project.  Not even remotely fun, even when given away for free.  Pretentious dialogue? Check.  Awkward, out of place jumping platform mechanics in a first person game? Check.  Poorly acted voice-overs from an actor who is clearly not a native English speaker? Check.
Just...no.  Thanks, but no.  You literally tried too hard.
"
6845,"Nice, short story with great gameplay and a deeper meaning than I expected.

The review I was about to write before sitting on the desk was ""A nice short diversion with a flimsy story"", then I read another review with a spoiler (it's the most rated, for a good reason) and I completely changed my mind.

I won't spoil the game for you, but while the first review I had in my mind was correct if you take the game at face value, you can find a far greater meaning to it once you put all pieces together (and the game itself gains 2 extra stars just for the story).

Gameplay-wise the game is good: I sort of speed-run through it because, in the end, I was the one looking for a quick diversion, but the game has more potential than that if you invest enough time to enjoy the secrets and practice a bit.

In essence, it's a platform game where you need to reach the end of each level using a limited number of technological devices without falling. There is no timer, there is no permadeath, so you can approach the game at your own pace.

The graphics are nice: not mind-blowing, but they serve the gameplay and never hurt the eyes. In a specific very dark level, I admit thinking ""did I end in a PlayStation 2 secret level?"" (it looked sort of like Crash Bandicoot...) but I put that thought in the back of my mind and I kept pressing on, so it must not have been so bad :)

The sound compartment is, again, not memorable, but doesn't get in the way, while the voice acting and sound effects are pretty good.

All in one, if it wasn't for the story the game wouldn't be memorable (the story is), but I had some very good time with it (which is what counts for me in the end) and for a 5-10E tier, is a definite worth buying."

6858,"3.14159/5 


Welp, I got this game free from Humble Bundle, My initial reaction was, 'Hey, that was the game Leafy used to play'. Never thought that I was gonna play it, just adding games to my library...cause why not. Woke up from the casual night terrors, and decided to hop on ye 'ol Steam. Decided to give it a shot. Took me about 2 or so hours beat, didn't really follow the story, as it was muted for 75 percent of my play through. Only at the end did I unmute to hear the final dialouge. I was watching 'The Pokemon Movie: I Choose You' on Netflix. It's almost over now. Went through the 'motion... I enjoyed the play throught for the most part. It was free so I can't complain. It's a nice, fun game to play. I'm sure I missed a lot, I'll start playing again at somepoint, and actually pay attention."
6859,Fun and relaxing game
6860,Very Nice!
6861,Good
6862,The game is great! The voice sounds like it's AI though lol
6863,Very short but good story telling.
6864,"Great game, excellent mechanics.  The fog at the bottom of the levels really helps prevent vertigo, somehow.  I wish the story was longer, but the challenges provide some good replayability.  Do yourself a favor and write down the alphabet as Maddy translates, or grab a screendhot of her book- it brings a whole new meaning to the story.  Easter eggs galore and well hidden collectables make for an amusing time.  Please make another with the same mechanics!"
6865,"This is a fun game i wish that it would be a little longer or so ... the story was fantastic, the levels were so interesting with all the puzzles and stuff. The views were amaizing never thinked i would be dazed by a game or the sights of it :)
RECOMMEND WITH ALL MY HEART !"

6870,Fun game
6871,Short but cool game :3
6872,Nice game.
6873,That's a nice and short game with good mechanics. I love how there are writings hidden around the game with stages of grief written on them.
6874,Its a geat game. I boght it and played for 2 hours straight. I was so Relaxed and Fix while playing it just made great Fun.
6875,One of the coolest stories. Interesting idea. Recommended. Good step to give some free copies.
6876,"3 hours of pure frustration

Pros:
- Beautiful visuals with vibrant colors.
- Swinging can be fun.

Cons:
- Way too frustrating most of the time. Difficulty is all over the place. Sometimes it's easy and relaxing but then some sections must be performed with absolute perfection.
- Checkpoints which are everywhere on easy sections are nowhere to be found on frustrating sections.
- Graple aim is weird, it may connect with poor aim or not connect with perfect aim.
- Way too dark sometimes, make sure to play it at night or in a dark room.

There is also this thing where if you complete Maddie's challenge, she congratulates you but you are stuck down there and if you fall, the challenge restarts and she'll mock you if you use the graple to get where you are supposed to go. I didn't put this at cons because maybe I'm doing something wrong but I got the achievement for it."

6897,Pretty good for free but the screen moving too fast make me dizzy
6898,"A beautifully innocent adventure/platformer with lovely characters.

Sometimes getting stuck at certain level areas breaks the immersion a bit, but yeah, there needs to be a certain challenge in the game. Trailer shows very fluent gameplay (which is possible to achieve with experience), but as a new player you stop a lot.

All that does not distract from this being a very good game with a gorgeous world and heartwarming narration. One playthrough with a handful of stuck-situations took me 4 hours, so it's definitely a nice evening of entertainment.

Cannot believe the Goat Simulator guys did this, great variety. :)"
6899,I don't usually write reviews but after playing this game I just had to. Amazing visuals matched with an emotional story truely an amazing game.
6900,"The level design is not good in my opinion. Quite early on after getting to Maddi on your back you have to make a 3 stage jump. I've attempted this about 30 times now and the ability to complete it is so finite that it just too difficult.
Gets boring and frustrating very quickly.
It's free and I don't think its even worth that."
6901,"Gameplay:8,9/10(not soo challenging but really fun,propelling yourself on first person just makes it better) Graphics:7,7/10(they were great but not perfect,it would be more likeable if the game had better atmosphericlights/visuals)
Story:7/10(It's a simple one not complexing nor plain, your ordinary adventure plot)

Mechanics:8,7/10 (For some reason the mechanics were ""the top of the cake""of this game making it fun and enjoyful)
Nps:6,9/10(they looked like they were from half life 2 but without any further expressions and actions)
characters:7,8/10(not much of a backstory,but it's not like they don't have an actual story at all)

Overall:7,7/10 ""A great game for people who want a soft and enjoyingful game to pass their time,highly recommended to people who want to spend their last 3 or 2 steam wallet money on a game.""

6925,Got for free. Stuck early. Too hard.
6926,Very mmmmmmm good yummy
6927,"Sucks and is stupid, makes you jump like an idiot, even for a free game dont waste your time,
After 4 frustrating hours of playing this jump and grapple game, it still sucks, each grapple has to be perefctly lined up in order to make it successful, not only that, but a lot of times you over shoot what your trying to do, or they make the space you land on so small your momenton forces you to fall off, still very disaponinted in how this game plays while the music is nice the mechanics are way off, too bad my first reviwe on steam of any game and I have played some bad one is a negative one."
6928,"You need to jump from one rock to another, also you can use energy hook to pull yourself to the rocks. Two voices at the background: father and daughter. That's all gameplay. Completely boring."
6929,Good grapling hook based platformer.
6930,"I don't have a good PC by any means but I figured I would at least acquire the license for this when it was free. Thought hmm maybe It will run. And it does, beautifully, even at low resolution it looks good. I am not really a fan of 3d platformers (the hours of screaming I did at Mario64 as a kid) so I figured it would keep me busy for 5 minutes.

It's really cool. I prefer using a controller so I'm not sure if the leap-dash is easier on PC or not but that was the only problem I had learning so far in almost an hour. Really cool game, I mean who doesn't love grappling hook type things?? Nobody. Voice acting so far has been well done. 

Thanks Steam and the people involved with making this game, never would have payed attention to something like this if not a short-lived free thing. It's been said it's rather short, so I would assume like $8 price point would be ideal and more than worth it if you like being Tarzan and sticking some crazy landings like an olympic medalist. Oh, right, yeah the in air controls are pretty perfect. Don't have to worry about missing the landing too much but sometimes you aren't sure of your timing then you do it and it feels gratifying."
6931,"[list]
    [*]+ Great physics, you can feel the grappling hook pulling and throwing you through the air. A great feeling.
    [*]+ Relaxing and serene, there is no part of the game that you feel ""in a hurry"" [spoiler](taking away the part of the monster)[/spoiler] you can always stop and think how to get past this part of the game.
    [*]+ The atmosphere is simply fantastic! Surrounding and quiet.
    [*]- Could have more soundtracks, I dont know if it was just me but even with this amazing atmosphere I asked myself 
       ""where is the music?"".
  [*]- There are a lot of places that should not exist, you can use the grapling hook on them and simply skip that part. 
  [*]- +History is engaging but a little cliche, although the way the story is told to be very good.
  [*]Solid Game!

6932,"I got this game for free and thought I'd try it out one afternoon. It's a great time kill and more than worth playing, especially if you got it for free.

6937,Stunning.
6938,"A very very cool game, good graphics but he needs more shadows. Some rocks are bugged and you can see thru if you reach on them. Some places where you can get stuck but you can escape. This is a cool game and I can't wait for the next one!"
6939,"This game had amazing potential. I really liked what I saw when I first got in, and then it got better when I finally got to use the grappling hook. The graphics were amazing, and I was already coming up with my own theroies about what happened to the Uncle.

Then I got into the actual game.

So the first thing that got me was the NPC models. Maddie looked like part of the enviornment and scared the crap out of me when she started talking. Then when I saw the rest of the model it was just, strange. The movements were very unnatural, they all looked like robots.

Then there is the voice acting, it was very... bland. All of the characters seemed to not be invested at all in what was going on. Maddie is the main case in this. SPOILER: [spoiler] Giant creature shows up, no reaction other than ""So that is what the sign meant. Remember, don't move when the eye is open. I also want to talk about that part. It was tedious and the creatures spotlight eye didn't even matter. If you moved at all while it was open, you were screwed. Even though I was at the very end, it killed me. And they way it kills you is boring, just roars at you and the screen goes black. [/spoiler]

The animations, as I said, were very robotic and unnatural. And very few and far between. Any time there was an animation other than talking or walking, the screen would go black or it would force you to look away. The most animation I saw was the on the only enemy in the game.

The gameplay was bland too. Instead of adding some kind of puzzle or making it more difficult, they just added new elements. SPOILER: [spoiler] After getting the rocket boots, the game is just broken. [/spoiler] They would just forget about the ones you had after you got a new one. They also put too many decorations too near the gameplay area. I cannot tell you how many things I swung towards just to find out I can't grapple to them. There was nothing to fight or run from. It was just swing to rock, land, swing to rock, land, and so on. When it introduced a new element, such as the ice level, it took way to long to tell you that that element was added. The dude would talk for like 2 minutes before telling you what happened, which caused me to die every time they added a new element (which was every 10 minutes).

The physics. They can be described as BS. You would bounce off of level surfaces and fly off the side, surfing was just you flying along a wall and then flying in a random direction. And speaking of random directions, you would get flung in random directions sometimes. It made the game very tedious.

The story would have been great, had they not messed up on so many things. There were a lot of plot holes, and random things that had no reason to exist. SPOILER: [spoiler] Like when the monster shows up, or when the rocket boots broke on a medium sized fall instead of one of the giant ones you were just doing seconds ago. [/spoiler] They were just random conflicts that were unneeded. And the ending was just so anti-climatic and terrible that I wanted to yell. It was like completing [i] The Very Hard [/i] mod for Half Life 2. SPOILER: [spoiler] Congrats, you win, here are the credits. [/spoiler] and the after-credits scene added nothing to the game. Didn't tie any loose ends, and had the generic ""I told no one cuz they wouldn't believe me"" which comes with any fictional world.

If I would have spent money on this game, I would have been angry. It was only about 2 hours long and is not worth whatever it costs. It has great potential, but was terribly executed."

6956,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!! The story is soooo good, sadly the game was short, well the story at least, i would love a second game, that expands on the story, but either way this game is a great game and also has a great ending, worth the time and wouldve paid for it if i knew what the game was about, the only bad things about this game is some world glitches, espicially in the ice caves, i could go through the ice and stuff, but anyway i recommend this game to ANYONE that enjoys a quick story :) 1000/10"
6957,"This is a good game, all you do is fly around but its fun. Geting the hang of jumping is the hardest part, but thats really the whole game. Its done fairly well, decent garphics"

6959,"Reminds me of leafy too much, would only recommend this game if you don't care about getting called a pine cone. Sadly this isn't the case for me..."

6962,"Beautiful Adventure, right in the feels, recommend this for anyone, fun game mechanics, lovely story, only thing i didn't like is it is over. Some parts can be tricky, thank you to the Creators of this game, simply amazing :)"
6963,"Gamehasnosound, could somebody check and advise? reinstalled couple times - all other games have sound , this one no."

6965,Amazin game
6966,"nice for a little 2 hour story with good first person platforming
"
6967,"This is very coplex yet simple game. It has very fun game mechanics, a straight forward story and so much more. I found that the story was a bit weird but also fun, and tthre were quite a few glitches that made the game hard to play but a quick reset  or a setting change it fixed the problem. Overall this is a very enjoyable platformer."
6968,"Good, unique, beautiful game. nice story too."
6969,"This game is a very short, but very good game, the game is actually wonderfull"
6970,"This game left me in fucking tears. Everything about it tugs on my heartstrings; the music, the story, the graphics, the gameplay mechanics. The frog people were also really hot."

Review Version 3.6.0
Learn More [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1302963276]About my review.[/url]"
6972,I am glad I got this game for free. Definetly would reccomend getting it but I feel like the current price of 12.99 is too much.
6973,"This is amazing game!

Graphics 4/5
Gameplay 4.5/5
Story 5/5

Overall: 4.5/5

One of my favorite parkour games!

(My 100% Honest Review)"
6974,Its good and has a nice story.
6975,"Thoroughly Enjoyable Game

Reminds me of what would happen if Limbo and Portal made a baby."
6976,"I loved this game, even though the voice ascting isn't the best, and the animations are a little wonkey, i loved it. it was so fun to play and the ending nearly brought me to tears. I would reccomend this game to anyone. any age. and time."
6977,bro this fred a fking beast if he passed all this parkour in 1 try i swear it took me 10 hrs to beat this sh!t
6978,9/10 Only thing wrong with the game was that all the NPCs except major ones looked like Anamatronics. Absoloutley amazing otherwise.
6979,Good game with a short but nice story
6980,"Very short game, beat in 1h40m, the story is good though and the grapple mechanics were awesome to play round with. The ending was well done and slightlly sad (as many have already said before). I dont know how they would make another game in this universe but here is to hopeing they make some other game with these meechanics."
6981,This is a good 2 hour experiece but after the story mode was over I didnt have a thrive to play the game anymore needs new content.
6982,"BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED! Worth the 3.9 hours i've played so far! Best game to take time off your hands. It is a great way to get the brain functioning as it puts many puzzles for you to solve. Can be rage enducing since that sometimes you miss jumps, but hey, what's a game without failure! Have fun gamers! (Also when I was writing this I had 3.9 hours so if it's above that's why.)"
6983,why wont my character stop spinning
6984,"Gotta admit, great game. Good concept, good controls, good mechanics. But I do spread a bit of salt with this game. The mechanics like the rocket boots or landing on a slope with a grapple, could use a bit of cleaning. Through my few hours of gameplay, I dont know how many times I would grapple, land, and then be thrown into a abyss for no apparent reason. Dosent work to well on mid end computers, from the lag I would try to grapple onto a small floating rock, and then it would lag when it loaded in the next bit and I would miss the rock entirley until about ~8 times trying and failing. Good game and story though!"
6985,The story is not so good but the gameplay is excellent
6986,Amazing game...
6987,"This game is brilliant! Gorgeous visuals, very interesting mechanics. Takes a few seconds to get the simple controls down, but the solutions to some of the levels is incredibly difficult to master. You will find yourself sometimes whipping through pieces, and other times it takes 20-30 tries just to get through. hehe... I told you, you couldn't do it!!!!!

Great game!"
6988,"AKA: ""A Story About Jumping and Falling from Great Heights"""
6989,very cool
6990,I love falling
6991,"Simple and cute story with easy to pick up mechanics. I enjoyed my playthrough, though the game is relativly short. Would recommend if it is only a couple of dollars. Note that I picked it up during the free give away."
6992,Its a great little 2 hr game
6993,Nice little two hour game. You can stretch it out if you like to be a completionist... The graphics quality is not crazy but not bad. NPCs look ugly lol. But I actually liked the game as a whole. The concept of a father telling his daughter a bedtime story and you getting to play that out is a pretty cool idea. I wish there were more of these free little story games that give you that nice sense of fulfillment at the end.
6994,"ay isnt this the game memeulous played in the back of his vids once

also 10/10 good game with really good visuals and also has some story, but its mainly a good platformer

also, free steam trading cards."
6995,"TL; DR: Good concept, poor execution. Enjoyable and bloody frustrating at the same time. 

This game has me torn:
+ Dig the concept
- Controls can be incredibly frustrating and inconsistent
+/- Voice acting is pretty poor. Yet it's not the worst
+ The environment/atmosphere can be charming
- The character models and animations are atrocious
+ Small game file (1GB) and I was able to play it for free
- Couldn't bring myself to finish the damn game

I really wanted to like this game..I really did. Definitely enjoyed parts of it but the combination of the shoddy grappling mechanics and level design prevented me from seeing this one through to the end. If you're interested I'd say give this a try (if it's free or dirt cheap) but be warned; you may smash your keyboard and/or yell expletives at your monitor as you try to navigate through the levels.

5/10"
6996,"I don't recomend the game becuse of the normal price of it. I got it when it was free for a few days, and enjoyed the 2.4 hours of gameplay I got out of it. The thing is, besides the story there isn't much to do. If this game had a workshop it would definently be a recommended. But because there isn't, and this is a 13 dollar game that you would at most get 5 hours out of becuase of the time trial mode, it's not worth the price. Also the compainion through a small bit of your journey was so bad, that when she talked I would walk away from the area if I was able to."
6997,"Honestly just a fantastic game, I almost feel bad I got it for free, because it's worth at least $10."
6998,"Fun game, short and sweet."
6999,"This game is free at the time of writing this review so take that for what it is worth. It is a super fun little game with some tricky but very solvable puzzels. However, it is very short I beat the story in about 2 hours. It sort of reminds me of the first portal game the story is very compeling and the gameplay is relaxing once you understand the mechanics. As it stands as a free game it is great if I had paid 5 bucks for it I would say still good."
7000,"I have the sudden urge, for some reason to bully kids on YouTube and be insecure about my weak chin"
7001,"Very simple gameplay and easy to pick up.  A short and fun game. Only thing I can add to this is that I wish the final unlockable was a translation (maybe mouse hover over)  of all the text translation.

And I was especially touched by the story/plot itself."
7002,"Fun and quick, a nice game to take your mind off of anything stressful"
7003,"Not bad, but the ending was a disappointment. If your ready to be triggered, while getting through these challenging levels, then this game is definitely recommended."
7004,"Really good game, I really enjoyed it and had lots of fun playing it. The Story line was really good in my opinion. I would also recommend you to play this game."
7005,"I had heard about this game a while ago, but I never thought to give it a look. Today it was free, so I decided it would'nt hurt to give it a try. I honestly didn't expect it to be this beautiful, heart warming, and emotional. Somehow I was so immersed into this beautiful world, and grew an attachment to it. It was a wonderful experience, and I recommend it to anybody that has about 3 hours of time to spare."
7006,After 3 hours and completing the game. I just need to say that i fucking loved it
7007,"this is the most boring shit ive ever played, all you do is go from rock to rock for hours"
7008,"Best Game Story Ever, well made, reccommended, also cool to parkour around in first person."
7009,Such an amazing little adventure game. Goes for about 2hours but worth every minute. The world is absolutly beautiful and the characters are great. Cant believe its free to play. 10/10
7010,"Short (beat in 4 hours). It feels about like Portal in that is an immersive puzzle solver that requires some timing and dexterity. Tons of easter eggs throughout.  I don't know if I'd play it again, but I enjoyed it."
7011,This's a nice game.You have power jump and you can run very fast
7012,"This game is great and very imersive, it has a good story but it is short. I would recomend this to everyone and it is worth the time and effort. the movement is great and very smooth. 10/10."
7013,"Impressive storyline and mechanics that still brings joy 5 years after the release
"
7014,"This game was one of the best games I've ever played. It took about 2 hours to beat it, but it was the best 2 hours spend on steam."
7015,"Awesome game, 10000% recommend + the end is epic. Enjoy playing it !"
7016,"I recomend this game 100%, its a game with fantastic story line, a little short yes, if they added more would it be better yes. but the as is is AMAZING."
7017,"Some people might like this game, but I don't. 

Good graphics and story from what i've played but it's simply not for me. I would give a 50 50 review if possible, so i'll give positive just 'cause it looks and plays well."
7018,"Pretty good game. Its graphics are nice, but its very short. 7.5/10"
7019,"Very fun to play, a great twist on adventure games. I love the story, very heartwarming. However, I wish that the story and gameplay were a little longer, but fun nonetheless, 9/10 would recommend."
7020,"An amazing game. Challenging parkour with many awe-inspiring settings and language ""puzzles"", all in one emotional adventure. I'd love to experience another story or two from you guys. It was a stunning tale and, dare I say it, Unreal."
7021,"What a quaint and delightful experience. I'm ever so glad that I got to experience this game. Despite myself having a copy for free, I would recomend purchasing this game to help the developers and publishers out as they are both caring companies respectfully. Cheers and enjoy the atmosphere and soundtrack in this platforming charm."
7022,"I have been playing it for 1 hour and so far so good! nice graphics, gameplay and adventure story"
7023,"Grappling hooks, and fun puzzles"
7024,This is a stupid game. I would rather play Mirrors Edge Catalyst over this.
7025,"This game is really fun to play. For now, I don't know the price of it I'll see if this game reallt worth the money ( I got it for free ) But it's relaxing and kinda challenging too! I didn't see any bugs yet. This game have good graphic and a cool story to tell!"
7026,"My only complaint about this game is that there isn't MORE!!!

Great story, gameplay is just challenging enough, and the characters are very memorable."
7027,its okay
7028,"Fun game, looks amazing but can be hard at times but I enjoyed it. Only 3 hours wish there could be more to be done. Not much replayability. Got it from humble bundle so i'm not complaining."
7029,"at first, I didn't think I'd like it, cause I usually don't like these kinds of games, but I saw it was free, so I thought why not. I got it, and I am loving the game so far. It can be a bit frustrating at times, especially when one of the grapple spots is a small rock, but it's easy to control, the gameplay is fun, and the world and graphics are both gorgeous. definately would get it while it's free, and even once it's not, it's totally worth the cost of it."
7030,"I say it's worth it for free but for money definetley not, as it can be repetitive and clonky"
7031,Short but very cool game. Strategic platformer with a story.
7032,"It's very short, but it's also very enjoyable."
7033,"Best story and parkour game,same like The Valley...."
7034,"[b]Wow.[b] That was...amazing.

Do not hover over the black highlight on text if you have not played the game and you don't want to find out specific things that happen in the game!

[h1]Storyline: 9/10[/h1]
The game had a rich, deep storyline. It was based around a father telling his daughter a story, and it was amazing. You can definitely tell that the creators of the game thought the storyline through, and that's very good. The storyline was not incomplete.

[h1]Graphics: 9/10[/h1]
The detailed 3D graphics added a lot to the game. The only thing I didn't like about this aspect of the game is that sometimes (not often, though) you could see the inside of parts of the land when you got too close to them. That happens with most 3D games I've played though, so it may be unavoidable in this case.

The game had many different, diverse places, each with its own type. It's very interesting to see all the different ""levels,"" and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

[h1]Gameplay: 8/10[/h1]
The gameplay is very good. There were some parts where you simply had to get through an ""obstacle course"" sort of thing, and that's what added hardness to the game. Luckily, there are frequent checkpoints (mostly) so you won't be stuck on a [i]lengthy[/i] part of the game for [i]that long.[/i] I was stuck on shorter hard parts multiple times I believe, but it didn't take that long to get quickly back to where I had died because of the checkpoints. The game definitely had a lot of those ""obstacle course"" parts, but there were enough ""storyline"" parts that it wasn't too much of a sole ""obstacle course"" game.

The controls were pretty easy to use, once you knew them. Every time a new control (such as the [spoiler]upgraded ""grapple"" (as they call it in the game)[/spoiler] or the [spoiler]jetpack boots[/spoiler]) came into play, there was clear text at the bottom of the screen explaining how to use it.

I had to look use a walkthrough multiple times, but I'm sure that if I had spent more time on it I may have figured it out. I didn't need to use a walkthrough as many times as I would have needed to if I had played a puzzle game. The only ""puzzle"" aspects of this game I would say are figuring out [i]how[/i] to get past a certain place (like when you have to [spoiler]swing off of icicles[/spoiler]). I can think of one gameplay-related thing that is implied by previous things that have occured ([spoiler]that you can't move when the eye-worm has its eye open[/spoiler]), so in a lot of cases it isn't that hard to figure out [i]what[/i] you have to do.

[h1]Music: 9/10[/h1]
The music goes well with what is currently happening in the game (for those who have played the game, one noticable occurance is when [spoiler]the music goes along with what the eye-worm is doing[/spoiler]). It's definitely well-composed music. =)

[h1]Age Rating: 8 and up*[/h1]
There is one creepy part I can think of ([spoiler]the eye-worm[/spoiler]). It's a sort of monster, and it does not attack you in a normal way, but rather causes a wind that moves you. There's no blood or gore or anything, and you don't attack the monster. There aren't any weapons in the game.

[h1]Overall Synopsis[/h1]
[b]Rating: 35/40[/b]
[b]Age Rating: 8 and up*[/b]
[b]Recommended! ‚úîÔ∏é[/b]

[i]Of course, whether a game is okay for a child [b]always[/b] depends on the child.[/i]

Thanks for reading my review! =D"
7035,"I'm just sad I picked it for free. This game was really good. Short, but really good."
7036,"uh, wheres aunt"
7037,"good game ig, thought my uncle was going to butt fuck me. basically mirror's edge except you're friends with poorly rendered frogs. cool"
7038,"Neat little parkour game. It is free as of now. Short game, predictable story, weirdo frog people. But thats not what the game is about, its the parkour: which is good nonetheless. The mechanics are nice and feel fluid, there are very few bugs if any. Relaxing experience."
7039,"Short and Sweet
"
7040,Leafy.
7041,"Solid story, don't have any major complaints. Fun gameplay."
7042,very well made game that gives a sense of free running and free falling... specifically the falling part i practiced loads and loads and loads and loads....
7043,"fANTASTIC GAME.  My only complaint is that it was quite short.  :,{"
7044,"Story is short, but great. Gameplay is great."
7045,"nice game, im glad they made it free"
7046,"Beautiful game, I love it. The only thing that could make it better would be a VR headset."
7047,I pay for this game and a few months later it becomes completely free? I want a refund.
7048,Chill game
7049,"A 3 hour game that had a touching story and some fun elements. It was frustrating at some points, especially the ice cave, and felt dragged on. Dialogue was meh but the game in general was overall not bad. Worth a free play"
7050,Its a great time to have with how the game plays and how the story goes its just a great overall time
7051,"Absolutely amazing game.
The quality of the gameplay, the beautiful story and ambience makes this game one of my best gaming experiences ever.
"
7052,"Like me, have you always been terrible at parkor in games? Are you used to dying over and over trying to make that next jump? Nothing will change with this game, but rather than raging at your fails, this game provides you with a chill atmospher that will enable you to keep trying over and over, all for progressing the story. Good stuff."
7053,"Incredible game just from my experience, has an interesting story and a really good atmosphere."
7054,"I adore this game and i haven't even finished it! the visuals are stunning and the puzzles are genius, I fully recommend this game :)"
7055,This game was a fresh breath of life. 10/10 would play again IGN my friend to the end
7056,great little game
7057,"beat it in a little over an hour, but i did enjoy it and the story wasnt too bad. i would have loved to have a more satisfying ending, but i accept what i got."
7058,Pure trash. Not worth the free download.
7059,"Great Game! The story is intresting and a great movement based gameplay

Would Love a level maker/ workshop"
7060,"Flying around with a grappling hook is pretty cool, but in A Story About My Uncle, the narrative steals the show with great voice acting.

I wasn't totally sold on the gameplay, which can get repetitive.  But if you've always wanted to play a game like this, there isn't anything else like it.  Imaginative graphics and hidden secrets will surely make for a great ride."
7061,Got it for free - Fun gameplay with charming characters and an amazing story
7062,"I had a fun and I got it for free. I was pretty short, I finished it in less than an hour and a half. Overall it was good."
7063,"A bad bug, sometimes it can't identify the keyboard except esc, spacebar and leftshift, which means I  can't play this game anymore unless  I restart it, then this bug shows up 2mins later, please fix it up."
7064,2 short
7065,"you grapple parkour and go through a epic adventure only to be sent home right as you find the person your looking for i feel as if this needs a better ending/more story to it. 


this is not me being negative just a smidge disapointed."
7066,"A Story About My Uncle : Relaxing Game, Very short and has a nice story. Currently it is free in the Steam Store, it is only 1 GB and doesn't require high end grsphic but still looks very stunning. The Game is about goeing threw what your uncle went threw until you find him, and feels like a puzzle sometimes but is pretty easy to find you way through the Lvls. Feels like Portal but has its own touch, I recommend at least giving this game a try and see how you like it. Once its complete the main menu allows to either replay the levels noramly or in a Time Trail. Personally I would like to try the Time trials, and I will.  :cozyspaceengineersc:
"
7067,Ya know... I liked this. The story was nice and it felt a bit like a good ol' movie. The gameplay was fantastic. This was a very heartwarming game to play. It's a great game to take  a couple hours of your time.
7068,"Crashed several times, gave up."
7069,Beautifull game. Thank you to the team for bringing this to life.
7070,The game is 10 out of 10. And it runs on a potato. XD
7071,"This is a wonderful tech-demo, I hope they add this grapple thing into the next Batman Arkham game! Although, the current one they have might be better as it doesn't feel so wild, inconsistent and you're not shooting it out of your nose. I thought about playing this all the way through, then realized I completed 90% of it in 2 hours and decided that it was a waste of time. The only reason I played it was because it was free.

Alas, they are pretending this is a game and I must review it with this presentation in mind as well - this is not a game. The story is nothing, written by a pseudo-intellectual who simply copy/pastes other people's better ideas and pretends they're making some ""deep philosophical statement"" when really this is Firewatch with jumping. Except Firewatch has character development. To give you an idea one of the characters who's reading off of walls literally says, ""That's when I learned to read the writing on the walls.""  üñï

The visuals are a joke, this is N64 level, actually worse because they copped out and made backgrounds just empty space. You're set inside an obviously instanced game where you're picked up and dropped from map to map with very little connection between them. You will stray too far off their linear path and have to reset back to the checkpoint. There is nothing beautiful about this game as 80% of it is open air and floating rocks. And when you do enter a tiny area with decoration it's completely separate from you, there's no interaction with the player, you're basically walking through a decorated area. Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 allows you to create your own little area to walk through, so again, this is ancient technology used poorly.

There's no wiggle room for how to play this at all, you're going to execute the exact process the developer wants you to in the exact order it's set-up in. Ignore any comment about ""exploration"", it's non-existant and if you do ""explore"" one of the clearly marked forks then you reach .... some more dialogue... there's no items or enemies so what else would happen? They're called collectibles but that's just a label because what else would you call it? Things to find? 

Which leads me to the worst thing about it, the gameplay. Once you get over the novelty of ""this hook thing + moon physics is kinda cool, wee!"" and it causes you to miss yet another grab because the little cursor didn't blink on exactly the right pixels then it sinks in that this is the entire game. ""Platformer"" has devolved into ""DHUR games where u jump on the platforms"" ... you're missing a lot if you think that's all there is to it. ""story driven"" has devolved into ""all we have is a story"" ... and if your story is trite, rehashed garbage then it's not story driven solely because it's the only thing moving you through it, technically it would be ""W button driven"". The last part of the game you get rocket boots, which is really a grapple without the need of a target. So it doesn't actually add anything.

Oh and by the way:

Revelation 16:13
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

They're not creative cute frog people. They are simply copy/pasting demons. The protagonists and the object of the game is... to help demons. ""Frogs"". 

tldr; Do not spend money on this. Sprint to Jesus ASAP, the satanists are tricking you into helping them by paying to play their terrible games. There's a reason they are known for the Goat simluator. In their religion 'the goat' is baphomet. So really, they are known for the bapohmet simulator and frog demons.... it's that obvious, people."
7072,"Interesting idea. If the grappler wasn't a little buggy the journy through the landscape would be much smoother and offer an enjoyable ride. Instead the environment is set up like puzzles, but each puzzle isn't really that much different from the last one. Portal players will not be impressed.

The story is delivered in a nice way and the atmosphere in this game is great.

Story: 8/10
Graphic: 8/10
Gameplay: 6/10

Edit: This game becomes worse as you play through it. It's the only game that I've ever played that's more frustrating than Bennet Foddys Getting Over It."
7073,"It had about 2 hours or so worth of story line, I messed around with the challenge that i had trouble with. All in all it was a great experience with a wonderful sound track"
7074,i say but this game if you like adventure and a bit of strategy
7075,I I enjoiyed it although it was very short. It has a cool enviorment but alot of loose ends :( there isnt much to lore in the game. None the less alot of fun.
7076,"Good game, Good visuals, Decent story, 7/10"
7077,Great fun but quite short game I enjoyed every minute of it and the story was great I just wished there was morecontent but I would highly reccomen if you want to play a fun casual pickup and play game a great little indie title.
7078,for a games so pretty it run suprisingly smooth on my potato pc
7079,"GOSH I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME!!
JUST ENDED IT BUT LATER PLAYED THE TIME TRIAL WHICH WAS AMAZING AF <3
GOTTA SAY IT !! WORTH IT <3"
7080,"Entertaining, relaxing, short and sweet. Great experience it was!
Loved the way the story was brought.

5/7 perfect score"
7081,"5.5/10
+ Great, smooth, addictive parkour gameplay
+ Atmosphere and world
- Mediocre/bad voice acting
- Terrible facial animations
- Terrible lighting in a section of the game.
- A very cliche scene in the game broke my immersion (bear in mind this game is like 2h)

The story is very simple, but this isn't necessarily negative, as the story is told as a bed time story. Bed time stories are simplistic, so this fits the theme. I still think they could have done more with the story, though.

I recommend this game, especially since it's free/keep it forever right now. You can finish it in an afternoon or two."
7082,      A story about my uncle is a great game and was very enjoyable. The grafics are great and I love the storyline. There are only two things first of all I wish you were able to go into 3rd person also i wish that you were able to take the translating book to translate all of the orange writting. One last thing about the game is it can be pretty hard at certian points which i really liked so great job on the game if you are seeing this developers.
7083,Pretty good story and I loved the music!!
7084,amazing story but kinda anticlimatic end and its too short
7085,This game was very awe-inspiring and heartwarming. 10/10 hands down!
7086,"A story about my uncle is a action puzzle first person platformer, its really awesome, specially the graphics and gameplay, yeah its good, straght forward, tutorial takes 5 seconds to drop you to your first challenge, story in game while you playing it, that is awesome and the reason why I love so much half life 1, its here, and still great, gameplay uses left mouse click and right mouse click, I don't even need to explain, click here, click there, and literally, it just works, the force is strong with this game, power run, power jump, power telekinesis, power wait, all that with 3 buttons, do the math this game is genius.

+amazing controls
+awesome graphics
+in game story
+avoidable tutorials

10/10"
7087,Really makes you feel like Spider-Man. Great time waster.
7088,"This game was free today, so I tried it - why not. I didn't bother looking at the screenshots or trailer, it was free, I was bored, and it had good reviews.
And that first time that I entered that underground town area... And the first time I saw the blue toad human thing...
I felt like the game really achieved what it wanted to, it told me a story about my uncle, and I was fascinated by it.
But if the game wouldn't be free, and if I took a look at it to maybe buy it, those screenshots of the underground town area and blue things would have probably destroyed much of that ""first amazing discovery joy"".
Thought that would be an interesting review to write, take it as you wish, game is great!"
7089,"If u have acrophobia, this game might be the cure lol"
7090,Play while its free
7091,"On par with Knack baby! (although Knack 2 is still far better)
Took me 2.4 hours to finish it and i enjoyed every second of it."
7092,The mechanics and story are somewhat interesting but they get kind of stale really quickly. Jumping is cool but the game never really goes anywhere past that. The game is either way too easy or way too frustrating. Often times I can easily spot the route I am supposed to take but the route requires absolute perfect work or you miss it by literally inches. This is immensely frustrating and it lead me to just drop the game midway through and watch the ending on youtube. There really isn't much benefit to playing this game firsthand.
7093,"Story was ight, not really that intersting tho just some dude telling his dying kid a bedtime story n stuff. Gameplay was what really made this game, loved the swinging n flying n shizz, the boosted jumps were cool too. The thotty blue frog girl that climbs on your back for about half the play time challenged me to a level with no grappling hooks, hate her now. Blue thing gave me a headache n stuff, no wonder everyone in her village hates her (cannon btw) great for a free game, finished in about an hour. PS your uncle really doesnt want you around kinda a dick move tbh. Nice game, ight story, gave me blue balls, 6/10 i would fall into a bottomless pit again."
7094,i had kids with my uncle
7095,Amazing game I recommend
7096,It's an amazing game though quite short.
7097,Fun little title recieved in the free weekend.
7098,good looking even on my low quality graphics settings +1
7099,Great game. It is very immersive. The story made me wanting more. The gameplay is a bit confusing at some points but you eventually figure it out. The only downside is there is very low replay value and it is very short(2-4 hours).  8/10.
7100,just finished the game. got to say i really like it good work on this one.
7101,"Good platforming, 8/10, though it was a tad floaty.

[i]This review was posted by the Mannpower Gang.[/i]"
7102,"Good for a game to lose yourself for 2 hours, fun mechanics although very frustrating at times. Story is just...there, Uncle Fred is a massive dick and the other characters are so 1 dimensional it's hilarious. Would recommend if you can get it cheap or free."
7103,"Played a couple hours on it, and while I understand the mechanics, and the story seems alright... I don't like the how difficult some of the jumps are, combined with the fact that the grappling beam doesn't reliably lock on to an object when flying through the air,  even when right NEXT to it... resulting in dozens if not hundreds of tries for some jumps... I write this review after one particularly troublesome area where there is not even a checkpoint after doing some of these... resulting in tedious tedious try try again."
7104,amazingly fun
7105,holy SHIT THIS IS GOOD
7106,ye
7107,Ok story and levels. I reccomend this game ;)
7108,Currently free until 14/1/2019
7109,"This is such a charming little game I enjoyed almost every minute of it (except the ones where the grappling decided to randomly not work >:( ). The atmosphere is really on the spot, seriously reminds me of a kids tale (as I believe it is supposed to be) with it's goofy looking characters and polished, cartoon like graphics.

The story doesn't seem like it holds much at first, but if you pay attention to a few detailes on certain levels, you may discover that there's a dark reality lying underneath.

And the gameplay is relaxing, yet challenging. You can feel like spiderman, except cooler. Not much else to say.

Overall, I got this for free, but I honestly wouldn't have minded if I had to pay for it. It's worth those ~3 hours of your life."
7110,"Fun, cute, 3D platformer. 

Ice Cave made me want to gouge my eyes out but other than that a blast."
7111,"Got this game for free in the giveaway. It's a pretty fun platformer, although the story is less than spectacular. I haven't found many of the collectables that are supposed to reveal story, but a game shouldn't require that to have a good experience anyway. 

Gameplay:
Fun, grappling hook-based platforming. Later on you also get a rocket boost which feels really cool to use. My main gripe is how the distance you can grapple objects from seemed to vary greatly in certain areas, and sometimes it felt like I couldn't grapple surfaces that appeared the same as other ""grapple-able"" surfaces.
One odd addition is that there's one ""boss fight"" in the game, but it happens in the first half. I feel like there was a missed opportunity for a fast-paced grappling hook chase or something.


Story:
Kinda interesting, but the ending pretty much just says ""You remember that big adventure you went on? It was for nothing."" There's no real closure, even if you wait after the credits *hint hint*. Only three real characters are introduced, and neither of them are given any real development with one exception being your daughter.

Presentation:
The setup is that you're telling your daughter about an adventure to had to find your uncle Fred as a bedtime story. It's done decently, with the voice acting being okay, if a bit unconvincing. The script is quite good, and natural, but the emotion in the voices don't match what's being said a lot of the time. Overall, it's a nice addition to have the narration periodically, and it adds a bit more character to the whole thing.

Worth it?
No. Not at 17 dollars. The story is less than 3 hours and you'll most likely not want to spend hours looking for collectables, but if that's your thing then it adds value. I would say if you plan on playing it through once, 5-8$ is a fair price, and for collectors out there you might want to wait for 10$. There's time trials but again, not everyone's cup of tea (especially since it's just the 5 chapters again with time limits).
"
7112,Loved the game.... took around 4-5 hrs to finish. 5 stars for story and concept.
7113,"I got this game for free off Humble Bundle but I have to say this is one of my favourite parkour, adventure games. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys parkour games."
7114,the story of this game is unbelieveable deep. just buy it ! its worth √≠t!!!
7115,"warm adventure, reminds portal"
7116,great storyline and generally great game for chilling
7117,Got as far as the whole room coming apart then the difficulty sky rocketed and it stopped being a relaxing exploration. can't knock it for the price though
7118,"fun but short
like
really short"
7119,yuHHuhhH
7120,"So cool game,Sometimes can frustrate you but so good for chill,Game have nice parkour and so good for chill,Perfection game"
7121,Controls handle great. Controller support. Graphics options work well. Fun game kept me entertained.
7122,this game is amazing i hope there are some good updates to this in the future this game is amazing
7123,"Just wanted to give a quick warning to anyone considering buying/downloading this game.

Unfortunately I experienced really intense motion sickness while playing and therefore cannot play this one.  I'm not sure if this will effect others who have this tendency, but thought it might be helpful to let you know."
7124,"Well i like it for aesthetic concept and the badges 
well that's it

+pros 
responsive controls 
gameplay 
THE ENVIRONMENT

-Cons
its short

overall Its a small game but you feel like its a big game where the story is simple the gameplay is quite easy to understand but very fun. you will get loss on the levels on how amazing they made the game 
"
7125,The story plot is amazing.
7126,"Corto pero muy buen juego. La historia no es del otro mundo pero esta bastante bien. La jugabilidad es lo destacable, al estilo parkour y plataforma con una sensacion de libertad y de no ser tan lineal (aunque lo sea). Por otro lado el arte y dise√±o de los lguares es hermoso. 8/10"
7127,Really good little game. I had a few random issues with hitting invisible walls but over all they've done a really good job with both the game play and the story. Would definitely recommend giving it a go!

I can't say the best scenario I've ever seen in my life, but there's a nice script that's not a game scenario.

+ Scenario is very nice for this type of game

- In some places, you're looking for a place where you can take a half an hour (I'm stuck for 13 minutes).

* I took the game free of charge and I loved it if it was probably not free and I wouldn't even hear a name if I didn't see new ones
* Endless thanks to the author of the script of this game from here, let us put down to the amble of Maddie"
7129,VARY NICE
7130,This game is a great fun to game to paly casually its pretty relaxing and i feel like all the people giving it negative reviews are people who are salty because their losing after the game gets progressively harder and gets slightely more challenging which is how it should be the stroy is minimalistic which works great for a game like this its a short game but i think its a great game anyway
7131,"A relaxing game, plus,if you play it with music its perfect.
Interesting lore.
Envolving Levels.
Astonishing Mecanics and Movement.
9/11 Would tell A Story About My Uncle Again.
"
7132,Thanks to our uncle
7133,"Very nice game after all but also a very short one.Overall great story and very good gameplay with art stylle.
I realy recommend it for anyone even if you dont like fp platformers. :) Great Game !"
7134,Great game to play for free. It is relaxing like Csgo surfing but has a calm story to make you feel really immersed in the game. Recomend to download for free but otherwise no. Took me 4.7 hours to play it from start to finish which definatly isn't a record lol.
7135,"About 2h in and i got to say, I've never felt more like Spiderman!!

Impressions: 
* The gameplay is solid.
* The story is meh (but the narator is quite good)."
7136,"Whoever wrote the dialogue for the game is absolutely terrible... I have the suspicion that their native language isn't English?  They use words you wouldn't use when telling a story to a child, the style and word choices are just bad like it didn't matter who they chose to author it.
The mechanics of the game are fun most of the time... you feel frustrated immediately when you discover that your grappling hook will draw you all the way up close to whatever you grapple and it's not that easy to know in which direction you'll be flung when you disconnect.
if the game is a couple bucks buy it but otherwise not so much."
7137,very interesting game. only given it 10mins so far but its nice. not bad for free. i recommend this for someone after a good story and no pew pewing.
7138,Amazing
7139,totally was expecting this to be about how someone's uncle took their anal virginity but this is pretty good aswell
7140,"Short, Simple, with amazing level landscapes~"
7141,It's the blue people from Avatar: The Last Airbender!
7142,10/10 play it you wont be dissapointed one of the best platformers ive played
7143,"Free and I can tell I'll be enjoying it....theres something SERIOUSLY wrong here......This game mines ETH with players brainwaves, you have been warned."
7144,"The mechanics are a really good concept, however they are ruined because a lot of the time you'll be fighting colliders and awkward physics.
The story, which you might expect to be captivating or consisting of more than 20 lines of dialoge in total, is about as interesting as watching the traffic lights change in a small town intersection."
7145,"9/10 very good game! Love the controls the feeling of speed and of course the enviroments+graphics(i played on 4K though).
It doesn't have a complex story and the voices are fairly good and not annoying BUT 9/10 cause its short (but thats what you expect when its free at least when i got it).
"
7146,"One of the best story and platform games I've played. If you didn't play it you MUST check it out! Especially now that it's free.
Just make sure you get it before the  14th."
7147,"Game was great fun! I enjoyed every second. Good storyline and gameplay. Although I completed it in 2 hours I would definitely recommend it! I rate it a solid 8.5/10. This is because of the shortness I would like it if they added a feature if you could revisit your uncle, however I'm happy! :)"
7148,"90 Minutes In:
I have seen this game in videos and was interested in it. I downloaded it and played it for an hour and a half straight. If anyone was thinking of getting this game, I'd get it, it is worth it.
- Interesting Plot
- Fun gameplay
- Consuming Gameplay
- Few to no bugs.

(Only Cons. are the 'cutscenes' slows down gameplay if you just want to play.)
[First time ever playing/seeing this game in full.]

Finished Game:
This game is very easy to lose track of time while playing, I completed it in two sittings.
The story is well written, and hooks you in and pulls you into the story.
The game is full of action, and suspense. It's very action filled but the only real 'enemy' is the world and the environment.

The game runs great on high graphics, 60 frames consistently.
The environment and music are amazing, and no matter where you stop and listen, it all blends together.
The game is challenging but easy, puzzle game, but very simple.

The story is well written and expertly carried out.
The story is suspenseful and keeps you in wonder and awe through each episode.
In the beginning, you're at wonder if the game is worth play, but once you get into it is almost impossible to put down. By the end, you're in shock, and thankful that the ending isn't a cliffhanger.

9/10
""NPC's"" walk speed is slower than ours.
""NPC's"" actions look a little weird
One or two graphical glitches, that I noticed, throughout the game. (Simple clipping error, being able to see through part of the environment.

2 Hours+ of gameplay"
7149,"Great short story game! Took me just under two hours to complete. I love the little collectables that you can find on each level that will allow extra features during your play. Only one part I got stuck on where it didnt really tell you what you were supposed to do. The ice mountain caveren with all the floating boxes, just use your grapple beam on the pile of crystals on the other side. That will trigger the story to move on. Story is nice and good to keep you invested in the little things happening. I do wish that in the end there was a mention about the collectables and what it was they were doing exactly but other than that I think the story and game is fantastic for a small team. Great job guys!"
7150,"Incredible game. I received this game for free and I don't know how much it costs normally but I'd easily pay $10 for this game. It's VERY short which is the only downside in my opinion. The movement feels so good and the mechanics make traversing the different areas feel fluid and intuitive. The story is nothing to scoff at either, though the voice acting isn't five-star."
7151,This should be called: a story about my boredom playing this game.
7152,"Don't let the trailer fool you A Story About My Uncle is a painfully linear and uninspired game.  It was as if the devs put nearly all of the work into the first segment of the game to distract you until you hit the 2 hour refund timer.  Right now it is on sale for free, and thats the most I'd ever pay for it."
7153,"I rate this game 10/10 I liked the story, the gameplay was smooth, and it was easy to get a grip on. Definetly for people who like games that have a parkour esque gameplay style and for those who like a simple but sweet narrative."
7154,"THIS WAS AN AMAZING ADVENTURE !..
NEVER PLAYED ANY GAME LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE!
... WORDS CANT DESCRIBE WHAT I AM FEELING...

THANK YOU GUYS!"
7155,fun and whimsical
7156,"it is quite short, but if you want achievements you might have to play more, it is free as of writing"
7157,Great Game. It is Very weird at times but that is what makes it unique.
7158,Its a very good game =) Was fun to play!
7159,"This is an amazing game 10/10 would go to another dimension again
"
7160,Frog. People.
7161,"very fun and addictin, even if i have a smol amount of time, it is very bueno"
7162,"i bought this game for cheap during a sale a few years back and i was suprised by how good this game was. kinda short but replayable. 

7.9/10"
7163,"A nice game with a  neat story. Its a new type of jump and run that i haven¬¥t seen before, which works out really good. All in all it is not a long game (about 2 hours) but definetly worth picking up, as its free now."
7164,"Awesome game, immersive plot. 10/10 recommend!"
7165,"Thanks to the devs for making the game free, otherwise i probably would have never played it, the gameplay takes about 2 hours and that's about it,you might get done faster but i got stuck at some parts because i didn't really know which way to go, i really enjoyed it, go play it yourself :D"
7166,"This game is free at the time of writing this, and I can say that It's a pretty well done game. It has a strong storyline and meaning, definetly would recommend."

7168,Very fluid and rewarding with a great story!
7169,"Wonderful game
The athmosphere is really good and the world looks soooo beautiful
also the voicelines are fantastic :)"
7170,AWESOME !! really good story ..
7171,"Got it for free , but honestly , if i knew it was this fun , probably wouldnt spare my money . 10/10 fun and well working game with compeling story ."
7172,a e s t h e t i c
7173,"Short as it is, simple as it is, flawed yet still perfect as it is .. Made me cry manly tears. Will replay it for achievements in the future."
7174,Get it while it's still free!
7175,"I love these kinds of indie games and this is a perfect example of how to make them. 

10/10"
7176,"wow, what a completely infuriating game.

Platforms edges will let you fall through them.   It won't register the jump button when you press it, making you miss jumps constantly.  There seem to be spots where you need to do the running leap boost but the platform you're jumping to will be completely over shot making you miss.  If you try to do a high jump and get there, you'll not make it...all the while the game is taunting you because of a ""no grapple"" challenge.  Fucking frustrating.

It was free and I'm still skeptical of recommending it."
7177,Story and gameplay ist amazing. Awesome game!
7178,"Was free on humble bundle, but saw this game somewhere before i got it and wanted to play it. Now i did it. what can I say about it? Well, 10/10 would recommend to get this game. I kinda had the same feelings in the end as when i played/completed Journey."
7179,"This game is really good, the music for the game is nice, the story is great, and the mecanics for the game are fun to play around. 10/10 IGN score"
7180,"Wonderfull story and a beautiful game, but came be completed in 2 hours or maybe less."
7181,Fun parkour game with enough story to keep it interesting. Fairly short but worth if you can catch it on sale. Took me about 4 hours to complete
7182,"this game reminds me of those cool adventure games i use to sit back and relax to play on my PS2. i especially love the great platforming involved and level design. although it doesnt have the great visuals, you can look beyond that once you hear the imersive story it offers with its child like fantisies of flying through the air and swinging like spiderman."
7183,"Fun story, cool mechanics, and nice progression. Well done. (Plus, it was free)"
7184,Relaxing gameplay. Its fun game just to sit down and enjoy.
7185,"Good Game
Good Storyline
Bad Desision on making it free
Brought it, now you are free?
Can I get a refund? IT IS UNFAIR!"
7186,"so far this game is really great, love the gameplay and the story"
7187,"A very intriguing first-person platformer.
The visuals are great and very scenic at some points. The gameplay is pretty good; the controls are straightforward and nothing is too cluncky (including the physics). The story is very mysterious and inviting. The only downside is the length of the game; it's not as long as I anticipated, but you still have a blst playing the game."

7189,"One of the best 2.2hrs spent on a game in a while. It's not the graphics, but the the storyline that mesmerize you and you feel addicted to the game, to know what happens next in the nephiew's story. I highly recommend this game. The only negative thing i find is that it was so short, would love to see something similar but a bit longer from a storyline perspective."
7190,Beautiful Game...Frustrating sometimes tho but Overall Awesome
7191,very cool game and its even for free :D
7192,First of all really aweasome game! Second i wish this game will be in VR! It will be amazing. Off course game have BUG with maps but game look's really asome.Recommend that :)
7193,fun
7194,Its a really nice game. The story telling and the gameplay are both nice. Its a platformer that brings you feels in the end
7195,"Great game, but way too short.
I want more :)"
7196,"very good, and u can run this game on almost any pc you want

7/10
-short and the ending was boring"
7197,"I hated that you're forced to go home at the end and you can't just jump off to the abyss... And also, are we going to talk about that psycho uncle that made children with garbage frog people?

But seriously, nice little platforming game, gets a bit repetitive sometimes. But for free, it's an amzing gift :)"
7198,":O I finished the game ! ! ! Nice Story . I love this game , go we got a part 2 coming soon ?"
7199,"I bought this game like a week ago, wtf
(It's free now, so I encurage you to take it, but man, fuck whoever is responsible for this.)"
7200,"this game is not like the others. 
-the story is unique (u will understand why people spend less time for this game when u play it and see the title again) 
-the gameplay is unique(grappling, normal/high jump, long jump, rocket boost). 

someone frustated about the gameplay, but im not. how do u call a game if there is no challenge and you can finishing it so easily? unless if its a visual novel (like ""life is strange"" etc).

"
7201,lmao heck yeah
7202,great game
7203,really cool
7204,This game is an adventure/parkour simulation. Even though i dont like parkour this game managed to combine both adventure and parkour with the absolutely stuning grafics and story. This is totally  worth both your money and your 4 hours till its end. I would really hope for a part 2 maybe....
7205,"Really fun, a great way to spend some time"
7206,"beautiful game. not extraordinary, but worth playing."
7207,"I picked this game up for free at humble bundle. I knew about it when it came out and thought it looked interesting but kinda forget about it.

This game is a puzzle platformer type thing, with a narrative. You are a guy looking for his uncle while traversing an area with his powered suit with which he can swing around using a grappling hook.
The gameplay is fun, most puzzles are interesting. 
The games looks stunning, with 3 different main areas which all look very good. And fun to swing around in. 
The story isn't that good. It's not bad either, just I didn't find it that interesting. Luckily the gameplay salavages a lot.

Two things that I didn't like are; quite a bit of glitches where I clipped through walls and stuff, this made some of the puzzles a bit frustrating. There is also a random huge spike in difficulty at some point. One puzzle that is super hard compared to the rest. I didn't really enjoy that puzzle because it felt random, there was not really a case of finding the solution, more like swinging around like an idiot hoping you get lucky.
Finally, the game is very short. I let it run for 1.5 hours for food, so the length is about 4h. There isn't that much replayability either. 
For free, this game is absolutely worth a try. I am not sure how much it usually costs but I would pay about $7.50 for it, maybe $10."
7208,Thanks to both Steam and Humble Bundle for giving away this for free.
7209,Pretty Short two hour narrative driven parkour game with really fun platforming. 8/10
7210,"fun and relaxing platformer ....
cool soundtrack !"
7211,very cool game
7212,"Marvellous gameplay, interesting story, gorgeous landscapes and intuitive level design. What¬¥s not like?
While the experience is a bit on the shorter side, it¬¥s still a very unique game. Jumping truly feels like ""jumping"" here.
9/10
"
7213,"Very colorful world and pretty places. I loved the magical story (reminded me of the movie ""UP"") and the Mirror's edge/Portal like puzzles. You should try this gem.
(Big props to the devs for the silky smooth gameplay and the Unreal Engine. I finished the game without any lag or control annoyances)"
7214,"Ok idea horriblee controls, you never know how long your grappling hook will reach wich leads to simple deaths, repetetative and the story is at best mediocre"
7215,game and world look beautiful
7216,Brilliant game
7217,"Deffinately a good game! Very good base for upgrade. I wish to have more hints where to go (no idea where to go in the village). Very bright colors. Sense of scale - very immersive!
P.S. I'm a huge fan of the jumping puzzles in ""Guild wars 2"" and this game is exactly for me :)
P.S I received this product for free, but not as a review gift or something, but only as ""Install now for free, keep it forever"" on the main page of Steam."
7218,"good game but all you do is to jump.
thanks for the giveaway though"
7219,Amazing game!
7220,tbh this should have been freet to play a while ago. disappointed that i bought it like a week ago but i dont regret it. definitely worth the download especially since its free as of now. great story 10/10
7221,"This game is a mixture of Indie and Platform in first person, without violence but with an interesting history. The story though interesting is a bit short.
Gameplay is very good, the game brings us a special suit in which one can use a grab hook and jump high.
The graphics are pretty colorful, but I caught some bugs during my playing time.

MY VOTE
58/100"
7222,Free on Humble Bundle & Steam Store!
7223,Very fun and free for the next 2 days:)
7224,So I got a free game key for this and I tried it out. Immediate addiction to its well created controls and beautiful looks. I feel more people should tried this and more influental people in the YouTube community should give it a shot. It reserves a higher respect and I will definately play this when I can.
7225,Great game
7226,"I spent money on this. And now like 2 days later it's free


Edit: Yes I know I can refund the game. But that takes at least a day and the copies will probably not be there by the time that happens. It was on the front page of steam..."
7227,"A relatively short platformer with a nice story. I finished the game without searching for all secrets or doing all achievements in just short of 3 hours. It's not hard but not too easy either and the movement mechanics are fun. The charming story is told through characters talking ingame as well as as a narrator (the father telling his daughter a bedtime story). It's definitely worth downloading now that it's free at the moment, I personally wouldn't have bought it for the full price of 13 bucks but if you don't mind not getting much time playing out of it, it might be worth it."
7228,"Really nice game! Great work devs! I really enjoyed the game, nice graphics and a great story. The game is not really a challenge to finish it but it's really nice polished and I recomend it!"
7229,I think the design of this game is supposed to be relaxing adventure where you parkour around to progress the story but I found many parts of it very frustrating.  Primarily the grappling hook randomly decides not to deploy so you fall to your death and you have to keep redoing the same area.  The range at which it shoots out is pretty random and sometimes the targetting just doesn't light up and it wont deploy.  The story isnt bad but is pretty limited.  The graphics style is nice but you can't really leave the main path much and there isnt much to go look at anyway.  You can wander around the towns but there is nothing to do and you pass a hundred NPCs that wont talk to you or even notice that you are there.  The ending is very dissappointing.  I got it for free and spent a lazy day on it coming and going from it as I did other things but  I would have been upset if I paid anything for it.
7230,muito top
7231,"Its a run and jump platformer in first person view with a nice narative, fun and relaxing. Nice visuals on the eye, not jaw dropping, Game overall works well"
7232,nice ;')
7233,"Pretty good.
would of liked a longer storyline."
7234,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7235,"Good looking and challening game, one of my favourite games right now. Really enjoyed it and I hope I will enjoy completing achievments too!"
7236,A Story About My Uncle is an excellent 3D platformer with a charming storyline.

7239,"2,5/5"
7240,"Great game, deffinetly next part needed :)"
7241,"I really enjoyed it, excellent story & premise.
In terms of gameplay it's a mix of spiderman, parkour & cave spelunking.
Some parts you may become confused with at first, but there's a solution to every part.
I got the game for free but would have bought it for the story & gameplay. :)"
7242,"This game felt so very sweet, but also challenging at times. I really enjoyed it, but I'm not very good when it comes to reviews. 
Lovely story
Intriguing mechanics
Difficult enough, but not frustratingly difficult
Stunning graphics!"
7243,1 part of the game is broken (the one with the ice and shards) and the ending makes me want to punch uncle pete in the face for real all of that work just for that... but if you just want to play 1 hour of jumping and swinging and some story then buy it but you 100% will regret buying it... i got it for free and im mad i played it....
7244,pretty cool idea tbf
7245,pretty gud
7246,This game is extremly immersive and the gameplay will have you wanting more. The only con to this game is that the gameplay is very short and it definetly has replay value and I hundred  percent recommend this game for a fun adventure game.

7251,"Good little game for a few hours of fun. The mechanics are really cool, but can be a bit glitchy at certain moments."
7252,"Around 2 hours of gameplay, but i highly reccommend you get this game, very immersive and cute game"
7253,prolly the best game ive received for free on humble
7254,Really enjoyed that game and thanks to Humblebundle for the game :3

7263,I haven't cried so much since second grade... And I'm 20...
7264,"I wanted to try this game for years, and now that Humble gave it away for free, I finally got to play it - and I was underwhelmed to say the least. I'll try to detail why.

It's not a terrible game, by any means, but it's just so...mediocre? I feel bad downvoting a game I received for free, but I try to review honestly and the game just was mediocre. I wish I could give a neutral review, but Steam still doesn't allow that.

First of all, it is a terribly short game with an uninteresting story. It tries to be deep and emotional, and I am sure there's a hidden meaning, but the game does a rather bad job at conveying it. The entirety of the game will take you about 3 hours, give or take. It would be way faster if not for the annoying controls. 

The story goes like this: you tell your daughter a bedtime story about how your uncle went missing when you were a kid, so you went to look for him in his house and got teleported/launched(?) to...somewhere? Another world? The game never clarifies where this ""world"" is, it could be another planet, underground, in the sky. Maybe it's just a dream? The game never touches on that - you're just there and that's that, deal with it. In your uncle's house, you find a cool suit that you put on before you get launched away. With it you can jump and also grapple.

That is what you'll be doing all throughout the game - jump and grapple throughout 5 different levels, all about 30 minutes long. I'd be fine with this as a general game mechanic, but the problem is that it is terribly inconsistent. While not the worst controls ever, there is much to be annoyed with, a small pile of grievances.

First of all, you have two main ""jump moves"": High jump and long jump. High Jump is fine, doesn't cover much distance, but you can adjust your distance while you jump, which feels intuitive. However, you can [b]not[/b] do that for the long jump; once you jump, you're locked in, which makes some jumps way too precise and many will end with you falling off the platforms.

The grapple is a whole other problem. There is sadly no real sense of speed in this game, despite the description claiming otherwise. Many times you won't grapple as fast as you think you will, and then fall. Or you think you're in range to grapple a platform, but then you can't and fall. The main problem with the grapple, however, is that it isn't really a [i]grapple[/i], like you'd know it from other games, but more of a mixture between a rope used to cover a gap (other games would use vines or similar for that; you've seen it plenty of times, I'm sure) and a grappling hook used to close up to objects. 

What that means is that, whenever you try to grapple to a floating rock to get to the platform on the other side, you will try to swing under it; but at the same time you will rapidly close into the rock and smash into it, leading to you awkwardly trying to let go mid flight to barely scrape past it. It's clunky, unintuitive and it happens SO often since you have to do that exact thing dozens of times each level. The game isn't [b]hard[/b] by any means; just frustrating, thanks to the level design and controls. And then sometimes it just works, for no real reason.

What you're left with is just a mediocre experience. Controls that sometimes work, level sections that are sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating (partly due to controls, partly due to level design) and a mediocre story with a rather bad, unfulfilling ending. I get that this game doesn't try to be anything big, but even in it's small scope, I feel like it could've done so much better. 

However, I played way worse and, aside from a few frustrations, you can get to the end just fine. Some sections are fun. For free or on sale it's an okay way to spend a few hours, but I still find it hard to recommend it. 

I give it a personal rating of 4.5/10.

Edit: due to some stupid comments I turned them off entirely. You are free to discuss my opinion (yes, it is just an opinion and not fact) about the game with me, but if the entirety of the comment section consists of ""git gud lol"", I don't see much room for discussion. Maybe I suck, but this is just my opinion of a game that is not all bad and has plenty of good reviews as well. If you want to discuss it with me, you are free to message me; I would welcome it! Thank you very much :w:"
7265,"I like this game. it is short, but it is also quite fun. it has likable characters aswell"
7266,"The story is great its immersive, and i loved the characters.
"
7267,it`s too short make it longer
7268,"This game is about a crazy adventure the main protagonist had when he was young being described as a bedtime story for his daughter many years after it occured. He speaks about how he met a really good friend Maggie and how they went out to find the Uncle of the main character. Having you able to live the journey he managed to do in order to actualy meet his Uncle, makes you create a bond with this game, rather pleasent, with an amazing soundtrack, magnificent background and challenging gameplay to the point where you don't get sick and tired of it, but it maintains the exhitment from the beggining till the very end. 

I had this game gifted to me, and lets be honest its more worth it getting it cracked is a singleplayer game, but if i had ever bought this game i would NOT regret my money.

Environment: 5/5
Storyline: 4/5 (you might find it a bit boring, i didn't.)
Soundtrack: 5/5 
Overral Rating: 4.5/5 

I would recommend you buy this game with your eyes closed."
7269,"Got the game for free on Humble Bundle (deal lasts until 16 or 18.01.18). It's very atmospheric and relaxed. Played for about half an hour so far, but it's leaving a good impression so far."
7270,A dozen frustrating falls are easily outclassed by one exhilarating jump. Well worth my time (free through Humble Bundle).

He fucks you"

cool story
unique Environment
nice movement

7285,Wow...I feel empty inside after finishing it. I miss Maddie
7286,"This game's not worth 13 bucks when all you do is jump for 2 hours from point A to point B in an empty, desolate world using two clunky abilities that are not consistent.

For example: you have no air control, the super jump fails to go off sometimes leaving you to plummet to your doom, the hook randomly decides not to work and its reach changes pending on what object you're trying to attach it to. In poorly lit areas, it tends to be difficult to even find your path as it's either obscured or it simply blends in with the background.

If you like what you see, feel free to get it, but keep in mind that's all there is to it."
7287,"I  recomend the game. The gameplay is really cool, but the game is really short. I finished it in 3 hours! :)"

7290,skip
7291,"I like this game. The graphic is pretty, the story is good, the music helps to create a good atmosphere and I especially like the characters voices, they are so comforting. Usually I'm not good with platformers, but I will fight through it, because I'm curious about the ending."
7292,Fun or something idk
7293,"Yet another frustrated game, it should be a fun relaxing game, but since movement is very buggy, often you wont be able to grapple even if you are very close to the stone, and the pointer glows, but it wont let you grapple and you fall in the abbys. I got so frustrated to the point that i wanted to brake my mouse and a keyboard."

It was really fun flying through the skies and doing hundreds of little parkours. i really liked the game but i felt like the story was too short. it was only an hour and a half of story, if it was more i wouldve gave this game a 10 out of 10.

7306,"In this game you play through a bedtime story about your uncle's adventures as you swing and parkour through caves and underground villages. The mechanics are simple yet fun and refresh from time to time keeping it new. The game is short enough that it doesn't get stale but long enough that it doesn't feel too fast.

The voice acting is not perfect, but it gives it a very wholesome feel.

The selling feature of this game is the fantastic world design. You can tell that a lot of effort has been put into the scenery of this game. Being so short the story has little time to be told but the beautiful world around you tells more than could ever be done with words. 

Maybe it's not worth the ¬£9.99 it's listed since it is short but on sale it's a good grab and defnitley worth a shot"

Spoiler Alert Ending Theory

[spoiler]Just wanted to post my take on the ending. Fred was known to be able to climb mountains at the age of 52. Theres a newspaper on the wall in the epilogue that says that.

Fred probably died during a climbing accident by falling into a crevice or similar. His body has never been found (hence the memorial). 

The story is the story the kid made up in his head to imagine how his uncle could have survived, he viewed him as a genius (he was expert in quantum physics as a wall says), and imagined that in his ice tomb he survived with a mystical travel device, that he was living with happy and nice creatures in a small paradise inside the mountains... He imagined himself traveling in that world. just like his uncle did, to find him again, but, in the end, lose him forever (admit his death).

That's why you don't get to open the locker in the end, and there is no launch pad. That story never happened. 

That's also why the glowing message in the final ice room before you quit your uncle is translated ""Acceptance"".

Other secret words, once translated say ""Denial"" (portal) and in caverns ""Anger"". These are the common steps when you are in mourning (in psychology: shock -> denial -> culpability -> anger -> sadness -> acceptance[/spoiler]"
7313,Great story! took about 2 hours to beat.
7314,This was a short but an amazing experience.
7315,Great Experience!
7316,I thought about downloading this game as i do not really play these games often. It would have been a mistake if i didn't download. I absolutely loved the game and the story and the style of playing. I wish it was longer but it was also very good considering the story. Love the game !!!
7317,Short and sweet game. Awesome platforming and a nice story. Highly recommend
7318,"Free on Humble Bunde!!

To anyone who is reading this in the near future, This game was AMAZING to play and i had so much fun completing it it brought me so much joy in the span of 3 and a half hours. this game was so worth playing. I'm really impressed with this game! 

its a solid 9.5/10 I hope you guys will enjoy it as much as i did!
"
7319,"Slightly short, but fun experience."
7320,This is a great game with fun mechanics and a good story.  Absolutely would recommend.
7321,Fun game ...bit quick (hours of gameplay wise) but then again i didnt do the secrets.
7322,Really fun game to play time to time.
7323,"[h1]Great Game [/h1].
Short and Sweet. just challenging enpough in some areas to warrant a second playthrough to unlock all the achievements. Could defenitely see speed runs becoming a part of this game, with the freedom of movement options through most levels."
7324,"Hist√≥ria curta, porem muito boa"
7325,IS GUT.
7326,"A Story About My Uncle is a cute first-person game, that isn't much of a game but a movie that's interactive. It's linear with some story pieces hidden here and there, but still fun to play none the less. I completed the main story in 3 hours, and don't feel the need to come back to it. 

if you'd like to see the playthrough, it's currently a VOD (as of 11 Jan. 2019) on my twitch channel which has the same handle as my steam acc. /mlgdave_ 
I do recommend it as it is free right now on Humble Bundle, and it doesn't hurt to claim it, unless you're just not interested. I find even though I got it for free, it would be worth the $13 it cost."
7327,"You're always trying to get from one platform to another using your grapple and jumping techniques. If you fail, you fall into a bottomless pit and respawn. There has not been the slightest change to that formula at all in the first hours. The jumping and flying around is also not very fun because the controls suck.
You never know how far your grapple reaches, never know how far or high you can jump. So you are forced to repeat the same parts over and over again."
7328,"Great game, pretty short, but worth the play.  Graphics are ok, but the world is pretty cool,immersive, and relaxing. The controls are easy to get  under control.  I'm not sure that I would pay full price for it just due to the length."
7329,"probably the best story game i have ever seen























other than half life"
7330,best parkour game ever totaly worth the price. wish it was longer
7331,humble bundle for free. dont know if its work 12$. but its good for a short game
7332,"This game is wow..... i don't have anything to say the environment and the story, just wow i'm just sad it was to short but this game is very good"
7333,Amazing game.
7334,"i played this game for 2 hours straight just to see some man saying see you later, wow 10/10 would fuck ur momma again :D"
7335,"A Story About My Uncle 

Id say that this game was satisfying to play, good soundtrack with decent story and a good 2-4 h spent. 
My only critic against getting this would be that the story as mentioned is a bit short and the difficulty a bit dull."
7336,Poorman's version of spiderman
7337,"A nice story about the boy's uncle, gameplay wise, its fun. I would say give this a try, if you enjoy FPS Portal like games. 10/10"
7338,"It's a great game, with a very nice story and cool gameplay! So fun to play and very relaxing. Thx HumbleBundle!"
7339,"Just absolutely beautiful.
Great adventure, loved it!"
7340,"Very good game. If you love platform games, give it a chance. The story got me in the night, i just didn't want to turn off the computer and play it another, that's how beautiful the game was. Ending was one of the best i've seen. Characters were well made.
Looking for a Platform game? Go for it! You'll not regret!
(Got it from Humble Bundle for free, if i'd never got this, i will never enjoy a game like this)"
7341,"I've seen youtubers use this game as a background for their videos, and I wasn't aware of the name of the game. Today I found it on humblebundle for free, and it only took me 100 min to complete it, not very replayable but I enjoyed it! The character models kinda fell into the ""uncanny"" valley for me though, I couldn't stop zooming into their faces lol."
7342,This game is so fun.  Just swinging around from place to place is amazing.
7343,"Good game just wish there was more, like community maps and stuff. i think this games system would work great for a FP spiderman game! the swinging mechanics can be annoying at times, when the game wants you to swing but the mechanics want to pull you to the spot. otherwise good game."
7344,"Even for a free game, I was a little underwhelmed.

Alright, let's start with the positives.
-The grappling mechanics aren't unique, but they do give the player a sense of movement and enjoyment.
-The story was nice, and even though it was short, I still enjoyed the environment it made.
-Very little performance issues, if at all.

But the negatives outweigh the positives for me.
-The characters, apart from Maddie, are all very forgettable. I couldn't even tell you the names of the two characters you meet for like, 20 seconds and only have 2 lines each. 
-The length of the game is unbelievably short. I beat it in two hours, and 15 minutes of that was probably in a challenge that I didn't even have to do.
-Some mechanics in the game aren't explicitly pointed out, and they're required to beat certain parts. Plus, if you need a refresher (which I doubt you need on a game this short), there's no way to look at the mechanical explanations again, or to get a cliffnote on what does what. 

Overall, I'd say its a good game if you get it for free or an absurdly low price, but otherwise, save your money. Definitely not worth 13 bucks for 2 hours worth of gameplay."
7345,The best game ever maded. Has the most beautiful story and if the creators see this i want the part 2 of this game or another game incredible like this one.
7346,"This is such a beautiful game. 

- Story: 8/10
- Gameplay: 8/10
- Environment: 9/10
- Graphics: 7/10 
- Soundtrack: 10/10
- Controls: Easy to manage. 10/10"
7347,This game is awesome. It reminds me of portal 1 and 2 but with more speed and freedom. Great game.
7348,a story about how my uncle touched me
7349,"Is a very good game !Story rich , has some action going on , a game which needs to be played in one run !Trust me im an old motherfucker try this game ! <3"
7350,"the main focus of the game is using your movement abilities, and damn are they buttery smooth"
7351,"Its a simple story, great music/atmosphere, and fantastic platforming mechanics. I did enjoy it but its incredibly short (2.5-3 hours) so I reccomend you get it on sale."
7352,"A story about *my* uncle? He was a train driver, and thats about it."
7353,solid game
7354,This is pretty neat
7355,"I recieved this game a day ago, its free on humble bundle rn.
Game is very short thats a little minus.
Graphics are good.
Gameplay is very very good.
Story is like idk its good but as its short i dont like it a bit.
Game is good for wood Pcs.
Its totally worth all of his price."
7356,"More frustrating than liberating. 
Feels restrictive, just a series of movement puzzles with uncomfortable controls.

Good concept, boring implementation."
7357,This has been the only game too make me cry.
7358,nice
7359,"yap-yap, yackety-yack"
7360,"Great game,
enjoyed every moment."
7361,[h1]Issa[/h1] [b]good[/b] game
7362,decent
7363,"A story about my uncle is a game that had me really pissed off for a few of it's puzzles tword the end. for instantce some crystals worked for their intended perpous. others didn't. The ending was incredibly disapointing. with how frusterating some of this game was and how long it took i was hoping finding your uncle was gunna be something really specual... it wasn't. finally the only character i really ended up liking at all leaves half way through the game. 

however complaints out of the way this game is beutiful fun and lets you feel free in a world compleatly alien to our own. 

I do recomend it... just probobly wait till it goes on sale because of the short game time."
7364,Very short and very gay
7365,"A very good, yet challenging game, it is fun and not boring, but it can get really hard at times so there might be some rage while playing the game but taking a break once in a while will help. Very intresting game with intresting concept. I rate it 8/10 :)"
7366,"Great game, woud recomend to anyone who wants to play to relax and chill."
7367,Sh@it game im from india and india have a lot of sh@it this is one of em
7368,"The game does not say in gameplay what it is.
When you play it you feel...strange(I do not know if you understand me)
The mechanics are good,the story is excellent...
I still do not understand how a child can do many things in search of his uncle,and is not scared =))
I recommend sincere this game..."
7369,Am I Leafy now?
7370,"i got this game recently from humble Bundle.

It's really pretty. It reminded me a lot of What Remains of Edith Finch in the beginning, but becomes a jumping/grappling/gliding platformer that is fun to play without being boring. The I haven't spent a lot of time playing it yet, but I've enjoyed what I have played so far.

If you're looking for relaxed, slightly challenging puzzles (that I am sure get harder as we progress), pretty graphics and what seems to be quite an intersting story, then give this game a go."
7371,most boring game i ever touched
7372,"I liked this game, the idea is great, but the writing could be better. Although the graphics are outdate, due to the genious use of lighting it does not bother you at all, so i would say that his game has aged very well. If you liked portal, you are going to like this one too."
7373,"pretty good, thanks humble bundle"
7374,Good game. Story in the game is really good. But it was a little bit too easy it take only 2 hours to finish the game.
7375,"very frustrating game

ending kinda sucks

uncle fred is a prick"
7376,"I recieved this game for free through Humble Bundle, and i am glad i did. I rarely write reviews but for once a game was truly worth it.

So this is my review:
I am actually sad i never got this game, i just finished this game and i can truly say that i have never experienced being as amazed and surprised by a game at this level. Every corner shows something new, something amazing and beautiful. The characters (even though there are not many) are well made and you feel like you actually connect with them. The scenery and details are just truly breathtaking and i loved all the emotions that swarmed my head by playing this game.

This game is like watching your favourite series the first time you ever watched it, you keep getting amazed. And once it is over you wish you could experience it all again in the same mindset as before.

I rate this game a solid 10/10, even though the graphics are slowly getting older (which i personally dont mind) the game is just so breathtaking and amazing that i cant give it any less than max score.

Thank you for making this game Gone North Games, you just made me enjoy a singleplayer game to the fullest for the first time.

(This game is easily worth 13euros even though i personally got this for free, I could easily buy it again if needed.)

Regards, Albin."
7377,"Got it free from humble bundle, after beating it, only taking around 2 hours, i gotta say it was not good. For sure wouldn't spend money on this, it's extremely repetitive and boring. Far too easy, the only hard parts was where the hitboxes for objects weren't correct, or would run into invisible walls or where the grappel decided it didn't want to reach that far anymore. Really one second it will go like 30ft the next it only goes half that. The story is a mediocre bedtime story, which could of been done awesomly like a fairy tale but comes off barebones and plain. The voice actors should've spoken their actual language as doing it in English comes off as very tired and monotone sounding. The protagonist sounds like he is bored and going to off himself any minute. 

There's plenty of games that do everything this one does but far better and they have more going on. I would skip even if you got it for free. The graphics were decent but assets were re-used constantly and there's not much to look at. In the end this game isn't even completed, it's more like a demo."
7378,"A very beuthiful game, really enjoyed the gameplay, but strugled at few points of the game. Still really do recommend this."
7379,"A short, but nice platformer with a positive story.

Wish it was longer. It can be completed in 2 hours."
7380,"A Story About My Uncle beaten in 4 hours and 30 minutes, without trying to rush it or anything. Short, but the story is wonderful and enjoyable! I feel like, I'm going to remember this game, forever... It simply just touched my heart."
7381,i didnt like it but idfk
7382,"Got this for free from Humble Bundle. Pretty nice game about platforming your way through some interesting environments. Movement is fluid enough, sometimes surfaces are a bit wonky though but it never really affected the gameplay (only in my favour a couple of times). The story is generic and the voice acting is average but they don't really matter, the best parts are the great views you can get. Graphics are nothing special, it's an indie studio, but they're stylised well. Only a couple of frustrating moments, I beat it in 2.5 hours. Sadly it lacked moments when you can really feel like a bada$$ with the movement, but still can't say anything bad about the levels. If you don't get it for free, it has discounts many times in the year (seen it often at -75% in Weeklong Deals) so pick it up if 3D platforming is your thing."
7383,"Very nice game, could be better if the trading cards would obtain faster."
7384,Pretty much a mix of parkour and tomb raider.Super fun. 8/10
7385,Good story. Good gameplay. <3
7386,I played this game and loved it! I wasn't sure if I should get it at first. I can can highly recommend it now. It was a truly great game.
7387,"Very good game, no bugs no framedrops, 10/10"
7388,"A platformer with awful mid-air controls, untested level-design and a boring kindergarten story not even worth the time. Hadn't I received the game for free, I would have refunded it by now."
7389,"If you like simply jumping and clicking buttons this is for you.....  The start was uneventful & frustrating, nice graphics, but other than that  not for me - or a few of my friends that tried it.    

TRY IT - IT'S  FREE!!!! 
and you never know  you may like it, it may be the best game EVER for you ?  .... just not for me ..... :("
7390,Good
7391,This game is amazing
7392,"bun
"
7393,its alright.
7394,"it's really frustrating game. it's a parkour game with first-person view.
no helpful hints or pathway, so you have to figure out what to do and where to go.

after few hours playing, this makes me dizzy and nausea
I got it free, but sorry i cant recommend this"
7395,"Fun game but really short, I beat it in about 2 hours my first time playing."
7396,"Thank you , S√©nor Humble Bundle.
Very Cool.


Recommend this game , 10/10."
7397,played the whole game and finshed it grate game would play again and again 10/10 thank you
7398,"I got this game for free on Humble Bundle and I have to say that I really LOVED it! The game is simple: you jump from rock to rock with a futuristic grappliing hook, super jumps and rocket boots and yes... it sounds as cool as it is. The world is beautiful and has many details. The graphic quality of the game is amazing too and even the story is short, but interesting to listen to. Even the music is smooth, adapted to the environment and relaxing.

All in all: A great game. 10/10"
7399,Game feels nice but it also feels like pro migrant propaganda.
7400,"Just wow. This Game is amazing, definitely 12,99$ worth. I can recomend this Game to EVERYONE!"
7401,"A really cute little game.







oh by the way its for free oh humble bundle right now."
7402,"Worth every penny! an AWSOME GAME!!! beatiful atmosphere, great graphics and awsome controls.
Its free on Humble Bundle btw! Go get your key :)"
7403,"story full of emotions, mind blowing"
7404,"Didn't find the gameplay fun, the controls were a bit fiddly too. If you enjoy convoluted jumping puzzles where you die 20 times in a row only to respawn just in time to hear the same annoying line of dialogue you heard the last 19 times you'll probably like this game."
7405,A unique story.
7406,.
7407,"Ideal game... like story for a bed time which you heard allways, but when you understand it all... you will live this story like main hero his uncle Fred"
7408,"A Story About My Uncle is a first person physics based platformer. The main character reads a bedtime story to his daughter, about his (You guessed it) Uncle Fred as you play through the game. You explore the deep caves and strange world as you try to find him. You are there to answer the many questions you have about your uncle and what he has done. 

Good:
- Pretty and unique Environment
- New ideas
- Interesting story delivery 
- Sense of freedom
- Very fun to parkour around
- Nice soundtrack

Bad:
- Tedious at times
- Quite short (<4 Hours)
- Little replayability 
- Can be frustrating 
- Dialogue is meh

Gameplay: (Terrible) (Very Bad) (Bad) (Okay) (Good) (Very Good) (Amazing)

Graphics - Okay
Soundtrack - Good
Atmosphere - Okay
Controls - Good
Overall Gameplay: Good

Difficulty - Not too hard
Replay Value - Very low
Worth - ¬£5 

Overall Rating: It's a very fun and interesting game with fluid movement. It has a pretty environment and a good storyline, even if its kind of strange. If you enjoyed games like mirror's edge, I recommended playing this one through, just for the fun of swinging around like a crazy man. Buy on sale!
"
7409,"The gameplay is pretty good, although very short. The story is a bit lacking though, there isn't really any sort of connection to the uncle. The game just starts off like ""my uncle is gone, lets go find him"" and there isn't really any other emotional attachment aside from that.

Buy it if you want a short but fun game, not if you want a deep story."
7410,Very Nice game is easy is something like portal!!!  soon review on my website
7411,an amazing game very beautiful the atmosphere is great and the character are also intresting in my opinion it deserves the money that it cost and even more
7412,"Fun little game, smashed through it in a couple of hours."
7413,"Nice game With Addictive gameplay....
got this free on humble bundle ...
thnx to them....
"
7414,"i got this game for free from humble bundle. I love the story, concept, art Ect but heres one huge problem for me. this game is a nightmare to control on lower tier computers. im playing on a macbook air right now and its torture to play. but seeing gameplay and how smooth it is on other high teir computers shows me this is just a computer issue and not their fault. otherwise this is a great game to buy and is worth the price.(even though I didnt pay for it) if you have a decent computer"
7415,"Free version of Spider man, 10/10."
7416,Short game but it is amazing the story is so good and i was so sad when i couldnt find a sequel!
7417,Beautiful game. Jules Verne would like it. (4/5 rating)

Would recommend it to everybody. Really worth playing."

7427,"AMAZING GAME!
it was challenging yet fun, the maps were showing us lots of detail and effort, i cant imagine how long it would have taken to design this all out and then put it into visual.
i think the animations for the NPC's could be better and thier textures could be more improved.

other than that, it was really fun and i would love to see a second."
7428,Thanks Humble Bundle ‚ù§
7429,"I must say I really enjoyed what I've played so far. It has old-school player speed, quality player animation and organic sense of exploration. Thanks, Humble and Coffee Stain!"

p/s: Like the game mechanic btw :P"
7433,This is to much for some bed time story
7434,"A Story About My Uncle

So much to say on such a short piece! After browsing humble bundle for something to play this came up as free so I figured why not? Best decision I have made in a while. I'm not much for story line based single player games but this one captivated me. I'm gonna run through some key points quickly:

GRAPHICS:

I loved the art style, the envirometns had a hand crafted and well worked feel, each one managed to bring out a certain mood or feeling and place you in the scene. Character design felt a little silly sometimes but the focus of the game was much more atmospheric, and well done at that.

GAMEPLAY:

I loved traversing this worl with the unique abilities of the suit. Finding new combos and ways to skip a grapple here or get an extra boost there removed a feeling of manotany when traversing levels.

MUSIC: 

The music fit the game however it could have been more dynamic. It wasn't bad but it wasn't terribly amazing either, just kinda average which im fine with.

STORYLINE: 

This is where the game shines through as more of an art piece than just a game, the storyline grabs you and immediatley drags you in making you eager to keep pressing forward. The level design its with the story in keeping you on a neat path while allowing small exploration here and there.

Overall this game was a blast, replayability may be lacking but for free on humble bundle it was well worth the two hours it took to complete. Consider buying if even just to support the creators for making such a unique game."
7435,"I LOVED this game. It is beautiful, and has a fantastic story. I only wish it were longer. 
This world could be expanded and be truely amazing, but it is sadly pretty short. 

The gameplay is fun, yet challenging with some pretty cool effects. 

The Music is wonderful. 

I could go On and on, just give it a try. It's a fantastic bit of true art we don't see much in games anymore."
7436,my uncles touching me
7437,FUCKING GAY
7438,"This game is amazing.  Don't be fooled by my play time, the story may be relatively short, but I loved every second of it.  I wish there was more, sure, but this is one of the few games that has actually made me cry from the ending.

If there is a god, may he bless the amazing devs that brought us A Story About My Uncle"
7439,the game's free on humblebundle right now
7440,"This game is really chill. Listen to music, watch a video/livestream and just chill back and enjoy."

7443,10/10 made me sad :/ why was there a whale?
7444,"i just started the game and so far the story telling is awesome, looking forward to see what lies next xD
"
7445,"I have got this game for free from humble bundle, and I just played the first 3 ""levels"" at the time of this review. I really like the story and atmosphere thus far, it is intriguing. The platforming is fresh and the grappling hook mechanics are easy to grasp, but still offer a satisfying level of challenge. So far, there is no pressure in the game, so you can take your time and experiment. 

I started playing with a controller, but found it hard to properly aim the grappling hook. I then switched to mouse and keyboard and prefer this scheme.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. I think the price point is great for this type of game."
7446,Nice short game.
7447,"It was alright, a little short.

The grappling mechanics weren't super engageing, they aren't physics based, it just pulls you towards where you latch onto instead of swinging. I didn't really feel compelled to do the time trials afterwards."
7448,So good. Rich in Story and an overall fun time. Graphics are great. Worth the $12
7449,"Good game, wouldn't pay full price but was enjoyable. It is quite short, but interesting story"
7450,greate game sweet story
7451,holy fuck i played this game for 2 hours straight on my first run
7452,Damn what a great game. Had no idea what to expect and was completely amazed.
7453,"This game was not what I expected, and thank god it wasn't."
7454,"A relaxing and nice experience I would recommend trying out but not at its full price

The grappling around and messing with the mechanics make it quite enjoyable and casual to play so dont expect a challenging experience but a layed back beautiful game that will take you for an around 2 hour ride with some beautiful landscapes and great soundtrack

I dont think it is worth the 13$ it asks for so I would recommend waiting for a sale if you plan on getting it"
7455,"Overall the game is good, nice gameplay and good graphics.
But, it's finnished in 2h. You might be able to get 10h out this if you try to get all collectibles and achievements.
Frankly I find it too expensive, 5‚Ç¨ would've been a much better price"
7456,"-great soundtrack
-great story
-game mechanics are awesome
-visually stunning
Overall,a very good game.Got it for free.Some jumps seem hard but once you get the hang of it the game seems easy.Would recommend."
7457,"A fun game with life lessons for kids

I would recommend this for those under 14. It has fun physics based gameplay with light life-lessons sprinkled in throughout the dialogue. Both about finding your own path via Maddie, and following others. At times it can be frustrating to play, but it usually doesn't take more than a 8-9 tries at the hardest parts to get through. The character animation for certain people you meet on the way leaves much to be desired, and many of the voice actors and moments seem not fantastic. It took me a little over 2 hours to beat the game. 

I got this game for free on Humble Bundle, and I would say I woud probably spend 2-3 dollars on the game in the real world. There is nothing in this game that I think breaks any sort of new ground, and I would play it primarily for the action-puzzle side of the game along with the story. At times the graphics border on lazy. Each level is absolutely massive in distance which adds to the ambiance, but can be frustrating when you can't tell how far away anything is. This sense of emptiness is only added onto when you are told there is a thriving metropolis in a certain area, but then are basically flying around what seems to be a wasteland. However, this massive scale is dealt with most appreciatively in areas where you do expect to find life.  

The game does have a simple plot. However, it makes up for that via life-lessons inserted into the linear storyline, albeit forced at times. This game overall seems to be cheaply made, but that is not always a bad thing. I mean, there are probably hundreds of games made on a budget that are worth a couple of playthroughs. However, due to all of this I could not say it would be worth the full 12 dollars. It's a fun 2 hours, but that makes it about 6 dollars an hour for the game experience. If you can find it on sale (or free) then I would say it is worth a run through. This game does have very little replay value in my opinion. Don't buy this game planning to play it over and over as you might Bioshock, Stanley Parable, or -- the most comprable -- Portal."
7458,such a beautiful experience
7459,"Finished it in 2 hours without rushing.
Gameplay is just enough to make it interesting,challenging and not too much or boring.It's like a real adventure.
Story of the game is so simple but so good and it .. play the game.. you will see.
I highly recommend this game,you won't regret buying this at all."

7462,"This was a short and challenging platformer. Every level gets progressively harder, but the upside is you get checkpoints a lot, so it isn't as frustrating. Overall a very enjoyable game with an okay story. Highly recommend. Get it on Humble Bundle for free while you still can!"
7463,"in a word: unsatisfying
the trailers make it look a lot more exciting than it is to play.
graphics were ugly, controls finnicky, and story was unengaging.
went from ok to boring to frustrating at times when segments required very precise grapples/jumps/boosts that were unintuitive.
asking for $13 for this <3hr game is a joke. the game was over right when i'd have thought part 2 would begin.
got it free from humble bundle btw, otherwise I would have asked for a refund
sadly i cant get my time playing it back as i would much rather have been doing something else with it :("
7464,Leafy brought me here ;)
7465,"This game even if its short it is one of the best games i've played this year. 

This is because of all the wonders of this game and the story. Please don't fear to buy it as i did, buy it and be happy about it!

It's a great small story about, well a story. Its really good and i recommend this very much and don't rush through the game, look at all the scenery and you'll notice how great it is. It maybe small but its worth it.

My rating of this game is 10/10 because how immersed i became and how it connected with me.

Take a chance! 
You'll love it.
Have fun playing"
7466,gud gaem
7467,"No tiene a tachanka, no lo recomiendo."
7468,Nice game.
7469,verry fun game and original idea 7.5/10
7470,I'll give it a thumbs up cause I got it for free and it was not entirely unenjoyable. That being said I really hated the way the grapple felt.
7471,"What a refreshing physics based game, I am in awe of such a game and to get it for FREE on Humble, wow! what an achievement!  However having said that I am a little concerned about these damn Lara Croft style jumps that have already got me thinking ""I am glad I got this for free"" as when I attempt a power jump of Shift plus Tab all this does is brings up the steam overlay and I take a swim!

I know what I am supposed to do however these annoying precision style jumps have already got me to leave the game and sleep on it!   Perhaps some of you could give me some extra pointers on how to climb the broken wooden ladder at the very start of the game???"
7472,"The game is pretty neat. Graphics, gameplay and what not, still short though."
7473,"Such a fun game with a beautiful story.
The game is overall pretty easy and the story is really short, but i enjoyed every minute of it.
Even tho i don't like platformers that much, this was the first one that i actually felt enjoyment out of and really wanted to keep on going and discover more about the story.

So simplistic and short, yet so great.

Also, I was able to play this game completely for free thanks to Humble Bundle. You should check them out to play it for yourself."
7474,"I both loved and hated this game.

Loved it because it looks wonderful (especially for a budget title!), the story is captivating, the narration is cute, and the feeling of jumping and grappling around is exhilarating. When it works, it's really great!

Hated it because it can be really frustrating with the grappling - especially in the latter third.
Maybe I'm too lousy with a mouse - but I've been a gamer for over twenty years, so I don't think I suck that much. The problem is that you have to hit precise spots in sequence to move forward, and you have no room for errors: a tiny mistake and you have to restart the section (autosave points can be frustratingly distant sometimes). The second or third time is still ok (the environments are amazing), the tenth could become maddening.

In the end, I had to resort to cheats to finish the game; I just couldn't progress without it. I think this is unforgivable for any game.
The player should at least have an option for having unlimited grapples (maybe linked to a number of collectables). Instead of helping the player enjoy their game, the developer decided to not offer this option, hence ""punishing"" the player who's not skilled enough. Clever thinking!

Without this problem with the grappling, my vote would have been an 8 or even 9. Considering the frustration I would give a 6, but since it's a new small developer, in the end my vote is 7.
A note to the developer: next time, keep in mind players primarily want to have fun."
7475,"great game, reminds me of my youth"
7476,whyyyyy is it so shorttttttttttttttttttttttttttt qwq
7477,i need the second game
7478,I suggest this game to people who looking for great story.
7479,free on humble bundle rn
7480,thrilling!
7481,You can get this game for free on HumbleBundle : https://www. humblebundle. com/store/a-story-about-my-uncle
7482,"A Story About My Uncle is a first person physics based platformer. The main character reads a bedtime story to his daughter, about his (You guessed it) Uncle Fred as you play through the game. You explore the deep caves and strange world as you try to find him. You are there to answer the many questions you have about your uncle and what he has done. 

Good:

- Dialogue is meh

Gameplay: (Terrible) (Very Bad) (Bad) (Okay) (Good) (Very Good) (Amazing)

Graphics - Okay
Soundtrack - Good
Atmosphere - Okay
Controls - Good
Overall Gameplay: Good

Difficulty - Not too hard
Replay Value - Very low
Worth - ¬£5 

Overall Rating: It's a very fun and interesting game with fluid movement. It has a pretty environment and a good storyline, even if its kind of strange. If you enjoyed games like mirror's edge, I recommended playing this one through, just for the fun of swinging around like a crazy man. Buy on sale!
"
7483,"I remember myself writing an E-Mail to the developers after finishing the game where I asked if there will be more. I was emotionally taken by this game. The world is wonderful, the story is really good and the characters are just likeable (of course it's not a big complex game, but it doesn't have to, to be impactful). Do yourself a favor, take 3 hours of your life, grab something to eat and play this game. It's totally worth it."
7484,Such a beautiful game!
7485,"If you love the story telling aspect of gaming and beautiful visuals then this game is for you. Great job by Gone North Games. 

There isn't a whole lot to this game other than the first person movement mechanics but those are done very well and the controls are lightning fast responsive. Flying through the air is an exhilarating experience. These same type of mechanics are also employed by the game Valley. 

So although the game sort of forces you forward while holding your hand to the finish and is also fairly short, it's still a great game and very immersive.

I give it a solid 7.5/10."
7486,"Honestly this was such a good game, I enjoyed it so much much and loved every part of it, even though it was a little frustrating at times. The concept was quite unique I find and the plot and narrating was very interesting too. The game was short which was kind of lame but it was worth the money. It's enjoyable if you have spare time or such."
7487,Very good made my eyes feel good 10/10 leafy used in some of his videos (im posting this from internet explorer)
7488,"I loved this game, and I would have loved for the playthrough to be longer. Great story and relaxing gameplay :)"
7489,"This game has great animation, and the art syle is just phenomanal. I really love this hame and its story. It really is one of those indie games that gives cool quirks to the normal parkour game experience, and emerses the gamer. Epic..."
7490,mad game
7491,"Absolutely visually stunning. And I'm floored by the sound track, its just so beautiful!"
7492,"Inititally Fun, but the final Ice Caves section was a tremendous exercise in finickyness.
Furthermore the game fails to hold up to its first hour. The game initially sets a tone of vast landscapes one uses the glove to soar through, and a pretty fun boss concept. But fails to measure up to that first hour as the game foes on. The levels after one drops of Maddie through are claustrophobic and require extremely precise mouse movement, to the point skill no longer felt like a part of making it tot he checkpoint, so much as repetition and luck. 
I would not recommend this game, unless you paid like $.99 and deleted it after dropping the weird alien companion off, and even then only just barely recommending it."
7493,Most people are drawn to this game because of the interesting movement mechanics. And to be honest theres isn't much more to the game than that. The gameplay is fun and its really the best feature of the game and I had a blast swinging with the grappling hook. The visulas and voice acting are decent but the story is very plain and simple. I get that this isn't meant to be a plot heavy game but for a story completely driven by your characters desire to find his uncle the ending is underwhelming. I'm not going to spoil it but it kinda makes your whole journey seem rather pointless. Its a shame  though that the game is so short and there really aren't that many levels as I really enjoyed them.
7494,Not quite as good as Valley but still fun.
7495,"Worth the money. Don't let its age fool you, it's a very good game. The story is perfect and the gameplay is phenomenal. The UI is ahead of it's time."
7496,Fun game. I finished it in about 2 hours but didn't really go after all the achievements. I would've liked an hour or two more of story/gameplay. The platforming could be frustrating at times but I was never really stuck anywhere. Runs great on linux!
7497,Cool and good
7498,A decent first person platformer that will take you a few hours to complete. There's not much in the story but this game has some good mechanics that are fun to play around with. A fun and relaxing experience. I would recommend to pick up this game when it's on sale.
7499,Very fun if you like jumb n run games.
7500,"Seriously the best game for its price, i loved it, but i think its too short, im waiting for the 2nd part"
7501,"the parkour part of the game is indeed gome. little different from mirror's edge tho. what is deeply interesting about this game is its story. well done ""gone north games""."
7502,very fun and relaxing game.
7503,"The game is extremely short (2 hours), and the gameplay is often frustrating due to lack of consistency (grappling failing), but it looks all glowy, mysterious, and kinda cool. Also it clearly has a lot of heart (stay until after the credits). There are defenitely better games out there that remind me of this type of gameplay (e.g., valley!), but if you like glowy crystals and swinging like Tarzan, this game will not disappoint. 

Graphics 7/10
Atmosphere 9/10
Sound 8/10 (but use a popfilter for maddy next time!!!)
Gameplay 7/10
Value (costs/gametime/replayabilty, etc.) 7/10 
Overall 8/10



"
7504,"A short experimental puzzle-platformer with a heartfelt story about looking up to your older relatives. You've got a pretty impressive number of moves  that you can string together in midair to cross massive distances. I suppose that is actually the only flaw I can find in this game's level design- I forget who exactly said it, but there is a game design truism that claims that if you give too much aerial freedom to a player character short of total flight, then platforming challenges become nonsensical in how hard they are to visually comprehend, with how long the distances between platforms need to be in order to be challenging. That definitely happens sometimes in this game, but overall the levels are all unique, challenging and fun."
7505,"Nice and deep Grappling and movement mechanics
Very good storytelling.
A good short game to finish in 5 hours or so."
7506,This game was alot of fun. and it sucks that its only 2 hours long. this would be a really cool vr game though.
7507,Really boring
7508,"This is possibly the best game i have played this year since going to the pc full time and giving up on the ps4 and consoles, this game was very fun, made me smile, was aesthetically pleasing, and was just all around cute and had a very nice reasoning, the ""easter eggs"" at the beginning of the game were also very nice and had me smiling from the beginning, i highly recommend this game :)"

7510,"I thought it was a ""nice"" game. It was pretty. It relaxed me, jumping from platform to platform while chill music played in the background. But there was also a bit of excitement. There were times where i didnt know if i was going to make the jump or fall.

It can be frustrating though. There were times where i felt cheated by the game because i was close enough to a rock that my grappling hook should have activated but didnt, but more times than not it worked properly. The story was meh, there wasnt really any substance to it. If you deconstruct it, the story amounts to, get from point A to point B. i'm sure some people will disagree.
 
The voice acting was meh, i didnt really like their voices they were either way to monotone or their emotions were exagerated to the point of being annoying, but that's to be expected from an indie game that probably didnt have the money to hire S tier voice actors.
 The game is pretty short (if i tried i could probs beat it in 1 to 3 hours) and i found it to be extremely easy and ""dying"" in the game isn't really punished at all. You just teleport to the closest checkpoint which is usually only 1 or two jumps away.  

The characters look like something that came straight outta the deepest pits of hell, so it made me a bit home sick. 

All in all it was a meh game. Definitely intended for children, most average players will breeze through the game. There are speed run events after beating the game, but it's not my cup of tea and therefore i doubt ill ever play the game again. I played all the way through it and i enjoyed it somewhat so ill reccomend it... just know it's NOT what i would consider a good game, and id advise you to get it on sale if u really wanted to try it (i got it off a bundle in humble bundle)."
7511,"For an action platformer, the flow of control is key.

This game has done nothing to nail that part. You will start blaming the game, instead of yourself, for dying again and again. 

Avoid."
7512,"very good :D
"
7513,Totally worth it
7514,good game
7515,In the ending [spoiler] the uncle rapes you [/spoiler]
7516,The grapple mechanic is very fun to use!
7517,Very relaxing game 9/10
7518,Good game but quite hard
7519,"Beatiful gameplay, story is meh."
7520,Not too bad. A fun gameplay of climbing to the top with a side of great story.
7521,A great title. Fun gameplay and good voice acting. This is a short arcade title. (Like really short. Shorter than Portal 1) Good voice acting as well.
7522,"one of the best games i have ever played, the story is amazing, i managed to complete it in a little more than 3 hours because i tried my hardest to finish it not realising it not a large game. be warned, you feel empty inside for about 2 weeks after completing the game. this needs a sequal"
7523,"This is a decent little game.

Pros:
+ Captivating story
+ Excellent level design
+ Good mechanics
+ Good artstyle
+ Commands seemed polished

Cons:
- Very short game
- Underwhelming ending
- Many uneplained things

[spoiler]If uncle populated cave with all life forms, where does that giant eye comes from? [/spoiler]"
7524,Like the game but I don't really recommend it to you.
7525,"this game make me feel strange, nice controls and graphics, short story made for those that don't have a lot of time to play, speed runing this game is cool"
7526,its actually cool even tho i havent played much of it its really fun
7527,I think that this game is a very fun and interesting one. The game is not a long one but the journey through the game makes up for the length. I would really enjoy a sequel.
7528,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME. It's super relaxing and is great for passing by time. The story is interesting, never seen anything like it to be fair. The graphics are great, the story is great, movement and actions are smooth, everything about this game is great. If you love these types of games, I highly recommend giving this a try!"
7529,"A very nice, little game about a nephew who tries to find his lost uncle and goes on an adventure to do it. With absolutely beautiful graphics (excepting the characters models, specially faces), little but very fitting music, a nice story and really fun, challenging first person platforming (one of the only games to ever get it right) this is a very good game, and I highly recommend it. One negative that I can say about it. is that is criminally short, first playthorough took me no more than 3 hours, and my second one that I finished a couple minutes ago took me maybe half of that or maybe 2 hours. Just get it on a sale!"
7530,"A Story About My Uncle is an excellent 3D platformer with a charming storyline, and relaxing soundtrack. The level design is great and Star Haven is just beautiful to look at. If your looking for a 3D platformer look no futher. This game is very much worth your time."
7531,"I don't know if I should call it an exploration game, but for that it is to linear, or an action game, but for that it happens to less.
So you are running and jumping from place to play through a bunch of different areas. The graphic is not that great but suitable. Most time you know where to go, so this is a plus point.
The story feels like a ""bedtime story"", a journey through mystic places searching for your uncle.

Game is good, but wouldn't play it again. For speedrunners this might be interesting."
7532,"Well this is definetly not worth 13 euros...
Good mechanics but it gets boring really fast. I played the free ones and i was fairly disappointed. Since i heard this game would be better than the free ones, i tried it and i was even more disappointed.

Would not recommend. Not a good indie game :/"
7533,*leafy intensifies* but seriously. I did enjoy playing it. It was rather nice to look at and had fun mechanics.
7534,fun game
7535,"7/10
It's a pretty good, short puzzle game. The mechanics and gameplay of the puzzles are fun, and at times frustrating, but I overall enjoyed them. I beat this game in just over 3 hours, so it is VERY short. The story is ok, and it is overall just a nice, simple, short game. I do not believe that it is worth the current full price of $12.99. It is too short to justify that, so definitely wait for a sale."
7536,"The game was a nice quick story with fun gameplay to keep you occupied. The story was interesting and touching. The game play was fun and were a bit challenging until I got the hang of it. The graphics were beautiful and were quite impressive at times. The level design had a steep learning curve but is possible. The game overall was great, but it was fairly short. I was able to complete the story in a few hours and a disappointed by that. The game is worth a buy but not at its full price. I bought it when it was on sale so I felt I got my money's worth, but if I paid the full price then I would have been a little bit annoyed."
7537,Bad story good mechanics.
7538,"It's a bit twitchy in gameplay, but it was wonderful visuals and a nice, sweet story. it's quite a short game all told, but it has replay value with going back into levels to get collectables, ultimately is worth the time to play through, quite an interesting and unique mechanic."
7539,"Solid game. Extremely simple concept to grasp and definitely a good game to play just to relax, but not too easy to complete without a little focus at times. Although the game seemed slightly too mundane and short for me, it's still enjoyable and highly recommended for anyone looking for a comfortable, enjoyable exploration experience.

7/10. Very simple but very short and not that much to learn about the game, especially when it comes to character interaction."
7540,Short but beautiful.
7541,"Forgot to write a review about this game, but when talking about games that are worth playing I remebered this game. It is a lovely little gem. Worth the full 12? probably not. Still an amazing game."
7542,"Loved the art direction. Not overly long or difficult, but an incredibly cathartic experience."
7543,"This is why i appreciate indie development. It's all got that charming wonkiness that comes from a 10-20 person team. The ending got me harder then i thought it would.

It isn't amazing, it's just..nice. It's a pleasant little adventure.

If I had to level 1 criticism at it, is that I wish there was more of, here's where you are and there's where you have to go. And then a bunch of objects up and around that you can choose how to get there."
7544,Definitely worthwhile.
7545,"I don't know why this game has such high ratings. The story is uninteresting, character development is cliche. The ending of the game does not pay off, considering the leadup to the end of the game is essentially half of the game itself. Voice acting is just odd, and I'm pretty sure they just used the whole ""reading a bedtime story"" as a cover up.

The only thing this game has going for it is the look itself (other than the NPCs). Its actually quite pretty. 

There are some segments where it seems like you can't make it unless its pixel perfect. 

Buy this game for the gameplay, and mute all sounds."
7546,"Tight controls?  Please..

You feel about as tight as a cloud on a warm summers day, and just as fast too."
7547,great game
7548,"Bitdefender doesn't like this game, prevented me from saving content while playing through originally. That being said, lets jump into the review: This is a fun game. It isn't long, or particularly difficult. It probably isn't worth the full price, so when it dropped to like $2.30 I jumped at the opportunity. The world is very pretty, the mechanics feel smooth, though I did encounter a glitch where the sprint jump mechanic wasn't working every time. This game is good for hours or replayability, lots of games can't say the same.

Get the game, especially on a sale!"
7549,"This game is so good. great graphics. great story. great soundtrack. great voice acting. definately worth the money. the only problem is its kinda short. still an amazing game 8.7/10
"
7550,very nice adventure game i would recommend
7551,the game itself was very challenging and the story was pretty good i would say
7552,"Yeah, it's good."
7553,A great for few hours of great fun.
7554,"Aaah, what a breath of fresh air this adventure has been. Brilliant the way the story is told and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy after you complete it. I would definitely recommend a playthrough for anyone. Get a copy for your uncle and show some love! :-)"
7555,the best game i have ever played. I WANT A SEQUEL!
7556,"Game is god tier ultra-deluxe Gold Premium now with extra efficiency and greater handgrip New recipie, same flavor enjoy Extra suction power makes it easy to clean up quickly and oh my is the package already here? Thank god im using Ultimate-super-jet mail delivery service because when i order something i want it delivered as soon as possible so i can get unpacking haha, THANKS! Ultimate-super-jet mail delivery service

The game is good"
7557,Great game and good story!
7558,funny
7559,Is Gud
7560,"this game is nice and calming, for it being made in 2014 it still holds up as a fun adventure"
7561,Excellent game if you dont mind length if its on sale easy pick up
7562,The game is very enjoyable and relaxing.
7563,"very nice game, short and fun story, lifechanging"
7564,"great game! amazing story, very good gameplay worth the price and even better its pretty often on discount so its must have."
7565,"It is a great game, even though its quiet short. It has an interesting storyline behind it and the athmosphere of this game is really beautiful and well designed."
7566,This game has breathtaking scenery and atmosphere. It's a lot of fun just leaping around and learning the story of your uncle.
7567,This game's story is incredible and it matches the universe perfectly. 10/10 there needs to be more like this.
7568,"Best 5 dollars I've ever spent. Solid story, ultra fun and challenging gameplay. I demand a sequel!!!"
7569,.
7570,"I got this game quite a while ago, and I enjoyed it then; it was fun to play through.

I went back on it recently and it was just as good as I remembered it to be. The storytelling is brilliant, and I like the open-worldy feel to it - you're free to explore and it's just fun to try and break the boundaries of the map. I loved the little details in the maps, being able to find little bits of information that form part of the back story. Game play wise, it was smooth and added to the overall experience.

There are some nice easter eggs as well that I didn't realise in my first playthrough. For example, at the start of the game on some walls are actual YouTube links to some videos that are rather entertaining. 

Overall a solid game that has a nice replay value to it."
7571,Underrated
7572,A Story About My Uncle was my favorite game for a while but the game quickly became too hard and I havent played it since!
7573,"Beautiful graphics and the gameplay was very relaxing but the story was disappointingly short.  
9/10"
7574,good
7575,This game really has a feel for atmosphere and a very nice and calming (mostly) story. It's ery immersive and rather well done for the price.
7576,good parkour game
7577,"Well, this is a  hard one to review. 

It is a great game, believe me, but you'll have to dig it really deep.

The game is about a wonderful journey a boy goes through to find his missing uncle (told from the future, where the boy is not a grown up telling all to his own daughter). The story is really amazing if you stick with it till the end. Unfortunatelly it is really boring until you get to the last few stages.

Graphics, music and atmosphere are breathtaking. Gameplay, on the other hand, is very repetitive and turn the game into a chore. There is where the game has its biggest flaw: the game is centered around the grappling hook and the power suit, yet it turned out being really boring. Considering mid story is also boring you know why I had a hard time recommending this one.

In any case when it is really boring you get to experience a very nice atmospheric game with good graphics. And if you force yourself until the end and understand what is going on you'll get an amazing story."
7578,"Beautiful game with fun game mechanics. The game feels very open and you're free to explore the environments.

The story wasn't amazing but ignoring that, it was a hell of a time!

Go ahead and buy it if you're on the edge!"
7579,"It's a little but very cute and maybe a little sad story. So if you like a these kind of games you should try it.
However, gameplay differs when you play on gamepad and play on mouse with keyboard. Therefore, if you want a more hard experience you should play on gamepad."
7580,This game is Amazing! Its simple and let u just play the game while always letting u explore somthing new. In just 2 hours u  bond with ur character and just dont want the game to end.
7581,"Not often do you come across first person platformers that look as polished and as immersive as A Story About My Uncle. 

Controls are tight and responsive, interactions and game mechanics gel really well with the various environments, while challenges are systemically and methodically presented within each stage,"
7582,It's aight I mean whats the point really. Not worth 12 though

7584,I love the scenery in this game so much. Gosh darn
7585,"I absolute love this game. It is, in essence, a 3D platformer with an incredibly deep story. It takes multiple play throughs and finding all secrects to understand the underlying story. The movement is great and the difficulty varies based on the current situations in the game."
7586,"Though short, this game may not be worth full price but if you can get it on sale definitely do! The game has a fairly interesting story told to you like a bedtime story which is interesting when paired with the characters speaking directly to you in the present. It's mechanics are fun to play around with and generally responsive, and I mean grappling hooks are always fun to play around with. Finally, the most pleasing part of this experience for me was the environment and character designs: the charcters were reminicent of games like Ratchet and Clank with some stranger proportions in a cartoon-y style that I find very memorable and quirky; and the environments were very lush and diverse, with one moment in a dark cave with glowing plants to another in sky villages with festival decor. All-in-all great game for a short playthrough."

7621,A very boring game.
7622,"This game has one of the most beautiful levels ever created in a game. PLAY IT.

What I liked:
A very short yet fun parkour game. It has a good story and is well presented through narration and voice acting.
The music is decent overall but is quite good in certain areas.
The gameplay is simple yet challenging. The save system is automatic and in smaller sections which makes retrying much easier.

What I did not like:
The controls are less but can be a bit confusing. Despite playing the game twice I still get confused about what I need to press for jumping.
The graphics are decent at best and the character models are quite low poly. The in-game cursor is also quite large and non-customizable.

7624,Nice Game Im very Enjoy this game

A Story About My Uncle (ASAMU) is a very pretty and very interesting game with flaws.  On the good side, some of the puzzles and jumping sequences are fun and interesting, the game is not overly punishing for failure as checkpoints are quite common, and the world you're travelling through is quite pleasant to spend time in.  I found three main flaws with the game as I played through it.  First, for a game that's about interesting ways to move, there really isn't many ways to do things besides ""the right way"" and it doesn't seem like creativity or particular skill with the hook are helpful.  Second, the voice acting is flat, deadpan, and just not good.  Third, the physics of the hook just don't feel good or satisfying.  This one is hard to explain and took me a while to figure out why I wasn't terribly happy with it.  The hook pulls you straight towards a rock, nullifying gravity while you are hooked to that rock.  This results in you not so much swinging (a la a more traditional 2D hook mechanism like in Metroid) as it is just driving directly at the floating rock you're trying to swing past and instead faceplanting into it.  You get used to it after a while, but it just never really felt satisfying and was frequently frustrating.  I've not spent a lot of time with this sort of first person exploration/platformer game, and I found it to be a middle of the road experience.  I feel like ASAMU has more promise than it actually puts forth, but I found it a worthwhile experience for a couple hours."
7630,Terrible.
7631,"This game is now one of my favorites. The creators know pacing so well. They add new things with perfect timing, and they teach the new mechanics without punishing you for not knowing them right off the bat. 

WARNING TO POTENTIAL BUYERS: this is a short game, took me only about 2 hours to complete, though it is quite replay-able. I didn‚Äôt find it bad, I thought it was a pleasant sit down and beat type game, but some people might not care for that so I think it‚Äôs important they know it. I also got the game on sale for only 3 dollars, which in my opinion made the game EXTREMELY worth the purchase, though I do not know if I would want to pay the 15 or whatever it generally is. 

TLDR: Amazing game, but short. Buy it on sale."
7632,A compat and great piece of platforming and visual storytelling. Really enjoyed it and it also has good replay value.

7634,"Best indie game i've ever played. Incredibly fun, revolutionary gameplay mechanics, gorgeous but simple graphics, and beautifully optimized for pc; this is the only relatively new game that is actually playable at 1440p with my 2GB MX150.

The story is very simple/understated, and the game is short, but for the sale price of $2.59, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal, and it's worth so much more.

I originally torrented this game and loved it so much I had to buy it, and I've since bought it three more times for friends. And as a bonus, the save files on my torrented verison transferred over!

BUY THIS GAME! You won't regret it."

Once I started I had to play the whole way through. 100% recommend while tripping and sober. You'll laugh and you'lll cry, a must play"
7637,This was in my backlog for so long and even though it seemed really interesting i never got to actually playing it until today. Didn't get too hooked on the story but the gameplay was fun. Only thing that griped me was that the game ended too quickly and was kinda anticlimatic. Overall a nice game overall!
7638,"[h1]Good Platformer[/h1]

I can't think of a moment when I wasn't bored. Only problem is how short it is, but it's still certainly worth the price."
7641,"Mini Spoiler











by the end of this inspiring story it gives us a perspective to respect other people's world. 
the game doesn't tells the player to ""have adventure"" in a world like other games would do, but instead you will be told to respect it and give other person some room to do it. 

it literally put us in a game where we act as a third person beyond fantastic world.. you'll see what i meant on the ending :)

good timings and the characters remind me of portal 2 but with nature."
7642,"Generally speaking it was kinda fun, I liked the scenarios, the parkour overall was nice.
The story was.. a Story."
7643,"# Specs
CPU: Intel i5-2430M
GPU: Intel Integrated Graphics
RAM: 4GB
OS: Debian GNU/Linux (Buster)
FPS average (approximate, felt like): 13-15 (laggy)

# Bugs
0) A few negligible texture bugs when walking into walls.
1) Experienced about 3-4 relevant bugs: sometimes you cannot simply activate crystals even if the distance between the player and the crystal is less than 1 meter. This caused me to fail quite a few times which was irritating.
2) Found a funny bug when you can hook a surface just before dying and if you're still holding the mouse button, the player will be actually draged to that surface no matter the distance after the respawn.

Because of the low amout of FPS on my poor laptop, the game was even more difficult than it actually is.
Of course this added a lot of frustration in some areas of the maps but I still managed to beat the game in about 4 hours in 1 go (though with higher FPS that would probably be quicker).

The story is nice in general and touching in the end.
I would definitely recommend buying and playing this game."
7644,"At its core, A Story About My Uncle is a first-person, puzzle platformer.

You will be traversing through mystical lands with bottomless pits. You must go long distances over these gaping chasms with a grappling hook that can fire up to three times before you have to land, and rocket boots that let you dash in the air over a short distance once before you land.
Overall, i felt like I was experiencing a poor-man's Spider-man. It's not a long game, but from start to finish, you are in for an engaging, speedy experience that is fun, and sometimes exhilarating.

7/10 ""Good"""
7645,"haven't played a none multiplayer game in so long (story games) , the feelings you get while playing this game are just amazing even tho the character is jumping you're relaxed and the background music is just beautiful ,finished it in 3 hours , which is a bit short but it is what you call short but sweet , would love to go on an adventure with uncle fred and maddie and  would definitely recommend the game

maddie is a 10/10 btw would def hit that blue ass"
7646,fun game
7647,"Absolutely amazing!
The physics are great, very fluid and easily controled once you get the hang of it. The rocket boots provide a sort of safty net for new players which works great even though you only really get them half way through the story, saved my life a couple times. 
My only gripe is the ice level where you must grip the stalactites of the cave and grapel the crystals perfectly, the timing is very tight and the level as a whole was a little dark but yes, it did provide a great challenege and once I finished I felt greatly rewarded and satisfied.
The story seems a little shallow I know its only supposed to be a bedtime story to his daughter and the entire game takes place in the time span of one day but I would have liked just a bit more. Now what was there was great story telling, as you progressed through the game the narrator keeps talking so if you are fast enough and collect all the parts of the side story hidden about each level it feels like a fluid bedtime story and matches the gameplay purfectly. 

Its a relaxing game to play casually but also provieds challenging parkour in later levels."
7648,"This is a cute game with fun gameplay, but that‚Äôs all it is. The voice acting for the little girl the narrator is reading a story to is good, but the voice acting of the other characters, especially the narrator himself, is not good. The narrator has little emotion in his voice and speaks with long, unnatural pauses between words, as if he‚Äôs slowly reading the words on a script rather than [i]actually[/i] reading his child a bedtime story.

The story is mediocre. While it is cute, it‚Äôs not engaging or exciting. There are no plot twists or even any interesting events in the story. This is the story of the main character, whose name is unknown, finding his uncle, Fred, in a mystical land, and that‚Äôs about it.

While the levels look pretty, they are still really bland. Other than grappling from point A to B, there‚Äôs nothing to do aside from collecting five collectables in each level, and the collectables aren‚Äôt that well-hidden either. Most of the levels look the same and don‚Äôt offer room for exploration. Most of the achievements are way too difficult and frustrating to unlock, and the game offers barely any replay value other than simply trying to unlock the achievements and beating your own times in the Time Trial mode.

The character models look anywhere from pretty bad to downright terrifying. The character animations aren‚Äôt anything to write home about either. As for the controls, it‚Äôs definitely a tonne of fun to grapple around like Spider-Man, and the game offers a nice variety of moves quite early on, but charging up your super jump or super leap takes a little over a second, so the gameplay doesn‚Äôt feel as smooth and quick as it could‚Äôve. I don‚Äôt see a reason to have such a long charge-up time. Why can‚Äôt you just super leap or super jump by pressing right-click or holding it while sprinting, without having to wait?

Despite all the flaws, I still recommend the game. It‚Äôs often on sale; as of writing this review, the game is ‚àí80% off, costing only $2.59, and it‚Äôs also been ‚àí85% off, costing only $1.94, on multiple occassions. When it has a great sale like this, I definitely recommend picking up. You won‚Äôt be invested in the story or characters, but the base gameplay is definitely something that will take your mind off things for a while.

If you‚Äôre wondering how long the game lasts, it took two and a half hours to beat the game for me. For you, it might take 80 minutes if you're rushing and not caring about the collectables, and if you [i]do[/i] care about the collectables, the main story might take four hours to beat. Additionally, you can spend a long time trying to unlock all the achievements, if that's your thing. However, I personally only got one achievement.

    [*] [b]Graphics[/b] ‚Äì Seeing as how this is an indie game that‚Äôs four and a half years old, don‚Äôt expect crepuscular rays, high fidelity, and other marks of beautiful graphics.

    [*] [b]Controls[/b] ‚Äì The controls are pretty tight, although the charge-up time to do super jumps and super leaps feels unnecessary and only slows your gameplay down. Other than that, grappling around each level is fast, fun, and easy to pull off.
    [*] [b]Gameplay[/b] ‚Äì The gameplay is the most important part of A Story About My Uncle. The grapple element, along with the rocket boots, are the core elements of this game, and it pulls them off really well.

I give this game a 6.8/10. Pick it up when it‚Äôs on sale, and you‚Äôll have fun for a good few hours."
7649,Cancer gameplay
7650,"Good story, very relaxing game"
7651,"This game is a linear 3D platformer with a narration being told as you explore the world in front of you. The platforming portion is fun, although there are frustrating periods where it may take a few attempts until you see an obscured mark that you need to reach to progress. The story is fairly simple and not a grand adventure, it's simple and straightforward, which also made it relaxing. In regards to the graphics, the environments are wonderfully crafted, the character models not as much, however the narration and exploration is what drives you forward, not the NPC interaction. I'd recommend trying it out if you want a fairly fun 3D platformer with some thoughts as to seeing how fast you can clear some areas."
7652,A Story About My Uncle is a hidden game among the thousands of game on steam and it's incredibly fun.
7653,"This game is very short; maybe only an hour on a casual playthrough, but the gameplay mechanics, story, art style and characters make this game more than a game; it's an experience, and i want as many people to experience it with me."
7654,"Im happy this game went on sale. No offense, but i would not spend 15$ on this. However managed to cop for 3$ which is way more reasonable. I only got about 30 minutes in but the game was very fun. The parkour platforming is challanging, yet fun. Id also recommend it for a nice game for youtube background gameplay. If you buy it, buy it on sale. Its a fun game though"

7657,"[b]A platformer - parkour game that has a great short story. Anyway I'll just go straight to the point.[/b]
- Is this game worth it? Yes.
- Length? If you used to play several games like this you'll beat it in 2-4 hours, in my gameplay I beat it in 2.6 hours.
- Gameplay? Amazing, a little bit spoiler about the abilities : [spoiler]You can jump hella high, grapple so you'll feel like a spiderman in fps mode, and rocket powered boots (for few seconds ofc).[/spoiler]
- Graphics? Okay-ish, not bad but the environment is beautiful.
- Performance? Almost any potato will run it smoothly.
- Price? Since it has replay value like for achievements and secrets, it's worth full price, but I'd recommend you to getting this one when it's on sale because of the length.

Overall it's 8/10 from me, thank you!"

At the beginning of the game, you are given a grappling suit that gives you the power to jump incredibly high and leap across extreme distances. This suit allows the wearer to harness the power of a crystal üíé, which emits a beam that acts as ""sticky"" rope, allowing for extreme mobility to climb and swing with ease through the environment. Equipped with this ability, you are able to grapple many surfaces and swing freely from platform to platform in a first-person perspective. However, the length of the beam is limited, and the number of times you can you use the grappling beam is also limited until you touch the ground again. Therefore, this can deem as quite the challenge when going through difficult and complex environments. The player will be required to have precision and fast reflexes to effectively traverse across the world.

The levels are made up of five worlds, each decently increasing in difficulty. Each level will introduce a new mechanic that is fairly easy to learn and put into practice.

Each environment of the worlds in [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] certainly holds the aspect of quality over quantity. While there are only five worlds to go through, each one had me bedazzled at how attractive they were.

Finding the secret collectibles will also [spoiler] unlock some bonus perks for your suit and grappling beam, which I definitely had fun playing around with[/spoiler].

When I played the 2008 first-person parkour game, [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge]Mirror's Edge[/url], I would often wonder what it would be like to jump and swing about the City of Glass using a Spiderman-like web mechanic. [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] was able to bring this past concept to life for me üíì (minus the parkour element of course).

7663,Amazing game with subtle story behind great platforming mechanics and graphics overall.
7664,"Loved the game.
Good graphics and solid controls.
Also the story was quite interesting.
If there is one thing to complain about, it's the playtime. I managed to finish it in about 2 hours, and someone more skilled than me might be able to do it even faster.

7665,10/10 would pretened to be a leafy video again
7666,"Hey guys, leafy here."
7667,Recommend! Really cool first person platformer. Loved giant levels and beautiful distant backgrounds. Gameplay was also very fun and pretty unique
7668,"I wouldn't recommend buying the game on its full price, but that's coming from a cheapo, really buy it according to your budget, it's a nice game, but not a great one.

The game has a grapple hook, like what else do you need?!
But seriously, the game is worth a try, it got a nice music and beautiful art, it is funny at times(not like it intends to, but man do i get quite a laugh in the village), it handled the use of grapple hook pretty nicely, really i enjoyed playing the game.

However as said, it isn't a great game, there were centain elements which could had been improved on this game, most importantly, the story and the difficulty. 
If you think it's a difficult game, nope, it ain't, there are no difficulty settings if you assume i am playing on easy. The game is easy to complete once you get the hang of it, don't really count my 2 hours of gameplay in that, that was my 2nd time completing the game while first time on the account, but it will not take you a long while to complete the game.
Secondly, don't buy the game for the story, the story is short, and bad. I don't wanna give spoilers so just, it's didn't lived up to my expectations.

TL;DR: It's a game for people who likes to sit back, relax, and enjoy the textures and the music(also if you don't feel its beautiful, just play until sky haven? i think that's what it is called, the one after the chasms basically)and they know how to make a grapple hook. But if you are up for the story, avoid buying it."

I bought it on sale but it's really worth it."

7671,Wonderful game with fun mechanics and graphics are a bit kooky but some of the enviroments are captivating and it has a amazing sense of exploration as you go through levels with branching paths and designs.
7672,Amazing game with a truly wonderful story and even better platforming. This game is charming from the very beginning and the characters that it adds just keep making the game even better.
7673,So far the story line is super adventurous and makes you want to keep seeing what is next. I got this game on sale and so far it has definitely been worth it.
7674,"A very enjoyable platformer at around 3 hours for a first playthrough (with minor replayability aimed mostly at completionists). 

The physics of movement and simplistic exploration are extremely satisfying - however, the game does not lend itself to precision platforming, with often clunky controls and default keys. They're OK for a short game but this means that the last arc of the game, a self-proclaimed ""it's gonna be a challenge"" becomes a dull chore and is by far the least enjoyable part.

At 80% off, it's a no-brainer if you like peaceful games with nice, dreamy environments to explore. ""Sonic meets Journey""."
7675,This game is short but its very great. For a four year old game its not bad. It's fun and relaxing navigating through the terrain.
7676,short but sweet.. gameplay is amazing and this deserves a lot of praise and attention to be honest!
7677,Quick but very fun. I enjoyed it.

7679,"...and this is why professional voice acting is so important when you're trying to tell a story, kids.

p.s. I'd gladly play some remastered version of it with good actors though. The gameplay itself isn't half bad."
7680,"The story is so-so but, the game play made everything feel so good in the game. Even failing and falling off a floating island gave me chills like I was acctually falling. The gameplay is easy to learn and has a very forgiving system if you die... and I died a lot. It can be finicky at times and you may need to have some pretty good timing if you want to get through the story quickly. Pick it up maybe at a sale. I had a blast."

Note: I love this thing. It's a cute story with a fun flowing game play. Once you get in the ""swing"" of things it has a good feel to it."
7682,"He definitley didn't touch me

gg ez"
7683,It's good. I find grabbing onto objects with your beam a bit tricky. You have to time it just right or else you'll fall.
7684,"Great game that sucks you into the world instantly.

The only bad thing about the game is how short it is. I would've loved a ASAMU 2, because it deserves it."
7685,"This is a really great game. Story is kind of like a childs fairy tale, easy to get to grips with. The levels are unique and well designed. I would totally love to VR this game. I hope the developers make a sequel!"
7686,I really liked this game 10/10
7687,"A Story About my Uncle is a fantastic, beautiful, well crafted and at times incredibly infuriating game. It is just hard enough to keep you interested and trying without being annoying. The story and voice acting are great, the design and graphics are beautiful. My only complaint is its a little short, I finished it comfortably in 4 hours without rushing. Time Trail is a neat twist too for replay-ability. 
9.5/10"
7688,A very well thought out game. The gameplay is around 5 hours and it tells the story about the main character's uncle. Beautiful graphics and gameplay. Definitely try it out
7689,Short and sweet. Very enjoyable.
7690,"There are many things I like about this game.  It's movement method is different and works smoothly (albeit a bit unrealistically some times) and the story was interesting enough.  But overall I just found the game too damn annoying.

I think this is for two main reasons:

1 - Lack of believability.  Ok, its a fantasy game -  I get that.  But the world is just too insane. I think its was the ""star haven"" level that did it for me.  We were led to believe that an advanced civilisation actually moves around their world by swining on magic beams instead of just building ruddy bridges.  It's just too stupid.  And if you fall? You're dead.  Great.  So in what reality is this ok for people to just die all the time just moving from one damn building to the next?  It just doesn't make sense.  It's the sort of thing that if this was a dream, I would realise I was dreaming because its just too damn stupid.

2 - Unable to determine perspective.  Can I reach that rock?  Oh no, that rock is a mile away.  What about this rock, oh that's jumpable.  But they look the damn same!  You have to keep jumping around to change the camera angle to try and get some idea of how far away these objects are.  And trying to judge the distance to some rocks is impossible, you are just forced to keep trying and dying, not because you got your timings wrong, but because it was impossible to determine the distance to the object.

Another minor point, but some times the auto save checkpoints were slightly too far apart, which made some of the tricky jump sequences even more annoying.  Generally the checkpoints were well spaced out, but there were one or two times where it was too far.

I wanted to like this, the mystery of the story was good, but I just found it a little bit too annoying.  I don't like ""jumpy"" games (i.e. where you have to precariously jump from ledge to ledge) so in retrospect maybe this wasn't the right game for me."
7691,VERY NICE GAME AND STORY :)
7692,"Story is the kind of you lie you can tell kids about knowing they will fill in the gaps with amazing. No plot twists or intresting layering. Characters are terrible. Character development is null. Clunky awkward controlls. Terrain screws you over whole game. Actual jumping is really easy but because the of the controlls or the terrain you keep failing what actually is easy.

More effort has been taken to model the intro building than most of the levels. They are just a skybox and a few platforms. Most reused more than once. The caves have hitbox problems everywhere. In a game that lets you go everywhere you kinda have to model everywhere.

Grappel feels slow, you often actually slow down using it. Rocket boots shakes the screen violenlty,and high jump has to be charged. All in all I ended up not wanting to use my abilites unless I absolutely had to. There is no penalty of keeping the charged jump charged, so you end up holding down the button the whole game so its there when you need it. If you walk on uneven terrain and press space you may acidentialy activate rocket boots. Respawning and jumping keeps the falling animation so you need to randomly pause to reset it. In a game about falling 90% of the time? 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs some of the most tight and responsive first-person platforming I‚Äôve ever played.‚Äù
78 / 100 ‚Äì PC Gamer
Mr. PCGamer obviuosly never played any pc games before. Tight and responsive is like Quake. Not like this. Sorry.

Its on the short side, and never really explores or expands on the mechanics.

Recomended if your parents pay. Some of the environments are cool. Not terrible."
7693,"One of my favorites, very good"
7694,i would love to see a dx11 remake or sequel to this game
7695,"Great first-person platforming/adventure game.  The puzzles/platforming was well balanced; I had fun!  The movement mechanics in this game feel good to use.

I loved the story-telling aspect of it (father telling his daughter a story from his past).  Also, the ending was excellent and was a wonderful way finish.  Hit me in the feels.

One other note, if you play this game:  take the time to look around Uncle Fred's house at the start and later.  I really liked all the bits and pieces of Uncle Fred's life strewn about, the hints of the many adventures he's had."
7696,"This game is pretty good, the gameplay revolves around grappling on to objects and performing parkour in the levels. The story isn't bad, but it's not telltale walking dead season 1 or fallout new vegas quality. This game takes about 3 hours to beat, and is quite fun, but as i said, it is sadly very short. Overall, if you're looking for a good way to kill an hour every now and then, I would reccomend buying this game."
7697,"The only downside of this refreshingly original game is its size, other than that I enjoyed it a lot kudos"
7698,"A Story About My Uncle? 

More like Falling Simulator, because i suck at this game."
7699,"A Story About My Uncle has you catapulting yourself and flying through the air grappling from location to location. You feel like Spider-Man but with a suit that allows you to jump to great heights and grapple. The game does a good job making you use and conserve your momentum to get to different locations and although there are some frustrating sections the overall game puts together a great challenege even though the game is ~4 hours. The sound, music and story are all amazing with the story growing on you overtime. There are some special collectibles to find which makes the player not rush through the game but try to explore behind some areas to see if they can find them. I wish the game was longer because once you get the hang of the game mechanics and really start to master them the game is over. There are time trials and other challenges/achievements available for those looking for more."
7700,gud game
7701,f u but it
7702,"Part way through and really enjoying this game so far. The mechanics are solid, I never felt as if the game cheated me if I mis-timed a jump/swing. Enjoying the framing device (father telling a story to his daughter at bedtime) and the general design of the universe. 

It runs perfectly fine on my I5 4600K/R9 380 with Vsync enabled. 

The only thing I currently wish for is an unlimted grapple option on game completion so I can free-swing around the levels and explore all the nooks and crannies."
7703,"+ amazing satisfying movement mechanics for crazy traversing
+ stunning ending where i just went ""[b]WOOOW[/b]""
+ sneaky secrets which create a great replay value

10/10 would recommend exspecially if on sale"
7704,"A charming adventure with lovely graphics and warm story about a family member, with unique dynamic, yet zen-like gameplay.
Warm reccomendation. :)"
7705,"Very cute game, but a bit short (finnished the story in 3hrs). Easy gameplay and interesting characters, even the realy nice story makes you to play it again and again. The graphics are not the best, but good enough for a story driven game. There's also an extra to play all the different levels on time. It took me very long to beat the given records ^^
All in all, if you're looking for a short but beautiful sunday-afternoon game, A Story About My Uncle would do the best!!"
7706,"this game looked great and had a cool looking preview but, the game was very short (completed in 3 hours) and the game play was repetitive. on sale 50% off maybe, not full price."
7707,'tis good
7708,This is what i have needed. I had been stuck playing multi-player online games for a long time now since i lost most of my joy from single player experiences but this gave it back.
7709,"Fantastic game, short but sweet. Mechanics feel fantastic for the most part, story is engaging."
7710,nice
7711,Completely nonviolent game; just great 3D platformer and grapple action; with wonderful art and some story.
7712,the story is awsome and everything alse is too
7713,"It's like a interactive movie.
Not in a bad way.
The story is that good."
7714,"Fun, different, and replayable :)


The game might be short, but it is absolutely worth the money. And with multiple achievements to get you can spend alot more time on this game than I've done at the time of writing this.

Yes, there are stuff about this game that could have been better, and you will likely notice. But it doesn't take much away from the overall story and feeling of spiderman-ness ;)

Higly recomended/10"
7715,"Story, character design, npc animations, glitches - meh.
Feeling like Spideman in a sci-fi-suit - damn nice."
7716,"good, light-hearted game, worth it on sale.

you can clearly see the love the devs put into this project."
7717,By downloading this game; You will tell a story about your awesome Uncle. You WILL do it again. 10/10
7718,Spending too much time w Uncle might not be such a good thing right (Õ†‚âñ Õú ñÕ†‚âñ)
7719,This was such a great game. Probably the best single player game imo. Great enthralling story with good graphics. However the only problem I had with this game was the length. If this was longer it would be so great. And nearly a third of my hours on the game has just been idle and giving the game a second go. Overall great game just needed to be longer and it would of been amazing.
7720,"Amazing game, has some of the most stunning visuals of any game. Sadly it's very short as i could be knocked out is a couple of hours, but is well worth the expierence. It's worth a 2nd playthough as you dont get to apreciate your surroundings as much first time through as you have to be focused on what you are doing. This game makes me hope for a sequal or community maps. Even as the movement mechanics are simple, they are so fun, it would make for a great VR portif you just put a fan in front of your face to feel the wind rush past you. I cannot praise how fun this game is even wothout the challange modes, it's worth it to everyone to play it at least once."
7721,"9.8 out of 10. loses .2 point becuase of durration. amazing story telling, almost like an enteractive movie. best 4 hours I have spent playing videogames"
7722,Relaxing narrative story game
7723,"Mixed review:

I bought the game on sale for around 50 cents so it was good value for me, I wouldn't pay the full asking price though.

Pros:
+Graphics
+Soundscape
+Story
+Unique and interesting game mechanics

Cons:
-Frustrating, repetitive platforming gameplay
-Very poor signposting (often had no idea where I'm supposed to go)
-Awkward controls
-Weak voice acting, the protagonist sounds like he's doing a Derek Zoolander impression
-Characters look like uninspired Avatar clones

The game is fairly short and makes for an unusual experience with first person platforming but I found myself frustrated by lots of the platforming segments. You'll often miss jumps by a few centimeters and have to lose progress, retrying parts which feels irritating, this would be fine if the game was difficult but I often felt I was working against the controls and physics not my own lack of skill.

Some parts of the game are really dark and it's very vague where you're meant to go, there are a few sections you can skip and make your own path, which I don't think the devs intended.

Later on in the game checkpoints are spread further apart in a poorly designed way to make the game last longer. All it does is irritate the player.

There are a few bugs where you can clip through walls and get caught on the edges of platforms.

The story was fairly nice for a short game and the childlike adventure is interesting but don't expect too much from it.

There is some replayability with the time trials and achievements but I felt no incentive to replay any of it. The game felt largely unenjoyable because of the mundane platforming."
7724,"This is one of the best single player games I've played. It's a distinct single player adventure game that has a great story line, great gameplay, and great game mechanics. Definetly something you should try if you're into adventure games."
7725,"Thinking that the game would be so mysteriously acceptable for young ages to play from the gameplay and story line of it. Although I recommend you buy this product when it's on discount *in my own opinion* since I prefer playing multiplayer online games which this game doesn't, but hey it's your life your choice. I won't stop you."
7726,Too short but I enjoyed every second of it. Thank you.
7727,"I bougth his game to get some feeling of the mechanics as I would like to build a game which involves hooks. And I ended up enjoying it a lot. Really cool game with a nice story. Good job guys!

PS. Thanks for making it available for linux :D"
7728,Best $12 in a while
7729,"I am a little bit undecided about recommending this game or not. Graphics and sound are really nice, the game mechanics are flawless and the story is OK... but it didn't feel like having fun. I had to retry many jumps three to five times and I often had no idea where I have to go. There are some inconsistencies where to and from what distance you can attach your graple. Somtimes it attaches everywhere and sometimes only to certain objects. Additionally the game isn't that rewarding: If you manage one jump, there are simply more jumps to come. On the plus side there are many checkpoints and you simply respawn without losing anything if you fall down ...and you will fall down many times..."
7730,"Get this game on sale!

I really enjoyed playing this. It is very atmospheric and the feeling of flying through the air was unlike any other gaming experience. The graphics are fair quality, but the different islands are all beautiful. Overall gameplay was good.. there were a few spots I wish there were a save point and there wasn't... but I still thought everything was very well made. The story left a little something to be desired, but you would just have to see for yourself. I do feel this game is a bit overpriced at $12 for only 2-3 hours of gameplay.

[h1]Story summarization (Potential spoilers, MARKED tho, go further down for more of the review)[/h1]

When you start up the game, you are playing the young version of a man, who is telling his daughter a bedtime story, the ""Story about my uncle"". As your progress further in this child version of his in the game, you continuesly hear the voice of his adult-self telling the story you are currently experiencing.
[spoiler]You, the young father, discovered a secret room in your uncle's house. In that room you find a suit fitting you perfectly and a launch platform that will pop you right into a world created by your uncle, in which the game plays out. Because of a note you find in said room, you know that your uncle is somewhere in this, by himself created, world and you go out to look for him, meeting the various people living in this strange new world. You will find new friends, avoid big enemies and fly, swing and boost your way through your uncle's ""Garbage disposal"", which is what this world previously started as.[/spoiler]

[h1]Personal opinion[/h1]

A Story about my uncle is a beautiful First-Person jump and run ""Puzzle""-game, with an adorable artstyle, nicely flashed out characters, a great storytelling and a playtime appropriate for a game like this.
I recommend this game to anyone who likes to play these kind of games, and to everyone who is looking for a short and relaxing, but very well told story.

A very nice experience.
"
7750,"I loved this game. Light on system resources. And beautiful graphics to boot!! Then the gameplay starts after a brief introduction providing impetus to your quest. The first thing that grabs you is the lovely movement mechanics. Grappling and swinging through the air is an exhilarating experience. With continuous upgrades dripfed throughout the adventure, the developers masterfully nudge you to experiment with what you can do with your grapple and jet boots. Later in the game, an ice cave level pushes your learned skills to the limit. Sometimes the traversal can be frustrating, but the game is always fair and provides check points liberally. There's a real sense of accomplishment when you crack a particularly tricky section and slam down only to trigger the save point. The graphics are beautfil and haunting. So is the music. This is a simple game that can be completed quickly. I wholeheartedly recommend this clean, nonviolent, wholesome entertainment product to anyone with a love for movement based fantasy adventures."
7751,üëç
7752,"This game is very well polished for the amount of staff it had on its development team. The controls feel pretty tight, yet fluid and allow for a very entertaining platforming experience. The momentum has weight and because of the controls and map design, you can creatively swing and jump around to get to your destination. Highly reccomend."
7753,"The title 'A Story About My Uncle' may be a bit misleading, because the story in this game is actually pretty bad. there isnt much to it, and the ending is fairly unsatisfying. However, the actual gameplay mechanics in the game are very well executed and if you are simply looking for a game to play where you can enjoy the grandiose feeling of being able to fly around and perform various satisfying maneuvers in the air (as i was when i bought this game) then youve come to the right place. This is a game where for the majority of the time I played it as a way to just chill and listen to some music while flying through levels and not having to focus too much to play it. 
That being said, the story is still a bit of a let-down in a way and I was a bit disappointed because the game could have been much better if it had a good script to go along with the awesome gameplay mechanics. If youre looking for a game with an enticing storyline and mind-bending plot twists, this isnt what youre looking for.

However, i still thoroughly enjoyed the experience as it is a much more relaxed game and could be one for speed-runs or just as a way to take a break from the more serious games out there. 

ill give it a 9/10 for mechanics and the sensation it generates
and 3/10 for story.

would recommend if it is on sale."
7754,BAD!
7755,"I just finished my second playthrough of the game. The first one I did a few years back. It's just as wonderful and amazing as I remember it. I even found a few things along the way that I didn't before.

The story telling in the game is wonderful. The way the narrator speaks like he is still telling his daughter the bedtime story of a story about his uncle and how he went to find him. It really emerses you as if you're playing through a vivid flashback. 

The gameplay is fluid and easy to understand. The controls are as they should be and the graphics aren't really all that bad for when it was made (especially since it was a small indie game). 

And as I did the first time I played, I cried at the end. It's a very touching and heart ripping ending, but in a very bitter-sweet way. It reminds me of my own seperation from people that I have loved deeply but ended up parting ways with for the better. (Although I must say that I did my first playthrough with my ex-boyfriend watching me stream it as we talked to eachother and playing it a second time brought back some... memories).

Over all amazing game, beautifully told story and the delivery of the gameplay and story were excellent."
7756,Nice game to play while listening to music. Not too hard but still challenging.
7757,"Absolutely a fun game and worth playing. 

It is rather tricky to get through however as the whole game is more or less a long puzzle. I like the little story there is and it is absolutely one of the better walking simulators I've played to date.

Also, Maddie is one cute character."
7758,Anyone who calls themselves a gamer should play this asap.
7759,"I feel like I ran into an abnormal amount of glitchyness in regards to grapple mechanic which everyone says is very smooth, I must disagree. Which isn't to say it was terrible but my grapple would break off sometimes while I was still holding on to the surface. Ending was nice but I find the overall story lacking. It's alright."
7760,"Very satisfying game but still has a bit of a challenge. Short as fuck though, I finished it in under 2 hours because I abused the shit out of the rocket boots. I'd say it has about 2-5 hours of gameplay depending on how much you play movement oriented games and whether you use the rocket boots on every single jump or not. It's fun as fuck while it lasts and a few bits I'd replay 100 times. Definitely buy while on sale but $13 for 2-5 hours isn't the best value for everyone. Then again I'd rather have 2-5 hours of fun than 20-50 hours of boring gameplay. Thumbs down though cuz I was tryna get over my ex whose name is Madeleine aka Maddy while I played this so it activated cripplingdepression.exe"
7761,"Grappling hooks are fun, plot didn't have me invested but the platforming and visuals kept me engaged all the way through"
7762,"The story is ok, the graphics are alright. Grappling and running around the world was nice. Controls worked most of the time, although sometimes I got flung in random directions. There are five big levels/sections that you cross, and the platforming challenges were varied enough to be fun. This game was not too difficult, but it was short. Overall it is pretty average and I would reccomend it only if you like these sorts of platforming games."
7763,"This game is seriously amazing.
It just has a really cool unique general idea and feel to it and the controlls are really simple, yet the game still can get quite complex and requires skill on the mouse...
The graphics aren't that detailed, but they are very effective. It has a nice feel to it and I think the graphics style suits the game perfectly.
The story isn't anything special, probably due to the game being rather short, but there still was a decent enough story line and at times even I shed a metaphorical tear or two... no spoilers though...

Would deffinitely play again and reccommend..."
7764,I legit almost cried at the end. This game was incredible.
7765,"it's neat. story of a boy searching for his missing uncle in a fantasy type world. gameplay consists of jumping around and using a fancy grapple hook to climb great heights and fly long distances. gives a fun feeling of speed and altitude. took me four hours to beat, which isn't that long, but for twelve dollars i think that's an ok value."
7766,"Short, sweet, fun, and heartwarming. Actual thoght was put into this game, and it was worth every penny."
7767,"Free falling and so nice, too bad there is not more to it"
7768,"It's been a while since I played this, so I thought, why not review? While not the best platformer I've played, this one was pretty good. Got me right in the feels at the end, too. Definitely worth a look."
7769,"Great gameplay and decent story which is narrated through the whole game, could have been a bit longer... Interesting game mechanics, very pretty and detained game. Enjoyed it till the end."
7770,So good
7771,"good concept, terrible execution."
7772,"Games are supposed to be fun. Some games are supposed to be challenging to give the player a greater sense of satisfaction when overcoming the challenges. Some games are no fun, nor challenging, they are just bad. A Story about My Uncle is one of those bad games. There is nothing challenging about it, just pure frustration coming from bad design. Repeating a section over and over again does not make you better at handling the situation because there is no challenge behind gameplay, but pure luck. The so-called ""beam"" is completely illogic: sometimes it can reach miles further, sometimes it can't reach a few inches forward because the stiff level design does not allow it. As once the late Pete Steele said,  ""don't mistake lack of talent for genius"". This game wants to be different, to be art, but it's nothing more than pure garbage -  hipsterish, artsy, but still garbage. Avoid at all costs and spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
7773,"It's good for podcasts, but that's about it. 6/10"
7774,he touched me
7775,Chill game :)
7776,i like this uncle guy
7777,"So I played this game quite a while ago and realized I didn't review it, and it definitely deserves review. Revisiting it, I'm actually pretty surprised this game isn't at least a little more popular than it is, because it was pretty incredible. Given that you're not the type of person to get motion sickness with a lot of video game movement, this game is super fun and active, and the story drives curiosity deeper and deeper."
7778,One of my favourite games i have ever played! Its a must buy.
7779,"Very atmospheric, chill, exploration game. The feeling of flying is very satisfying and oddly idyllic. The narration was soothing and made me want to explore the world. I really enjoyed this one.

A casual playthrough of the story took me about 4 hours, which I think sufficed, although I would have liked another open area.

So if you like to take your time, explore, experience a cozy story - and well, want to soar through the air - then I think you will enjoy this game! Besides that there's some challenges, which I haven't tried, but that's it. So if these things don't appeal to you, then this is probably not the game for you."
7780,Thorougly enjoyed the game. Excelent pacing. Ran really well on my old Linux-based system with a Radeon HD 7750.
7781,"Nice little indie game, with one really fleshed out mechanic.

The movement is fluid and the whole grappling mechanic is executed rather well. The visuals are decent too, but the story is just all over the place. 

The writing is simply quite bad, characters are typical archtypes and spout clich√© lines. Plot elements are incoherent, the worldbuilding is nonsensical. This may have been the point, since this is a children's story, but it seems like they put in some effort here and there just not everywhere. The story introduces two seperate villages and doesn't do anything with this concept.

The theme of the game seems to be finding one's place in the world. This is demonstrated through two characters and not much else. I can barely call this a character arc, 
"
7782,"All thought the game is very short and not that difficult, it's still one of the greatest story driven games I've played. The graphics are not fantastic, but they work. The fact that the game is more focused on telling a story then making this a graphical pleasing game, makes you forget about the rough edges on some of the characters and enables you to focus on the great story being told by Gone North Games. The story is fantastic (9.5/10), the gameplay is decent (6/10) and the graphical experience is also decent (6.5/10). But as I mentioned, this is a story driven game and taking that in to consideration the game gets a solid 8.5/10."
7783,"Had this game from when it came out. Played it for 20 hours 4 years later played it again because of nostalgia probably, and then this amazing game was over. Whish there was a sequel. (: loved it every minute.

edit: i came back to it another 2 years later and now im replaying the whole game... i truly enjoy this singleplayer short story... please make a sequel im begging you!"
7784,"Pros
Good Story with deeper meaning
Nice Graphics
Simple but relaxing music
Great Concept

Cons 
3 hours 
half time of gameplay was to pass some obstacles
Awful gameplay
Repetitive
Price (13 euros are waaay too much for 3 hours gameplay)
No map or something to give you a simple direction where you must go

Though i would really to reccomend the game i simply cannot...The worst part is the gameplay for me..
I really want to see indie developers or smal companies go well but they have to earn it.
If the gameplay was better i would definetely recommend it.But at some points i realy got pissed ."
7785,"I have mixed feelings here, but you can see the thumbs-up already.  Take it with a grain of salt.

Good:
-Movement is mostly responsive and feels good.
-Graphics are pretty.
-Some of the collectables and interactive objects are pretty well hidden.

Mixed:
-Despite some reviews complaining about bugs, I had few and even those didn't break the game.
-Story is like something you'd tell an six-year-old.  Simple and cute, and doesn't take very long to tell.
-The music and sound won't haunt your dreams, but they get the job done.
-Moderate difficulty, though most of it is observation and trial-and-error.
-Rather short.  My listed gameplay time is how long it took me to complete the story mode.  I wasn't in a rush, 
-Having two jumps feels weird.  You have a normal ""hold the key/button to jump different heights"" jump and a power jump that has a set value.

Bad:
-When the controls flounder, it's pretty bad.
--The tether tries to pull you straight to the anchor point, but the slightest brush with floating objects while in midair kills most of your forward momentum.
--Colliding with objects with the tether active has a nasty knack for turning off the tether and immediately dropping you like a rock.  This applies to the floating vertical rectangular blocks in the ice cave, when travlling upwards and you bump into the side.  Instead of turning the tether off and you fly upwards, your momentum ceases to exist and you drop.
--Jumping when on a slope pushes you slightly sideways, away from the slope.  There are thankfully few cases where you have to line up a jump at an angle from a slope, but those are still annoying to adjust for.

Overall:
Short, but pleasant.
If you enjoy movement games like Mirror's Edge and Valley, you'll probably enjoy this.
Recommended, but pick it up on sale."
7786,"How dfaq I never knew about this game?!
I recently saw it being played on an old video of some cancerous chin-defficient YouTuber, and I really liked it, decided to check it up and possibly buy it - but I already had it in my libary (probably from some bundle I got years ago).

Graphic is simplistic yet very well utilized (charming and very creative, reminds me of Psyhonauts), story is almost non-existant yet competent and unimportant, but the most important bit - gameplay... is what games should be like. Free flowing movement is extremely satisfying and puts you into that zen state most of us started playing games to begin with.

For negatives I have only two very petty things: its very short game (If you are not IQ defficient like me to get stuck on some very simple puzzles, its probably 4hrs of gameplay in total), and it subscribes to that old school achievement idea where they do not give you achievements for 1st time not crappying your nappie; in this game you have to earn them! I finished the game completely in fairly competent manner, and got 0 achievements unlocked. So if you want achievements - youll have to earn them!

Conclusion? There is no reason not to play this game! If you get trough some rough patch in your life, this might actually help a lot cos its very relaxing, and it costs dirt cheap on any sales."
7787,Worth buying while on sale for $5.00 or less.
7788,"very fun game, worth btw played it twice"
7789,"Something about 3D environements always let's developers fail miserably...

A Story about my Uncle has indeed a nice story on the cheeky and heartwarming side. Otherwise it's a 3D platformer. Good level design, beautiful surroundings and a compelling mix of game mechanics do the rest to make it a real gem. Superjumping, grappling hook with 3 charges and rocket boots keep their promise of a fun game. It even manages to be relaxing in a way. Checkpoints are never too far back and usually really close to each other. And you will fall a lot. But between the first boss ""fight"", the scenic views, and the fear of heights that got triggered only once or twice for me, there lurks an evil, that befowls each and every 3D platforming game there is --> The Unbeatable Barrier.
What I mean by that is simple. Each 3D platformer that I have ever played always came to the point where I could not seem to progress. In this case, it is the falling boxes. The whole game teaches you to look around, enjoy exploring, take your time. Then: grapple and boost for your life ... and then die anyway. This section is so far away from the rest of the game, and was such a frustrating experience (or specifically 47x ~20second experiences) that I stopped, ragequit, watched the rest of the story elsewhere and deinstalled. They even managed to invent new but equally upsetting ice-physics.
I am happy to have played it. It's a good game. But why do GNG need to go out of their way to produce extra assets for just that section, introduce a mechanic never seen elsewhere and never needed again, in a cave you go in and out without sense, just to annoy the player who enjoyed the regular game so far? After the boxes, it seems to be hard but manageable platforming again without further disturbances. 
So yeah, if (IF!!) you can come past the boxes, you get a good game for 4h of entertainement at a slightly too high price.

7790,beautiful game with a nice story.
7791,"This game is amazing! The story is lacking a bit and at the start it was lagging but othr than that I totally recommend it! After I finished the first play through I found myself going back to my favorite parts, listening to music, and just playing this game over and over. The atmosphere of the game is beautiful, the grafics are amazing, and the flying mechanics are very satisfying! Amazing. The only thing I didnt like was the story, it was slightly boring but most of the time you were flying through on a magical light rope so I can't be that mad. The price is worth it."
7792,"When I first played this game I was loving it, I couldn't stop playing it. 2 years later and I am still addicted. The story is very well told and the characters are easy to become attached to. 100% upvoted game!"
7793,"Repetitive gameplay. Trailer makes it look interesting, but it gets tired real quick. But here's the worst part. The major mechanic, this grapple ability you see, it works only in a very narrow band, and outside of that you end up falling constantly. You can master this and it's less a problem, but then... Does the game look like you can fly your way through in a path of your choosing? No. Massively linear, only one way to do things. 1 part only had my interest. If you like simple and pretty with some mechanical skill but repetitive, great. Good concept, but under developed."
7794,"Unica coisa ruim √© que √© curto, mas √© um puta jogasso"
7795,"Nice game for anyone looking to chill out with some simple game. You will find your way around the landscape easily, even if you fail a few times. The story is short and simple, while still beying interesting. 

I totally recommend this game to any type of gamer."
7796,"An platforming adventure game where a guy tells his daughter a story about his uncle. The swinging and platforming could put off a few people, but overall a short and sweet game!"
7797,if you have thought of suicide do not play this game
7798,"I've never played a game so frustrating yet so calming and addictive. The story is actually very simple but it's an atmospheric and good story. Too bad it's a little short and i was expecting [spoiler]a boss battle with The Eye or something, it's missing a climax.[/spoiler]

8,5/10 would hit Maddie's head to the ceilings again."
7799,"I was expecting something big something interesting, trailer promised good story and cought me. What i got: bugs, infinite number of trying to pass something, super small story which was not catchy as it looked like, If you want story, its not for you, if you want casual game, its not for you, if you want fun, its not for you. If you want to spend hours just trying to pass some small gap with limitted grapples, its just for you. Not my type of game, because its either 50%+ bugs or either its super boring game for someone who likes to do same things for hours. Gladly steam offers a refund option."
7800,The game is good but I think that if you add an open world next to the story Mode the game will gain a longer life.
7801,A nice little game. Not bad.
7802,"Good as a one-and-done title for me. Speed runners would probably like it more. It's a solid length; doesn't overstay its welcome. The sense of speed and flying through the air is fun, but some jumps simply aren't well-designed, and the sections with moving platforms are almost ALWAYS a drag. Give it a go if its on sale."
7803,"During my short time playing this game, I had a blast.

From the swinging from floating rock to rock to the jumping and boosting to far away platforms even to the beautiful graphics, A Story about my Uncle is definately on my watchlist for a sequil. Due to the graphical limitations of the 2014 era, I was suprised they made the game look so good. (I'm not dissing on any other 2014 or older games, but in my opinion, they just didnt look too good.) The mechanic of ASAMU (a story about my uncle) of being able to grab floating walls and rocks kind of reminded me of the portal series, one of my favorite franchises. Although the story wasn't too strong, it made up in gameplay.

I felt that the platform-esque levels of ASAMU was a good way to show off all your cool abilities. They weren't too easy, but they were definately not Dark Souls level. I was able to finish the game in just about 3 hours, but I didn't try to do the extra speedrun mode. I found the levels to be kind of hard to repeat. Once you've done them once, you're kind of like, ""Do I really want to do this again."" Its one of those wierd feelings.

Final Scoring: (out of 10)
Easy - Hard:                        6
Entertaining - Boring:         9
Bad Price - Good Price:       5

Overall: 7"
7804,Really good game with magical ingame look. The story and game are pretty short but still really good.
7805,"Lovely story!
hope there will be a part 2,
because we are left with a bit of a cliffhanger, what is fred doing now?
love!!"
7806,Mindless fun when I get tilted at other games. Don't remember any of the dialog still a solid 7/10
7807,The story about your weird uncle and his weird sexual fixation towards frog people....
7808,"Nice and relaxing and with a good movement mechanic (the grapple). Had great performance on my machine which is essential for first-person platforming. I found myself immersed in the atmosphere achieved by the artists. So, although very short, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
7809,"I finished the game for the first time in about 90 minutes. I could have refunded it, yet I chose not to. Cause this game might be very short and pretty easy but it was so much joy to play. There is something so enchanting about discovering this gorgeous and mysterious world as you rush through it, striving to keep your momentum. You don't have to be fast, that's up to you, but being able to complete a segment without ever stopping feels really good.

All in all this game is nothing that will blow your mind. It's a simple game, with a simple yet enchanting story and it feels great."
7810,"Honestly this game is actually really great. I bought this game awhile ago and really never touched it, I regret doing that. The parkour, puzzles, and the acting is really good I love it. But its really not that long I wish it was longer, it has a really great storyline though.

If you want a game that has a really great story, and a fantasticly uniqe way of moving the story foward this is for you."
7811,"I had enjoyment out of playing this. I liked it. 

Cons - ugly frog people and a little bit short

Pros - music, story"
7812,It's a good game under $20.
7813,"Nice art style, great idea... but frustrating game.

I got the game via Humble Bundle, and is 4-5 years late to the party.
However, I don't undestand many of the reviews here that say that the game is too easy, or takes only a few hours?

I played 5 hours, and this includes cheating my way through the last level.

The game starts out great. You feel like superman with your new found power.

However later in the game is gets difficult to a frustrating point.
Often you will find yourself confused on where to go, or how to do it.
Solving the later puzzles works like this:
Look around and find some path that could probably be the right one. Jump out into nothingness many time and slowly learn what the developers thought was the correct solution for this part.
Try to execute the plan, probably failing 50 times while learning.

When you finally make it, then theres just another boring section like it.
The story makes you want to finish the game, but even here you're rewarded with not more than even more questions.

The grappeling mechanic is fun to begin with, but is poorly designed. For example you can grapple your way, but you cannot hang on a ledge, as the grapple drops you as soon as you ""wind it all the way in.""
I would have prefered a more rope like grapple, enabling one to swing around... but while this is sort of the idea in the game, it is poorly executed.. and depends more on luck than skill.


If you are the type of person who wants a difficult game, where trying again and again is required to ""win"", then this may be for you.
If you, like me, are looking for a casual cozy game... look somewhere else.


"
7814,Gets you really soaked into the story!
7815,"Really good game with magical ingame look. The story and game are pretty short but still really good.
8.5/10"
7816,A short game that plays around jumping and swinging puzzles with a cute and fun story to tell.
7817,A nice and relaxing adventure game!
7818,"Great first person platforming game, requires a lot of timing of jumps and abilities to make the most of it.
Beautiful artstyle and a compassionate story about a boy looking for his older relative. Some surprises but its quite nice overall. Pushing on a bit now in age, but it's still a great experience.

Only issues are with optimisation, but nothing a few minutes in the settings to fiddle with graphics couldn't fix,"
7819,"Hands down one of the best games on steam, i mean for the price when i bought it, its an amazing game. The graphics are pretty amazing, even if youre playing on low-medium. It has a pretty great story, and can take a while to master. Its a pretty fun casual singleplayer game, and if youre looking for like a ""peaceful"" game then this is definetly a good choice, being that there is a lot of adventure mixed in with the calm esthetics of the game."
7820,"[h1]Nice mini game :)[/h1]
Is small and simple but good."
7821,"Isn't it interesting that we all have that one funny Uncle? The boy has an uncle that travels to new worlds, I have an uncle who goes in my room at night and locks the door! :D"
7822,"cool
"
7823,"Short but sweet - Really enjoyed it, and worth picking up on sale.
9/10"
7824,"Really interesting story, fun gameplay. Very relaxing. I would recommend"
7825,"a bit buggy saves...but game is great ;p just it doesnt look like uncle...doesnt touch leg or say ""shh dont tell mom"" :/ i give it 8 ruined childhoods of 10"
7826,There should be a DLC for this game. Beat it way too fast. But it is one of my favorite games of all time. highly recommended.
7827,"If I could give a ""maybe"" score, I'd select that for A Story About My Uncle. I can see why some may like it but I can also see why others may not. Though I found the gameplay mechanics and story interesting, I just didn't find myself liking it, to me it felt more of a chore than I expected to complete, which I'm surprised at. Perhaps it's because the it felt far too linear and clear to me how to solve the parkour puzzles and perhaps it's that I didn't really find the story as compelling on a literal or philosophical level as most people. But, looking at it all together, it's a decent game, definitely not one I would wish to downvote and certainly one I know many others would find enjoyment in."
7828,This is like surfing in counter strike but better
7829,"Took about 3 hours to beat, One of the most intresting story games i've played in awhile. The gameplay mechanics really got me hooked. I'd reccomend this to anyone whos looking for a short and sweet story! Very good!"
7830,I fucking love you but I hate you at the same time
7831,"I wish the gameplay had gotten the polish of the visuals. The movement is fluid and precise for a 3d platformer, but the novelty wears off fast, only the changing scenery and the paperthin backstory keeps it together. The secrets are well hidden, but the levels otherwise are very linear. There are alternate paths, but the main one is so obvious and easy that unless someone aims to speedrun this, there's no reason to experiment, just go from checkpoint to checkpoint. It's a pity, because the architecture of the levels is very promising, vast canyons and caves remain under-utilized, what looks like open horizon turns out to be an illusion, looking back the path is a straight narrow line and the rest is a bit tacky background. Also the description is inaccurate, there is no parkour here, and no grappling hook either, it's more like a magnet, or tractor beam, promising a lot of mobility but delivering little. This game could have been much better very easily, but it's still a very unique experience."
7832,AWESOME GAME I LOVE IT. just sad that the story is about 4hrs
7833,great game
7834,"This game is a great story-based game, and it has a very adventurous atmosphere! It's really a fun and enjoyable game."
7835,"Its very fun. I love the mechanics and the game. But its too short. My first playthrough was 2 hours long. Then, i finished the game again in 45 minutes. I feel this would be very cool to speedrun, it's like CSGO Surf. Its just something you play when you wanna see something cool"
7836,"TL;DR: 5/10. Would be a decent short game, but a bug with saving destroys replay-ability and forces one to finish it in one sitting.

Just finished playing through the main story line. Steam recorded it as 3 hours of play time. The game is a descent game, but nothing spectactular. It *would* stand as a real 5/10. However, there are save issues with the game. Specifically, for some users it doesn't save. After finishing the first run through I went to try and go back to levels to work on achievements, but everything was locked and in a state as if I never played it before. Nothing I collected in the game was even recorded. I hadn't even exited out of the game, and all progress had been lost. Some users on the forum suggest changing folder permissions for the save directory, but mine already had full rights. Unfortunately, given this issue, which makes nearly all achievements unlockable, and severely limits replayability, I cannot recommend this game."
7837,"A fantastic game, very underrated.  Requires patience to master, but the platforming is incredibly satisfying. The messages it preaches are childish and immature, but the gameplay is great."
7838,"Kid on crack explores a cave and finds a pedo who pretends to behis uncle and made a cult of frog people










10/10"
7839,"This game made me cry, it still does.. 
"
7840,"This games is very short. Even though it is short it offers a very fun time and you‚Äôll actually want to do the challenges. The game offer a unique storyline and is one of the only fun non violent games, definitely recommend picking it up if it‚Äôs on sale. However, this games offers little to no replay value and that after I had finished the main game, I didn‚Äôt want to play it again as it would feel like a chore. It offers a fun time for a bit but it will be short lived."
7841,A nice adventure alongside with a nice story. The gameplay is all about getting through obstacles with the device you have. Make your way and find your uncle!
7842,"This game is amazing! The movement feels fluid and resposive and not to mention epic. The voice acting could use some work. It wasn't bad, just not perfect. 

The only issue I have is that its fairly short, gamepaly and story wise, and I can't find anyother games that have the same feel to them. I know there are a lot a FPS PLatformers but this one is fantastic. 9/10"
7843,This game is absolutely amazing. I would have purchased this game for $60. The story line is simplistic and so is the gameplay. Its a very relaxed more puzzle like gameplay that is relieving and differs from the FPS dominated world of gaming at this current time. The dialogue is minimal and doesnt differ from the basic motive of the game. The game is very short but is satisfying and leaves you wanting much more. I have 12 hours into the game so far replaying it and just messing around and keep wanting to come back every few days or weeks to play it again. 10/10 buy this game.
7844,"Fantastic game, Loved it to bits. EVen if the graphics may be laking you still have a wonderful story and narative with a well crafted gameplay. If i could cry then the ending would absoloutly make me. 
Buy it, It's even worth it if you double the price"
7845,"Game is mainly about sort of ""parkouring"" around.. You get to jump and move around with a grapple.. Even using some kind of a jetpack later in game. It is fun.. Enjoyable and can be frustratingly challenging at times. Story is okay. It is just there to sort of provide you with an ultimate goal.. Something to go through while actually playing the game. I don't honestly find it that amazing.. It is an average one.. A bit above that at best.

If you are the kind of guy who rather jump around in minecraft than walking as a normal person would, or rather jump through roofs in an Assassin Creed game to reach your target than storming the streets killing everybody on sight dark-souls style.. Then i believe this game will suit you just fine!!!"
7846,its ok
7847,"A game about moving fast with super jumping and attaching yourself to things with some laser glove. Does that sound fun to you? Because it is.

The game is meh. It's very short and easy, it almost looks as if the developer wanted to make it exactly a little more than 2 hours so people can't refund the game. The graphics are bad, not terrible just bad. But I can't deny I had fun with it and my kid seemed to really like it. The story as bad as the name of this game, and the characters are really uninspired. The ending is even worse. It was too easy for my tasting. The powers your suit gives you are very limited, and you can master them in 3 minutes. If you're looking for a challenge, this game is not for you. If you have kids and a potato computer, buy it on a very nice discount, and have fun for like 3 hours!"
7848,It‚Äôs really fun to do parkour
7849,Serisouly one of the best games i've ever played if not the best.
7850,short ey eff
7851,"It's alright. Fairly one dimensional. Somewhere between a puzzle game and a parkour game, neither of which are some of my favorites. If you like either of those genres, it may be for you. Good story as well, and great way to tell the story (again, not a big fan of story / dialogue heavy games)."
7852,Everyone should have this in their library. Really fun casual game.
7853,I thought this was a story about my Uncle who shoots up heroin... but this is much better.
7854,"I wish there was a middleground between ""recommend"" and ""not recommend"". There's nothing WRONG with this game. It's fine. But it just... didn't keep me interested. Maybe it's just not for me, but the story wasn't gripping enough for me to continue. I was bored pretty early on and played about an hour and it still didn't get any more interesting for me. The story didn't progess fast enough and wasn't gripping enough for me to want to keep playing.

It's fine. Story was too boring and slow for me. Probably will never come back to it."
7855,"Fun game, Good mechanics and a nice short story. I really liked this game the only problem with it was that it is very short (2 hours on my playthrough) only having 3 main stages (cave, wind farm or something and ice cave) but to be fare i didn't get very many of the collectables so i assume that would make the game longer. and a few graphical issues mainly clipping towards the end but that is just a very minor nitpick. overall i liked this game and would recommend it."

Comment: The game is AMAZING. One of the best single player games I have ever played. The story and the atmosphere.. Everything was just fantastic. Loved the ending it was so touching.. This game needs a sequel or a part 2 someday.. I just wish the boy could stay with his uncle.. And Maddie!

Rating : 10/10"
7857,"A unique and relaxing 3D platformer. The game is short, but it's a good experience for the price."
7858,"Its offers the same pleasure of the woman in that ally by the drug store.
 However, this game is far cheaper than her so its worth it."
7859,"it good, but for real.. where the fuck my tuna pasta at??"
7860,"It's really short and it doesn't offer that much additional content. The gameplay is fun, but some of the levels can be a bit frustrating. 5.5/10, buy on sale."
7861,In the game you need to use your grapling device on stalactites that falls into the void in an ice cave with a giant whale: 25/20
7862,It's a fun but small game. Buy it on sale.
7863,"Very fun game, 0 complaints. Very mellow game to play, Had a blast! Thank you for this game!"
7864,3D platformers are honored by this game.
7865,"Pros and cons time

+ Fun grabblin n stuff
+ Somewhat creative
+ Addictive
- Dialogue is quite mediocre and lacks character
- Collectibles have no impact on the game itself
- Ending was super anticlimactic and explained practically nothing.
- Repetition. No real puzzle, just point and click all the way (well. Thats the point of this game i guess)
- 2.2 hours from start to finish. But then again if it was 4hrs+ same stuff then.. Meh.

Anyway. If you can get it for a good sale like I did I'd still recommend but as for a full prize - no."
7866,"Don‚Äôt be fooled by the rating, this isn‚Äôt a bad game. Although I just couldn‚Äôt recommend a game that lost me after spending an hour with it. The gameplay has no complexity or depth. A Story About My Uncle is a first person game where the core game mechanic is a grappling hook. Essentially, the player clicks where they want to go and they are pulled to that spot.

There is no skill or finesse needed to master this mechanic and it is the only core gameplay mechanic (unless the designers introduce more mechanics later on, but I wouldn‚Äôt know). The grappling hook reminds me of a secondary navigational mechanic that would be paired with a more interesting core mechanic. But on its own I felt that it was very weak and it failed to carry the whole experience for me.

As for the story, it failed to have any sort of intrigue for me. It was hard for me to get invested in the Uncle character because he has no presence in the story. Also, the writers use a framing device where the whole game is actually a bedtime story that a dad is telling his son. So already I knew the Uncle would turn out to be fine since I‚Äôm pretty sure the dad wouldn‚Äôt be telling this story if the Uncle died horrifically. On top of a general lack of stakes in the story, the writing is full of cliches and the characters are generic archetypes.

The story takes no advantage of the medium‚Äôs interactive format. The visuals are lacking in detail and polish while the art direction feels uninspired. A Story About My Uncle is by no means a bad or broken game, I just felt that it was really bland."
7867,"Genuinly Heartfelt and with fun grapple hock and rocket boots platforming , A Story About My Uncle is a fantastic experience
Worth every penny and more."
7868,"Nice story about fantasy and adventure, nice platform game with a glove, amazing game.

[b] The only problem is the duration, 2-3 hours.. bur it's not bad at all[/b]"

Video Review: 
https://youtu.be/aakZRr9XwjE

A Story About My Uncle was suggested to me by one of my Steam friends. I knew almost nothing about it and had received A Story About My Uncle over a year ago in the Humble Indie Bundle 18. Still, I seem to have gravitated towards story-based games, so what‚Äôs the harm in one more?

A Story About My Uncle starts with the player entering his uncle‚Äôs house and finding it empty, The house is wonderfully decorated with a ton of tchotchkes in it. In fact, I had a lot of fun exploring the house because of all the items in the place and because of how many hidden easter eggs, including a youtube link, there are. Everything felt really interesting and unique and it felt like a house I wanted to explore.

From there through a number of steps you get teleported to another world and I have to be honest, I loved looking at the levels in this game. Each level is lovely to look at and fills me with wonder. A Story About My Uncle ends each level abruptly and jars me out of the trance it has weaved, but when the next level starts, I forgive it because I‚Äôm filled with a strong desire to explore the new location.

The gameplay helps with that as well. The player is given a suit that allows him to run around and jump great distances, even controlling which direction he‚Äôs falling while in midair. The suit even has the ability to ‚Äúpower jump‚Äù. The mobility the suit provides makes exploration very interesting because the game is allowed to build in a vertical direction as well as a horizontal one.

However, that‚Äôs not all the tricks the suit has. On the first level, you get a crystal that activates the suit‚Äôs ‚Äútether‚Äù from there you can look at any surface that is close enough and press a single button drawing your character to the point where you aimed. It makes what is an average adventure into something rather special. The ability to pull yourself up a cliffside is excellent, and the tether has limits, so aiming at the side of a cliff will only pull you to the side, getting on top of the edge of a cliff is a whole other story. That is the challenge, to use your new found superpowers, and it‚Äôs an interesting challenge at that.

The tether also can be used for momentum as it drags the player toward an object, if you release early before the player collides with the object, the player can fling themselves across chasms and gaps. It‚Äôs exciting and fun to use.

You see, when the tether‚Äôs target is in constant motion, such as a windmill, the tether will continually draw the player in, but the target will continue to draw the tether out creating continual motion and slingshotting the player to places. The rush as you ride along on these objects almost make you forget how outlandish some of them are. Many of them are just floating rocks orbiting around another rock or empty space with no connection to reality, but the experience is some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in a game.
¬†
I‚Äôve made the tether sound exciting, but is it as good as it sounds? Well within the first look I called myself spiderman, and I‚Äôm having trouble coming up with a better comparison. It‚Äôs as if someone stuck a web shooter on my character‚Äôs hand and I‚Äôm web-slinging around the environment. While it doesn‚Äôt have the range I‚Äôd really want, or the fact that it immediately starts to retract after making contact, it really does feel like you are swinging on a web just as Spiderman would, and that feeling almost never goes away in the game.

There‚Äôs even a point where you get an additional tool, a pair of rocket boots, in the game, and from there you feel more like a Marvel character, only this time you can fly. It‚Äôs more Tony Stark‚Äôs Mark I model, than a true flying hero as they only give you a small boost, but that boost completely changes A Story About My Uncle and makes you feel even more amazing in mid-air if that‚Äôs possible.


The villages in the game look great.
With all these tools, the question of what is the gameplay about comes up. The entire game is about finding out where you should go next, usually by finding a common mark that tells you your uncle has already been there. Then you have to find points to sling yourself to or from and from them to execute a plan that eventually requires three tethered shots and sometimes a rocket boost to get where you want to go next.

A Story About My Uncle does a great job of showing you the pathways. The levels are well laid out and there are only a couple of levels that I had trouble with. The marks your uncle left are rather big clues, but once in a while they look reachable but are not. As I said before every level made me want to explore it but even as I did, there‚Äôs usually one clear pathway from each point and from there you can clearly know where to go next.

The levels themselves are great, however, the final level‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs rough. The game gets too clever requiring precision that wasn‚Äôt asked from the player previously. It‚Äôs a constant request as well, not just one or two hard movements, but almost every jump in the final level is significantly harder than any jump requested previously. In addition, there are crystals that will recharge the number of tethers you have but you are also asked to hit them in mid-air, and quite often there‚Äôs less than a second to target the crystal and then target what you need to swing to next. It‚Äôs a very tight timeframe and doesn‚Äôt make the game as enjoyable as the rest of the game.

In addition for some reason, the game stops giving you the rocket boots for part of the level and then returns them to you again in a story moment that‚Äôs clearly there for a gameplay element. It‚Äôs a shame because the rest of the game worked well and never felt like it abused the story for a new challenge. Here in the last level it‚Äôs an unnecessary challenge that‚Äôs thrown together, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to work.

Still, I was able to pass through it relatively quickly, it just was the most gamified level in A Story About My Uncle. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like it fits as well as the rest of the experience. By the time you reach the final level, you should feel quite accomplished but that final level seems to delight in just finding new frustrating ways to annoy the player.


Just a little earlier, this level is filled with life and enjoyable challenges.
There‚Äôs also the idea of collectibles in the game, and those can be interesting to discover. The collectibles make a little sound like a clicking when you are near them and from that you can locate where they are. I didn‚Äôt find many of them in my game though and didn‚Äôt feel a need to go back and collect them all. If you are a collectible hunter, there are five of them per level and most are fairly well hidden.

So we come to the story. Honestly, the story in A Story About My Uncle is flawed. It starts off interesting and sounding like we‚Äôll have a sad twist or find out the story is in someone‚Äôs head. It just has all the marks of a manipulative story.

As A Story About My Uncle progresses you find fantastic villages and even a frog person friend named Mad Maddie who assists you for part of the way. It‚Äôs actually a bit charming. Just as the world make you want to explore more, the story makes you wonder what you‚Äôll find next.

7870,"This game was amazing. It has an amazing storyline, and the gameplay is excellent. Sometimes things can get repetetive, like when you fail a certain part and have to do it again. I definately don't recommend playing this for a long time, take breaks. After a while, Your fingers start to hurt due to the keys you use, and if your like me you can start to get a little ticked off if you don't have a break here and there. But again, the storyline is amazing, the scenery is awesome to look at, its fun to use your grappleing hook, and its worth every penny they're selling it for. So if you haven't already, definately purchase this game. I give it a 9/10. The only reason I give it a 9/10 rather than a 10/10 is because its a little short for such an amazing game, but its still extremely fun to play."
7871,"It was good, finished story in 1.9 hours so I got to refund it. Thanks for the awesome 2 hours! <3"
7872,"Very surprised this game reviews as well as it does. The story was shallow and underdeveloped, the characters were flat, and the dialogue was awkward at best. The game presents its gameplay as something to do while exploring the world, but the world is not interesting enough to make this a worthwhile endeavour. Taken on its own, the gameplay is not interesting enough to justify the game. Where skill-testing, this is merely because of artificial-feeling limits the game places on your grappling that are hard to gauge even after playing for some time. Where puzzling, this is because places to grapple have been hidden from direct view, and not because of any inherent challenge. As a result, perseverence does not feel rewarding, especially when your reward is [spoiler]learning the uncle is some whitebread professor dude, who has nothing interesting to say aside from some bizarre message about abandoning your family and life's work to play with frogs who seem to get on just fine without him, apparently for no reason other than that the frogs see him as a God. How is this character, who leaves behind anything a reasonable person values in favour of self-indulgent hovering around one achievement, supposed to be not only sympathetic, but mysterious enough to carry the narrative weight of the game?[/spoiler] Although this is a detailed description of the ending, I barely felt the need to use spoiler tags, as it doesn't feel like anything really happened.

This game does not have a story to drive it, does not create a sense of adventure, and does not stand on its own without these apparent features."
7873,"the gameplay is short but worth it,the story is weak but intersting even though the game is short its worth it to try becuase how the game felt different every time you proceed and i used to play it every morning as a kid becuase how it looks and plays im happy that i played it again and finished it ofcourse.
overall the game gets 7.5/10"
7874,"Not a great game, but not bad either.  I really am torn about recommending or not recommending this game: The story and character elements are weak, and nearly the whole game is very easy but then there are some tremendously tough parts.  Overall, nice art style and interesting approach to platforming, but weak story and characters (only 4 do anything notable, like move, if I recall), and of those few platform puzzles that are actually challenging, several are insane garbage."
7875,"this is an internesting game, with many unique features and so far an intreging story line, for someone that wants to chill with music on, this is the game to do it. also this is the game that leafy played, but not the reason i bought it :) good game!"
7876,"Honestly, I'm a very picky person when it comes to picking games. This is in my liking. Enjoyed it"
7877,"Graphics-Beautiful
Scenery-Gorgeous
Controls-Smoothe
Gameplay-Amazing
10/10"
7878,"Short, if you buy it in sale it is worth it."
7879,Good story driven narative in a inventive new world
7880,"It was a very short game, but being short doesn't mean bad. It is one of the better games that I have played and I definitely recommend it to everyone. Plus if you don't like it just refund it but I personally think thats unlikely to happen."
7881,completed in under 2 hours so I refunded. Good game tho. Not sure if I should check the 'recieved this product for free' box.
7882,"This game is good.
Not great, but good. You can buy it and play it and you'll probably enjoy yourself.

It's a 2-3 hour, single player game that follows a very linear story. The story is fine. The ending is a bit disappointing, but for the most part it's fine. 
The gameplay isn't hard, but it's really fun.
The graphics are fine.

7/10
It's fine."
7883,"PROS:

- Beautiful af.
- Controls are really, really fun - if you like Mirror's Edge, the fluid coordination will feel comfortable and familiar
- Casual (could be a pro or a con) - it's not [i]hard[/i], just fun.

CONS:

- Really easy, not much mystery or challenge
- The voice acting is [b]terrible[/b] - I almost wanted to turn it off.
- Interacting with the villagers feels bland and uninteresting
- The ending felt like a transition to the next part of the game. There was, effectively, no ending.
- The story telling, as others have mentioned, was kind of dull. The storyline is quite shallow.

This game is in a weird juxtaposition of feeling like a child's game (thanks to the plot and story) whilst simultaneously functioning like an adult platformer - the controls require a bit of finesse to master, but aren't exactly difficult.

Overall a cute game. The aesthetic of the level design is pretty top notch but everything else kkind of falls short."
7884,"+ Maddie

- Average and predictable story 
- First person platforming
- Game mechanics contradict themselves often
- Clipping issues
- Extremely short (2h)
- Terrible achievements that cannot convince me to re-do the game even if it's extremely short.
- You bounce off rocks as if either you or they are made of rubber

Considering it's indie developer it's decent. I can only recommend it if it has 90% discount though or if it's in some cheap bundle."
7885,"took me 2 hours to beat it, it's a short and really nice game, would 100% recommend this game on sale."
7886,"Just feeling..

9/10


"
7887,If you like puzzle like games! (portal)
7888,"The storyline was pretty weak, not gonna lie, the graphics weren't top tier. But damned if I  said the gameplay was bad. As for being an indie title, it was a very strong game gameplay wise. I haven't played a game that was anything like this. The grapple mechanic was great, and in a world of micro-dlc, and other bs, it is great to see that you can make a fun and enterataining game, without the budget of a triple A game. The only thing I would say is bad is the short story, which isn't really bad, just a negative. (I do however understand why, beacuse it's an indie game, they don't have access to as much money and resources as say a developer like EA or Ubisoft. Like the first season for a tv show, they spend what they can, to show what they can do, and if it is a success, then they will make a longer 2nd season.) Aside from the short story, there really isn't too much to complain about. I bought this game for $2 USD when it was on sale, and if they were to make an expansion map or a sequel, I will 100% be buying it. 


(Edit) Another thing I was going to touch on was the price, $15 for this game just seems like a bit too much, so probs to the devs for lowering the price."
7889,Loved it. Highly recommended.
7890,"Really nice and unique gameplay.
Short playtime tho."
7891,yes
7892,"Good game but very short. Grappling was pretty fun although it could be a bit hecked at times if you ever so gently graze what you're swinging from, losing momentum and falling to your doom. Aside from that it was fun. Wish it was longer though"
7893,"This COULD have been very good, despite its shortness. 'Could' and not 'is', not because of the very good mechanics, responsive and enjoyable, the cute graphics (even if the characters models and animations is VERY outdated, maybe N64-like), the simple yet efficient storytelling. The game is not that good because of a rather game-breaking detail: [b] [u] YOU HAVE NO CLUE ON DEPHS AND DISTANCES between objects[/u] [/b] because of the rendering. 

This 'artefact' could have been totally unimportant in other type of game, but not in this kind of ""first-person-plateformer-parkour"". It totally denatures the vertigo effect, the speed effect and the smoothness of this kind of actions can have.

Every object you see could be a far far away gigantic rock, or a tiny little stone just in front of you. Every time you try to reach the next stepover you have to jump into the void and prey that your gappling tool icone are going to be highlighted in 
order to grab something. Every. Time. You. Gonna. Jump.

I've experimented and finished a lot of other ""first-person-plateformer-parkour"" like [i]Mirror's Edge[/i], [i]DeadCore[/i], [i]Valley[/i] etc, because this kind of game is totally my thing. Some of them are [u]way[/u] harder than [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] was, which would be a total piece of cake without the problem I mentioned. I still enjoyed a little this one to be really honest, but I could not recommend it at all.

7894,"So much fun, I just wish there was more of it. I hope they make a second one."
7895,"I did enjoy this game, however, I do still have some criticism. I  bought this game for $3, however its original price is $13. Had I paid full price I might've felt a bit cheated.
First off, the game is very confusing. I loved the game mechanics, but sometimes the level design was so confusing I found myself standing still for around 5-10 minutes Figuring out where to go. I had to look up a tutorial to figure out I was even able to grapple onto the falling rocks on the roof.
I also found myself skipping multiple sections, which I did enjoy the feeling of straying from a linear playthrough, also left me unsure of where I was suppose to go and where I was supposed to already have been.
The story is also incredibly anticlimactic.
*SPOILER ALERT*
Upon finally finding Uncle Fred, a moment I've worked an hour and a half to find, he's there for all of about one minute before he sends you off back home. I was hopeful after the credit scenes we'd AT LEAST get to go see what he's been up to, but instead, he just throws a note into the wind in the observatory. I felt incredibly let down.
I'd personally rate this game around a 7/10. Great game mechanics, the rest of the game needed work though."
7896,"Good story, graphics, and chill gameplay, but I don't really think it is worth the full price because of the short play time."
7897,"I've got a crippling addiction for these sorts of games. Short, sweet, clean visuals and an enjoyable self enclosed story."
7898,"Excellent game, grappling, jumping and flying in the 3d platformer without enemies. Just dexterity and casual fun, with a charming story that helps move things along. Recommended!"
7899,Amazing story and I love games that allow me to explore! I feel like spiderman
7900,"This is the definition of ""atmospheric game"". I loved it and I advice everyone to experience this beautiful game.

It is only a bit short, but that is fine."
7901,"There's something really satisfying about jumping through the skies (Or caves) and landing on platforms. Solid gameplay worth your money. I had 2+ hours of fun, going to replay the game and perfect it! Story ain't that great, but hey, the gameplay makes up for it. It runs great too.

A must buy on sale.

9/10 (Would love an expansion pack or a custom level maker!)"
7902,"The storyline is okay at best, it's not very captivating to the point where you play the game and get curious about what happens next or where you actually get interested with the characters involved in the story; games like 'A Beginner's Guide' or 'Until Dawn' are able to capture very well, but the game -despite it having ""story"" in it's title- surprisingly has a better gameplay than it has story. 
The parkour mechanics are great and in a way unique, albeit having some similarities to any spiderman game.
The visuals are amazing; the artstyle is perfect and the levels are somewhat coherent even though the game is obviously set in a fantasy world.
8/10"
7903,"it is bad and it is hard
"
7904,"Great game, beautiful graphics, and funny dialogue, a must own game, ESPESICALLY if it's on sale. For alien, adventure, and parkour fans, this is a must own game."
7905,"First let's get a quick summary of the game. 
The game is about a boy who goes to look for his uncle that regularly goes on Adventures throughout the world, on this trip he encounters many different interesting locations and (creatures).

Pros: 
Gameplay: The gameplay is amazing, it's simple, fun but gets challenging after passing the Zeppelin world, At first you start with a grapple hook that makes you feel like spiderman and then you get extra items including extra charges for your gappling hook and a really neat pair of Jet boots which are very fun.

Sound: The sound is very nice from the dropping thud to the electric grapple, what I really liked was the attention to detail, like when Maddeline speaks in the caves theres a noticable eco that goes away after you pass the cave level

Price: I personally got the game on sale for around 8$ which is an amazing price for such a high quality game, I believe the standard price is around 15$ which isn't as good but I'd still pay the price for a chance to experience the game as a newbie again.

Story: The story is also pretty good, it starts up slow but in the end you do feel fulfilled to have ""solved"" the ""mystery""

Cons: 

Graphics: The only noticable thing I can count as a con are the graphics, now for a 15$ game I wasn't expecting Ark level graphics but I was expecting a little more than what I saw, It does have a cartoony style which I appreciate but it lacked a little detail, especially the Rock formations and the Bottom sky.

Overal this game is one that I would definetally recommend to anyone and I will definetally be replaying just for the gameplay."
7906,"This game has been one of the most beautiful games i've played. I loved swinging around in those caves while listening to the sweet narrator tell the story to his daughter. This game was really relaxing to play while you get this beautiful story. Would definetely recommend if you are looking for a small story driven game.

The game is really good, and beautiful. But im recommending this because of the narrator doing a so good job in my opinion."
7907,"A Story About My Uncle has enjoyable mechanics and stunning levels, but very simple and uninteresting story and barely any music. 
Grappling hook is a lot of fun despite the fact that the game discourages player from using it too much implicitly by achievements and explicitly making most of the surfaces unavailable for grapple in the last level."
7908,you jump and stuff
7909,I loved this game one of the best story games I have ever played the game is short but I wouldn't want it any other way it's a first of its  kind if you have 4-5 hours to kill I wouldn't recommend anything else
7910,cool lil grappling hook game
7911,thank u :)
7912,"It's not a depressing story about an abusing uncle but an adventure game, thought I'd get to re-live my childhood memories but instead I got to jump through the skies with a pair of rocket boots."
7913,"Great game! 

Pros:
-Great game mechanics (responsive, fast, fun)
-Game graphics are nice
-Game feels really satisfying to play (get that dopamine discharge on every succesful manouver)

Cons:
-Characters are insipid (specially villagers)
-Game is too short (2 hours should be more than enough to complete)

Conclussion: buy this boii

PPS: 7.5/10"
7925,"[i]The only reason I rate this as a thumbs down is that there's no neutral option, but I couldn't possibly give a thumbs up after my experience with the game.[/i]

[h1]TL;DR Despite great graphics and atmosphere, the gameplay is frustrating to the point of quitting.[/h1]

[b]Design[/b]
This is what got me to buy this game in the first place - the polished and colourful graphics of what seems to be an endearing world to explore. And I wasn't wrong - the world is interesting and beautiful, one that I wouldn't mind delving into for hours if it wasn't for the inability to do so.
This aspect is done fine.

[b]Story[/b]
The entire game is actually a hindsight bed-time story a father tells his daughter about how he searched for his missing inventor uncle. Sometime the story progresses with the father's voiceover and other times with the characters in the actual game.
There isn't very much to the story other than that. Not that it's bad, I just didn't find myself as immersed in the story as much as I did with the world it takes place in.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
This is where the game falls short.
You basically control the suit you're wearing - it can make you grab onto surfaces and lasso yourself towards them, it can boost your jumps above and far away (even in mid-air at some point), all around it's a cool thing to wear.
But the problem is some things combined:
[list]
    [*]Objects and surfaces are so far away it's hard to determine distance.
    [*]First-person makes the problem above x10 worse.
    [*]No manual save - throws you back to the start of an area if you fail and have to restart what you've done.
[/list]
Those 3 combined are a recipe for frustration.
At first I tried to ignore the repetitiveness of the progress and focus on other things, but as the game progressed I got more and more angry with it - it stopped being a relaxing experience and I couldn't spend more than 15-20 consecutive minutes playing at a time. After not touching it for quite some time I decided to give it another try today - but this was the peak of my exasperation. I can't finish the game, even though I know I'm near the end.

So if you're like me and cannot grind a repetitive gameplay with not much else to compensate - I wouldn't recommend buying it. I guess it fits better to different type of gamers."
7926,One of the best 3 hours I've ever spent. Thank you for everyone who's involved in such a beautiful project. Only deficiency is its playtime.
7927,I think this game is very funny. Highly recommended.
7928,This is an amazing game. The mechanics are extremely satisfying and I can reccommend it to anyone who likes fast paced games like dying light or mirrors edge. The devs did a great job and the fact that a linux version exists show how much they care about the community
7929,Just completed the game and it was quick but was action-packed. The story was very good and I would recommend anyone looking to pass a few hours by to play this game.
7930,This game feels so satisfying to play. Navigating the levels is super fun.
7931,"shit game, finished in 1,5 hours

trash story with ALOT of downtime where you just stand and talk about nothing for ages"
7932,"A very interesting and fun singleplayer! 
Small gameplay, but definitely worth to get it while it's on sale."

7934,I recommend this game for everybody...its not long but the story is absolutely amazing ( and the atmosphere? very well made)
7935,A simple game with a great story.
7936,The story is interesting and full of suprises
7937,Stephen Hawking had a better ending then this
7938,"Good, but it can be beat in less than 2 hours"
7939,I first off have to say Gone North Games and Coffee Stain Publishing thank you i know you thank me for play but i have to thank you for the experience just the last time i got a good experience like that well i should say great was brothers a tale of two sons keep making sweet storys and awesome puzzle games guys call of duty and all of those triple a title games can be fun but i dont think ill ever get an experience like this in those games so keep up the great work and cant wait to get more of your guys game! <3
7940,"First off, I would like to say that I got this game on sale for around $3.00 and I think that is a good price for the game. It took me 3-4 hours to complete and i doesn't have too much replayability other than its time trial mode if you are into that. The mechanics are super fun and I never got bored with them. However, I think the story is comically bad. [spoiler] The premise of the father telling the story to his daughter was interesting but nothing else about the story had any meat to it and when I left certain characters behind I couldn't help but laugh because I hardly even knew anything about them [/spoiler]. This game held my interest the whole way though due to the enjoyability of the mechanics and the fact that it doesn't hold you up on the story too often. I would recommend it on sale."
7941,"A fun few hours to be had in this little gem of a more-or-less ""family friendly"" game. Even though there are no guns or things to kill, the threat of falling to what would realistically be a terrible way to die looms large when traversing massive distances and across big chasms. The jovial way one accompanying character suggests you traverse a specific secion without using your life-saving grappling hook belies the terrible fate that surely awaits you if you fail - luckily this game doesnt ""go there"" and infinate and constant re-spawning back to frequent nearby save points keeps the game flowing and keeps the game PG showing no blood or the like. Even the 'creatures' you meet echo the feeling this game was meant for kids, but the challanges faced are sometimes difficult enough to keep most adults busy and developing sore keyboard fingers.
The games graphics seem a bit dated for a 2014 title, especially the character movements, but otherwise the settings were intriguing and colorful, level design was a fun platformer, music and narration was nice and a big part of the esthetic of the game. The idea of the story, and the easter eggs of the scripts in the house were a nice touch.

A Story about how I ""accidentilly"" beat the game.
I had made the mistake of skipping one section, a cave filled with floating boxes to traverse, to focus on what I though was just a cleverly challanging blocked passage to a hidden area seen at a distance - finally just barely managing to make my way through, moving on to finish the game from there, only to later go back, clear the floating boxes 'room' and discover that completing that challange takes down the obstacles that previously blocked my path and helped explain an aspect of the crystals strewn about the world that would have absolutely helped me traverse the tougher sections later on. It's actually quite amazing that I managed to make it through some of the challanges without knowing what those crystals did for me. They either designed it that way, or each of those challanges i had figured out an oversight in level design that allowed me to traverse those obstacles without knowing to make use of those crystals (lets just say I could tell the areas above some of the paths that i was supposed to be in were not where i was supposed to be - as i could tell by the clipping through textures I often saw there - but they allowed me to reset my precious few power core charges enough to move on).

Worth tens of dollars? Not particularly, but using my $1/1Hour top value scale, this games few hours was well worth the $3.49 sale price I paid for it. Though a  good hour or so was likely spent working on those challanges that kept me busy trying to figure out.
I don't think i'll bother with the time-trials, and the replayability is not likely as nearly all paths are one way.

The grappling reminds me of the fantastic fun I had playing Bionic Commando, so this game will likely be memorable for a few scenes."
7942,"This was one of the most greatest experieces I've had with a game, Even though it is kinda short. I loved every second."
7943,Easily one of the best if not THE best indie game i have ever played
7944,All my friends think its about child molesting when I say the name.
7945,"This game has a really good soundtrack and so atmospheric journey.
If you like unique games with chilling soundtrack you should buy this."
7946,I would love to know what drugs the developers were using.
7947,Good game but its extremely short
7948,"Fun game/Good story, Needs a part 2.  Would love to see some more stuff like a steam workshop for maps or skins or idk what ever.   IDk if i would buy it full price as it is short but if you can get it on sale then its a 10/10."

I was actually chasing my daddy for whole time? 
Now I understand why my mom doesn't believe me

10/10"
7950,Cool game
7951,"Great mechanics, fun gameplay and a good story.
Could have had a better ending."
7952,a story about ur mom
7953,"Gameplay wise - its definately fun, the feeling of speed is really polished and the mechanics are great. Story wise- its not that special. Mostly the game is focused on the gameplay, and story feels a little pushed back. The artstyle and colours really make this game beautifull and vibrant."
7954,"Awesome game. Movement feels incredible and the story is well writen (just a bit short, finished it in 2 hours and 35 minutes). Only negative point I can find is that the facial animations for the characters look extremely dated."
7955,"This is probably one of the best games I've played. Better than my uncle.

10/10"
7956,This game feels so satisfying to play.  Navigating the levels is super fun.
7957,"(Contains spoilers)

Actually quite liked it. I enjoyed the movement mechanics, but I think the part about including humanoids and actual human models could've been left out, as that was really in the uncanny valley."
7958,Recommended a solid 8/10
7959,Platformer game with a very fun mechanism and beautiful visuals. Some of the levels are actually quite challenging but it makes it all the more satisfying when you solve the puzzles.
7960,"The story is melancholic, but gameplay is nice smooth and chill.

 I recommend this game if you like adventuring and just looking at your surroundings and enviroments in games, as it has many beatiful areas.
 At start game is very easy but at the end the travelling gets a lot tougher so there is a bit of learning curve as well. All in all it's a pretty good game."
7961,"Game is good, but unfortunately it's not saving... I've checked online and it seems short, so I might finish it in a single run one day, but I'm not going to play the 4 first levels again.
(this kind of game is not too apeling to me)"
7962,"A short but sweet game about a kid who goes on an adventure essentially being space Spider-Man. It could have used more of a conflict for the story, but overall playing this game was nice. Not amazing or terrible, just nice."
7963,really nice game with a good story and beautiful atmosphere
7964,"i enjoyed this a lot,
a neat little story and fun platforming aswell
the levels are incredibly well designed too, several times i jumped to a platform and barely made it and wondered if i had gone to the right place or if i had accidentally gone backwards but i never did, which considering the environments is pretty incredible.
the only negative i could really give is that it is a little short so if you're the sort of person that is bothered by that then maybe pick it up in a sale"
7965,A game with amazing graphics and a chill mood for a good time :)
7966,"loved playing through this game, really felt special going through those caves alone."
7967,"[h1]A Story About My Uncle[/h1]

Short but good.

[b]8/10[/b]"
7968,"great chill game, it's good for when you're just not havin it"
7969,A very neat little game. Very heart warming.
7970,amazing
7971,Esse jogo √© de mais o final dele tbm √© bem fantastico gostei muito !!!!!!
7972,Iz real good
7973,such an amazing game
7974,One of the best game with emotional story ;_;
7975,A fun little adventure with satisfying physics.
7976,"Fun game, disappointing story.
I had a lot of fun with the mechanics of this game, the grappling and path-finding is easily the main attraction of it and I had a great time playing it.
That being said the story is practically non-existent, though it pretends it isn't. Most of the story moments seem to be trying to be poignant or emotional but the game doesn't try hard enough to make it work. The last few lines of dialogue managed to get me in the heart - but only for a fraction of a second before I realized the sentiment those words were trying to convey hadn't been given anything to go off of throughout the whole game.
In short: gameplay is fun, story is light enough to ignore but JUST present enough to feel let down by its lack of substance. Get it on sale if you like parkour or Spider-Man."
7977,bad game
7978,This game is so delightful.  I played much more than my hours show.  I hope everyone gets a chance to play it sometime!
7979,"It was recommended to me that I play this game.  It's.... alright ‚Äî a bit overrated.

+ Story is interesting
+ Environments are nice and homey, done with some real heart and soul!

- I grappled with the game's mechanics for a while, especially the grappling mechanic.  Perhaps a click-and-hold function would help a little with that.  Also, controls felt awkward ‚Äî I mean, yes, they are rebindable, but click-and-hold to super jump?  It felt more like a nuisance than anything.
- Game has pacing problems, which for me is a big no-no.  The maps are very scattered, which I get, and while there are indicators as to where to go, often I wasn't sure if I skipped past any story bits (sparing of course the secret story bits, which I understand).  I felt like I had no clear sense of direction ‚Äî even in NaissanceE I had a better sense of direction.  This also led to me getting to possible unintended places (i.e. sequence breaking) on my first run (not good!).
- Trapping issues, such as getting stuck on low rocks.  I loathed these when playing Portal 2, and this game feels no different in that regard.

I give this game [strike]Jim Sterling's[/strike] 7/10"
7980,"Okay game, didn't care for the ending, I like the timed runs."
7981,From the best story game
7982,The movement mechanics feel fantastic. The level design is beautiful and the story is very cute.
7983,Short and sweet game
7984,"A good adventure platformer game built around a solid grapple mechanic. It has a well narrated ""bed time"" story format that keeps it engaging enough for people like me who normally don't play pure platforming games.
The game is fairly short - about 5 hours - but the length felt about right considering its an indie game at a modest price.
Graphics are mostly very good. The first level does look a bit dated, but some of the later ones look really good and have an amazing sense of scale to them (if only Skyrim's pathetic ""black reach"" cave looked as impressive as the ice cave in this game).
The difficulty balance is good for most gamers, but some of the later parts are quite challenging. There is a timed segment that will prove very difficult for anyone who tends to have trouble with platforming games. Be warned.
There is only a checkpoint autosave system, but for the most part the checkpoints are not too far apart.
This game has a very polished feel - it ran smooth and I experienced no technical issues at all.

Overall, given the solid mechanics and decent story, I would recommend this game to anyone, as long as they are ok with a lot of platforming. It is also suitable for children age 7+ in my opinion."
7985,"God bless Steam! I can‚Äôt stop praising it for making it possible to make new cool connections and meet people around the world with common interests. These people always remind me about some games, that I had on my mind for a long time and then forgot. 

But what is much more important is that games they recommend me always fit my mood in a proper way, just like in a right place in a right time. The same happened to me with A Story About My Uncle. I had a bit harsh weekend, which started with fixing my broken PC on Saturday, then I was forced to do other stuff I really didn‚Äôt feel like doing and after all these events I felt like I squeezed lemon, so I really needed something chill, relaxing and just kind, without any violence. So, after a quick conversation with a friend on Steam, I realized, that I bought this game few years ago, I guess and still never touched.

And that was a mistake! Or not? Maybe this game was waiting for a proper time and it only came now? Anyway, I always have this feeling, like, why I never played it earlier, when I find something really cool and amazing in my library all of a sudden. A Story About My Uncle starts as protagonist tells a little girl bedtime story, so she can fall asleep. He decides to tell her a story about a sudden disappearance of his uncle.

You come in your uncle‚Äôs house and looking around for him. After climbing up on atticus, you ended up with finding a suit, that your uncle invented and you decided to wear it, like I don‚Äôt know, for no reason, at all. I mean, that was a bit confusing for me, just don‚Äôt get me wrong - you come into someone‚Äôs place, looking for the master of the house, then you find a suit and you think like, oh let me try it, why not? :) Of course, I understand that it‚Äôs a bedtime story for a little girl and you can‚Äôt be so strict about it, but in terms of starting a story that part confused me a bit at the start.

Right after you fit something that doesn‚Äôt belong to you, an enormous atticus window opens and you teleport to a weird place with little flying islands. Your reaction is kinda like wow, oh my god, where am I now, what‚Äôs going on here, but you are not gonna be overwhelmed for a long time. Just in a few seconds you will already understand somehow, that this suit is not just a fashionable suit, it has interesting abilities and of course, they come handy just in time. 

Game introduces you to a grappling hook on your glove, set on a LMB, which will be the most frequently usable gadget during your adventure. The trick is that you will have to travel from island to island, using that hook, grappling on stones located in the air between them. The more you proceed the more features of the suit will become available to you, like boosting yourself off the ground after holding and releasing the RMB button, or rocket boots, activated by pushing spacebar. As being a classic puzzle game, where you have to reach to your destination using all these features, all these suit powers will works in a best way ever when they are combined. For example, you have to sprint on the ground, holding the RMB button and then release it right near the edge, to boost yourself in the air, hook the nearest stone and then after realizing the next stone is quite far, spam a spacebar button to get to it. In addition to it, you will have a limited amount of hooks, so you won‚Äôt be able to spam LMB hoping that you will catch a flying stone one way or another, sooner or later.

At some point, during your adventure, you will find a village with weird froggy-alike creatures, which will answer some of your questions and will help you, guiding your way to uncle and telling you about this world and its secrets. These creatures represent a really important part of this world and this charming story as well, you will understand it closer to the end of the game. 

The good point, that you will not be stuck only somewhere high in the air, jumping around the clouds from one island to another. You will also be able to explore greeny villages, dangerous caves and icy terrains, as well, so you won‚Äôt feel like you are stuck at one place. 

Of course, my favorite part of the game is the narrative thing. During your adventure, the protagonist will be explaining everything for the little girl, commenting on every dangerous situation or an item found in caves or whatsoever, that makes connection to the story and tells more about mysterious uncle disappearance in this fairy world. That, without a doubt, my favorite part in games, when developers work on the dialogues and telling you a story through the protagonist‚Äôs lines. Little girl seems to be really confident and has a big mouth, so time to time you will uncontrollably smile on what she says. 

I can highly recommend this game to someone who is in love with short, touching, well-designed indie games with a soul and kind atmosphere, without any violence at all. It would be a cruel move from my side to call this game relaxing, because at some point it can be a bit challenging, and at the end of the game, on the last level there is a chance that you can smash your screen! But, in general, this game has a message in it, of course I won‚Äôt tell you which one, because it‚Äôs a massive spoiler, but it‚Äôs hard to argue with a fact, that mixing action puzzle jumping-platformer game with a touching story is a really brave move, that worked out really well!

Ok, to sum everything up!
You should grab this game if you:

+ Love nice charming games
+ Eager to play something short and nice
+ You love all these games with puzzles where you have to travel from one point to another, finding a best way to get from point A to point B
+ Fan of an atmospheric games with warm graphics and beautiful sceneries
+ The idea of adventure and travelling is your thing
+ Love all these cool gadgets, with grapple hooks, super jumps, etc.

Recommend to avoid if you:

- Although, I said this game has warm graphic, it looks a bit outdated from technical point of view, especially the faces of froggy creatures
Enjoy!

7986,"A Story About My Uncle is a pretty cool first-person platformer that emphasis a grappling mechanic. Gameplay-wise it works pretty well, but it was the visuals and art style that I enjoyed the most. The game also has a good narrative and characters. The music is also immersive. This is also a rare game where all of the achievements are skill-based. Even finishing the story won‚Äôt net you one. And they‚Äôre hard, requiring knowledge of the levels and control mastery. The game itself isn‚Äôt very long, but it is an enjoyable experience. Recommended on sale."
7987,Wanna sprint jump? *Inhales* HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
7988,Insert horrific molestation story from childhood -h-e-r-e--->
7989,"Lots of fun, beat it in one sitting. Well worth it on sale."
7990,"Great visual and sound design, engaging enough story and great platforming"
7991,"A Story About My Uncle has a very misleading title. Gameplay wise, it boils down to a fantasy-nearly-no-gravity-parkour-simulator-fable-adventure.

What sounds weird at first, is a very strong indie title with great environments, endearing art design and a very entertaining journey.

While not too long in itself, it does feature time trial mode and a few challenges and the entire game design is so much fun that there's actually reason to rerun some of levels to try to find the fastest and most effective route through.

Content wise it's a small game, but well deserving to be played."
7992,"Loved this game for every moment and every little thing, like the momentum physics with the grappling hook, and the way your arms swing them you long jump.  Combine all that with great graphics and a decent story, and you have a game that I recommend for anyone."
7993,"[h1] A Story About My Uncle misses the very important adjective 'dull' in its misleading title, and I forewarn anyone debating purchase of this and expecting an enthralling tale to consider other options carefully.[/h1]

In the broadest sense, the game is a basic third person, parkour platformer loosely wrapped in a bare-bones tale, and barely held together by combined gravity pulls, static jumps and rocket-booster boots. Now, these boons may pique the interest of any parkour gaming fan, but it's comparative to using gluten-free bread to make a sandwich - it's going to fall apart and make a damn mess everywhere and you're going to wish you'd just used normal bread. Stick with what you know works, and works well.

(Incidentally, I feel the pain of anyone who has a necessity for gluten-free bread. Just carry a knife and fork with you, it makes life so much easier.)

Graphically, a few backdrops are easy on the eye and locations are nicely detailed in a soft 3D, easy on a potato-machine, cartoony style, but both contrast starkly to the character faces which are best not viewed at all if you can help it, lest you turn to stone.

After reaching the less-than-climactic ending, the story was abruptly cut short. I say it again, [b]do not[/b] expect any form of interesting, mysterious story whatsoever. There are traces of a tale present, but the focus is wholly on the platforming experience. That experience is best described as somewhat awkward, and (mostly due to my total imbecilic ability with controllers and parkour platforming,) mildly irritating with countless falls into an abyss.

I feel like it is necessary to mention that certain levels felt entirely pointless after entering, and then being required to leave again as the level collapsed. Several of these are scattered through the game and whilst providing means of challenge felt far more frustrating to complete than enjoyable.

The entire game felt more like a prelude than an actual finished product, despite my modest completion time of 5.4 hours. There were no hints alluding to further stories, even so, my expectations would be by no means great. 
I expected a lot more from this and admit to slight confusion from the very positive store reviews.

Unless you purely live for platformers, I highly suggest skipping this one."
7994,3–∑
7995,"The main mechanic, being grapple is really fun to use and doesn't get boring. But if you're looking for a great story then you're in for a treat. I came for a interesting movement mechanic, stayed for the story. Also, kudos to the narrator, great voice."
7996,This gmae is 1000% worth it it is difficult but fun and the ending is actually the best ending out of every game ive ever played the ending is satisfying and comforting you should buy and play this game
7997,would recomend
7998,"Seems super fun at first, but the grappeling (pulling yourself toward objects) wears really thin really fast. The amount of times you have to re-try the same section of the game is just riddiculous. Also, it says it should support conroller, but doesn't"
7999,"Here's the thing about this game, right. It has an amazing idea. The grapling system is nearly flawless- except some early game confusion that was quickly sorted out. The movement is challenging but not too much so, and the story more or less is interesting. I think there are a few key things this game did poorly. The balance, I think, between the difficulty and the story's intrigue wasn't matched up. I've only made it about a half hour of story into this game, much to my dismay, because one particular portion became simply too hard for me to manage. That leads to the second key thing. One of the mechanics of the game, is using your graple on plants to make them light up. Lovely. Except if you miss the center of the plant by even the tiniest fraction, you graple to the rock the plant is on. And you have limited graples. So you're screwed. This mechanic, paired with the maze-like atmosphere of the thin rock portion just made it too much. After a half hour, I'm done. I can't."
8000,"It is fabolous and fun, altought I do get stuck on some parts which is quite annoying but I don't mind. :"
8001,"The game is quite short, but very enjoyable. Enigmatic atmosphere, great soundtracks and enjoyable gameplay."
8002,one of the best games that u can play when u want to relax even for 3 mins...
8003,gorbopg
8004,"the story is boring and you can't skip cutscenes, but the gameplay is amazing"
8005,"Wierd, But in a good way"
8006,Short but good story
8007,"First time i saw this game i though it will be a kind of simple 3D platformer. 
But the more i go inside the game and the story, all game characters emotions and feelings go deep into me. 
Cannot tell this game has fancy graphic or some unusual game mechanics, but a lot of times it will make you stop your breath and leave you amazed. 

Well, there is only one small problem i found so far - its very hard to find the way sometimes, there are only a few clues about direction. 

But no matter what, i love this game for its story, its people, its ending (will not disclose any details to not spoiler ;) ). This game is really just a story. A Story Of guy`s Uncle."
8008,"One of the best games I've ever played, great story too, very emotional."
8009,"""Do you recommend this game""
Meh.


Steam, there should be an option for ""Meh"", ok? Some games are really just plain old MEH."
8010,"talking about game and story so dont look if have not played yet but buy it dont even hasitate...
[spoiler] This game... Made me cry at the last scenes where we left uncle that sad moment, the room after years, the talk the message and real adventure... you made so many emotions come together at once anger, sadness, smiles and stuff you get it moments with madelline and leaving her etc. dialoges with our daughter about collectibles missed 10 for sure will come back for them what I say is it was short, I bought it on sale I would buy it full price if I was able to It's short gameplay doesnt give a negative you cant think of any negative conditions in this game expect a few bugs which I encouraged one or 2 and the chain reactions place where you hook hook collect hook hook hook etc. [/spoiler]"
8011,"Sweet game, the story is good, the characters are kind and cute, it took 7 hrs to finish it for me. Some jumps were pretty hard to me tho.
I rather recommend to buy this game during a sale.
Rating: 8/10"
8012,"Trailer makes the game seem a lot more exciting than it actually is.

The story is pretty interesting. The environments are pretty and generally a nice place to be. However, to progress there is a lot of platform grinding.

If you enjoy platformers and don't mind falling a lot and having to repeat a lot of gameplay without any checkpoints then maybe this is for you."
8013,"Pretty short story, but I found it very satisfying to play. Definitely worth buying on a sale"
8014,"Story:

Personally, I think the game is great! The story is explained very well with the Half Life-like cutscenes and you are already interested in following the story. Only the end came very suddenly.

Graphic:

The graphics are not the best, but that's because they're more Cartonian. It is relatively okay.

Control:

The controller just feels awesome. I had so much fun flying through the air with the suit and the rocket shoes.

Presentation:

The presentation is sweeping. The lights in the caves were very well thought out. And the first time I got out of the caves I was also very flashed, because the first thing you see looks very good.

Summary:

The game has okay graphics and the end came suddendly but is otherwise as good as perfect."
8015,"Good Stuff Bois, Greet"
8016,"Nice. Pretty fun, except little replay value. 8/10."
8017,Wow... Pls dis game... Now
8018,this game made me sad. it's a good good game tho.
8019,<3
8020,"It's a fun short game. Not the best story tho.

Not worth full price."
8021,"while it has neat scenery, the story doesnt hook you and the challenges get too tricky and precise - too much sweat for not much reward
i even lent a friend to try it, she did get near the end, but... we agreed on the stated above

i'd give it to someone if i could, dont plan on giving it another shot at playing it ever again

[PS this whole ordeal was long ago but i forgot to post the review at the time]"
8022,"Its a cute and fun little game. At times I wanted to break my mouse because of how difficult some of the levels are, but it is fair and challenging gameplay."
8023,"A short, but fun story to follow, collorfull characters and narrating."
8024,Really fun platformer. I love the spider-man feel of swing with the ropes.
8025,Very well made game.
8026,"Really fun game, pretty short though :("
8027,"A Story About My Uncle, is a very engaging first person, platforming, adventure game, yet unfortunately short.
Graphics are well done, nothing mind blowing.
Game mechanics are fun and simple to use. You play as a boy who inherits his lost uncles magical glove. you use this glove to overcome obstacles in an attempt to find your uncle.
The story is told very much like a bed time story.

I finished the game in about 3 hours.
I would recommend buying this game on sale."
8028,"Wonderful story, well written, and very fun.  Beautiful but short.  Kudos to the game developers, the love put into this game shows."
8029,"Quite boring honestly, some frustrating controls and areas of the game.
The story didn't feel impactful or interesting either, well not to me. 

The game looks pretty, even if it is dated. 

Overall I felt let down after playing it."
8030,"I have some minor gripes about the game like the controls being a little weird to get used to, but nothing major. 

I would suggest anyone that is susceptible to motion sickness DO NOT get this game."
8031,"Where to start? This game is not terrible, but there's also a limit to how many small issues you can allow to pile up, before they deflate the experience entirely. Overall, this feels like a prototype made by students - and I should know; I've been on a student production where none of us had any idea how to scope, how to prioritize or how to polish. Difference is, this game is probably about 3x the size of what we made - on the flip-side, we'd have never charged ‚Ç¨13 for our title.

The pros:
First of all, the environments, the color palette and the overall visual aesthetic is nice; and the levels are decorated neatly. The game design is mostly brilliant - someone here really knew how to iterate, to focus on game-feel, and to exploit the physics-engine.. Flying, dashing and swinging through the air feel great, and it always pulled me forward, despite every other aspect being terrible. Without the game design, this title would be pure lackluster student-project trash. In addition, the level design is fairly good, and repeats itself / uses sequences in just the right amount.

The cons:
Few things in this game is outright terrible, but everything (besides the above) is far below average, and not something you should charge people money for in 2018. The character-design is bland; the characters are bland; the animations are lackluster; the world feels dead, due to a lack of animation in characters in the environment; the voice-acting is somewhere between mediocre and okay, but feels... unneccicary. The dialogue is horredous and non-sensical. The amounts of bugs/glitches are a bit too high for my liking, and the pacing/difficulty/curve is inconsistent and feels prototype'y. In addition, the parts of the game- and level design *not* mentioned above are also 'meh'. Guidance is sometimes pretty bad. You constantly swap between a feeling of having cheated the game because you accidentally landed somewhere - and feel like the game cheats you, because you can just as often get unlucky or become the victim of disorienting uniform level-design. The mechanics present, besides the movement - e.g. a 'timing' mechanic inside a cave, where you can only move  at certain times - feels poorly though out, with their implementation being even worse.

In addition, this game is extremely frustrating to play with a controller. Precise aiming at moving targes is required, but any kind of auto-aim is completely abscent. I wanted to play in front of my TV, with a controller, but gave up 90 minutes in. After attempting to get the hang of mouse-and-keyboard (which seemed *MUCH* easier, had I taken the time to get used to it), and getting stuck in a rock for the second time, I gave up on the game.

Overall, this game screams ""we didn't know how to scope, and ended up with no time for polishing"". And that sounds like nitpicking, but there's a reason why they say polishing is 80% of the work. This game is maybe worth your time, if you're into FPS-platformers, but it's hardly worth your money, unless it's like... 60% off."

8033,"A Story About My Uncle is a first person platforming adventure game about a boy who searches for his lost uncle, and ends up in a world he couldn‚Äôt imagine existed. Take help of your uncle‚Äôs mysterious inventions that let you jump incredibly high and far through beautiful scenery, uncover clues to your uncle‚Äôs whereabouts, and meet fantastical creatures that will help you on your journey. 

It was too short (I completed it in 2h + Some extra content) but in overall it was a fantastic experience. The gameplay is really unique and innovative and swinging over huge distances is really satisfying. A must buy for everyone!

8041,"fun parkour game. looks good
however, overpriced for the length (2 hrs max)"
8042,"This game is entirely too short for how awesome it is. On the one hand you're a young man looking for his missing uncle, while on the other, you're a father telling the story of a fantastic adventure to your daughter. It's simple, straightforward, but still just plain fun. The gameplay and mechanics are smooth, and can be quite challenging at times, but never hair-pullingly frustrating. The story while brief, and simple, has so much heart (read: brimming over with schmaltz) that I can't help but love it. If there were ever the gaming equivalent of a children's bedtime story, this is it. The fact that Gone North have managed to create something with that kind of innocence and whimsy is just wodnerful."
8043,"PROS
+the game is pretty
+grappling across massive chasms is fun
+good music

CONS
-some areas are a bit too frustrating
-voice acting is mostly bad

OVERALL
I don't regret giving this game a play through, but have no desire to return to it. 6.5/10."
8044,"I just finished a playthrough of this game (YouTube is same as my username,) and I felt like I should leave a review, so here I am.  Quick summary: short, fun, easy-to-learn, decent graphics, and nice music.  Definitely deserves a positive review, so I am surprised it has fewer than 95% positive.

Now for more details...


The story was not particularly breathtaking, but wasn't too bad at the same time.  If you're looking for one that's incredibly in-depth and has dozens of characters who are realisticly animated, then it is not for you.  However, if you're looking for something to kill time on a random afternoon, then you'll have a fun time.

The visuals are simple enough that most computers should be able to render them at a decent framerate, but are good enough that you really feel like you're swinging through an environment full of floating rocks.  The sound is also pretty nice, especially considering that not too much of the game required it.

10/10, would smack face into rock or fall into infinite abyss again."

8061,"This is a pleasant enough but boring little game with a kinda fun but frustrating platforming mechanic. It looks beautiful sometimes and other times it just looks pretty outdated. The character design is boring and the character models would look bad even on a Playstation 2. 

It can be a bit depressing too with a melodramatic and weak tone to the story which I got fed up with pretty quickly. While the enviroments in A Story About My Uncle are also very dark and lifeless.

I'm not recommending this one because it needs more of an edge to the storytelling in my opinion. The developers could also vary up the gameplay and try to make it less frustrating. I can see that alot of people have enjoyed playing this game so more power to them. However I just got bored and found myself wanting to play something else."
8062,"Quite a great game. Solid mechanics, not too difficult, and an interesting story. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was glad it didn't overstay it's welcome by trying to draw out the length of the game."
8063,A fun platformer with an adorable story and an interesting setting. Despite its shorter running time this game struck a chord with me. If you can pick it up on sale you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

8067,Nice game
8068,"Let me start out by first saying, A Story About My Uncle is an interesting game. You're here probably from a friend recommendation or from seeing this as background gameplay from a youtuber. This game is more than just swinging as you've probably seen from a video not related to the game. It talks of a story from a dads perspective, going over his adventures trying to find his lost uncle. It includes new friendships, and losses. I was hoping for more in this game, and unfortunately you only get 2 hours of gameplay. This was a bummer for me, since it seemed to have so much potential for new maps or other swinging mechanics. This is the type of game you should relax too. Listen to some music, find interesting ways to complete levels, and challange yourself instead of just doing the simple. That will make the game last longer. Is the game worth the full price? I would say wait until its on a sale, or if you're really into adventure story games and have the money and time to fully enjoy the game, go for it!"
8069,"Very short, yet very fun game.
Probably would take forever to get all the achievments though..."
8070,It's fun and a challenge
8071,"[h1] What I liked about this game [/h1]
This game's got really fluid mechanics that are enjoyable to play through with a decent story that's fulfilling in it's own way. This game was built in a way that you won't be pulled out of the immersion you find yourself in, aside from a few frustrating times where you get stuck for a short time, but you don't have to be Albert Einstein to get yourself back on track.

[h1] What I think this game can improve on  [/h1]
More graphical customization, because of how fluid this game looked, I wanted to experience it with a smoother look since I couldn't really focus on low textures flying through the caverns. That's it really.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Great story you could play within a weekend with a few friends watching, fun for everyone. [b]10/10[/b]"
8072,"This game wasuch more than i expected. I thought i would get some fun out of it for 10 minutes, then get bored by repetitive gameplay or map design, but that was not the case. 

The game constantly adds new mechanics and story elements to keep the player busy. In the 2 hours that it took me to finish this game, i was never bored. 

Then, for the flaws. The game is really short, just around 1,5-2 hours. The story is a bit lacking and is never really expanded upon, but it's interesting enough to make the player want to see more. To my surprise, i never encountered any game breaking bugs, which is pretty much expected for a game this short. Long distance jumps were quite annoying, because judging where you were going to land was nearly impossible, resulting in a few frantic moments of panic when i missed the ledge i was aiming for.

Conclusion: If you like fast paced games similiar to ClusterTruck, Titanfall 2, etc... then you should consider buying A Story About My Uncle, because heck, it'll make your afternoon a bit more enjoyable than just playing a game of PUBG..."

8079,"[h1] Let‚Äôs review: A Story about my Uncle! [/h1]

This game was an interesting find, a platform adventure that takes you into a different dimension, in search for your missing Uncle, discovering many beautiful things along the way. While donning a special suit designed by your uncle just for you.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

+ First you greeted with an intro that serves as a tutorial of sorts, while explaining what happened to your uncle.
+ You have a suit that lets you ‚ÄúSpiderman‚Äù to nearby surfaces, but at first only once, and as the story proceeds you can upgrade your suit for more movement. 
+ Also the suit grants you certain improvements, like far jumping and a protection from falling damage!
+ You‚Äôll meet a few humanoid species that will help you along the way, while serving as company.
+ The game is fun, although if you don‚Äôt time your jumps and grapples correctly, expect to try and try over again, as you‚Äôll fall into the darkness below!
+ The sound work, both voice and soundtrack is great, really crisp!
+ Cheap game!

 [h1] Cons: [/h1]

- While the graphics are nothing special, you can truly see that the developers had a real interest in offering a fair amount of detail to the environment around you.

[h1] Final Review [/h1]

Like I said, this game was an interesting find, the storyline is a good one, one of family. And the rush you have from running off an edge and timing your jump in hopes of correctly being in range to grapple to the floating rock in front of you, and then timing again to let go at the correct time to gain enough trust to reach the platform in front of you, or fall into the darkness and start over, it‚Äôs impeccable. And I haven‚Äôt even mention the Rocket boots! You‚Äôll love them! For a good platform game I have to give this one a solid 7.5 in my book!

8080,"Amazing gameplay, meh story with meh voice acting, and the game is incredibly short for $13. Four hours of play time and I had beaten the game, excluding time trials. Regardless, still a great pick up if you catch it on sale."
8081,"best fucking $14  ive ever spent 11/10
"
8082,"well, actually it is a very nice and interesting game with a well thought through story... but the story elements are a little bit to feww and  the actual gameplay (something 3d platformer like, to describe it in very few words) lack a lot of of consistency; like sometimes you can jump and get yourself drag with your ""hook"" towards your target from 100m away, the next time you'll have to get as close as 10m to get the slightest chance to be able to survive and reach the next platform... while making sure you're targeting the ""sweet spot"" for the game to accept the request to grab something you nned to move forwarr... that's what makes the game  sometimes frustrating / annoying  at places which are slightly more complicated....

so, if the interface would be more clean/consistent throughout the game, so you could actually learn & train how to do your movements/jumps it would deserver at least two thumbs up from my side, but at the moment it's definitely lacking a better user interface, so - sadly - it's a thumbs down... well....  yes, the game actually deserves more, but the user interface is still a vital part... so i am sorry but i can't recommend it in its current state"
8083,"A Story About My Uncle is a rare game where the gameplay itself is so good that hardly anything else matters. Disguised behind the inconspicuous title, it's the most ambitious and most successful Spiderman-simulator I've ever encountered. Starting out with a mega-jump, progressing with a grappling hook(ish something) and moving on to even more in-flight tools, the game provides you with the exhilarating feeling of traversing the air without actually being able to fly. Your range increases to many 100s of metres as you progress, but you can (and will) still die at every move, as you're not actually flying, only almost. Just having the game as a sandbox is easily worth the price of admission, the beautiful levels and the story are just nice additions.

As it's often the case with ambitious games, ASAMU is not without faults. Audio is nerly non-existent and the story is paper thin and the character visuals are subpar with the environment, though these are the easiest to forgive if the gameplay is perfect. Unfortunately, there are a few major issues with the gameplay, as well. Most importantly, depth perception is difficult (increasing the FOV helps), and I just can't believe that the grappling range is the same for every object, which makes free running much more difficult and less satisfying. Then it's too easy to crash into objects and lose momentum, which is realistic but breaks the movement too often. There are some very difficult jump combinations, which easily become annoying - it helps to think of them as puzzles instead of arcade challenges. Finally, your grappling device is not really a grappling device - a great advice in the forum was to consider it as more of a magnet.

Even with the shortcomings, ASAMU is a magnificent experience. When you break out of the caves into level 4, you just don't want to leave the open skies, and as a massive surprise, in the middle of the level you get the rocket boots, which increase your range even further. Then the final level heavily ramps up the difficulty - there's the most talked about falling cubes room (which is annoying but not unfair), the falling stalactite corridor (which was actually super fun for me), and an ungodly I-dont-know-how-many-hundred-meters ascent which no one mentions but made me nauseous despite having absolutely no fear of heights. The sheer impact of the game's spaces is so powerful.

With all these, you'd think this game is superb speedrun material - but it's not quite. Due to the issues mentioned above, it's very difficult to have fluent runs. Maybe it's worth mastering the game mechanics to the level where breaks are not too frequent, but you either have to be very good at 3D navigation or you have to practice an awful lot. Neither works for me right now.

When Mirror's Edge came out in 2008, I adored the freedom of moving around in the air without actually flying. A Story About My Uncle is about five times the experience - if you like this kind of game, do yourself a favour and give it a shot."
8084,"Fun little game, Unique idea and controls.  A little on the easy side though. About 2.5 hours gameplay."
8085,I see myself always coming back to replay this game because of the atmosphere of the game. Peaceful yet also thrilling and adventurous at the same time.
8086,It was a great story game and I'd love to find more games like this! 5 stars to you creators!
8087,good game....

Parkour with extra tech tools. Very entertaining."
8097,a delightful game thank you for the story and the puzzle of exploration
8098,"for ¬£0.39, who can complain? the gameplay is actually pretty fun tho"
8099,"It is a heartwarming story about a boy trying to find his uncle in a mysterious land. In the game, you travel across various floating platforms and rocks like spiderman. The game is not difficult when it starts, but in the last part of the game, the diffiulty spikes noticeably."
8100,the story is to short. the ending felt a little lazy and overall i just thought it didnt live up to its potential story. but i did like the gameplay i had tons of fun with that its unique and difficult i loved it.

8109,"Horrible voice acting, but besides that, there is a cool 80-styled Wrinkle in Time campaign and unique gameplay."
8110,"Not bad. Flying through the air, pulling myself along on an energy beam like a sci-fi Tarzan and swinging from rock to rock is really fun. Some of the environments, especially the final ice cave level, are stark and beautiful. The game as a whole feels low-budget and indy, in a tolerable way. The story isn't much, but it suffices. Short, accessible, worth the time and money to play."
8111,"I genuinely cannot recommend this game enough. If you're into story, it has a very simple one that'll nonetheless leave you wondering and coming up with your own ideas only to have them either confirmed or trounced by the lesser yet just interesting enough reveals. This game is as close as one can get to living through a bedtime story, nice and short, not without tribulations, and full of excitement with a satisfying conclusion. If you ever see it on sale you'd be absolutely insane not to nab it, and even off sale it's worth the meager price."
8112,THAT ENDING THO
8113,"Interesting and fun way to travel, but some points ingame can be quite tricky.
Simple but lovely story and likable characters.
Game is not too long (unless you get stuck somewhere all the time like me) and doesn't have any fighting mechanics as the main enemy is the 'ground'."
8114,Gets frustrating and boring quickly.
8115,"This game was interesting. I was intrigued with the story line, but the it has a lot of the elements I enjoy and succeed at least from First Person Shooters, like fast and precise mouse movements.

If you enjoy FPS type games, this might totally be your cup of tea. I wanted more of the story, but as the difficulty of the puzzles gets harder, I'm kinding that the length to progress is getting quite a bit higher without a proportional payoff."
8116,"Excellent game. Heads up, this game is short (took me about 4 hours) so know what you're paying for, but I found the travel mechanic very fun and entertaining. Good little story as well."
8117,"I'm gonna be a basic review and make a pros and cons list.
Pros:
Great ideas
Fantastic storytelling
decent story
Im a fan of the idea of the stray language
cool whale
Cons:
some part were far too difficult for me to enjoy
I kept forgetting i had rocket boot making the first con true
some sections felt really boring, mainly the cave areas,
half of the time in the cave ares i had trouble finding where to go
sometimes if you have bad timing on a release you would hit your head or not go far enough


Because of the above stated things, this game is not for me. I would highly reccomend weighing the enjoyment of the idea of the concepts against the fact that sometimes you're silently goinging through simple and long areas and sometimes you get confused just because you didn't look up as looking upward for your path had not been required of you for a while."
8118,The sprint jump is just terrible.
8119,"This game was fantastic.  Not perfect, but what is?  Very fun to fly around the worlds the game developers created via grappling hook(s).  It's nice to not be shooting everything for a change."
8120,"9/10
-can i have more ples..."
8121,"a very chill game with a unique and intriguing worldbuild. the game's mechanics are fun and smooth. The sets just look g o r g e o u s. many breathtaking views and beautiful worlds that make you beg for more.

except for the npcs
the npcs are horrifying

overall, worth a play"
8122,"Just finished the game and it was awesome, hard but challenging with a great pace.
Lovely story and atmosphere"
8123,gud gem
8124,Really fun relaxing game with a quirky story and excellent platforming mechanics
8125,"This is a great game, it is a bit on the short side, but still really good. I highly recommend this! I recomend waiting for a sale tho. It has a good story and fun gameplay."
8126,"A Story About My Uncle (ASAMU) is a game about a man telling his daughter a story of an adventure before she goes to bed. The story involves the man following his uncle into an unknown world full of mysteries and challenges involving parkour. The story itself is okay. It's not great and it doesn't last long: a little over 2 hours; maybe less depending on how quick you are.

The movement in the game revolves around a suit which enable you to jump far higher or further than you would normally, grab onto walls, obstacles, ceilings and other bit of the environment with an ""energy rope"". The introduction of this suit provides fast paced parkour and platforming which can be both exciting and challenging at points. 

As far as value goes, the game also includes a time trial mode. This didn't interest me but if it's the kind of things you like, you could get a lot more time out of ASAMU. Overally, it's a good game but not at retail price. You're better of waiting for a sale when it's being sold for between ¬£2 and ¬£5."
8127,"Great game with great mechanics and great atmosphere. You're exploring a completely new world.
Pluses: 
- great gameplay (it's just cool to fly using the grappling hook!)
- the game is challenging enought to make you sweat to get to certain checkpoints
- nice (positive) atmosphere 
- great checkpoint system (before each hard section)
Minuses:
- maybe a bit too short
- the plot could have been more detailed (but actually that doesn't spoil the game - it's still good).

In some sense the game is relaxing and I would recommend it to anyone who liked 'The Lifeless Planet'. I loved both."
8128,A bit short buy fun to play.
8129,"Very fun!  Only around 2 hours of gameplay, though.  I loved the feeling of the physics in the game, and the aesthetics are on-point.  Highly recommend if you can pick it up for a few dollars.  This is the kind of game that makes you just feel awesome.  Chaining swings, long jumps launching you between flying islands.  It is like a dream.  Short, but sweet.  I will likely replay it just to see the visuals again.  Nice, casual game to pick up.  Very relaxing to play."
8130,"This game needs some serious controller updates I find it really hard to use my xbox controller when playing. Distances are very hard to judge and more you often find you‚Äôre self going but my timing was right this game needs bigger hit boxes.

The story and narration is awesome the game has a very indie feel to it. You feel as if you were being read a book before bed as a child once again and defiantly gives me some feelings of nostalgia.

"
8131,"A game that just didn't want to end. Its Beautiful, has a awesome story and wonderful gameplay, But sadly is very short. It will take you maybe 2 hours, 3-4 if you take your time and marvel at the landscape. and maybe another half hour to try time trial mode before you rage quit. (Time Trial is really hard) once you reach the end you will cry (unless your a heartless monster) it is a very heart grabbing story. I would Recommend it but sadly only if its on sale."
8132,"I jumped in, thinking this was a sandbox/puzzle game.   Once I finished the very long tutorial, the credits rolled and there was nothing left to do. This game has about 1 hour of gameplay, and has little to no replay value.  I would not recommend buying this 'game'."
8133,"This is a short game I have beat it 3 times now. That is not a bad thing the story is good and funny at times. It play great, and I have had no issues with it even on a potato (laptop apu from 2013). Defiantly worth the buy."
8134,"Started strong but I found it a little repetative, and the 'creature' models put me off a lot, reminded me of a game from 1998."
8135,great game!! The sensitivity is a bit hard to get used to though
8136,Astounding.
8137,I really enjoied the story told by the narrator.
8138,"Its a clar 5 this game, wounderul graphics, atmospher and story.
Its an original !
Im very hapyy i played it."
8139,"WOW! Didn't expect this game to keep me so hooked onto it that I would finish it in one sitting. It's incredible. Unique story with a great message to the player and stunning visuals. Just another proof, that video games are the ultimate medium, the ultimate form of art."
8140,Tbh the best platformer Ive ever played. Am in love with the movement system.
8141,real fun but pretty short game..
8142,"I might just have around an hour ingame, but i feel pretty confident when i say this game runs very good. Overall good game. Recommended by me :P"
8143,Very chill and nice
8144,"I wish this game was longer. Not because I felt disappointed by the lack of length. I just wish there was more of it.

This game is beautiful in every way. The floating world it shows you is beautiful. The strange people you meet along the way are beautiful. And the indescribable feeling it gives you of flying through the air, never fully in control, but always able to do something to determine where you land (huh, I guess I just described it) is the most beautiful thing of all."
8145,"- Interesting but sometimes glitchy mechanics
- Not bad but also not good story
+- Nice parkour feeling and gameplay but it is too short. When you get used to it and start jumping around fluently it ends.

On sale it worths the price."
8146,"This game is an acquired taste to me. My first run was rather frustrating because it took me some time to understand the quirks of the grappling hook and at some points the path wasn't very well marked, making me get stuck and/or fall into the abyss a lot.
Then again, now I see it more like the story-driven experience it's intended to be. And story-wise, it was very touching and full of feels (especially the final levels). [spoiler]Not to mention when the true meaning of the whole story dawns on you.[/spoiler]
So yeah, If you like exploring, nice visuals and good stories I recommend it. Oh, and the mechanics are pretty fun once you get used to them."
8147,it's for kids.
8148,"Good game, it's fun and has a nice story. Not very long but i didn't mind"
8149,"Gameplay and the adventure of it was enjoyable but the story just seemed to always fall into the background. I kept forgetting what i was doing and why I was doing it. It didnt make it a bad game though. The envoirnments were beautiful and swinging all around was a lot of fun.

If you are looking for a pretty platformer this is your game. If you care about story then maybe you should think twice."
8150,"Fun game, only downside is the length (That's what she said) the game is unfortunately very short. Otherwise well written and fun gameplay mechanics."
8151,Loved the story and gameplay. The platforming and jumping feels pretty natural and the new mechanics get introduced at a great pace. I was a little disappointed the game ends so quickly but I'll take quality over quantity any day.
8152,"Honestly the game was too short in my opinion, some physics based jumps left me raging like a 13 year old on hormones. 

But overall good game, wished it was longer"
8153,"Its a very good game based around momentum. 
Has a good short story. Is a good game to waist a bit of time in."
8154,"A short story game, that I enjoyed playing. I didn't have any difficulty playing this game or leaping around. Some people complain about the controls  or edges being to strict. But I was more than easily able to figure out where I needed to go and what I needed to do.  The checkpoints are frequent and overall the game was fun. Wish it has more and more story. A part 2 that expands on the story...maybes Freds Adventures?"
8155,"I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves platformer/free running style games. The physics in this game are on point.
There are many ways to complete each level and a load of achievements to unlock.

I would suggest picking this game up on a 50% off sale (as it is at the time of this review) or lower."

8159,"This is a short game. Really short. I would recommend getting it on sale.

Length aside, however, this is the best first-person platformer I've ever played. There is no combat, and you instantly respawn after a mistake. The mechanics are simple, but end up having a lot of depth."
8160,"A kid's bedtime story brought to life. Yes, the controls can be a little tricky, but in my opinion that's its only downside. The worlds are beautiful. The story is simple, fantastical, and heartwarming (TO ME-- there are a few ways you can interpret the story, and the writers have confirmed that they've purposely left many aspects of it open ended for players to decide). Short and sweet. I would grab it on sale due to its length and the fact that it always seems to be on sale!"
8161,By far one of the best parkour games that I've ever played.
8162,Love the game! Only down side to it is that it's quite small and in my opinion should contain more content. It's definitely worth buyibg tho.
8163,"An amazing game. stunning visuals, fun controls that are easy to get the hang of, and a beautiful story. the first time a game has managed to make me cry since super mario bros on world 8. if you have a bit of money in your wallet, and a yearning for a great game, buy this."
8164,fun but I wish if was longer
8165,"Amazing game with a good storyline, I enjoyed it very much. 10/10"
8166,"As someone who is terrified of heights in real life this was almost like a horror game. Props for that. The first person platforming in this game is good. I found it surprisingly difficult at times, which was nice. It IS a good game overall but it could have been alot better. 

[b]The bad[/b]
- Sliding of ledges, your body getting stuck on stuff when grappling. Stuff like that was hella annoying. It took a lil bit to get used to the physics.
- Too much focus on mediocre story telling. The story is meh and so is the voice acting(if not plain bad). The game would have been better of with more of what was actually good - the gameplay. More levels.
- Did not like the time trials(abilites not being unlocked). Replaying the same exact levels only with a goal time just feels like lazy design. Would have liked to see more effort there.
- For a game with little to no replayability it is a bit short(2-3hours).

[b]Rating[/b]
6/10, buy on sale. ~5 euros is fair price."
8167,"A Story about my uncle is a platforming game FULL OF TRAIL AND ERROR where you use an electron beam to latch on to objects and swing from object to object(like spiderman).  There is a problem with the not ever being sure how far your, infact sometimes there may only be one floating object around that you need to latch onto to progress, you will find yourself undershooting, or that the game unforgivingly gives your a split second to be able to latch on to the platform. 

INCONSISTANT GRAPPLING

 I found myself pressing the latch button over and over again while in air hoping that it would finally come out,  I've done so many times only to have it latch and release because I was so desparate not to fall I was mashing the buttons and caused it to release. This happens because you do not have an unlimited amount of latches, in the begining you only get 2 and then finally 3  latches while your in the air,  once you have depleted this, you need to land in order to replenish your power.

HARD TO GET INTO THE ""SWING"" OF THINGS!

I""m not quite sure if once you latch on to a platform that your swinging, or being drawn to an object your latching on to, and there doesn't seem to be any free weight shifting. So you can't swing left or right.  often times I found it very difficult to understand the physic of getting from one platform to the next, sometimes I felt like I had the right momentem and direction, other times I thought I did and ended up falling or bumping into the object I latched on to thus slowing my momentum.

YOU WILL FALL A LOT !

You will fall, alot in this game, you will die more times than any FPS  the frustrating part is that there is not quick reset button you will half to weight until you fall, sometimes several 100's of feet before the game puts you back at the last check point,  and some of those checkpoints are brutal."
8168,Wanting something diffrent this is a good game for that though realize the platforming can get a bit rough at times but the story helps it along well enough
8169,"When I read reviews praising the gameplay, I wonder if we even played the same game. A Story About My Uncle would be a great game- if it worked the way it was supposed to. 

Let me elaborate.

A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer where you grapple to rocks and stuff and swing your way through levels like a majestic version of Spiderman in an armored suit. Unless you don't. The game is VERY touchy with where it lets you attach grapples and at what distance. While you may be able to grapple perfectly fine once, the thing will refuse to attach at the same distance later, sending you plummeting to your death. Or, you may think you are in safety, attaching your grapple to secure land and waiting to be hauled up there, only to get caught on a ledge or for the grapple to decide to release, and have minutes of precarious parkour be completely for naught.

It is absolutely mindblowingly frustrating.

The game also has a way of having absolutely no idea of consistency. At one point near the end of the game, I got really really stuck because I didn't see where I had to go. Turns out you had to grapple on to the spiky things on the cave ceiling that were not marked with runes and were never grapple-able previously. Another point even later had you grappling to the bare ceiling, again something that just wasn't possible beforehand but the game expected you to know.

Don't get me started onto blind leaps of faith because I cannot even tell you how often I got completely lost only to literally throw myself off a cliff in sheer spite and rage only to see that the next platform was hidden behind the corner where you had ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF SEEING IT. And, unlike the franky awful and glitchy grappling, this was intended. I'd call it a very very bad choice for a game that doesn't give you any hints.

I'd like to compare it to Mirror's Edge for a second, my favorite game of all time and also a landmark in FPP games. If you got realy lost, say, if you haven't played for a while and got chucked in mid-level with no idea of what the hell you are doing anymore, you could hold ALT and it would spin Faith in the direction she needed to go. Nothing was highlighted, it just pointed you in the right direction.

ASAMU doesn't have anything remotely like that, ending with me spending hours accidently backtracking through most of any given level after a long hiatus without even noticing. You are on your own.


So anyway, it has bad mechanics and doesn't work half the time.


Another point: This game's concept of difficulty. It's either ""let's take away a feature we gave you earlier ex machina style"" or ""let's construct this level in such a way that you will be fighting the mechanics at every moment of your miserable existance"". Because this game would be perfectly doable and even calming if the godforsaken grapple and jetpack worked the way they supposed to.

The endgame really brings this out.


So enough about shitty mechanics.

Let's talk story.

There is:
-really horrible voiceacting
-annoying characters
-annoying story that tries so hard to be endearing but instead falls flat on its face, violently
-an ending that is the epitome of anti-climatic and disappointing


So TLDR
Pros:
-Interesting idea
-Would be fun if it worked
-Very pretty (if you don't count the character models)

Cons:
-frustrating and glitchy mechanics that hate you almost as much as you hate them
-bad characters
-bad story


just generally... get it on sale. It's not worth full price."
8170,so good
8171,"[i] Strangely enough I have to thank once most hated and cancerous youtuber [b]Leafyishere[/b] for this game's discovery.[/i]
[list]

 [*] [b] Gameplay [/b] - It's simply great , alot of replayability. just fun to run and fly around. Game's best part.

 [*] [b] Sound [/b] - Sound in this game is oddly satisfying. voice acting is mediocre, but I don't know what is it exactly, the visuals plus overall sound design is very satisfying.

 [*] [b] Story [/b] - I am recommending this game Sheerly because of the gameplay. I know its about uncle (duuh) and everything takes place in dream or something, go figure out yourself. If anything it will be good bonus on top of addicting gameplay.

[/list]"
8172,"Really good game. It could have a better story, but it is cool anyway. xD"
8173,parkour with a light beam grappling hook and rocket boots to save your uncle. pretty fun
8174,"This game was such a journey, Alot of fun if you are just into the mechanic of jumping around and using a grapple hook. 
A very similar game (In my opinion) is ""Valley"" which is also on sale currently. Both the games have similar pros and cons, but Ill do my best to sum down the game

Pros~
+ 6.4 hour game according to my account, and that was 6.4 hours I dont think anyone would regret, however realistically it should only take about 3~ hours to beat. 
+ Perfect amount of difficulty, and requires creative movement to succeed.
+ Amazing atmosphere
+ graphically not ""INSANE"" but definitely not bad either.
+ experienced no bugs

Cons~
- character design was not super interesting
- story line wasnt exactly ""Grasping""
- the faces some of the NPC's make are gross to me."
8175,"AMAZING STORY. definitely worth the price, you should play it in your life its such a nice game just get it you wont be disappointed sure theres no replay value but the price is worth an immersive 1 time playthrough just do it"
8176,Very good story but it is a little short.
8177,"This game is fucking awful.

I paid 2.50 for this, and I honestly feel scammed. The game is only about ~2 hours long to complete. Which, I didn't mind too much, as I did only play two fifty, but holy shit, I would never buy this game for full price.

The graphics and animations are awful. I know it's an indie game, but it really dragged down the experience watching the weird fish people maneuvering back and forth.

Controls are really damn slippery. The concept  is fun, but you'll eventually be fighting not to slip and slide off a ton of ledges trying to get from place to place.

The voice acting is just... bad. It's not well written and the delivery sounds just awful. The fact that the script is crammed with weird jokes and references (there's a random brony reference when you pick up an upgrade later on) just makes the whole game feel so awkward to play because you have to listen to this weird dude and fish kid talk.

If you want to try a fun first person platformer bogged down with these awful artistic choices, then wait for it to go on sale. But really, there are better options you can find.
"
8178,<3
8179,"Incredible Game, Just be careful Not To Fall!"
8180,"I think this game has an interesting premis and interesting mechanics, but I feel as though it is poorly executed.

The story is captivating and interesting for a majority of the game, but the end come sto such a screeching halt at the end and has an extremely dissatifying ending. It felt as though there was supposed to be two more levels at the end, but it just ended. This is my biggest complaint.

The gameplay was ok for the most part, but it seemed very inconsistent. It seemed like while some movements work the first time, they dont work the next. Sometimes I can grapple to a surface and pop over an edge, sometime I can't. It made a lot of moments in this very frustrating and annoying. 

My main point is while this game looks great, its frustrating and clunky and doesn't deliver on the ""story"" part of this. not worth the buy unless it is on a big sale."
8181,.
8182,"Honestly this game is amazing.

The ammount of dedication and aspire that went into this game to make it as good looking and playing is astounding.
The story is compelling and makes you want to come back for more everytime u play. The graphics [b]OH THE GRAPHICS[/b]
THEY ARE AMAZING! Every detail in this game really pops and makes the game 10x better. god I wish I can play this game in 4k. 

I give this game an 8/10 stars

Why not 10 you might ask? One major thing that I have to point out is the character design and game length 
You only get a glimpse at him at the end of the game and maddie only is there for about 1/3rd of the game. When I first beat the game I thought there would be more to it like going on and aventure with fred and not just him sending you home. Also the price tag... I think the price needs to be lower because of the length of the game in all. On the plus side there is a time trials mode for extra replayability. But besides that i reccomend it!"
8183,"Very hard, but also very pretty, and somewhat short. So far I've only done the main story, which took me approximately 3 hours. Not very surprising for a first-person parkour game, since this is a genre that tends to be short!

At the same time, you have challenges, as if the basic main story wasn't hard  enough! :P

Mirror's Edge, Deadcore and loads of other first-person parkour games like to tone down gadgets or else introduce combat. A Story About My Uncle gives you no weapons, but instead you get a magical grapple that attaches to certain surfaces. This is pretty innovative, and very satisfying, despite the high difficulty!
(Years later, we have Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which also has a grapple, but in my opinion, this game handles the grappling mechanic a little more smoothly).

You'll find yourself swinging across large expanses in deep caverns and high up in the sky, in a weird fantasy world populated by docile frog people and ginormous monsters. The game is broken up into small chapters that can be replayed  post-completion if you're aiming for certain achievements or to improve your score.

There are also collectibles (hidden lore!), which are super-hard to find (at least, for me).
To gauge the difficulty, I'd say that it's somewhere between Super Meat Boy and Portal: not only do you need fast reflexes and some kind of strategy, but you also need to use your gadget to gain momentum to overcome large obstacles or cross large chasms."
8184,"Awesome game, 100% recommend 




uncle fred ;_;"
8185,"Great story, very emersive and fantastic fun."
8186,"Awesome story, awesome graphics... proper fun time.10/10"
8187,"A beautiful game, really fun gameplay and i wish there are more games like it.
A true adventure
this would be a tops (if not gut wrenching) VR game"
8188,"A really simple and fun parkour game with a good story to go along with it. Definitely worth the buy, but wait for a good sale. The game is only about 2 hours long."
8189,"please make number 2 
too good"
8190,"love this game, controls are great, multiple ways to get to the same destination.

If things look impossible.. go for it anyway. If you're having a hard time completing a part, take a break, maybe even for a few days. 

I'd definiteely recomend, cute story, beautiful graphics, it's the kinda game you wanna play over again because it's so immersive and fun."
8191,"[h1] A review in 100 words : [/h1] 

[b]A story about my uncle[/b] is an awesome FPS 3D platformer that focuses on speed and air. You have a suit that allows you to traverse massive open levels. In terms of fun factor, it's a blast to play thanks to the level design and throughout it's runtime it keeps on adding new mechanics every 10 minutes or so. It runs well and controls well. This game can be completed in less than 2 hours so keep that in mind. Otherwise, pick it up for $5 and you will love it.

[b]4/5[/b]"
8192,"I like the game and the story it's really good. The game is just parkour so you can find it boring but i didn't find it difficult, i found it a bit short, i just finished it in 2.5 hours. Maybe 13‚Ç¨ for this game is not right."

8206,Real good.
8207,On a serious note tho guys.
8208,"short game, some part a little hard to get through but overall it's a very good game. 8/10"
8209,"I really like this game, calming voice, interesting story and concept 
BUT
the grappler doesn't grab way too much. You jump many times, reasonable distance but still no possible way to grab it. It's kinda fristrating after trying for half an hour at the same spot.
"
8210,"A good game/story, too short sadly but I hope there will be a 2nd part.. maybe the small child who is being told the story enters the world? :D


Here the story of this game, be aware, **IT HAS SPOILERS!**


[spoiler]Fred was known to be able to climb mountains at the age of 52. You can see a newspaper on a wall in the epilogue stating that exploit.

Fred died during a climbing accident. He probably felt into a crevice or similar. His body has never been found (hence the memorial). 

The story is the story the kid made up in his head to imagine how his uncle could have survived, he viewed him as a genius (he was expert in quantum physics as a wall says), and imagined that in his ice tomb he survived with a mystical travel device, that he was living with happy and nice creatures in a small paradise inside the mountains... He imagined himself traveling in that world. just like his uncle did, to find him again, but, in the end, lose him forever (admit his death).

That's why you don't get to open the locker in the end, and there is no launch pad. That story never happened. 

That's also why the glowing message in the final ice room before you quit your uncle is translated ""Acceptance"".[/spoiler]"
8211,"A simple yet fun parkour game with some nice visuals.
it is around 3-4 Hours long.
Pick it up during a sale."
8212,.
8213,"Difficult to bin this game into a genre - but I'd call it a puzzle platformer. If Portal had a prequel that didn't have any portals, the gameplay might look something like this.

It's very imaginative with the storytelling, and the world is visually stunning. The voice acting is very good where the animation might lack just a bit, but fortunately it's usually just the player and the world.

Good pacing, though the story is short.

Overall a great game that you can finish in an afternoon, but probably spend much more time on in challenges."
8214,"Although it's short, it's a very fun platformer game where you get to play around with some interesting tools to complete the challenges, meanwhilst a father tells his daughter of the adventure as narrator."
8215,"That's one of the games that remember the purpose of the games, not to tell stories but to share them."
8216,"Absolutely loved this game!

The mechanics are good. I got the hang of it pretty quickly, though the additions throughout the game I found a bit challenging to adapt and combine.
The story is great, really pulled me into the game and kept me hooked until I finished it.
The design of the worlds and their scenery are gorgeous. The graphics are nothing too fancy (there isn't a dozen filters thrown into it) but that all is simply unnessecary here. It's a beautiful sight."
8217,"A Story About My Uncle is told as a child's bedtime story, with all the dreamlike logic that implies. It's charming and imaginative, with a beautiful art style to match. The ""magnetic rope"" mechanic makes for some very fun platforming that can be suitably challenging in the later stages. This is an underappreciated jewel."
8218,"Enjoyable game!
Pros. Not to complicated and changed up the concept from time to time so it never felt old. It had a good play time for me aswell.
Cons. Most characters look lifeless and a bit creepy. It also feels like you are really short from time to time."
8219,Very relaxing yet entertaining
8220,"I remember back when I played the alpha demo of the game and really enjoying it. So I was very surprised and excited when I found out that they had fully released the game on steam.

It is quite a unique platformer puzzle game. The game looks very pretty (until you die cause you where too busy looking at the scenery and not where you had to go next) The story is quite simple  but that doesn't make it a bad game. It may not take long to complete but it feels like it's a good length for this type of game."

8222,"Beautiful in every single way, 10/10 I enjoyed every single second of it, except dying though, I got med"
8223,"Very frustrating mechanics. The grapple mechanic worked fine, but the game keeps adding mechanics that you have to chain together perfectly. The momentum always seemed off and bumping into something threw you off in another direction to your death. I didn't fun it fun at all. It was just a first-person platformer. I wouldn't recommend it."
8224,Cool story line fun parkour great time killer.
8225,"A great game with fun gameplay, story is not that great, neither is the voice acting, but the story isn't the strong point of this game, but it feels alittle short but definetly a game worth your time."
8226,oh my gosh i love this game so much!!!!! dfiusbhfibfahbfuiahfuihnaufihfuhafnuifhujvfnbvgfuignogri gnruiguighuighgu hrhnsruighbi9seghuigsvvgrsegeZghruiGHYGHHGGUHurHGUHRUGHUIHRGuIGRUhr98HGRHRUGH&URHGREKURRRRRGHERUgtuRHGhgtzuigruigrghrgbgrhgfuigfgfgfjiogjiogjiogjiofrjiogrjiogfrdjiogdgdgdjigfjijiogjidijhdgijodgjiogfddghhjiojhhrhjiojohrdfhjiogffiodihdtiojxd;ohyio;hjx;dj;jkixchopgxtfjk lgfuizsbgvfh vgyughrsdjkegf8ghefuklgfeyghdhksdgbyhydfhdeghjguhyghghgsdfjkghsuighuhguiGHUGHUIGHuihgsuGiugsdhigsuhguihGFJUGHIGHGSUDIhn(:
8227,"Short playthrough, decent story, fun gameplay, laughably bad character models (seriously though), too expensive for only ~3 hours or so of gameplay. Still, i'd recommend it, 7/10."
8228,I would like a refund!
8229,"Ye i can see why people would like this game, over all i do rate this game highly, i do like the concept of it but theres a big lack of control with the grapple and jumping, i think they should add much more places to grapple like at the bottom of rocks to make it more fun and make it so you can control your jumps and where they go, great game, nice concept but needs more work."
8230,"Boring.  Sure its pretty and has some nice aspects like the grappling device, but the game is repetitive and full of just trial and error.  Plus the voice acting is pretty bad.  Most of my playtime is from the game idling."
8231,"Overall I'd say this is a pretty good game, it's made for a purpose and that is to make a story, the gameplay is also quite good and can be challenging at times. I cant say there's a whole lot of replayability because the story is exactly the same every time and theres not very interesting secrets to find (though a second playthrough will net you some extra enjoyment in a fraction of the time the first took)

However it can be a bit weird at times. Hitboxes arent optimized which is minimal, though still annoying when you fall off the edge several times because of super fast collisions.

The one thing I'd like improved about this game is content. It's not fun enough even though it has good gameplay (that can still be improved upon). It'd be really cool to see user-made levels so the community could try others, though that might take away from the feel of this being a single player experience.

7/10 Could be better, could be a LOT worse."

8234,WTF an FPS platformer? Weird - but it works! Tried playing with a game controller at first but as the difficulty ramps up I think it eventually becomes unplayable with a controller. Stick to keyboard and mouse if you want a frustration free experience.
8235,"Interesting game, wasn't really exciting enough to keep playing so I stopped after 45 or so minutes. Cool concept but really lacked depth in my opinion."
8236,"Fluid, challenging platformer with pretty environments"
8237,"I bought the game when it was on sale a while ago, and only just got round to playing it.

I wouldn't say it's a great game but I wouldn't say it's a terrible game either. 

The world itself is amazingly beautiful, the devs did a great job with the graphics (I played on high settings I think). However it's basically a repetitive puzzle type game. All you are doing is jumping from island to island through numerous amounts of 'levels' or 'zones'. 

It's not exactly hard but it is rage inducing and it's simply just redoing it until you get it right. But again EXTREMELY repetitive.

The story itself is okay, however after all of that you'd think there would be more of a ending and not just what it was, it didn't have much depth to it. 

Very short story, not sure if worth the original ¬£10 but I'm happy with the sale price I got for it just for a few hours of entertainment. 

Overall it's not awful, but it's not the best. If you don't mind repetitive games that might make you rage then go for it. But if you like in depth games that will last ages I would say it isn't for you."
8238,"BEFORE I REVIEW: This is a very short game, only about 2-3 hrs of playtime so I would advise only getting this while on sale REVIEW: I really love this game. The movement is smooth, the visuals are astounding and its all together a great concept. My only downside with it is that it feels incomplete, its such a short game and has such a forced ending that it felt rushed near the finale. Other than that one downside I would definetly say to pick this game up on sale."
8239,Amazing. This game doesn't need a deatailed review - simply breathtaking with a suprisingly intruiging story- quite short... maybe not worth full price but if you can get this game on sale it is totally worth it!
8240,Good
8241,"Overall a really great game, and worth your money. Although you can get through the story pretty quickly, its just as fun to speedrun levels. I suggest it to anybody whos looking for a relaxing game."
8242,"What a beautiful game.
This game was in my wishlist for quite some time and I finally got it on the last Winter Sale, no regret getting it, the only regret was not getting it earlier.
The environment is really pretty and detailed. I didn't face any issues with the movements, only the physics feel a little weird when you try to swing on things, but after a while you get the hang of things (pun intended) and everything becomes easier.
The game gives you different ways to approach a challenge, you can go high swinging on things or you can go through more wide paths with less chance to die. Although I died a lot trying to test things, it didn't make me frustrated at all, on the contrary, the feeling of accomplishment after getting through a certain part was very rewarding.
I wanna see a second part of this game, please.
"
8243,Very very nice game.I wonder why is it so unpopular tho :)
8244,"I haven't learned much about the uncle, but it's fun to play while tlaking to friends deciding what to play. You know what I mean?"
8245,Story is really good but the ending is disappointing. Fun to speed run tho
8246,"Very nice art style, good music and the grapling mechanic is awesome. You are like Tarzan but better"
8247,such swinging
8248,good meme
8249,"I honestly wish I could meet all of those characters again...
[spoiler] I wanna see Maddie, I wanna see Fred with her. I wanna see the village and the strays after the person you play as left them. I don't even care if there's any gameplay, I just wanna know what happens after, and if he ever meets them all again. [/spoiler]"
8250,"It's short, but the platorming mechanics are well designed. Just when I thought they were done adding to the movement system they'd hand you something more. As you progress through the game it opens up a little and gives you multiple paths for traversal that vary in difficulty/verticality slightly. Overall it's a lot of fun to play and I'd recommend it to anyone who sees it during a sale."
8251,Just wish after the story there was a multiplayer/community maps.. 10/10 game
8252,"One of the best games I've ever played in terms of atmosphere, graphical pleasure and story line."
8253,"amazing game, 10/10 ending"
8254,Fun little game with great platforming mechanics and physics.
8255,godly
8256,.
8257,"Great Story, beautiful game and well worth the price."
8258,Rly nice game
8259,"One of the best single player games i have played. great story plot and line, and is a good game to play when bored or tired."
8260,The game is amazing however I wish it was longer because it only took me 3 hours to complete and I took my sweet time on completing it too
8261,"no way.. the game is all jumping puzzles, but often you cannot see your destination because it is blocked, or the rock that you need to grapple is spinning in a weird way. the jumps require you to leap off a ledge to be in range of the grapple target, so you are trying to aim while you are falling. you may like jumping puzzle games, but you will restart dozens of times just trying to figure out where you are supposed to land! is this hardcore parkour? and it did not match with the gentle, slow kid-friendly story... too bad because the cute 3D character animations were quite charming, so was the gentle music and the soothing voice acting. it is just the level design... not sure what they were thinking!

... so, now a couple years later, I tried playing through the game again. there are a couple tricks that I did not notice previously, like the jump point having a triangle pointing to the landing. I got a bit further and the gameplay got worse. The game goes into a pitch-black terrain, then drops the aim-assisting triangles, that makes it even harder to see the targets.

I played this game on an ubuntu linux computer, with radeon mesa graphic drivers. I played with a keyboard and mouse. It supports a controller, but I would think that would be so much harder. The game uses the Unreal Game Engine, and it takes up 1,500 MBs of diskspace. As for technical issues, I had none and the game ran very smoothly."
8262,very nice
8263,Great game
8264,Just buy it.
8265,"Its extremely difficult for me at the third part with Maddie's Village section. 
Practically the worlds get more and more difficult for new people like me to even complete any sections.
Other than that it's a well made game obviously with good graphics and moderate fps with no rendering issues what so ever."
8266,"Great Game! A little short but an excellent game for 2014. Still good in 2018.

Good to buy on special."
8267,Fun
8268,this game had a great story with great pakour with real difficulty would play over an over again
8269,"The game might be short, but the gameplay is extremly fun."
8270,"To be honest, I wasn't really expecting much of this game. The mechanics of flying through the air looked fun, but I really didn't expect much of a story. What this is, however, is a beautiful cascade of visuals, soundtrack, and a rekindling of child-like imaginations that I'd long since forgotten. The story starts out with a father telling his daughter a bedtime story...a story about his Uncle. In this story, the father retells an adventure from his childhood when he set out to find his missing uncle. 

To me, this game was uplifting. It's genuinely refreshing to play a captivating game that is challenging, touching, and completly lacking in violence. Beyond the brilliantly simple controls, the game consistently kept me intrigued with increasingly exhilarating challenges, and the promise of answers at the end of the road. And as we explore what appears to be the vivid imaginations of a child, we learn a more poignant truth behind this experience, one that as an adult, is incredibly close-to-home.

I highly recommend this game"
8271,Words cannot discribe how good this game is. The only complaint i have with this game is that it is extremely short. I played through it in 3 hours at a lesurly pace. Im wishing for a second installment due to its greatness.
8272,So fun.
8273,"This was a great game, beautiful too, but it was just so short. Still worth the money, but I wish there was a part 2 where it would explain what happened to Fred and Maddie."
8274,Loved the story and the gameplay. A masterpiece for sure.
8275,"The gameplay of this game is so unusually addictive that I couldn¬¥t get enough of it. Once you get into it and become good at it it really feels like flying. The story is beautiful, it has the ambiance of a dream even though its not too complex or unpredictable. The graphics definitley match the style of the game, there are many beautiful scenes throughout the game. I sure love this game and I hope there will be a part II soon as this game doesn¬¥t take very long for a playthrough unfortunately."
8276,"Good game but simple story(to short),the best part is the gameplay"
8277,MOAR SOTRIES NOW!
8278,"i usually avoid games like these as im more of an ""actiony, first person shooter, fighter game"" kinda guy
i bought this game because i had a few bucks left over and didnt know what to do with it

this game was EXCEPTIONAL
i really loved it

the gameplay was unique, nothing quite like it

the voice acting was on point *or on fleek for you youngins*

the sounds were by far my favorite part of the game
as you charged up the suit, as you flew through the air and as you landed, almost everything sent chills up my spine
i HIGHLY recommend this game ESPECIALLY if you just want to sit back and relax to a good story driven game

10/10

its a shame the game is only like 1.5 or 2 hours long, I beat it twice even though i only have 4hrs of play time"
8279,"This game is one that has been in the backlog for a while but having played it now i have to say really worth the time.
The game has a story that pulls you along and a fair and fun challenge. at first the fact the grapple did not work like a spiderman swing pissed me off but almost immediately i learned it was absolutely necessary for saving my stupid butt from a bad jump.

Nice and complete in under 3 hours so do yourself a solid and go ahead and play it."
8280,"Brilliant game hands down. 
The game is excellently made and runs like a charm. I had no issues or bugs with playing the game which is always a bonus.

The art style is fantastic and the music and sounds are amazing. The controls can be hard to get right for a game like this but in this case they are done very well. The in air movement is very forgiving but also can provide a challenge. The use of the grapple and the jumps and everything combined make for a great platformer. 

The story for this game is very well written, and the voice actors suited the roles and portrayed the characters well. The game itself from a story point is short, but I think its length suited the game well. I would recommend this game if you are looking for a easy enough game with a fantastic story."
8281,best game ive played for ¬£2 .. since it was cheap i thought it would be bad but its AMAZING must buy!
8282,"Okay so This was a really good game. The art was very immersive along with the narration. I enjoyed it very much. Very beautiful game in general with a good storyline; however, I beat the entire game in 2 hours. (mind you not 100% with all the secrets and whatnot). In my book even buying this on sale for $2.50 only 2 hours of gameplay is pretty lame. Just know that."
8283,"Gameplay is smooth, graphics are great, controls are phenominal, only encountered one problem.... MY SAVE FILE FRICCIN CORRUPTED!!!!"
8284,"The game is short, and further playthroughs are much quicker than the first time around once you become proficient in the game's controls and KNOW where you are supposed to go. The background music is calm and reminded me of the one for the game Myst--it was good for exploring.  There is not much complexity to the story, but what it does it does well. The narration along the way is helpful to immerse oneself in the exploration--it makes me want to BE a part of the story, of the world.  There is no gore (or violence), just pulling oneself by grappling to walls in caves or floating rocks. This game is definitely kid friendly. I got it on sale, but wouldn't pay more than 5 dollars because it is short and somewhat small (although the areas are large)--but it is lovely.  There are unlockables you can find on each stage which unlock some features, but so far they don't add much to the experience (goat mode, for example, where you hear goat sounds instead of the usual human ones for the main character). I would have prefered more surfaces on which to grapple to and explore, just for the sake of exploring and aesthetics. I love looking at the waterfalls, caverns, etc."
8285,"This game is a piece of work, in many ways. Most people say the voice acting is terrible, but i thought it was fairly good. When I completed the game I suddenly felt very sad simply because I wanted more. That was one of the only downsides to the game. Well, another downside was the sense of gravity the game had. You would launch yourself towards a platform and gravity laws would make you think that you're getting close, but noooo... you're hurdling towards the side of the platform! Enbridled with rage, I kept playing the game and I was not disappointed. I am currently replaying the game and am having so much fun with the grapple mechanics! I can't wrap my head over the grapple device and how cool it is! How cool it would be to have in real life... The whole game made reality seem boring. I saw a youtuber named Memeulous play this and found it on sale on the steam store. I bought it and saw why Memeulous had played it. He has good taste in games. This game is SO worth giving a try! Get it while it's on sale me home slice"
8286,"I wish I could give this game a mediocre rating but as it stands I'm tending more towards the negative than the positive. First-Person platforming is tough to pull off so I'm giving the devs a lof of credit for this game. However, they didn't do themselves any favors with the grappling hook functionality given the inconsistent control scheme. Sometimes you can latch onto objects, other times you can't, even when it's at the same distance. The margin of error is so small that on massive rocks right in front of you there's only a tiny area you can actually latch onto and it's often more luck-based than anything else whether you get it right. There were plenty of sections that I enjoyed but more than enough areas that were just frustrating beyond belief, not because it's hard to pull but because the controls get in your way. I really wanted to finish the game to see where the story would lead but once I got stuck at the falling blocks section in the ice area for more than half an hour I was done."
8287,"A story about my uncle is one of the most unique games i've ever seen,i enjoyed the story line no matter how short it is

what brings me back to the game constantly is the timed trials, the timed trial are absolutely amazing. i highly recommend this game if you are into games like this."
8288,"best money ever spend on a game, the graphics & designs are so beautiful, story is one of the best i personally experienced, and i love the mechanics

10/10 would recommend"
8289,"A really beautiful game <3 Loved it so much :p But unfortunately it is short >.< I hope there will be a dlc, major updates or anything like that in the future :)"
8290,"This is an extremely fun game with a good story, but it is EXTREMELY short. I finished it in about 2 (almost 3) hours. There's not a ton of replay value exept for little collectables. There are challenge maps but I didn't even bother to try them out. I would highly recommend this game. Just make sure to get it during a sale, though. I would not pay more than 5 USD for it"
8291,10/10 definitely recommend
8292,"Horrible voice actors. I mean the main character is voiced by some monotone Mexican? Am I supposed to  fu ck ing  fall asleep when he speaks? Did the devs run out of money to hire voice actors? 

The story was about the nephew and uncle was okay, but the fact that there were unskippable sections of dialogue that I couldn't even have alt+tabbed in the backround almost made me quit before I finished the tutorial. The blue  bit ch  (Mattie) would talk so much, and she felt irrelevant to me during the entire story. 

I love grappling and swinging throughout the game but why the actual  fu ck  is there a story? Seriously. They dev could've never added a story to the gameplay and the game would've been SO much better. When I think of it, it's kind of like the past Call of Duty titles. People don't buy Call of Duty for the story, customers buy for the gameplay (the online gameplay in the case of Call of Duty that is). 

What I'm trying to say is that the gameplay was fun and entertaining but the story was forced and I would've loved this game so much more if the annoying blue  c u n t  known as ""Mattie"" would just shut the  fu  ck  up.

I beat this game in less than 2 hours. Easy game.

Buy this game if you want a little blue  bit ch  with the worst voice imaginable to talk loudly to you for 89% of the game.

2/10      -        I give the game this score because Mattie was annoying enough to want me to walk off the cliff next to her but I couldn't even do this, because there were invisble walls blocking me from killing myself. Wonderful. It's almost as if the devs want to torture you by not allowing you to skip an unnecesary, annoying, and worthless character's dialogue. If Mattie wasn't in this game at all this game would've easily been an 8/10 from me."
8293,A beautiful game with a beautiful story. The parkour here is very interesting and sometimes challeging.
8294,Leafy is Beafy
8295,"A Story About My Uncle is game that invites you to relive that a long lost part of your life, where adventure and mysterious places dominated your imagination. The movement, flow, and world building all accumulate into a very well made game/story that left me pondering what will happen next.

The gameplay is fun and builds upon itself to make an increasingly difficult, while fun, 3D platformer. The programming that went into each ability, perfectly coincides with the surrounding world, creating a feeling of true skill when you achieve a tricky maneuver. 

While having a good story, I won't say I don't have critiques. The voice acting is definitely a little cheesy at times. However, for the smaller development teams like Gone North Games and Coffee Stain Publishing, I would say they did what they could. Additionally, while a beautiful story, I felt it could have used a bit more pay off in the end. By introducing another character, Maddie, and not utilizing her properly, this game missed the opportunity to create a deeper emotional impact. Action, suspense, and conflict build a story to greater levels. Understandably, it is a bedtime story so it shouldn't be like an action film, but every good narrative (especially one that took about three hours to beat) could use a subplot, or additional conflict to flesh out the world a bit more. 

Overall, I give this game a [b] 4 out of 5. [/b]

It kept intrigued until the end, but it is not a masterpiece."
8296,"This game is just amazing, best 3 hours i have spent in my life.


420/20 would noscope throught the game again"
8297,really fun but kinda short :p
8298,"Beautiful story, Beautiful graphics (Character design wasn't the best), Amazing gameplay and good controls"
8299,"Very strong story line, not much replayability, but then again most games don't have any. A bit frustrating, but it's a puzzle game, so that's warranted."
8300,"AMAZING story, really good if you have 3-5 hours to blow on an epic game."
8301,Good game but should've made it longer and more interesting.
8302,Solid game and can be played again with enjoyment.
8303,"8/10

For how short this game is, it is worth it.
This game is great to let the time go by and just relax

I recommend you get this game but only during sales for I feel like its not worth $13 as of right now"
8304,"beautiful story, simple yet fun gameplay mechanics. It works because you don't have to think about where to go‚Äîyou just go. Please buy this game . give it a try. you wont regret."

8307,"The visuals look great and the story is mildly interesting, which made me excited about playing the game. Unfortunately the platforming action is so difficult and unforgiving, even with frequent checkpoints, that I gave up about halfway through the caverns and ended up using the flying cheat to get through the remaining levels. The game is beautifully made and I'm sure a great many people will enjoy grappling, rocket boosting and making vertigo-enducing leaps, but I'm not one of them. If you are, then definitely check this one out. If you're like me, give it a pass."
8308,"I thought everything looked very pretty. I wasn't sold on the game when I first played it, but it's not bad. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it's certainly not the worst. The end was cute and definitely left the player with some closure."
8309,"Although it was super short, A Story About My Uncle was an awesome experience. The storytelling was beautiful and it was really relaxing yet challenging at some parts to play. For the price I paid, it was worth it."
8310,"Very overrated game, just jumping around and getting headaches all day."
8311,A game that deserves to be played... it has a very nice story ... the gameplay is good ... I d like this game to have multiplayer ... but it's an awesome game even without multiplayer
8312,"it's an above average puzzle game with some interesting puzzles later on.
the story isnt great and the player guiding can be a little off sometimes.
if you buy it on a sale it's 2 hours well spent, wouldent reccomend for full price."
8313,"Good Game!! Really Chill and not very stressful,play with music in the background and your good to go!"
8314,"A frustration machine. Play only if you enjoy rage and, subsequently,  rage-quitting. A game I played far too long because the story and setting are rather lovely. The attitude of the game, though, is YOU WILL LOVE MY PRECIOUS GAME MECHANICS. 

I don't love your mechanics, though. While a good idea, overall, they are flawed by: (1) a horrible cursor that obscures targets, (2) a targeting highlight policy that's all-or-nothing, both in direction and distance, so you don't get any idea if you were barely there or way off, (3) a targeting highlight policy that's all-or-nothing, so you get zero advance hint about when a grapple might be successful, (4) level assets with poor graphic design that give little cue about distance but have very similar appearance, needless yinterfering with distance estimatation, (5) a seriously bad horizontal momentum system that brakes far faster than air actually does (braking is proportional to the square of velocity, but you die most often falling straight, straight down), (6) and which also means that it's harder to swing around grapple points, meaning you run into them more often, (7) no visual concept of your own body size, so it's impossible to estimate in advance when you will run into a grapple point, (8) a policy that insists that you click only on top of grapple point, not nearby, making it impractical to plan on grappling edges, (9) level design that insists that YOU WILL BECOME PROFICIENT IN WHAT I WANT TO YOU *RIGHT* *NOW* DO OR YOU MAY PROGRESS NO FARTHER (there's a good reason I have no desire to play NES games), which could readily be addressed by smoother presentation of skill challenges, (10) route-finding by trial-and-error when only the first part of the route is even visible and the route has to be done dynamically, leading to an utterly implausible mesh of story and mechanics, because no teenager is going to magically find all those routes and live to tell the tale, and (11) I'm sure there's more but I don't care right now.

tl;dr: Not fun. Don't play."
8315,"[i] First of all: [/i] One of the best games I¬¥ve ever played

This game is amazing. It¬¥s made very simple but it has a lovely graphic design. You have to think about the steps you are doing and the story is great. I would love to play more of this sort of games but i couldn¬¥t found a better one than this. It¬¥s worth the money and if you want to chill a little bit more and get into a world of dreams this is the perfect game."
8316,"yes
"
8317,pleasent nice experience slightly depressing story however i really enjoyed every aspect of this game
8318,This game is very lovely indeed
8319,This game is really fun if you want a fun platformer to play.
8320,"I am just breathtaken by this game. Just finished it and I just want to say wow. It is by far one of the best single-player games ever! Playing this in 2017, years after it's release in 2014. I still think this game could be modern. The first person views are breath taking in this game. And the physics have no flaws. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Towards the end of the game it touched my heart when I found Fred, and he told me that he is gonna stay with Maddie and the frog people. I thought it was over and I was very happy, but then I went back to Fred's house. The letter that the nephew writes is wonderful and it is nice to think that Fred got that letter and read it. A true happy ending for a great game. I would recommend this game to anyone if they were looking for a new game. Best. Game. Ever."
8321,"Amazing physics and intriguing story line. Not very good in a money per hour played ratio aspect. 2.2 Hours is the amount of time it took for me to complete this game. Only 11 collectibles and no achievemnets though so perhaps you could squeeze another 1.5 hours for collectibles. Moreover the achievements for not dying are rather difficult so 100% completion is optimistic. However the story, soundtrack and general mechanics on this game means that my overall rating for this game is 8/10. (‡∏á ¬∞ Õú  ñ ¬∞)‡∏á"
8322,"A Story About My Uncle was the most captivating yet short stories I have played. I have been following the development of this project for years, and after finally getting to play the finished version I have to say it was well worth the wait. The music, atmospheric level design, and the short story mix beautifully to create an artistic and immersive experience for the player, and I was enthralled for the entire journey. Every leap and jump across the visually stunning environments felt so real, despite the fantasy aspect of the game.

One of the two downsides of the game has to be certain parts of the levels, where almost pin-point accuracy is needed to successfully progress through the story. This can become slightly frustrating at times, but definitely do-able eventually. The other downside is that, at times, I lost my sense of direction and had to spend time searching corners and edges of the map that could be the way foward, which slightly took away from the immersion.

Overall, the large positives drastically outweigh the small negatives of the game, and I highly recommend buying this game as a beautiful, story driven, peaceful piece of art."
8323,"'A Story About My Uncle' is an extremely well-planned, well-delivered game. The game takes little from you but gives a lot back in return in the form of an intriguing story, responsive mechanics and varying levels. The story in this doesn't take too long but neither is it overwhelming.

A perfect, though-out game."
8324,"A very cool, little adventure game. Character models and animations could use a little work, but it doesn't take away from the pleasurable experience. At a sale price of ¬£1.99 it's a steal!"
8325,BUY IT
8326,must buy
8327,"It's quite story focused, but it's simple enough to follow as you swing around the beautifully trashy underground.  It's really just a happy little game to play when you need a break from the stress of life.  I give it an A-.  I would be an A, but the salamander people are kinda spooky. :)"
8328,"A Story About My Uncle is a unique twist on puzzle platformers. It begins with a father telling his daughter a bedtime story about an adventure he went on when he was younger. The player is a young nephew who gets lost on an alien world in search of his missing uncle.

The platforming mechanics are done well, however they quickly become repetitive. The player unlocks a few different tools to help navigate the world, however the main one is the grappling mechanism. The grappling mechanism allows the user to swing/pull it's user towards an object. The other two tools at the users disposale are the rocket boots and the super jump.

The levels feel unique and are well designed, however the difficulty is problematic. The difficulty has no real curve, it is all over the place with giant difficulty spikes preceeded and proceeded by dull, easy, repetitive sections. 

Along the way, the nephew can find cleverly hidden objects that can unlock fun additions to the game like changing the color of the grappling beam, the funny goat mode (changes the players audio to that of a goat), midas mode (everything you grapple turns to gold), and acrobatic mode (spins the player around while in the air).

I was really looking forward to a good story, and the intro leads you on into thinking there is one. Sadly it is quite flat and not very flushed out. The game is rather short, however that is not always a bad thing if the story can keep me captivated, but I found myself wishing the pace would pick up and it never did. It took me around five hours to complete the game. The ending is also quite bland and sudden. I was hoping for some kind of major twist or a final boss like in the Portal series, but it let me down...

Other than the main story mode, there is also a time trial mode where the player competes against the clock on the various levels, and can be rather challenging at times. 

For being a good platformer I have to recommend the game if you have a few hours to spend and can find it on sale."
8329,I don¬¥t know if I would be happy with buying this game for full price considering it is awfully short unless you want to try and speedrun exe. But for 80% it was definetly worth it.
8330,Interesting world. Some poorly designed manouvering sections. Overall decent experience.
8331,B E S T  G A M E  E V E R 10/10
8332,A unique and fun adventure platformer. With an atmosphere and fun gameplay that pull you in and gives you a fresh experience.
8333,"""Good unique story and challenging gameplay."" 72/100"
8334,"only complaint i have is on the windmills or what ever you want to call them, sometimes your grapple disconnects and makes you fall."
8335,"Short story with good challenges. Some of the scenes were pretty. Was not a amazing game, but would recommend if you like 3D platformers and a short sweet little story. Some of the acheivements I went after were very hard though, hard enough to put them in my top 5 achievements on my profile. Make sure to pick it up on sale though it isn't worth full price."
8336,"Nice short game. Great visuals, music. The voice acting and controls is just okay in my opinion. Maybe I'm just really bad at this game, but I had to try some parts a bunch of times. And for a game which would build on ""flow"" I think is not the best thing. Overall, I enjoyed it though. Grab it on sale if you are interested."
8337,Pretty good platformer and story.
8338,LITRALLY BEST GAME EVER XDDDDD
8339,"Simply beautiful. You can tell from every aspect how much love has been poured into this project. The gameplay itself is refreshingly simple and flows like a dream, and the story is advanced by soft-spoken characters. Each environment is visibly unique and incredibly pleasing to the eye. Come the end, I couldn't help but feel I had been put into the shoes of the narrator's daughter, having been told a story about his uncle."
8340,"Good game. The gameplay is very fun. The story is lacking, but some of the locations you visit are very interesting. Overall a pretty decent game."
8341,This is an AMAZING game so far. I am loving it the story the gamplay the parkour the art style EVERYTHING 10/10 would recomonnd it.
8342,thIS IS A Good GaMe
8343,"A good 3d platform with cool mechanichs.
Visually very good, in some levels you will find yourself staring at the landscape"
8344,"I loved this game, from the story to the mechanics, if you just want something emotional and to show games are art. Play. This. Game. The trailers and screenshots don't do it justice."
8345,I was my uncle was this cool
8346,Goodbye friend.
8347,A short wonderful story with adventure and intrigue. Just a great oldschool indie platformer.
8348,Fun game
8349,"ASAMU isn‚Äôt my type of game, but I can see why most people enjoy it. Swinging around is fun at first, but becomes boring quickly. Luckily the game is rather short, so it‚Äôs not a big issue for a one time play through.  

Pros
Story is solid
Graphic are quite nice 
Controls are very responsive

Cons
2-3 hours.

8350,"Fantastic Game
I really really enjoyed it.
"
8351,A short but sweet game with a graphic style everyone could enjoy.
8352,the best game ever <3
8353,This game needs part 2 but 3x longer.
8354,"It has been some time since I played a game so good at bringing in a mixture of feelings such as sadness, joy and other emotions. The artstyle is great, creating a beatiful environment, while the gameplay can be clumsy and annoying at times it can also be fun. This game may be called short by some(must have taken me about three and a half hours to complete) but really it is just the right amount, knowing what it wants to do, going there and doing it similar to the first portal. However the true selling is the amazing and emotional story."
8355,"It's a short 3-hours adventure of jumping and swinging around to get to places, unraveling the secret world that his uncle had been lost in. It's really fun, and capable of expanding to a bigger game, but unfortunately it was just that short.This game is for people who enjoy a short story, straight foward mission, moving around in fast pace and beautiful view of the sky. though I'd recommend buying during sales.

Price: 6/10 (expensive for a short game. It's worth atmost 10$, or maybe 5$.)
Story: 6/10 (could have expanded more.)
Characters: 6/10 (humans and friendly blue creatures.)
Controls:  9/10 (this is what makes the game amazing.)
Graphics: 7/10 (beautiful nonetheless.)
Duration: 5/10 (wish it was longer.)
DLC: none.

Theme: Where the fuck is uncle Fred?!!!"
8356,Fun gameplay and story!
8357,Great game with a great story.
8358,"Short game but it`s an awesome journey.
Great for speedrunning if you`re into that."
8359,this game was really fun but i finished it really quickly and it has little replay value but in my opinion it was worth my money
8360,"Fun sweet short game
Thats all"
8361,"pros:
-the story is unique and interesting
-complicated parkour action
-hi-speed parkour action
cons:
-the gameplay is monotone.

i recommend this game for those who likes hi-speed parkour like spiderman.
i dont recommend this game for those who dont like parkour."
8362,"Great game, fun and enjoyable experience. Even though it is short, not one minute is boring, so thats enough for me.

8/10"
8363,"What is A.S.A.M.U ?

A short and simple platform game where you use a device to swing around rocks. run very fast, do crazy jumps and other stunts while you progress through very well done levels, it is an interesting and fun game, fast paced, has a good story focused on family relationships, it may be a little short, it took me 3 hours to beat, but its easily replayable and theres not many games like it, its very cheap by the way, dont worry about getting it, you will have fun."
8364,Short but sweet game with pretty average gameplay. The setting is the strongest part of the game.
8365,"A particularly beautiful little story with an excellent movement mechanic.  The game is the perfect length and does not wear out its welcome.  The grappling mechanic is fun and lighthearted, much in the same way as the story.  It is nice to play through through a game with such a light and upbeat tone.  I would definitely recommend picking up this game on deal."
8366,"6.5/10 (I'd give it ""don't know"" but since it forces me to choose I'll pick ""yes, recommend"").

A game about jumping, with nice graphics and story.

Pros:
- a cute story
- a nice looking world to explore
- nice music

So-so:
- as you get further into the game, the jumping puzzles become more and more annoying, up to a point where the game requires you to make 3 very precise jumps and land on a tiny floating rock somewhere way out of sight from your initial position. Some players may like this but to me these dexterity/timing puzzles are just a waste of time.

Cons:
- the only thing you can do in this game is run around, jump at huge distances and hang on objects using a rope. It's a platformer, yes, but any serious gamers would want something more

Despite its excellent artwork, music and writing, the game has limited value due to its pretty bland and repetitive mechanics of jumps and hooks. So, at best it's good for 1 evening, until the puzzles get too frustrating to progress further. Unless you into this sort of stuff."
8367,3h of story playformer
8368,"Amazing game although it was quite small as in terms of levels but I really enjoyed it!
Big shout out for the developers :)"
8369,Great game had such an amazing storyline I wish there was a series to this! ):
8370,"Great game. Just the stuff that will make you fall in love with pc gaming, but i dont like how i payed 12.99 for this and got onbly 2 hours of gameplay, also should have option to choose level."
8371,"So, I got this game for 85% off, so about 2 bucks, This is a pretty good game.  The art style wasn't bad, the actual gameplay was actually pretty fun. It wasn't easy but wasn't too hard. It follows a pretty nice story, where you meet people and you can actually walk around in some areas. If I were to give this game out of 10 it would be like 7/10"
8372,"Very Short, Not worth it's price honestly. But if you want nausea simulator, Puzzles are simple as it holds your hand through the narrative about finding his uncle, with not much of story feel free to grab it on sale."
8373,i cried at the end this game is like a cute little puppy
8374,"Nice story :)

If you like storyes and speedruns, try it.
A bit boring at some parts, at others challenging and at others a touching story :)

Really worth playing.

7/10"
8375,A really great looking and fun to play platformer. Kind of short but worth it for the experience.
8376,"It's ok, if you want less than 2 hours of Playtime from the campaign, the only reason I don't recommend it is for it's short short short campaign. The gameplay mechanics are nice and the story was, better than most. Just I can't recommend a SP/Co-op game that after 2 hours of gameplay has you Grinding or competeing to extend it's life, so honestly I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a competive person."
8377,Little short. Actually its really short.
8378,"Buy it now and thank me later.
"
8379,"Very interesting story.
However it's really short, like horribly short
Not worth the ¬£10
it's best to pick this up during a sale.
Overall it was a good game"
8380,good ass game ive beaten it like 3 times
8381,"After playing this game for about an hour and a half so far I have come accross a lot of pros and only one con:

Pros:
- Great art style
- Great storyline
- Good voice actors
- Good AI

Cons:
- Can sometimes feel a bit slow paced (especially when walking through the village)

As you can see there is only one con on this review so far which is good although if anything does pop up in further gameplay then I will ad it to the list.

Overall I think this game, besides the slow paced sections, is pretty good. I would definitely reccomend this game for ages from about 12-Adult (any age). I can not wait to carry on playing through this game.

[b][UPDATE]Game Finished:[/b]

After completing this game I am already thinking about re-playing the game! Thats all I want to say!

[I][b]Comment Written by Eliot Poynton[/b][/I]"
8382,"This game was... amazing. The maps were good, the physics were one of the best, and the story... AWESOME. I can't explain how good it is... it's just way too good. 10/10"
8383,"Love the story line, Thinks its out of the box, no one had probably ever thought of a story like that."
8384,"Haven't played the game in a while, but when I did play it just felt like a beautiful and fun game, overall. Surprisingly emotional story to it, and the platforming in first-person felt fluid and proper, unlike other titles that try to do the same. Fantastic game!"
8385,"
The best game I've played in a long time <3"
8386,"Really great game, but way too short. Try to catch it on sale!"
8387,"its very fun but... after a while it gets very boring. But,its a kind of challenge but a great time killer i highly reccomend it"
8388,"A very short game but it was done so well.  Fun, somewhat challenging in a couple parts.  Mostly, I kept playing for the story.  The narrative was awesome and the characters innocent and fun.  Well worth the $ for it.  Thank you!"
8389,"Totally AWESOME! One of the best relaxing games I've had so far.

8390,"Some very nice graphics/story line.
I would like some sandbox gamemode.
8/10"
8391,A nice little story with good play mechanics. Perfect difficulty level to be challenging without being overwhelming.
8392,"Not a huge story or gameplay experience but it cultivated me. I felt an aray of enjoyment out of playing, It was almost moving in some way. The way they devoloped the story was amazing, the voice acting was mediocre and it almost felt like it left a void but it sufficed none the less. Over all gameplay was fantastic, the mechanics were very good and fluid it made things challenging at times which gave it a sense of accomplishment after finishing a more difficult part. As a whole i dont think it is worth the price it is because of the lack of time it took to complete. In the end i would say this game is a 7/10 for its creativity and ingenuity. You will have fun and enjoy this game but i would say about putting this onto your wishlist and waiting for it to go on sale and pick it up for a bargain price."
8393,"It's a really cute and fun game. Overall, the game is relatively short and the story is pretty forgetable. However, the narration style kept me engaged and the game kept introducing new concepts whenever I started to get the hang of the current ones. Overall, I never got frustrated with the gameplay and it was always clear where to go next. The developer nailed the grappling/jumping gameplay. The 2 hours of enjoyable gameplay was certainly worth the $1 I paid for it."

8396,"So.
This game is so cool. Sure the graphics aren¬¥t that good, BUT the story is just fantastic. The characters are all fitting perfectly and the background music fits in every time.

11/10"
8397,"Simple, short and really well done game. I wish it was longer because i really enjoyed it"
8398,"Came to remake my review. This a great game. In my top 5 of Single player game for sure. Awesome story, sure the ending ain't the best, but it sure is pretty damn interesting. There's no fighting in this game, you just lay back and swing. Since it's on the short side (about 2.5 to 3 hours the story), the steam summer sale (or other sale) is a great time to try it out!"
8399,a story about my uncle when you sexually molested me
8400,"Great game. Simple mechanics, yet challenging and rewarding when you have to combine them to complete areas. Very good visuals to go with the story and good cues on where to use your abilities. It has about 3 hours of gametime for the main story. Works great on Linux."
8401,"Who thought it would be fun to have so few checkpoints? Test your game much? Is it ever fun grappling around blind corners, not knowing what to expect, falling to your death, and then repeating the last 10 minutes of gameplay OVER AND OVER AND OVER, especially when you have no idea where you're going thanks to the samey level design, especially once you get to the ice caves. Watch any playthrough, and first time players will invariably say, ""Am I going in circles? I better not be...""

There were some nice moments, there is some nice art and vistas, but the gameplay is glitchy, the pacing awful, the direction unclear, and the checkpoint system frustrating as hell. Having to target those crystals to recharge your grapple with pin-point accuracy while swinging around is horrid, especially when I tried with a gamepad. I absolutely had to switch to keyboard+mouse.

I did finish it, but it became an exercise in extreme frustration too many times. A real shame, because I was somewhat captivated by the art and the world (I even liked the low-poly character art that others dislike. I found them charming.) Some of the reveals are quite breathtaking.

If you want a game that blows this away, check out Valley. You will get much more of a ""flying through air, grappling badass"" feel from that game, trust me. It's a masterpiece compared to this.

I wouldn't say this game is horrible, but don't pay more than a few dollars for it."
8402,"This game is very fun to play, has a good story line, some hard challenges and worth playing!"
8403,"From a game like this, I wasn't expecting a story this good. I first saw this game on leafy's channel like most other people, but just thought it was a Parkour game so I didn't look in to it. A few days ago, this game was on sale for only $2 and I wanted to give it a try. The mechanics in the game works flawlessly throughout the entire game. The Levels got progressively harder and Sometimes even frustrating. But over all, the game uses every second of its two and a half hour gameplay time to deliver a unique gameplay experience with a great backstory to drive you forward. The game is great, and for $2 that I paid for, It is a 9/10. The only thing that I am disappointed about is the fact that the achievements are really hard to get and almost impossible to get in the story sections of the game. But over all still a must play. (Also has really go art work and atmosphere)"
8404,"Badass game with nice visuals, good story and fun mechanic.  Swing like fucking Tarzan around caverns and sky islands.  9/10"
8405,"A Story about my Uncle was a unique experience for me. The game is quite short and it took me a little less than 6 hrs to complete it. The story is fairly simple and straightforward as the protagonist narrates a story to his daughter about a journey that he embarked on to find his beloved uncle's whereabouts when he was a kid. Coming to the gameplay, this is exactly the department where the game has something new to offer to the players. The core mechanics of the gameplay involves crossing various levels ranging from frozen caverns to paradisal floating city to mystical landscapes by means of a grappling hook. It can be quite frustrating at times to progress through some parts of almost every level given the challenging level designs. Timing and patience is, more often than not, the key to successfully cross those hurdles. Barring those, the gameplay is actually quite fun and somewhat makes you feel as if you're a superhero as you fly high and soar through the levels. The visual fidelity is quite decent. It is more of an artwork with good colour contrasts. The enigmatic and imaginary elements of the game world adds to the overall graphics quality as well. The ambience in-game was very good as it incorporates a sense of calmness and keeps you hooked to it throughout its entirety. The controls were quite responsive. Didn't have any problem in that regard as well. On the other hand, the achievements are tough to unlock in this game too. So a heads up for the achievement hunters out there. There's also a time trial mode where you've to complete the previously completed levels within a limited time. And that pretty much wraps up my review. 


P.S-There's not much replay value to it to be honest. So get it on a sale. Once installed sit back and relax and enjoy this game on a Sunday afternoon. You won't be disappointed! :)"
8406,woaw sublime
8407,"Very fun, with an incredible story."
8408,"Overall great game with a good story and great gameplay.

The story could've been great, but (Spoiler Alert) [spoiler]the ending felt pretty shitty, like I came all that way just to se my fucking uncle and he just sends me back within seconds, like wtf, I thought I was your favorite nephew, and now you'd rather be with a bunch of frog people insted of me. SHAME Uncle, SHAME!!![/spoiler]"
8409,A pretty short game worth playing if you don't mind the graphics.
8410,"Fun game loved playing this after seeing it in so many YouTube ranting videos. Got it on sale for 3, recommend getting it then. GOod simple, but at times challenging gameplay with extremely easy to learn controls. I just wish it had better graphics. They aren‚Äôt bad but they could be better. Also more levels as I hear it is short. An easy way to fix this would be to just add workshop support, for new levels, better graphics, and gameplay additions. Maybe include a level editor? Overall 8/10 gameplay."
8411,A very fun parkour game with a sci-fi feel to it.  It is on the childish side- as the game takes place as a bedtime story to a child.  The gameplay is very solid though.
8412,Short version of Mirror's Edge
8413,"kinda fun gets boring after a while tho, also crappy npc's and graphics"
8414,The most satisfying game ever made.
8415,This game is amazing
8416,Whimsical and relaxing...until you come to a series very challenging jumps...just play it.
8417,Very cute little puzzle game! I got it for very cheap and it was very enjoyable! Definitely a great little gem for a fan of first person physics puzzlers. The mechanics are very fun!
8418,"A very immersive platformer with compelling  narrative. I definitely reccomend playing this if you enjoy a decent challenge and want to spend a few hours flying around mystical environments. I will say it is a bit short and I wouldn't want to spend the whole 14.99 price for it, but on sale it is definitely worth it."
8419,Fun platforming game

8421,"A bit short, but really fun to play. It is for something like 3$ while on sale, so for this price it is ""must to have""."
8422,"Great story and sound track really builds the suspense as you progress through. I definitly recommend if you want to relax after a long day of  ""Hardcore"" competitive gaming. This game has a nice soothing vibe to it and provides a relaxing atmosphere. Theres always room for self improvement that makes you wanna keep playing."
8423,Boop!
8424,"great game, no stress, just a relaxing, fun experience"
8425,"A great platforming experience, definetly pick it up if it's in a sale."
8426,"I apreciated how visually uniqe the world was and how stunning the grafics where. The interface with the game machanics where very forgiving. You diffenatley didn't have to worry about being ""exact"" when using your abilities. The controls stock have a bit of a funky lay out for my tast(Mostley involving the Run button). Luckily the developers made the controls fully customizable to easily fix this. The puzzles where a bit simple as well as finding all of the hiddin items. There isn't many hours in the campain. If your a serious gamer this will be a few hours of jumping around with no real reason to return. However, It's a great adventure/ Platformer game for any new gammer/Kids. And It's cheap! Worth the price point."
8427,the first and only game i've gotten emotional over
8428,"A very short (I played in about 2.5 hours) whimsical story about a boy's memories of his uncle. There are not explosions or A-list actors, but there is a lot of heart, a memorable story, and some beautiful levels. For the price of a movie ticket, you'll get just as much enjoyment."
8429,"great game, period. Buy it."
8430,"Fun 3D puzzle platformer. The only con is that trying to use a controller can often get really buggy (e.g. controller sticks start acting like sticks and a mouse at the same time), so I to switch to using a keyboard and mouse."
8431,"So funny, one  of the best plataforms i have played, it is rly short but you can replay it to beat your time."
8432,"Nice, Sweet, And very good game, gives a good challange, and I'd say that you give it a try ;)"
8433,You fall for most of the game
8434,This game has a great story and is a nice break from more stressful games.
8435,Its a fun gme but hard for me and i like it
8436,cheap n kool
8437,One of the best platformer game that I have ever played
8438,"First of all, yes the story is kinda short, but it is also captivating. 

The visuals are functional, still some parts of the world look awesome. 
The controls are okay, although they sometimes lead to trying something over and over because they didn't work like you would have liked them to. Level Design and Soundtrack are great, even better than some AAA-soundtracks I have heard.

tl;dr

About 3 1/2 hours of great story with a great soundtrack and sometimes beautiful visuals, that are totally worth the price. Give it a try if you havn't already."
8439,A Good Story.
8440,"very good
"
8441,worth every penny
8442,"good story.
good controles."
8443,"A really good game, kinda short but good enough"
8444,"A nice change from the normal bang shooty pow games, it's relaxing, light hearted and fullfils some mildly challenging platform and adventure itches. 

I'd recommend it for fans of games like Portal, Quantum Conundrum and the like."
8445,"I played it for an hour or so, but couldn't quite enjoy it. Controls are very stiff, graphics not just simple, but also pretty flat (better suited for an egoshooter rather than a story-based game) and the story didn't really capture me. Then it crashed and I just didn't feel like ever starting it again."
8446,really rich storyline and amazing game play mechanics
8447,when i got the game i didn't think much about it it took me awhile until i plyed it but when i did i got sucked into the story and gameplay i strongly recommed this game its very calm and fun
8448,"I cannot describe the joy this game provided me, a must buy."
8449,"great game the plot isnt that intresting but the gameplay, mama mia the gamelay is something that should be cherised in your heart right beside the love of porn"
8450,Such a fun game and a great idea for a game!
8451,This game is indescribably splendid in idea and execution. Swinging by a grappling hook through a quasi-aetherial biome is just :ok:
8452,"Even though it brings back flashbacks of 'nam... Sorry, leafyishere videos, it's still great. Too short though"
8453,One of my favorite short-and-sweet games with an interesting story. plus grappling hooks are rad
8454,"This game is simply great! It has a great story and exhilerating gameplay. A really fun game in general that has stunning visuals and a beautiful soundtrack. Engaging and addicting, I'd recommend it to anyone."
8455,It's a beautiful game but can be frustrating sometimes.  I enjoyed it nevertheless.
8456,"peaceful game ,helps me relax"
8457,coolÔºÅ
8458,"Far more fun than I expected, being able to launch your way across a landscape, often with multiple paths."
8459,"Unexpectedly excellent. It's a beautiful, immersive and serene experience. Sometimes you just want to play a game to relax without having to think. Sometimes we need a break from the intense triple A goodness. This game does that and a whole lot more. Highly recommended."
8460,"You should play this!  Beautiful, fun, and it's a steal on sale."
8461,"Awesome game all around, gameplay is simple to understand and the challenge ramps up slowly, only 2 or 3 parts i found frustrating but with a little patience it can be done.
I would describe this game as very charming and with a lot of heart, i simply fell in love with it."
8462,"Just... Words can barely begin to express how amazing this game is... From the story, to the simple (Read Difficult, but engaging) platforming. You CAN NOT go wrong with this game, I would recommend a playthrough to everyone who has ever considered platformers fun."
8463,"A lovely game that's all about movement. Fluid controls and a great sense of speed make a very enjoyable platforming experience. The game ramps up the difficulty at a perfect pace, I only felt frustrated by a few challenges, and felt a great sense of accomplishment with every landing.

The best 4 hours I've spent since Portal!"
8464,"Wonderful short game with a satisfying ending, lovable characters, and good vocals throughout. The gameplay is solid, and it can run on potatoes while looking great."
8465,"This is a really nice game! very strategic thinking is recquired throughout the entire gameplay. The best was I can think of this game is that its a one player giant obstacle course built into a unique and intriguing story. Very fun to play, and remains to be one of the best games that I've every bought! I wish that the developers would create another one person survival game since this one turned out really well!"
8466,This game is AMAZING... I am speechless... Kids would probably enjoy playing this.
8467,This game is such a beauty.. Would love too see more games like this ! :)
8468,"Interesting game. Perfect length for the price, in fact a length I prefer for a game like this. Can be played to completion, and enjoyed in one sitting.

Its like a sort of FPS puzzle game. The movement is somewhat unique, and challenging, without being overly tedious. Definitely had some frustrating moments, but I enjoyed it. Wish I could go back, and play it again for the first time."
8469,Pretty funny. Character models are a bit strange but its worth playing
8470,Really fun gameplay but a bit short
8471,"I just completed this game in three breakless play sessions (my controller kept disconnecting, but that's bluetooth's fault) totalling about 4 hours. I was reminded of fez because of the atmosphere and little consequence of failure, only the developer is not in fact a total tosspot. I almost regret getting it on sale, because it was 4 hours of heaven. Not 100% perfect experience, but not far off."
8472,A nice indie game.
8473,"The game has no violence in it, the landscape is gorgeous the story is interesting and the mechanics of the game are quite intriguing but the overall experience of the game is worth trying. One of the flaws of the games that don't realy enjoy is that the voice actors are not very experienced in this in my opinion, because I couldn't feel any emotion in their acting."
8474,"This game is fairly run-of-the-mill exploration sim, but with an interesting gimmick. You have a grappling hook and rocket boots. It's a fun mechanic, albeit clunky. You'll be bashing your face off of rocks and clipping ledges wrong and having to start over from the last checkpoint. Another bit of awkward is that while Jump is bound to Space, as per usual, the High Jump is bound to Hold-Release RMB. This drove me nuts, but I eventually got used to it.

There was a lot of care put into the world building. Many of the assets held clues that would let you learn about the world you were in. For example, there's a book that contains an alphabet translation and you can peak over the shoulder of the character with it so that you can learn to decipher hidden language throughout some of the levels. For the most part, narration covers the important things that you could miss if you're not the inquisitive type.

The level design is pretty great aside from a few sections where the intended route is hidden by some scenery elements and sometimes the arrow guides didn't point anywhere imparticular. It sucks to do this, but you can just suicide off the edge while you search for the grapple spot you need to use, as looking up will usually show you most of the level. It would have been better if those sections either had better hints as to where to go or if there were alternate routes.

That's another thing that's kind of wonky: limited routes through most of the levels. At the beginning, they obviously need to restrict the player's sequence so that they can learn the movement. However, later on through the game, the times where I was able to choose multiple paths were either unintentional by the level designer or it was an explicit section of the game where you had to jump across a chasm with a wide-variety of grapple points. Given the theme of adventure, the awesome movement gimmicks, and the beautiful environments, it's a shame that the whole experience felt like a railroad with all of your moves set in stone. As a result, this game is more execution oriented than exploration oriented.

That said, the game's fun in it's own right and it's normally $13 for the 2 hours of gameplay that I got. I'm not going to refund it. For what they set out to do, even though it was a short game, it's worth the money, in my opinion."
8475,"Good game, finished it in 2 hrs. Good story although it was short. 8.5/10 If you ask me, would totally recommend it. :)"
8476,"Nominated this for the ""The World is Grim Enough Lets Just All Get Along"" award."
8477,"I bought this game mainly because i saw a streamer play it for about 3 minutes and thought that it was a pretty cool parkour game and once I actually played ""A story about my uncle"", I realized that throught the whole game, the story is still held in a very high regard. Really enjoyed the game."
8478,"I really, really liked this game. I only wish I hadn't finished it, or that there was DLC or something. I bought it on sale and didn't expect much but it sucked me right in and held on tight until I completed it! 

Fun, unique gameplay with puzzle and timing elements.

There is also a decent amount of replay value in trying to get better scores on levels."
8479,"Excellent game. Quite a short story, took me 5 hours to complete. I would suggest buying on sale considering how short it is, but for me it was easily worth the money.

You feel ""like the coolest guy in the universe"" while super jumping forward then blasting through the air with rocket boots. 

And a satisfying ending. 10/10"
8480,"a slow paced interesting story with delightful game mechanics one of my favorite games recently, it is definitely worth buying especially right now when its 80% off."
8481,"The story is not that long, but who cares? It's an experience. The visuals are fantastic and the gameplay is very nice. It's not very challenging unless you go for all the achievements, which some are pretty hard to get.
I 100% recommend this game."
8482,"One of the best 3D Jumper/Solving game I played. It has pretty story, extremely hard achievements and simple but not so simple tasks :D"
8483,"The graphics to this game were absolutely beautiful, though the alien creatures were a bit odd. They were well done as well, but I just didn't think they quite [i]matched[/i] the scenery. 

Being able to grapple and leap everywhere was a lot of fun and the physics behind it was really well done. It was a bit frustrating when I repeatedly died because I kept misjudging angles, but that was user error. Still, it will bring some frustration if you suck as much as I do!!

The ending was meh. It tied things up nicely, I guess, but I was a tad disappointed. 

Overall 4/5 stars."
8484,"Pros: one of the best parkour games I have ever played.

Cons: Dissapointing ending."
8485,Very good Game
8486,"Great money's worth, nice touching story that props up already amazing mechanics with ok graphics but is incredibly easy to run on any computee"
8487,Beautiful. Would play again.
8488,"Amazing game! The story was inspiring - once your done read this post by the developer - https://steamcommunity.com/app/278360/discussions/0/522729358374450914/?ctp=4#c1368380934271186747 .
A great purchase especially when on sale!"
8489,"This is an amazing game. For the price, it's a steal, and its usually incredibly cheap during seasonal sales."
8490,god game it was fun
8491,"I wanna sell this game to somebody. Idk the price yet, but if you want it, message me."
8492,"Nice atmosphere, cool gameplay. 
Quite short, leaves a little bit of nostalgia.
I advice it."
8493,"Very well made game. I've got a lot of funn plaing it, especiali whan you play  it secound time with opend modulators like GOAT TONG as grapling. :D :D :D :D"
8494,"It's a short game that you can easily finish in 3 hours, but you'll have a lot of fun for those 3 hours. Highly recommended."
8495,"Waaaah, I'm falling!!! :)"
8496,Well Crafted.
8497,Got more emotionally destroyed by this game than by my girlfriend leaving me for someone else
8498,Amazing parkout game in an alluring world with great visuals. The mechanics are nothing short of perfect.
8499,"I have only just started playing this game, but I have to say it is definitely up there as one of my all time favorites. Here's to more games that resemble this type of gameplay!"
8500,"One of the best platformer games i ever played, this could become a cult game if the develpoers let the community create their own custom maps."
8501,It's a nice platformer where you use a 'grappling hook' to get around
8502,"This first-person platformer features a sweet story that sadly doesn't expand beyond its set path. The world that's built by the creators of this game is only begging to be explored. I mean, what's gonna happen to the frog people? What goes beyond their world? What's up with Sauron?! So many questions but, like this review, the game ended abruptly."
8503,"The game's great, but I'm honestly just making this review for steam's game awards"
8504,"A beautiful jump and run, with a wonderful written story and the graphics are also pretty awesome!
"
8505,Love it
8506,A great slow paced adventure game with unique game mechanics that both want you to slow down and enjoy the view and speed through at top speeds to beat your best times.
8507,This is an innovative must play. Wish there was a second one.
8508,Abit sad but fun
8509,"I buy this game with an advise of a friend. But it was much more fun than I expected.
Nice scenerio and graphics, beautiful gameplay.
In this game you are kind of high-tech spider man :)
It definately worth the price."
8510,"It's beautiful! Perfect game to play when your just chilling out. All though the caracters look a bit odd + the voice acting is not the best, but i'll give it a 7/10"
8511,Great game to unwind with
8512,pretty nice my friends
8513,The story about my uncle wasnt as pleasent
8514,I love it
8515,A good platformer.
8516,Great story!
8517,"This game is beautiful. It's honestly one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The storyline was beautiful, the graphics were beautiful, and the mechanics were beautiful. Beautiful. Wanna hear me say beautiful again? Beautlful."
8518,Somehow makes dreams come true.
8519,"Nominated for ''The World is Grim Enough, Let's just Get Along'' award. :)"
8520,its good
8521,"not portal good, but still good"
8522,Even though I got it on special I would gladly pay full price for a game like this.
8523,"The story is simple and short. The levels are easy and fun but some took me a ton of tries, I'm almost 3 hours in and still have finished only 60% of the game so far. It's definitely worth it on a sale."
8524,This game is decent!
8525,"A lovely game with a nice short story, it was fun to play and admire. Replay value of trying to get faster times going through the different areas."
8526,"This game was such a pleasent surprise! I bought it not expecting much out of it, however found myself immersed in a beautiful world with great gameplay! Even my wife who normally does not play an PC games is hooked! Please, if you are even thinking of buying this game, do yourselve a favor, and do it! I nominated it for ""The World is Grim Enough Let's Just All Get Along"" Award in 2017."
8527,"This kids on all the drugs.










He talks to fucking frogs and acts likes it normal #Drugsmakemetalktofrogs



10/10 would drug again"
8528,Very nice and chill game to play
8529,"Great story!
This game has one of the best story for me. Mybe it's because the voice actor has beautiful voice or mybe it's because i like games like that, i mean you can just chill if you want but you can also try to unlock achievements that aren't the easiest to unlock. Anyway try it if you like parkour games or games with great story or voice acting !"
8530,"This is a really fun game if you're a fan of FPS puzzle games, like Portal. It can be frustrating at times, when you have to nail the timing of a jump, but when you've mastered it, exploring is really rewarding."
8531,"Pros-Great Game,Fun Levels,Good Story and amazing landscapes. Overall good game would recomend the game to almost everyone. 

Cons-runs ok on low end pcs and thats about it"
8532,Its a Short but a fun time
8533,by far the most beautifull and most fun game i have played. just wish it had more story and levels
8534,Great Game for Speed Runners
8535,took me 2 hours to complete the story
8536,"A Nice relaxing piece of game that well worth the price, even if u dont for some reason like parkor then the story behind the game is for you i wont spoil anything i want yall to just try it out and if you dont like it then oh well"
8537,"Great game and amazing feeling of progress but some bugs

Edit: don't buy this game if it's not 50% off or more because i finished it in 3 hours and thers no replay value"
8538,"better than the beta and alot more fun! would recomend to story/platform lovers or anybody
"
8539,This game really suprised me. I had no idea really what it was about but when i decided to give it a try according to my friends. A story about my uncle is something that is considerably short but definently worth every minute. This is the  adventure that you could only imagine in your dreams. I highliny recommend it for just a nice chill time.
8540,"Enjoyable game with really immersive controls. Grappling hook has a little bit strange physics, but overall movement is swift. Graphics are okay, same to the story. Not a long game, but it's definitely worth buying and playing."
8541,"A Story About My Uncle is a short, story driven platformer. In the protagonist's quest to find his lost uncle, he meets a few very interesting characters along the way. The feeling this game gives when the user plays it start to finish is amazing. Rather than using cutscenes to explain the narrative, the game brilliantly reveals story elements in the background as the user plays. I would highly recommend this game, and I would say it's worth the 2017 Steam Award for ""No Apologies""."
8542,"Ok, on the one hand I'm writing this because of the Steam award.  On the other, I picked on this from the nearly 300 games in my library, because it's really quite exceptional.

This is a really quaint little game.  It's not terribly long and the graphics are cute, rather than outstanding.  But the puzzles are of a sort I've never seen in another game.  It deserves the same sort of acclaim Portal got, but it lacks a sarcastic antagonist to propel it to that."
8543,"[h1]- - -[ Impressions ] - - -[/h1]

A great, short, and challenging platformer with a story that, at first glance, seems shallow, but with careful inspection tells a tale that's extremely deep and moving...

My biggest gripes are with the time trials. Sometimes the physics and mechanics just decide to not work, when other times they are fine. It only is really a problem when you're rushing, so during the story it's easy to stay immersed."
8544,This story brought a tear to my eye. 10/10
8545,"Absolutely love it!

Great game that challenges the mind when it comes to achievments and is truly unique in gameplay. No regrets in buying it, definitely worth it.

Would recommend it 10/10 times!"
8546,"Leafy ruined this for many people, but sick game"
8547,"Great short game.

Yes, i'm doing this for the steam awards."
8548,"A Story About My Uncle combines 3D-Movement with a beautiful world and an amazing story. It requires some skill to maneuver around and there are severel secrets to discover which add more depth to the story, so it rarely gets boring. I had much fun playing it and would recommend it to anyone interested in actionless gameplay and a railroad of a story."
8549,"Great game, purchased it for $3 and am currently enjoying it greatly, i wouldnt say its worth $15 but under 10 definitely worth it!!!"
8550,awsome game
8551,It's good
8552,"Short, but cute. Challenging and fun...Family friendly. This game is kind of like if you were Samus from the Metroid Games with just the grapple beam."
8553,"Love the game, the story and the graphics. 
It might not be 4k true HD, but on my Ultra Wide 34"" this was a beauty to play.
the game play it self was a lot of fun too..

Think Platformer meets rocket boots, Grappling hook and a nice story.

Even though the ending was cut short in my opinion, this was a good game.
9/10"
8554,"Very nice and good for relaxing  but too short, they need to update the game"
8555,definitely worth the price
8556,"I liked this game a lot.
 It was really hard game and I haven't finished it yet. 
What I really like about this game is the feel of satification when you finally beat an obstacle, that you've been stuck for 
over 10mins."
8557,"The search for your uncle is so exciting that when you meet him, you feel regret."
8558,"brought it when it was in offer, will pay full prise if need"
8559,"a very relaxing game imo, good music & gfx, recommended if you like games with a touch of parkour"
8560,Love the game! amazing story and gameplay! the story is short though... i finished in 2 hours and got my money back!
8561,"What an immersive story. I got this game after a close friend recommended it to me, and I loved it. It has such a captivating story, and amazing level design. I love the game and love how it ends. I don't have any word to describe it other than amazing."
8562,"he gave me pink eye, then i gave him gonorrhea"
8563,"I recommend the game, but with reservation - and it must be on sale.

The story is really short, just two or three hours. It is 2/3 relaxing, all nice and dandy, but also 1/3 frustrating and you just want to get over it.

It's a rare game in that it has no violence and it's a feel-good silly game with a life lesson, and that's why it's a shame in the end there are so many frustrating parts. Otherwise would be good for kids. Well, maybe the kids don't actually mind the frustration, but they might not get the relaxing effect either.

If you find it on sale, though, grab it, and spend a chill weekend on it."
8564,"hmm, don't really know where to start with this game. It is like a love hate relationship. This game can frustrate you due to some clunky controls. The main thing for me is the grappling system. Instead of a swinging motion, the grappling system drags you forward and gives you forward momentum. This at time will cause you to hit something and therefore cause you to die. The graphics, not bad but nothing significant. Now on the plus side, the game is compatible with nvidia surround and also offers FOV slider. The story, well not bad but not much in it and also, the game is extremely short. I found it at $2.73 which is fine but $12.99, not sure about that. Replay value, hmm hard to tell, I want to but at the same time I have limited interest due to the frustration from the control. So, if you find it on sale, go for it but at the full price, I could hardly recommend the game."
8565,I do recommend this game for the smooth game play and cool world but at times it's hard to get in to the story for the plate forming gets a little frustrating and that they sound if they need to blow there nose
8566,"Fun, wish it were a bit longer. Cute story"
8567,"changed my life

"
8568,"Get this game while it's on sale, it's worth it."
8569,Very hands on. Very touching. Just like my uncle in real life.
8570,ITS SUGOI
8571,"Very few games capture me within the first few moments, and although the story is somewhat of a trope, who can't get lured in by salamander people. 10/10 would reccomend, amazing graphics and really obvious effort in the animations and construction of the story and art. Well worth the price."
8572,"A splendid platformer that is about 3 hours in length, Buy it on sale unless you are balling. If there were community maps this game would be 10/10 but since it's so short and left me wanting more... 8/10. GG

"
8573,"Many of those said it could be completed in one sitting; but for me, it is not enough due to me have difficulty to enjoy it at first. The story is interesting at first but the ending somehow is too weak although the epilogue kinda 'bitter-happy' moment. I recommend it for those who want a relaxed game, no violence here, and it's really like a bedtime story.

ps: The only good scenery in this game for me is the Star Haven level (the cover game on steam), while others are too plain."
8574,"the atmosphere of this game is absolutely amazing. this game either needs a pt.2 or workshop maps. sadly enough its pretty short, get it when its on sale."
8575,"Finished this game in one sitting.

Weak story, models and sometimes glitchy gameplay, making it sometimes feels frustating instead of challenging.

Aspects of this game is weak, but if this game is meant for children like <10 years old then it might fit.

If you want to buy it for your child I suggest you do it as the story is kind of give some good views on life those they can relate to and induce some fun for your child, violence-free, if you're concerned."
8576,A very nice game <3
8577,"A cute game with awkward narration and kinda clunky controls. The gameplay, though repetitive and world-building is unique and creative enough to make you immersed, but it's not enough to make the game fun or enjoyable for more than 30 minutes. Since its not an expensive game I'd still recommend it, but don't expect nothing more than an adorable timewaster. 
I would give it a 3/5."
8578,"The game is easy, but still challenging enough to make it fun for most people I think.
Hardest thing was finding a way next that I had to go.
Delightfully beautiful graphics.
Only shortcoming is that the playtime is about 2 hours.. a bit short.
Definitely buy this. Worth your money and while.
"
8579,Great game. Kinda like a bedtime story but 3 and a half hours long
8580,"I never got tired of leaping around floating platforms, super fun. Wish it had a couple more hours in the campaign."
8581,"An amazing short game that challenges your patience, but the ending is quite disappointing."

8583,"[h1] Short Review [/h1]

This game has to one of my most enjoyed first person games on my Steam Library, the general atmosphere, graphics are superb and the storyline fits in well with the concept.

[b] Pros: [/b]

- Brilliant Graphics

- Engaging Storyline

- Side activities (Maddie's grapple quest)

- Easy to obtain unlockables

- Time Trial



[b] Cons [/b]

- Too short

- The story ends so suddenly, was expecting more of a polished finish

- Achievements are quite hard to get



Plus it would have been cool for the developers to add a casual parkour map where players could simply grapple through it without any main objective.

8584,"Here we are told quite a fascinating story of a guy who is looking for his uncle named Fred. Maybe he went to the forest for mushrooms and never returned... Or simply tipsy, somewhere to sleep, but unfolds more impressive scene, when the boy finds awesome drawings of costume, and after his own. Suit get superpowers, can jump high, run fast. It turns out, uncle is a scientist. And after searching the lab, poked the buttons, he throws in the ""other world"" actually exists!

The world is a cave, with many hieroglyphics in an unknown language, glowing objects, plants. And flying stones! Looking down, we see an endless abyss... With the help of costume and force their way deeper into the marks left by our uncle. That's really it brought!

All the mysterious events, boy meets girl, but not man Before it finds the entry, as uncle told me that he had found an unusual egg, and leaving them in this world, they hatched and began to multiply! And he forgot about it. Hatched out here are the ""frogs"". Very funny and smart, who have their own history, and it will tell you Maddie.

But where is uncle? Maddie agreed to help us in the search! Now have to go through a long and hard road to track him down. Going further into the cave, we will meet the city's settlement with his technique, and architecture. And also extremely cosy lighting atmosphere! Many pavilions with lanterns, tents, blankets and fruit, small benches with cushions. Beautiful screenshots guaranteed.

Therefore, suit up and go in search of Fred. Can you find it? And what will be your fate?"
8585,"good, could use some polish but very enjoyable"
8586,"Its was beautiful story. First impression was difficulty... It's not easy to control but, since I've played 30 minutes, difficulty's not matter. There were Fantasy, Adventure, and healing, Thanks to this game, I got a great weekend."
8587,"Immersive story, smooth mechanics and fun gameplay. Truly an amazing game!
Only downside is that it's rather short but you should definitly try it out!"
8588,It's too short
8589,"I'm only 3 chapters in, It seems very soothing. Great when you need a break from more high stress competitive games. Almost reminds me of portal in some ways, in the trying to get places, but thats probably not the best analogy. It seems worth the 5 bucks I paid for it. 

It has crashed like 5 times though. I'm not sure if thats a me thing or a game thing. minor frustration."
8590,"u have cool outfit and can fly af, just like a bird, scurr scurr makes the birds"
8591,"Amazing game. Highly recommended! 

Extremelly smooth gameplay, challenging, creative... a bit short, but that's fine... overall, I give it a 9/10."
8592,nice
8593,really good
8594,This game  is good you need to try it out! Its short and fun !
8595,great game !
8596,"First of all, the game itself is full of lags no matter what video res i set it to. second, with the lagging in the game, it is almost impossible to pass the beggining, either it runs too slow for me to move at the right time, or sonme parts of the game itself just dont respond. i probably would recommend this game if your computer can handle it, but other than that, i wouldnt waste my money on this....... smh"
8597,Garbage level design and controls. Not happy even on sale at 2:50$.
8598,"I fully recommend this game if you are into visually stunning games and in games that touch you deeply.

This game combines an excellent music score with amazing visuals and fun game mechanics into a 2 to 3 hour long fun experience. Sometimes the game is a little challenging, not giving you the luxury of checkpoints so you sometimes have to redo a part a couple of times, but it's absolutely no hinder. The storytelling is very fluid and everything is explained very well. There is also a timed mode which I guess is more challenging? I heven't tried it out yet though.

There are also some minor negative remarks to be made about the game, but they are very limited. Not a lot is explained first of all and I get that the story wants to be vague about it because of the ending and it's interpretation, but sometimes it could be a little less vague and still be intriguing. The voice acting and animations of NPCs are also a little off, but it's barely noticable.

The best part about the game has to be the story and the ending which is open for interpretation. I even shed a few tears as soon as it started to dawn on me what actually happened. Spoiler to only be read by people who have finished the game: [spoiler] I think his uncle was just an inventor who sometimes played ""adventure"" with his nephew, but he died while the main character was at a very young age, so he had trouble getting over the grief which led to him making his uncle's death a story with a happy ending. What tipped me off (and the moment I shed tears of manliness) was when you enter his room after the credits and you see the little altar with flowers. [/spoiler] That's my interpretation of the ending, please tell me if I'm completely wrong."
8599,Very good game I like the graphics and the gameplay suprised it played on my laptop so smoothly was new to this game so it took me around 2 1/2 hours after finding out how to do stuff to complete it but re-running it again I'd recommend to a friend 10/10 (Short campaign but there's a time trial also fun to re-run).
8600,"Really Really short. But great game nonetheless. 
Would recommend on sale not full price."
8601,"Now ive completed the game, i can finally write a review.


The game is very fun and has an amazing story. The charicters are great and the scenery is amazing.
I love this game as its out of the ordinary and doesn't seem to have very many  games like it.
However this game is Extremely short and not woth 10 bux. I got it for ¬£1.99 in a sale and im so glad I did.
I have completed the game in UNDER 3 HOURS and im very dissapointed. For this im going to say RECOMMENDED but if you are reading this, please i would advise you be carefull. Thanks :D

WHEN I SAY ""COMPLETED"" I MEAN THE STORY."
8602,"Mechanics are excellent, maps are fun and challenging. 

Art is enough to convey what it needs to.

Charecter dialog sometimes a bit annoying but I got over it.

8/10"
8603,good game
8604,absolutely beautiful
8605,Amazing game from the beginning to the end
8606,"The story was amazing but short. Definitly worth picking up while on sale but the base game price is a little much.
Gameplay is smooth and calm, greate for casual players!"
8607,"Sweet story of a child going on an adventure and growing up, game mechanics are interesting and fun, and voice acting isn't half bad.

My one complaint is that the map isn't tight enough, as in you're not quite sure where to go occasionally and its fairly easy to glitch over certain obstacles. Although, maybe this is how it was intended; so that the map feels big and you're a small child trying to navigate it.

Its your pick."
8608,This game was actually not what i expected! Graphics are pretty well and the story is ok!  The game overall to me is a 6.5/10 because i felt there wasnt anything hard about the game! Its a parkour adventerous type of game!
8609,A platform game that would be so so so frustrating if it wasn't so damn beautiful. Definitely worth the 3 euro's now it's 80% off!
8610,I liked the story and the parkour elements to the game.  The visuals were also stunning
8611,"An amazing innovative game which gets more and more challenging as you advance. The plot of the story is a bit simple but It has a great imaginative world inside. Maps and level designs are really good. I recommend it, you should play this game."
8612,its just a fantastic game to chill and think about so mush thank you for release this game
8613,"Great gameplay, pretty childish and shallow story. The narrative and voice acting were on clearly not the priority developing this game, luckily the unique combo of adventure, 3D platforming, and smooth gameplay make it worth a play if on sale for less than 5 dollars."
8614,"Wow!
So, Im not usually one to take time out of my day for a review.... but this game is the exception. Im truly amazed by the fluidity of this gameplay. Thank you, to the developer of this well crafted game. This is the first game I have played that immerses you while you hear a bed-time story. Best game on steam by far.

10/10 hands down

Side Note: This game is worth weay more than the cost. BUY THIS GAME"
8615,"-MAC USERS BEWARE-

there are several mac users who are unable to run this game. It shows the starting screen and refuses to load. 


I am running OSX El Capitan (Version 10.11.6)
"
8616,"waist of money, fun game but you will beat it in less that 2 hours."
8617,"Pros: 
Really really fun gameplay
Relaxing and can be played after finishing the story
Goat mode!

Cons: 
The game doesnt tell you where to go so you can end up going back or just confusing what to do.

%100 purchase it if its on a sale"
8618,"Amazing story, great relaxer. Most fun I've had in a while."
8619,Very Good Game
8620,he touched me....there i saved you money
8621,First minute map doesnt have NEW ZEALAND ON IT
8622,"Completed the game in 3 hours, the gameplay is fun and honestly what made me want to try it. I got it during an 80% sale, so 3 CAD for it was a great price and and really enjoyable game. The plot is simple but touching, you're a boy going after your uncle on an adventure, really recommend it, especially during a sale, since i'm not a speedrunner I'll probably not play it a lot more, but it is good for speedrunning and also has a time trial extra mode that can get you a few more gameplay"
8623,Its good until that weird thing jumps on your freaking back lol
8624,"This is one of those games where I could really use a neutral option on a Steam review. It's not bad, but it has some problems, the biggest one being the story, which feels as if it was cut halfway through. It had a nice start, but the ending was just very disappointing. Besides, the game is very short, so definitely not worth paying the full price (I bought a key for less than one euro). 

The good things? The visuals (asides from the frog people) were nice, but no more than that. The gameplay is probably the best thing about this game, a little bit repetitive, but relaxing and well balanced in it's difficulty. 

I can't really recommend this game nor tell you to avoid it. I give it a 5/10 and leave the choice to you."
8625,"Play this for the gameplay and the breath taking environment and not for the story.

The ending is so bland and disappointing that until the last second i was hoping something - Just anything to happen But sadly, it was the end of the game.

It is a different game. Worth trying out during a sale"
8626,damn this game is lit AF :fireEMOJI: :fireEMOJI: :fireEMOJI:
8627,"Very cool game, beautiful looking environments with very good and fitting aesthetics.

The core platform mechanics are very well made, absolutely fluid and fun to play!

The story seems to be intriguing so far, hopefully, it gets even better later on."
8628,Nice game to play when you want to relax and chill. 9/10.
8629,"Let me start by reminding you that this is an Indie game. 

It was made by a team of less than 20 people. 

So, yes there will be some glitches like clipping into terrain and the animations won‚Äôt be butter smooth.

But what you get is a fresh fun game made by people who care about their game. 

This game is not Skyrim or GTA with 200 hours of content but its 2 hours of flying through the air is well worth its price tag. I picked it up during a sale but at only ~$13 it‚Äôs still a great deal at full price. 

The game is breathtakingly beautiful at times, with huge areas filled with vibrant colors. The fantastic use of light to give an amazing sense of scale as you look down at a bottom less void and up to a sea of colored pillars and caves. 

The gameplay is amazing and often reminded me of Portal and Bioshock Infinite with the sense of scale and freedom of movement. There are 2 parts in particular that look like they are ripped straight out of those two games. And that is not a compliant or a bad thing, they are awesome parts. 

Still not sure if you should get the game? 

Well if you are super stressed out after getting killed for the 100th time by an invisible sniper that you are sure is cheating, then buy this game, install it, and beat it in less time than it takes to watch any of the Hobbit films. You will be much calmer after soaring through the air while staring at pretty things."
8630,"great game! LOVE IT!!!
to think this was made by the devs of goat simulator"
8631,"An okay game. Starts stronger than it finishes.
Its biggest fault is that it doesn't really allow the player to have fun swinging and soaring through the air. A lot of the time you have to make a jump exactly right or use the limited (three) graples with perfect timing, and the game becomes frustrating and a chore.
But, in general, I recommend it. The gameplay (if we overlook its slight mistakes) is interesting, and the atmosphere and set-pieces are beautiful."
8632,"Dont mind the lack of hours, I pirated the game and decided to buy the game. Game's tight and responsive and the non-violence is a great change of pace."
8633,"You know what I love in video games? Doing a bunch of busy work and trying to master one ridiculous skill. Even better, I reeeeally appreciate when I'm punished for not perfecting the ridiculous skill by being sent back to where I was 30 minutes before. 

Thanks for the waste of time!"
8634,"A short adventure bedtime story.

- Gameplay is nice, unlocking achievements will be fun.
- I loved the gameplay of this game, this is something you'll casually launch to pass time (after you've completed it once, of course.)
- A little short for the price, but I got it on a sale, so keep an eye out.

and unlock the achievements. :)
"
8635,"An awesome atmospherical story that embarks on an adventure to find his uncle while being mildly challenging & atmospherically emerging. 

8/10"
8636,"Beautiful graphics, solid gameplay. That being said, the voice acting is so horrible that it completely takes me out of the experience. Such a shame. Its not hard to read a script and phrase sentances like a normal human being telling a story to a child. Good lordy it makes me not want to finish the game. Im guessing im turning the sound off and leaving the subtitles on for the rest of this adventure."
8637,"If you liked Portal, you'll probably like this.  The characters are a bit weak, but then again it is a children's story."
8638,"Short and overpriced but overall a good game. The gameplay felt smooth and I much enjoyed swinging around with the grappling-glove. The voice acting was a bit stiff but the story was cute and I especially liked the ending.

I'd definitely recommend this game, but not for its full price."
8639,"For some reasons it took me 7 hours to finish this game.Good for people who love jumping around and something challenging.    
 
 7.9/10

Good Storyline

Nice Background especially the frozen whale.

Easy controling  

Good Graphic

Nice Ending"
8640,"great game, loved it. had a few bugs where i was clipping into the walls and fell through the map a couple times. only real complaint."
8641,"The scenery is kinda beautiful and the mecanics are interesting, but the world is shallow, the story is bad, no character development, and it's so repetitive that I was glad that it was short.
Sometimes it seens like the reach of your grappling hook varies, which can be just impression, but in the last (4th) level it's hard to tell why you couldn't throw the hook in this surface, even it being the right color. This is also a problem with objects moving in a circular maner, they move really slow and it's difficult to know when you should let go, or when you should throw the hook.
Overall, this game has potential, but it's poorly made.
It could be better if the focus of the difficulty were more in right timing than distance perception."
8642,"Really a good game. it's kinda hard, but fun."
8643,"One of my top games of all time.  Loved the mechanics and wishing for more maps/expansions.  Movement smooth, grapples easy, been looking for a game like this ever since I played it.  7/10."
8644,Picked it up in a sale. Get yourself a cup of hot cocoa and have very nice evening :)
8645,The game is short yes bit the amazing experience and visuals make up for it.
8646,Good game mechanics! Really fun! Graphics are a bit outdated but it doesn't change the experience. Must try for less than 5$
8647,"This game is Calming, great environment, great story, great platforming game, great movements.
9/10"
8648,"An absolute blast! It's graphics are not revolutionary nor the story a literary masterpiece, but goddamn was this game a fun ride from start to finish. I was thoroughly impressed by the gameplay, especially considering the developers are on the more indie side of things. The level designs worked wonderfully with the mechanics of the game, and they were definetely inspired by imaginative minds. Besides the gameplay, I liked the look of the setting and the music. The ending made me have feelings too. A Story About My Uncle is defintely a nice change of pace from the usual games we see on the market.

The only real downside is that it is short, but for the price it is defintely a quality game. I was glad I got it on sale, but I'd argue that it is worth the full price. If you're looking for a nice ""in-between games"" game, this is the perfect game."
8649,"I love this game. It's short and sweet, not too hard but there are some times I would click on a platform to grapple on and it wouldn't connect, 8/10"
8650,"One of those games that isn't super flashy or crazy. It won't be something you constantly think about or replay, just one of those games that when you finish you're gonna sit there and say ""Damn, That was a good game."""
8651,"Incredibly peaceful game, with a nice story and very engaging characters. :'), very good game. 9/10."

Honestly a very good game, kinda short but hey, there's still a time trial mode.
The story felt kinda bland but it still was compelling and made me want to commit suicide at the end.
Because the game is so short, the characters don't have time to make us develop a more than vague interest in them, and I truly believe that's a shame.
The gameplay was good, it felt nice, even though some parts of the levels were kinda confusing and I almost got lost going backtrack once (maybe that's because I'm completely stupid, but I hope not).
All in all, this is a good game, but sadly too short for its price... Consider buying it on sale."
8653,"This is the best game i have ever played! The graphics is great, and all the different type of worlds you travel through is throughly built. The gameplay is nice and if you want it to be more challenging, you just make some for yourself, its all up to your imagination and it wont be a problem, beacuse of the freedom that the game provides. And last but not least, the story! It is intriguing and if you just pay attention it is really complex. All in all, this game is amazing, and with an ending better than most movies, i am left with a feeling that i just want more of this game!"
8654,"a good looking game with a kind story, too bad it's not that long"
8655,Great short game. Ice caves were frustrating.
8656,this game was fucking amazing
8657,"The game mechanics are interesting... for about half an hour. Then it's the same thing over and over again. The developers try to make up for it by giving you different jump challenges, or different level textures, but it gets repetetive very quickly after the novelty wears off. Then the jumps get harder and the saves further between. Maybe it would be worth finishing if the story wasn't so bland or the voice acting so terrible... but the story IS bland and the acting IS terrible. I just don't get the game model of ""if you fail a jumping section of the game 25 times and THEN you manage to pass it, you'll forget about feeling frustrated and it will somehow be fun!"".  Glad I bought it super cheap, but it still wasn't worth it."
8658,Good game and quite fun 8/10
8659,"A Story About My Uncle is exactly what is sounds like. It is a bedside story told to a little girl about the time the main character went on an adventure.

Gameplay -
Great gameplay, I loved swinging around like Tarzan. However, whoever invented those jump boots needs to die. It is a real pain to charge it up every time, and if you want to aim it, good luck. When the little frog lady says, ""I bet you cant finish this part without your hook"" just ignore her. Really, it isnt worth all the pain. 

Story -
I really like the way he sort of narrates the story as you experiance it, like your playing a story. However, there are some flaws. [spoiler] At the end of the game, when you finally reach the famous uncle, it is a big let down. He gives up his only hope of escaping this cave frog nightmare to help you. And because you accidently promised that he would visit a frog girl. Very nice, but down there one mistake means death. I should know. So you come all this way to see if you uncle is alright, most likely dying several dozen times, and he says thanks goodbye. After that I feel like they hint that the uncle died in the future... but I dont really know. [/spoiler]

Overall a good game, I would buy on sale for the unique gameplay and story."
8660,"This is a puzzle and I [b]hate[/b] puzzle games.  There is no intuition or even logic involved in puzzles.  Puzzles force you to think in terms of what the creators wanted.  Okay, rant over and having said that, I'm going to recommend this game because no matter how many times I fall to my death, I always want to continue on.  Using a grappling hook to attach myself to floating objects and swing through the beautiful environments is exhilarating.  The voice acting is good and the story is simple - we all can relate to it in some way.

Oh, and it helps that I got this for only $2.49."
8661,"very realistic, lots of action I guess, tons of upgrades, HECK YEAH!!! Play this game. it is so awesome!!!"
8662,Very Good story line and great gameplay and graphics! Definitely recommended.
8663,"It's ... OK. And that's OK. The later levels are just annoying and cheap, but the first part of the game can be breathtaking at times."
8664,"Well made game.
Great gameplay
Great story
nice voiceacting
well done"
8665,I would love to know what drugs the developers were using.
8666,"The scenery is beautiful, but this game needed a lot more play-testing.  As I've played the game, I've reached the point where I actively despise it.  Don't think I'm going to finish it."
8667,"Probably one of the best games i have ever played

Fantastic story

Great gameplay

10/10

A little short though..."
8668,"Want a short game that gets you in the feels but is still fun and a good way to pass a few hours?  This will do it.  Pretty, whimsical and an interesting tall tale of adventure a la Jonathan Swift.  

Overall pretty easy (except a couple of sections that ramp up the difficulty) and if I can get through it as someone who's only just started gaming with K&M then anyone can.  Put off writing my thesis to play it.  Would do again. 

"
8669,"A beautiful, peaceful and slightly addictive game with a really cute story. Some minor glitches but I hardly noticed them. Really awesome game!"
8670,"Gameplay's actually kinda cool, but can be fiddly trying to find something you can grapple onto before you fall to your death.  There's a good amount of checkpoints so it's not the worst, but there were a few points I just kept leaping to my doom trying to catch a glimpse of where I was supposed to go next.

I'd only reccomend it if you've already played The Valley."
8671,A beautiful atmosphere and swinging from rock to rock is so damn satisfying. 9/10 (only reason why its not a 10 is its short and the voice acting is pretty bad)
8672,I cry like little b l y a t.
8673,"Great game. Fun mechanics. (I'd be interested to see a competitive multiplayer game based around platforming mechanics like these.) Intriguing world. A beautiful game too. Some breathtaking scenes. Some spooky moments. Great soundtrack. Just good all around. It's not punishingly difficult. Checkpoints are generously frequent.

The only downside is that it's a little on the short side. The game ends rather abruptly. Still worth the time though."
8674,"This is a lovely game with a very sweet story dirving you throughout the game. A father tells his daughter a bedtime story, about when he went on a great adventure to find his uncle Fred. You enter a beautiful, almost magical world, with floating rocks, flowing waterfalls and crystals. With a special suit your uncle made you you get to jump great distances and fall from great heights without hurting yourself, thus exploring this alien your world, later adding a grappling tool and rocket boots tto bring you even further. 

The enviroment was very well made, and it was a bit of a let down to see that the npc's didn't look even half as good. I would have liked some more opportunities to interact, even it it was a simple ""hi"", but those that you do interact with I thought fun and sweet and fit very well within the story.

The more you explore, the harder the parkour gets. I am not a rage-quiter, and I would not recommend this game if you are, because I've had to repeat serveral area's multiple times only to miss the last ledge (and that holy-moly-YES! safe point) by a hair. The feeling when you do finaly get to that safe point is amazing though, and for me the story, the sceney and the accomplishment of getting to that next safe point was more than enough to keep going and keep trying. It took me 9 hours to complete the game, taking my time to enjoy the views, savoring that safe point. 

Getting the collectibles was not a thing for me, and I know for a fact I will never try to get all the steam achievements (finishing all levels without dying.... nope), but I might give the collectibles a try later on.

Overall I enjoyed playing this game and I would recommend it to those that like story-driven parkour games that can be quite challenging at times."
8675,A good game about jumping
8676,"Awesome couple of hours, nice visuals and cool mechanics. Get it on sale."
8677,This game is way to short.
8678,"Very good but very hard, clearly the dark souls of first person platformers"
8679,"I loved this game, It looks amazing and has a great story! 11/10 One of my all time favorites, 
Give this game a try

8680,Took me 1.9 hours to complete story mode. Fun game.
8681,"I mean, I recommend you play it, yes.

However, there are some things I need to say first.

The story, in my opinion, is crap. But the gameplay is awesome, with the exception of 1 section near the end where it was difficult to figure out where you were meant to go.

For fun gameplay, I recommend it, for story, go play something else."
8682,The fact that I took the time to write this review shows that I found this game truly exceptional. Highly recommended :)
8683,"Pros 
amazing story,
interesting level design, 
graphics look brilliant, 
short game, only a few hours long. 
great fun once you get the hang of it. 
i didn't want it to end!
Fred
room for a part two where the nephew goes missing and the daughter or neice goes in serach of him? 
Cons 
short story.
nearly reduced to tears."
8684,A very atmospheric game that feels peaceful with an interesting and pleasant narration. The gameplay is well made and has a good scaling in difficulty through the length of the game. The game felt too short since the world seemed to be worth exploring for a lot more hours.
8685,"Good game, would definitely recommend."
8686,"It's a beautiful, relaxing game. The movement system is amazing, truly creating a feeling of freedom. The grapple system in three dimensions works well, and allows a surprising amount of freedom with relatively few restrictions while still not trivialising the game. The way the expectations of your movement progresses also prevents it from getting stale. That being said, it isn't very difficult of a game, and it offers a pleasant and relaxing experience more than a thrilling and challenging one.
Along the way, there's a bounty of beautiful scenery to explore.

The story offers an interesting experience, having left me curious for more along the way while still not rushing the pace of the game. The characters feel friendly, and while I always wanted to know where the story went next, I never felt like it pulled me away from enjoying the aesthetics and movement system, which are definitely the core of the game. The story is rather short, but especially at the very generous price I got it at, it's nonetheless an amazing title I'm happy to have played.

8687,"I so want Sandbox software for this game too make my own level, and i recommend this game."
8688,"it's...very different? it isn't like what you would expect. the story is quite interesting and the gameplay feels very mysterious, magical, fun, wild, and calming all at once. i would say yes, get this game. preferably on sale, but depending on how it ends when i finish it i may just be willing to pay full price if i could buy it again. try it out guys, have fun and best wishes"
8689,cmon mate where is the pilgrims
8690,"Rarely does a game so move me that I feel compelled to volunteer a review of it on steam, but this underappreciated gem deserves all the positive comments it can get. Although the story is very short, I find myself revisiting the game because of the extremely satisfying controls and movement dynamics (given the grappling ability, the booster jump, etc.). It feels wonderful to control your movement through these environments. The music, the graphics, and the atmospheres from level to level all come together perfectly to make for an endearing experience. The story is very cute, and most of the voice acting is fantastic‚Ä¶ There may have been a grammatical mistake or two (if memory serves), but that was entirely overshadowed by everything else. 

Just about my only problem with the game is how short it was. It has so much potential to be drawn out into a much longer game, or perhaps a series (I‚Äôm not sure if a sequel is even being discussed, but, in my opinion, it should be seriously considered ‚Äì perhaps with the protagonist being the young girl, now grown woman, telling her child about one of her adventures). The only improvements I can think of besides elongating the narrative would be the ability to further upgrade the grappling ability, adding an optional compass, adding some (more?) Easter eggs, and *maybe* adding some sort of dialogue option which could result in changing the story (perhaps giving the game more replay value).
Bottom line: this game is fun. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. At the end of the day, that‚Äôs really the whole point of a video game. I am happy to give it somewhere in the range of an 8/10 or 9/10 ‚Äì but with some small improvements, I could easily have given it a 10/10. 

A great (if very short) game. 
"
8691,"Great Game. Nice, Short Story told by a great narrater. Beautiful graphics with pretty light effects and cool charakters..- Well, there are 4, but that is totally enough for what the game is and does.

Fast, Fun gameplay wich gives you the feel of you flying around for real. 

In fact that the game is that short, 10 Bucks are definitely too much. Got it for 2 Bucks back in a Summer Sale."
8692,"It may be a short game (I completed it in a few hours), but the gameplay is very fun and challenging, visual aesthetics are nice too. Story surprised me at every turn and I thought I was done being surprised by the stories in games."
8693,"Most 3D platformers tend to be collect-a-thons and to not actually focus on platforming. A Story About My Uncle is one of those games that I would truly qualify as a 3D platformer.

The feeling of freedom granted by the controls is amazing. It is like playing Spider-Man, swinging around in caves and cities in the sky instead of New York. Only that your webs stock is very limited and you have to use it carefully. 

The gameplay is very empowering, but don't be fooled: the levels can be quite challenging, and will require you to be attentive of your environment and to be dexterous.

I wish the adventure was longer (which is a good sign that I spent a great time), but also I think new elements would have to be introduced; otherwise, it'd get repetitive as I feel the developers explored everything they could have done with the current mechanics. 

A better story-writing would also be welcomed, especially considering how big of a role it plays. There are obvious moments where you are supposed to feel sadness or wrench, and it is just awkward to not feel involved when characters are making emotional speeches. 

I would easily overlook the flaws and recommend it, as it is an original concept well executed overall."
8694,Great gameplay! Stupid ending: [spoiler] Spend all your time finding Uncle. In the end you say hi to him he sends you back and he stays. [/spoiler]
8695,"This game is not a long one, but what it provides is an exciting twist on the traditional platformer. I found myself revisiting so many levels just to find different routes and faster ways of completing objectives. Not only is it a refreshing experience, it also provides an amazing narrative. I found myself getting attached to the characters and often feeling for them. If you are a person who loves games with a beautiful story then pick this game up!

The only cons I have against ASAMU is that the voice acting is pretty bad, but if you are like me and don't really care, then buy it."
8696,this game is one of my all time favorites for a game with an amazing story
8697,"The mechanics in this 3D platformer are some of the most polished and thought out I've seen. New (to me), and they're used in such meticulously constructed and well-paced environments that it's hard to fault this game for anything. Fresh ones are introduced with perfect timing. 
Changes, instructions, are all in-universe and don't break immersion at all.

Even the save spots, which you'd sometimes feel like need to be closer together, are actually perfect in retrospect. Any more frequent and they'd detract from the challenge of surviving in one go. And more importantly, that'd take away from the exhiliration of completing that stretch. Protects the player from themselves.
 
Story is pretty amazing, for a game with so little story. It sells the motivation VERY well. The way the dialogues are written, and the stellar af vioce acting is honey for the ears, even on repeat. 
Ending:
[spoiler] How does it feel to be the reason your uncle has his decision made for him at the end? Pretty good actually. It's written so well that we can interpret it either way. [/spoiler]
Might be sort of underwhelming, but there aren't many ways this can end without changing mechanics (and not being boring). Very portal-like, in retrospect. Leaves room for the sequel."
8698,"Quite short ~ deff not worth the full price (5$ max by my toughts)

Story is....shit ~ its quite kid based

Whoever was the voice of Madline , god.... your voice is annoying af.

i give it a 4.3/11"
8699,"What a shame, I was able to finish this in just one sitting. The story was short, but it was enagaging, immersive, sweet and beautiful. Stunning & unique atmosphere, enjoyable music, amazing & lovable characters and just excellent overall."
8700,"YES. 
I absolutely love this game. It just feels great to play. 

+ Good soundtrack
+ Fun gameplay
+ Interesting story

I highly recommend this game!"
8701,"This game is amazingly fun but the story is way to short it took me alomst 3 hours to finish the game 

its fun but its not worth 16 dollars"
8702,"This game gets at LEAST a solid 9/10 from me. It is just absolutely stunning, with a variety of carvings and rune-like symbols covering the vast cave systems, plus the far-reaching beauty of the open areas (no, really, you don't understand how open), the game was a breathtaking visual experience from start to finish. The gameplay and movement itself is intuitive and FUN, just so much fun. A good sprint function is vital in any game, and this one lets you ZOOM. You use that in addition to swinging yourself over huge bottomless drops, with a VERY well done physics engine, and combined with not wanting to tear your eyes from the scenery, I found it almost totally immersive. There are a few large segments where it gives you the opportunity to go without stopping for several minutes on end, and it is /bliss/.
It also has a really quick recovery after falling to your death; nearly as soon as you are out of recoverable range, it fades out and quickly resets you, and also responds to powering up your suit before/during the fade, which lets you try again very quickly without much downtime/time needed to ""get back into it"" at all. This is a *very* good thing , since falling will happen a lot, but with the fast recovery, it's pretty easy to stay in your groove even if you do die frequently, without sitting at a load screen doubling your frustration. 

Part of the one point I take off is for general character development, I suppose I could surmise it as. I felt myself a little less emotionally involved in the player character, the End Goal character, and the main NPCharacter that is with you for part of the game, than I think the writers wanted for... any of them. Without getting into spoilers, I felt like the companion's story was fairly indecisive and didn't offer a huge amount to the game. However it doesn't play out unrealistically, exactly, and doesn't break immersion, they're just a boring character. The goal character, you aren't given a lot of reason to care about them, just some tiny bits of random incidental information. You also have virtually no information about your own player character; age during the gameplay, capabilities, job training, why they can do these things intuitively, why their goal is their goal, are they even a reliable narrator about their own feelings during this (there's one line about the player character reassuring himself with an idea that I basically just... don't buy being enough to get through that situation), etc. You're just kind of doing it because it's what you're doing.

The other part of that point being taken off is that this game is TOO DARN SHORT!!! A whole playthrough end to end takes maybe a few hours, and I could play this game for DAYS. While wanting more content from a game you really love to play is a sad kind of yearning in and of itself, I feel like there were also some parts of the story that were hinted at too lightly, or were left unresolved entirely (basically... why an uncle is so important that you would launch yourself into space and take your time meandering through an alien world for him, especially just for... that ending, and other family-related story stuff I feel was hinted at but not strongly enough to be sure of), that could have been told more clearly, and much more emotionally, with more playtime to tell it in. 
All that said, ultimately, I expect to keep replaying this game over and over for a long time.

Short list version-
Pros:
- Amazing physics movement that you really *feel*
- Doesn't waste your time with extended falling scripts or load times
- Truly, just beyond beautiful scenery, it shows you places you wish you could just stare at forever
- Lots of interesting little notes and items to examine 
- It doesn't outstay its welcome, nor do its less-than-engaging characters
- Not too complex, no expanded lore needed to get into it, just jump in and have a good time
- I don't believe I've encountered a bug so far

Cons:
- Very short, leaves you wanting to explore SO much more of the world
- Story and characters are pretty lightly developed
- Very linear, most of the sparse exploration options you have to find the collectibles are either blatantly obvious, or almost literally invisible
- I'm sitting here trying to think of other things and without going and playing again specifically looking for other things not to like, I got nothing!"
8703,‚ô•
8704,10/10
8705,"While I have my small issues with this game, the gameplay is incredibly fun, and for that alone I would absolutely recommend it."
8706,"Great and challenging game that tests your patience, perserverance and determination on each level. Might I suggest tho that you should prepare a pillow beforehand to scream on as you'll die a lot if your precision to land or grapple isn't right. On the plus side, no one cares if you'll die a thousand (or a million) times in this game as it doesn't affect the gameplay."
8707,"The time trial part was just irritating to plow through. You can't reset the clock immediately, you have to load back to the main menu just to reset the time trial challenge from the start, it's just very petty and unintuitive on that regard. This game was made in 2014(?) and there's better time trial minigame out there at that point, so goddammit such backwards design.
The game overall is fun, just it feels like there are certain mechanics felt missing in the game, like let players cling to the edge of platform and climb up said platform like in the 2000s Tomb Raider games. It's just so frustrating to hit that edge of the platform and fall down like an NES character. The air control in this game is floaty and not the most precise but manageable. 
A lot of room for improvement here. 
And I like the suits.
The suit's cool, a la Sanctum.
Git gud guys."
8708,"I love this game it's so relaxing and chill to play (extremely fun too, obviously)
I HIGHLY recommend you give this game a try."
8709,"This is a pretty good game. I don't know if I would buy it for it's regular price, but if you can find it on sale, it's probably worth the money. Another cool thing about it is that it can run on practically anything."
8710,"Actually quite a good game but.....
















Leafy sucks and i know half of the people who brought this game only got it cause of him"
8711,it was a rly great game i wish it never ended. maybe a separate story line could be added after finding his uncle
8712,"ASAMU left me both happy and disappointed! Its a fun little platformer with a focus on momentum. Playing a game that doesn't have combat or enemies trying to kill you feels unique. But beyond a certain point, the platforming gets a bit too repetitive and that feeling gets worse with some imprecise design. FOr example grapple points dont work as intended sometimes which makes your nth fall trying to land on a platform annoying! But if you can get past that, ASAMU is a neat little game worth trying."
8713,"Strongly recommended for a unique gaming experience.

Its a experience that occasionally draws you back to install it 
and feel again that sensation of flying. You get to really feel that you
have a bottomless pit underneath you. And that starheaven map is just pure art.
After completing i really suggest you to unlock all limit restrictions via console
to swing a lot faster and grapple without the need to recharge.

I really hope a sequel or more games similar to this."
8714,"wow... just wow...
we are rly waiting for ASAMU 2. 
this game is a golden gem that shows us feeling of missing our ""soulmates"". GEM
9./10"
8715,Fun
8716,"This game is amazing, i got it on sale, and had a blast playing it, totally worth 5 bucks."
8717,"Very good game. Has a good story, fun gameplay, everything that makes a good game good. Try it out for yourself!"
8718,one of the greatest games i ever played
8719,A great first person plat former with a story that's short and sweet. I do recommend.
8720,"i couldnt finish the game but the time i have played the game, the environment is very beautiful. i would recommend this game to a friend that enjoys puzzle games and enjoys the scenery of the virutual world. but other than that i could not get into the game"
8721,Clean fun game. Beautiful graphics.
8722,"Beware, for this is a masterpiece.

It just hits you right in the guts. Bull's eye.
Breathtaken, I sweeped across the caves and chasms and floating isles just to wreck myself into the pain of realizing its over.

The story's over. Feelings stuck in the throat. Acceptance.

This game is a must-have for anyone, who's into the good narrative.
One touching story to share, a whole new experience to remember.

Farewell, old life.
Let us start anew."
8723,"WOW!
Recommended by me X100"
8724,"It's great, stunning visuals and gameplay and a simple but very nice story, one of my favorite games of all time."
8725,Short parkour fun.
8726,extremely visually appealing with a great story. i have a hard time with the grappling sometimes but overall it is very worth it.
8727,"If your favorite game as a kid was Bionic Commando, then ignore my negative feedback and get this game. You'll adore it.

For everybody else, this is a game where you grapple through caves. The first 3 levels are caves of increasing darkness, you get a reprieve in the 4th level, and then the big 5th level is a harder cave. The grappling is challenging but tedious. While other short games feel clever and innovative with their mechanics (i.e. Braid), A Story About My Uncle feels like it's mostly filler. If the game was half the cost and half the length I would have had a better experience.

As for narrative, the story is flat and not thought through. The game starts off hinting at a strong narrative, but never builds to a deep or interesting story. There's a decent amount of voiceover, but it's all small fragmented stories that never develops into a full narrative.

To its credit, A Story About My Uncle doesn't pretend to be something it's not. However, I have a hard time justifying a tedious and repetitive game with little story or world for $13, when I can wholeheartedly recommend 30+ hour games like Hollow Knight for $15. Unless you're extremely interested in the mechanic, give this a pass.
"
8728,"Welp, I've finished this game. I liked the mechanics, the gameplay, the story, the music, the atmosphere, their characters, everything! I loved it! I paid 8 dollars because I had a steam coupon, but I would've definitely paid the full price. I know the game is not perfect, for example, the graphics are not that stunning, but they're beautiful. Also, the game is really short, It took me about 4-5 hours to beat the game (I took my time looking at the people, the villages, etc). Still, it's a wonderful experience. If you really like platformers and/or parkour, THEN YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME, but I'd recommend you to get it on sale if you're unsure about paying the full price.
P.S. Mi tio el furro."
8729,a story about his uncle*
8730,Very good game
8731,Amazing short story.
8732,This is a great 3D platformer with cool story about finding your uncle and getting cool upgrades along the way like rocket boots
8733,"Where do I begin. The environment is absolutely beautiful, the art style is incredible. The characters aren‚Äôt the best looking, but you barely see them. The story is pretty flippen good, and I‚Äôd honestly recommend this to anyone, especially on sale! Is it a short game? Yes, but it‚Äôs totally worth it"
8734,"Atmospheric game with basic, but lovable story. Amazingly fun gameplay techniques an beautiful scenes. +1 because there is a dad in it."
8735,"I don't cere what anyone says this is a terriible game highly annoying voice acting ridiculously ease pazzles and it a prety short story it one of those game where you could do a speed run in just over 2h so you can't ask for a refund and it probably a mater of apinion but the storry seems like it wos dremp up by a 6 year old. 
I got the game after plying portal so maby my expectetions where a bit high and this is only bad in comparison but I sill dont get how it has over 90% positive reviews"

8739,"just for the record, my uncle would approve of this game"
8740,"This game is what has been absent from gaming since the 1990's. It is a good, story driven platformer with simple and unique mechanics used in creative combinations. It was wonderful to play, and while it gave me nostalgia back to the days of Spyro the Dragon and Banjo Kazooie, it didn't feel retro or childish. The story is interesting and immersive, pulling from halflife with first person cutscenes that feel natural to the rythem of the game. I must highly reccomend a playthrough. My only complaints are that in the begining the controls feel a little clunky, but you get used to them quick (again like the old platformers of the '90s) and I feel like one more chapter would have been nice, because I was having a lot of fun by time the ending came around."
8741,"[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
[i]Morty trying to find Rick in the Avatar universe via platforming[/i]

[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]
++Exciting grappling mechainics as you swing from point to point swiftly
+Platforming combined with the grapples and non-violence creates some good puzzles and pathfinding, especially in vast areas
+Beautiful atmosphere that is constantly changing around you. From the sky aborad ships, to deep down in dark eerie caves
+The sound design and the soundtrack are fantastic, making you fully immersed into the game with every swoosh and swash! ... is swash a sound effect?
+The level design is well done because there are parts that are very linear, but most parts allow a lot of freedom in how you go about them and complete them

[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]
=The big areas are a little overwhelming, but doable
=Story and script are alright, not the greatest but it's still fun
=Voice acting is hit or miss depending on the character

8743,very kool
8744,"Fun game, great atmophere, unique movement, overall relaxing."
8745,"I usually don't get motion sickness while playing but this is one of the few exceptions. It's because you have to jump a lot in first person view. 

The game itself is pretty boring and repetitive. Insufficient game mechanics, little to no character interactions and an anticlimactic story with a bad ending make this game not fun. The developers probably wasted most of their time trying to create an artistic game world and neglected other parts of the game.

1/10"
8746,"A cute little game, I liked it. Buy this if you like 3D platforming with interesting momentum-based movement."
8747,"Played for 2 Hours and enjoyed every moment.
A very pleasent and calming atmposphere just going through the game, using your energy beem to cross between Flying mini islands and progressing in the story when it gets more intresting."
8748,good game
8749,"Portal 2, Firewatch, and this have one thing in common. They are all games that I love the puzzle mechanics as much as the story. I'll be honest, I haven't completed the game as my computer is less than the minimum requirements and that makes the puzzle I got stuck on harder, but the physics and controls to this game are well done. Very rarely, if ever, has something gone wrong that I entirely blamed on the game itself. If you are looking for a game that's relaxing, fun, and interesting, then I would recomend this game.

The only quirk is that when pulling yourself toward a wall, you can let go right before you hit to bounce off of that wall. This actually makes the game more fun, in my opinion, and you can travel great distances."
8750,yes yes uy4eexd
8751,"It ended sooner than I thought it would but it's enviroments left a lasting impression on me.

give it a try"
8752,Fun little game.
8753,"Really Fun game
Good story mode
Really Cheap
Good Designed"
8754,"The story is like something for toddlers, but the game is fun. It's rock climbing. I mean, it's not, but the concept is the same in that you're trying to get some place (using rocks) but you never really know where the next place to grab is going to be, though you'll fall and die if you don't find it. It's a constant leap of faith.

I got bored and found a cheat that let me fly and just watched through the last of it, but I still recommend for the price and because it delivers what it promises.
"
8755,Just a good platformer
8756,"Short but enjoyable game! The game itself is beautiful and relaxing to play whist you swing around the fantasy world taking in the view. Plenty of checkpoints for those tricky parts and once you complete it you can mess around in the time trials mode. Honestly the ¬£9.99 price tag can be justified by the experience you have while playing this, even still I'd recommend waiting around for a sale to avoid disappointment once you realise you just completed it in the same day."
8757,"Amazing game, great story, good graphics and overal a very relaxed feeling.
10/10 one of the best game stories."
8758,Is koo
8759,"The game is quite short and very linear. It's not a major issue, but the lack of challenge made it boring to me. The setting and short story are nice, the world looks good (characters less but who cares?). I guess time trial and challenges make the game funnier, but the base was too boring imho"
8760,"Lovely story, enjoyable and funny gameplay, and most especially and incredibly good level design. Of course, graphics aren't as good as they are in big EA's or Ubisoft's products, but the game stays quite beautifull and the world they created is awesome.

I'd enjoy some more, 3 hours isn't enough, I'd like to explore this world freely."
8761,"Short and sweet (I prefer shorter games).  The mechanics are fun, and it feels really satisfying when you get through a level just right.  Definitely worth the ¬£10."
8762,"A good mix of bionic commando, and spelunking with smurfs

I have really enjoyed the game so far. The atmosphere is cool, along with fun gameplay, and an original story.
The game controls are great with both kb&mouse, and gamepad (360pad tested).
Game visuals are nice, with support for ultra wide displays (tested at 2560x1080). 

If you want to try something a little different, give it a try."
8763,"Just listen to some music you've never listened to before and slip into a world of dreams, jumping around, while everything around you slowly fades away.

Maybe try playing this on drugs, IDK, but it may be worth a try."
8764,"I was looking for a game that was
- not that time consuming (because of the short time I have after work) but could be re-played if necessary
- had many check points but no quick save mode (makes it too easy)
- has some sort of 3D jump&run feeling, just like Portal (1 &2)
- has an interesting story

I found that one in ""A Story About My Uncle"" what starts rather boring due to the build-in tutorial goes into a very interesting adventure with beautiful landscapes.
I won't tell anything about the story as it would spoil the game. just this: it isn't epic or anything, but still deep enough to leave you with lingering thoughts after you finished the game.

Summary: a solid 8 / 10 for ~5 hours of game time if you bother to look for collectibles."
8765,"A short game with nice graphics and a sweet story (with good voice acting). The parkour and the grappling mechanics are very fun too.
If you're generous and interested then try it out but when it's on sale it's a must-buy ;) 
A very fun experience, even though it's quite short."
8766,"Wonderful parcour game, nice way of telling the story. Character models don't fit the rest of the graphics at all but I can overlook that due to the otherwise very well made and fluent gameplay. Maybe a bit short for the price, so you might want to wait for a sale."
8767,Well got dis game as a random steam game that I bought from eBay. Anyways the game is quite fun with loads of parkour. I tend to enjoy it
8768,"yes, you can still cry even if nothing particularly sad is happening. therapeutic."
8769,"Good game and very enjoyable to play I didn't expect this would be so good. It is simple mechanic but well executed, perfect balance between challenging obstacle and enjoyable progression. 
Fun! I can recommend this game without a doubt :)"
8770,"I love the developer, they made the sanctum series and goat simulator.
Graphics are really cool, the sound was amazing too.
The gameplay is really simple and feels like an evolution from the platformers, you go around timing jumps and letting your hook go to gain some momentum.

There where some parts where i wasn't able to collect some of the crystal energy so it was frustrating, and I feel like they aren't going to fix that.
Buy it on sale and increase your library.
6/10"
8771,my uncle died
8772,Its a very good and well designed game. i had fun playing it but I finished it very fast. Great game but you'll finish it very quickly.
8773,"What a fun game! Graphically it's not much and the voice acting is mediocre at best but the gameplay is solid and the story is interesting.
Bit short for the asking price, though. Grab it when it's 50% off or better and you won't be disappointed."
8774,"Shit, dont buy it"
8775,Best played while high #trippygraphics
8776,"Fun little game, though there's nothing special about the story line and it's not very difficult. Short playthrough. I would recommend this game on sale."
8777,"Although quite short, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this game. Madeleine and Fred are two very endearing characters. The ambience is superb and the grappling hook mechanics are extremely fun. Recommended for every fan of puzzle platformers."
8778,"Truly enjoyed this simple yet extremely fun game. It doesnt promise insane graphics or wild bloody storyline, but i just couldnt walk away from it. The pace for me was just right, and it was a joy exploring this mysterious land. It's usually pretty cheap online, so spend the 2 bucks and enjoy the ride."
8779,"This game feels like just a bedtime story when you play, but when the credits role and the closing sequence is over, it is almost like a touching adventure. The challenges were difficult but with enough pacience I could finish them without getting mad, and most things look great. Whether you play it because it's in your library or you play it for a new story, it is enjoyable. I'm glad this game exists."
8780,"A Story About My Uncle is what some might call a ""walking simulator"", As for me? It's more of a Grappling simulator, one with a surrealistic design and somewhat somber feel. While charming and and exciting on the outside, you could find profound messages about childhood nostalgia, religion, acceptance, loss and grief. While the game is quite short, it's mildly challenging, and the visuals are appealing as well, so if you're a speedrunner (there's a speedrun mode to the game) or just someone who appreciates beautiful vistas along with a simple yet charming story, this game's for you."
8781,"This game is a masterpiece. The storyline is very well written and also great acted, the story is pretty simple ( a dad telling a story to his daughter), but I really enjoyed the plot twist at the end.
Gameplay is great, just a bit lackluster at the end.

8/10
"
8782,"Despite the weird name this is a cute little game that goes well beyond the usual walking simulators, but may also get a bit obtuse and frustrating near the end. Avoid if you expect AAA production values as the voice acting and animations are janky as hell."
8783,"- fantastic graphic
- beautiful sound and music
- Easy to control and freely explore
- Feel good to play
Very Recommend if you want to enjoy the story with good graphic and sound.
Love since first play."
8784,One of the best non violent fps games we need more like this!
8785,"I thuroughly enjoyed this game. It's one of the first games that I've actually finished in a while. I was sad when I reached the end. It's not a terribly long game but its not short. If you like adventure games, climbing games, or grappeling games this is right on the money and adds a little extra in story."
8786,"I hate the ice caves I hate the ice caves I HATE the ice caves!

But aside from the final level, the game's pretty fun, though you tend to be pretty floaty in the air. If you like grappling and can get a hang of the controls, it's a pretty good game."
8787,A story nicely presented with nice game mechanics. It will rewarrd you
8788,This was my first game on steam and I really enjoyed it.
8789,"I've only just begun to play this game, so I'll probably update my review after, but let me tell you, first impression: AMAZING

The physics in this game are just fun. Literally on the edge of my seat trying to land maneuvers, it's fun and engaging.

A first person platformer with an energy-beam-grappling-hook + jump boost + dash boost = loads of fun.

The environment is pretty cool as well. All in all, pleasantly surprised!"
8790,"Is more jump simulator, jump, climb, jump, climb... boring."
8791,Fun and challenging game mechanics/puzzles. Nice story. I always recommend waiting for sales.
8792,Cant wait for the next one.
8793,"A first-person platformer with a whimsical, if minimalist, story."
8794,"Pros:
Nice art style of game, unique storytelling and a cool new mechanic of getting around. The grapple idea is nice, something new! Thought it'd be similar to Portal and it is, using things like momentum to push you between the different floating islands, which trigger lines of dialogue every so often

Cons:
Unless you are pretty good at platformers (which I can confess, I'm not great but I can usually get by on things like Portal and similar) the moving around takes about twenty times of dying and is frankly nearly impossible at points, more if you try to go for one achievement in particular. It is enjoyable at first and I'm playing for the storyline which I enjoy, but the actual gameplay has gone past enjoyment."
8795,"As much as I'd love to recommend this game, I just can't. The voice acting is horrible, the story is unengaging, and the gameplay mechanics do nothing for me. If you interested in failing the same section of a game over and over and over until by luck you manage to get through, go for it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend persisting for the sake of the story, because it's just dull and the ending is disappointing."
8796,"The graphics are nice and the gameplay pretty relaxing.
I really loved the story, finished it in one sitting. About the only con I have about this game is that it's too short. And I would say a bit expensive if you look at the 3-4 hours it takes to finish the story for 12,99.
Nevertheless I did really enjoy playing it. If you can get it on sale, I would totally recommend buying this game for a few hours of beautiful gameplay."
8797,"Got in on a sale, and it was well worth it. Intriguing story, and nice game mechanics.  Kinda reminded me of Portal/Half Life in a way.
Was a nice ride. 
Visuals are amazing, and there's a good vibe, kinda relaxing. 
Check some gameplay on youtube and see if it's your kind of game."
8798,"A beatiful game with a strange, yet interesting story that's fun for the whole family. There is constant narration to keep children entertained and engulfed in the adventure fantasy. The real highlight for experienced gamers is the fluidity and novelty of movement through the game. There really isn't much in the way of a challenge, though, except for the usual time trials. As it stands, the narration is bit cringy for adults to sit through and the ""adventure"" is spoon fed. The mechanics of the game were good enough to keep me entertained and happy to have made the purchase. I would love for this to be adapted into a puzzle-based adventure to take full advantage of the open-world gameplay with these movement mechanics."
8799,"A mello and fun casual that I think I can just pick up and play at anytime. I loved the atmosphere and the story was alright. 


It was a MASTERPIECE 0/10"
8800,"A University project that turned out to be a decent game. A first person platfomer whose gimmick is a tether/grapple. I enjoyed this simple game, you might too."
8801,"whether or not you like this game depends on how you feel about first-person platforming. i, for one, hate it. it's very awkward not knowing if you're gonna land, or if you're gonna be thrown/slide off due to either physics or glitches.

unfortunately, this game's controls and physics aren't tight enough to be fun, it's way more infuriating. for controls- you can't really gauge whether or not you'll be in range for a jump or a grapple until you're already on your way, which is poor design that leads to trial-and-error gameplay. for physics- quite a few times i would land on a slanted rock that would slide me off into the abyss.

the game advertises itself as a ""narrative-driven"" experience. however all you get is a janky in-game cutscene that lasts for 2-4 painfully slow minutes after each linear platforming section. and there are no trial or tribulations in this story. (minor spoilers) the story in ch 1 is the same as the end of ch 4 (of 5)- where is your uncle?

this game is more infuriating than fun, and i recommend skipping it. if you want a fun first-person platormer, i recommend clustertruck."
8802,i closed the game and it proceeded to stay on for several days
8803,"Get it, just get it. The platforming mechanics are incredibly fun and unique, and the story is very heartwarming. You can't go wrong with this game, I promise you will enjoy it."
8804,"If you are looking for a simple game, with a nice story and dreamy setting, try this one. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
8805,This game is both story rich fun gameplay.
8806,"My favorite type of indie game: One made with love and passion. 

This game reminds me of another indie game, Valley, except this game doesn't suck. It's part walking sim and part first-person platformer and both parts work well. On another note, the character models are very low quality, astonishingly low. The game is beautiful and has great vistas, but the characters look Playstation 2-era quality. The fire effects are also pretty poor quality; both of these things I never got used to as the contrast between the low-poly models and beautiful scenery is jarring.

But that's a small complaint as the rest of the game is great and is worth playing. Great movement, great story."
8807,Not enough content.
8808,"Was really fun for a short while, then i instantly got bored as it didn't offer any variety or anything after basic grappling hook and rocket boots. The story is very dull and uneventful. The animations are quite bad. I would not recommend getting this game."
8809,Cool anti-gravity type physics. Jumping and swinging around gets boring after a while though.
8810,"Solid 1st person platformer. Its super short, and the environments aren't that varied. There isn't much of a story. The platforming mechanics work most of the time, although every once in a while can be unintuitive and require repeated trials because it won't let you grapple something for no reason, or you can't tell how far you will be be flung forward. More variety in platforming, environments, mechanics, and longer game would have made it better, but still worth checking out. 

7.5/10"
8811,"The animations are bad, really bad.
The game is short and doesn't have a point.
The storyline is dull, nothing new nor interesting.
The graphics are nice, the textures seem smooth and pleasant due to new engine.
The levels designs are not as fluent as it should be, although it is not bad it could be better."
8812,"Easily one of the funnest games i've played this year!
The mechanics were straightforward, simple, yet still challenging without being stupidly or pointlessly difficult.
The story was a solid 8/10 and was on perfect pace with how you progressed through the world.
It was a solid mesh of cutscenes & gameplay to learn a story you were walking into.
The only I have against it is that it would probably have looked better if it was made more recently, but that's not the games fault - that's just me wanting a sequel!"
8813,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platforming, story game where you traverse vast areas using various jumping, boosting, and hookshot skills in an attempt to learn the location of your missing Uncle Fred.  The story is told as a bedtime story to your daughter which was interesting.  Honestly, the story was the only thing that kept me going because by the end of the game, I was frustrated and just wanted it to be over.  However, I still recommend because the gameplay, graphics, and experience was positive overall.

PROS

+ Vast, beautiful areas to explore and traverse
+ Frequent checkpoints help mitigate frustration of frequent deaths
+ Interesting story and gameworld kept me playing
+ Lots of hidden areas and items to find

CONS

- Vast areas often lead to disorientation and confusion
- Some jumps are extremely frustrating
- Voice acting is average
- Achievements are difficult and are for hard-core fans only
- By the end I just wanted to get it over with to see what happens"
8814,11/10
8815,".... this game is INSANE!!!  Insanely awesome!!  Little dialogue but the adventure keeps fascinating me.  The mechanics are interesting.  The ambience is superb!  The ideas, details, music... super inmersive! Great game!!"
8816,lol
8817,"Quite simply one of the funnest and most entertaining games I've ever played.  Such a fresh take on the genre, don't miss it.  You WILL enjoy this game."
8818,I enjoyed the sort of aftertaste this game provides. You have to understand I don't normally enjoy 3D platformers but this is a great game. I have found this game has extreme replayability and that completing Maddy's little challange was probably not worth the 25 minutes when I could have just ignored it. But if you want a fun replayability game get this I stuck it on my wishlist and waited for it to go on sale I got it for cheap. So go have fun :)
8819,"What a beautiful game. Great story and gameplay, even if somewhat short (3 hours will let you finish the game without a rush). Still recommended!"
8820,Great game to just chill with. Good story and nice gameplay.
8821,"wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
edit: I just 100%'d the game, which means find all collectable, all optional story items, complete every level with a limited number of grapple, complete every level without dying (ice cave alone took me 3.5 hours!), and get a gold time for each level's time trial (actually quite easy, besides sanctuary tt)"
8822,no
8823,"This game is short, but relaxing with a bedtime story sort of feel."
8824,"Awesome story game, fun to play, hard enough to use your brain, but not frustrating. Nice graphics and awesome idea at all. I just love this game and definitely recommend it to everyone who loves good and loveable story games."
8825,It made me dizzy to play this. The story was ok I guess.  would not recommend. There are way better games to play.
8826,frog people.
8827,"Amazing game.
Amazing story
Bit short, not really worth ¬£11 imo, but it's really fun very unique"

*(*(*(*(*(*(*("
8830,"this is a nice game - relaxing at times but really gets your grey cells going as you try to work out the route through the levels - but what kind of game is it? its a platformer and a walking simulator of sorts. The controls are excellent and work well. the graphics are ok for what it is the narration is ok and on occasions the vastness of the caverns you explore is impressive. What is fun about this game though is the grappling hook - jump swing and repeat - not really that much else to do - time it right - some of the jumps can be very difficult and took me over 20 attempts to make - but once i knew how to do it it was pretty easy next time - however after a while you will be doing cool jumps first time. some nice simple game mechanics used effectively. 
this game is very similar to the valley if you liked that then you might like this -"
8831,"Really amazing movement in this game, such a blast to play. I found the story intriguing but ultimately a bit underwhelming. The areas to explore are full of little things to find and really beautifully designed. I'm really looking forward to whatever Gone North Games has upcoming."
8832,"the game is good ill give it that 

the reason i make this negitive is this game is not user friendly...Why???

no marker for next location so if you cant find where to go you end up having to look it up

save points are poorly placed apart

it is also a game of luck

you will die alot so if you are bipolar or have no patience you will most likely not like this game

8833,breddy good

8835,"the graphics are really good and the story line is great i rate 9/10
sad that the story is short"
8836,A nice little first person platformer. Only minus is the heavily accented dialogue (Swedish developers).
8837,"This game is BEAUTIFUL. The gameplay is fun and it feels immersive enough to make you feel this sense of wonder and flight. The visuals are pretty stunning imo. The little perks you get later on from collectibles are a fun addition. Goat mode is hilarious. The storyline is simple enough yet effectively captures the feeling it seems to have set out to achieve. Dashes of welcome sentimentality abound. 

Sure, the NPCs are a bit lacking in their animation and the voice acting occassionally feels off, but this doesn't deter the game from being a pretty great one."
8838,"[h1]Summary[/h1]

A Story About My Uncle is a first person adventure where you control a boy searching for is uncle. You end up being transported into another world with a suit that makes you capable of traveling very large distances by jumping very high or far, or by using a grappling hook. If you ever felt like traveling in another world with these abilities this a game for you. Think of it as spider man simulator but instead of swinging with spider webs you get to be pulled with a grappling hook.

+ Nice scenery
+ Not many interruptions
+ Relaxing game that is easy to understand and play
- The maps could be more varied

[h1]Review[/h1]

The game starts off with you searching for your uncle but instead you find a suit that gives you super-human abilities and being transported to another world. You know this world is were your uncle is so your search continues. The suit gives you the ability to do a long jump, a high jump, swing with a grappling hook or boost. As you will quickly notice this world is composed of platforms so having the suit ended up being very convenient.

The controls are easy to understand and master. Jumping is like being a low gravity planet and grappling is just pointing and clicking. Of course the game doesn't make the task to go to point A to point B easy. You will have to master the art calculating your jump and especially of swinging like sort of like spider man (technically you don't really swing with the grappling hook, you're just pulled). Thankfully you never lose in this game. If you fall the game resets to a save point. In fact you don't really have to think much in this game. It's very relaxing. You may end up bumping into rocks or being lost but the game is generally easy. Just remember this game is mostly linear. The correct path is almost always forward. You just have to figure out were you can grapple and land.

There was a clear investment in the scenery. The maps are very well designed and presented. You will eventually find items your uncle left around and intelligent creatures. All of this is part of the atmosphere of the game and doesn't interrupt you much from game play. You just talk a bit, make some comments about something you found and carry on. Basically the game is designed for you to perfect your aerial traveling skills while enjoying the atmosphere. One issue I had with this game is that most of the time you are in dark places and that makes you feel like you're always in caves. An open light place would be nice for a change. Just my personal opinion.

In conclusion, this a game with a simple story, simple game play and nice atmosphere. If you just want to travel with a grappling hook in an beautiful alternative world without thinking much this is a game for you."
8839,What an awesome nice game and mechanics pretty cool story! What else can i say about it!? its just AWESOME... Worth The Price...
8840,good game
8841,Amazing. It's short and sweet. You can play it in a day. The story is engaging from beginning to end and is told in such a creative way. The game resolves itself wonderfully. The artists who made this have amazing imaginations. Highly reccommend.
8842,"What an oddly delightful platformer. Runs well, never wavers. 

Story is nice, childish as in it's literally a bedtime story, but nice. 

Styled graphics look clean and never get boring 

Not too difficult but definetly not too easy

I'd say the only weakness this game has is sometimes you can get lost on where to go, but it's not too hard to find the main path after just looking around for a minute"
8843,"The gameplay itself was amazing and so relaxing, but the checkpoints were the bigest pain in the ass. I reccomend this although the gameplay is a bit short."

[b] Review [/b]
A Story About My Uncle is a parkour, grappling hook, platformer game. I found the story to be mysterious, and the art style to be one of my favorite. The voice acting wasn't anything amazing, but it wasn't terrible. It's definitely one of the games you have to pretend you are in the shoes of the main character. This game is pretty easy for the most part, but there are some tricky spots. I really enjoyed this game, but I do believe that it is overpriced. I would recommend this game to people that have a good imagination, and I would recommend this game when it's on sale.

8845,good game but so short
8846,A bit hard in places but overall was great. was kinda hard to figure out where to go in the ice caves but was a good challenge. the end was good
8847,"Wonderful game! 
Crazy good controls (i played with mouse and keyboard - i don't think you could do it with a controller) and movement. A reductive summary would be that it is like an indie version of Portal - but that would probably be selling it too short. 
I could understand the gripes - 3 hr campaign, minimalist environment... but the length is spot on - you rarely do the same thing twice. And the environment really plays to the mechanics, giving you ample opportunity to explore and investigate, though with a relatively clear pathway to progress."
8848,"A game that will entertain you for a couple of hours if you like puzzles. 

Story was interesting. 
Design amazing. 
Time flew as I played this.

Only did not like that I could not zoom out.

9,5/10"
8849,"This is a puzzle platformer, and its ok.  5/10 neat story and characters, but nothing special in the gameplay."
8850,"I like, very good, yes."
8851,its an awsome game... i completed the game in one hour. i think it is a wast of money . but i mean its an awsome game. it has a cool story but i dont recommend it because you can comeplete it in less than an hour if you try. ( my best score was 43 minutes)
8852,A great game
8853,"It took me 2 hours to play it.
It's just jumping around, listen to a voice and look at the level.
10/10 would buy again.
Great game!"
8854,"This gave me feels
10/10"
8855,"An amazing game! The gameplay was perfect, soundtrack was good, level deseign was breath taking, and the story telling was good.

Hard to beleive this is an indie game.
10/10 !
"
8856,This game was very fun the story was nice and the controller where fluent if you have not plaid this game I definitley recomend getting it whenever it comes on sale I only wished it was a bit longer.
8857,"Let me start off by saying that there is a lot that this game could use work on. The voice acting isn't amazing and neither are the animations. There are some reeeeaaaallllyy frusterating parts of the game that could have used more checkpoints and other parts that could have been made a little bit clearer as to where you were supposed to be going. But putting all of that aside, the story is good and the mechanics work pretty well. The grapling mechanic is smooth. Overall the game is fun to play so I would definitley reccomend it."
8858,"ASAMU is a short and fun adventure. The various movement mechanics make platforming fun and leaves you with plenty of options to get through an area. Since moving around in itself if pretty fun and checkpoints appear often (until late game) redoing an area a few times isn't frustrating. The characters are likable, but it's hard to get invested with how short the game is. The narrator's voice acting can be rough, but it's always understandable. I played using a controller and found it sluggish and imprecise when it came to they more challenging areas, so I would reccomend using mouse and keyboard.

ASAMU is definately worth picking up especially during a sale. The main campaign is fairly short but there are plenty of collectables and achievements easily missed if you want to add play time."
8859,"Goed spel maar we kort zo uit gespeelt maar is het wel waard 
"
8860,"[h1]cute game with a nice artstyle[/h1]

the story transmits a fairy tale feeling, colorful and childish
the gameplay isnt always challenging but fun and innovative

all in all a good game :D"
8861,"Really nice game and one that I would recommend to all of my friends.  Graphics are absolutely amazing and when combined with motion blur and good physics make this game feel real.  The achievements are so perfectly designed that replayability is great, especially since once you've finished it once it's much easier.  Gameplay is exciting and fast-paced or relaxing and scenic, whichever way you prefer to play it.  The game is definitely meant to be ""family-friendly"" and does so at the cost of some kind of cringe-worthy scenes, but overall the gameplay completely drowns that out.  One of the very best non-violent games I have ever played.  I got it for sale and would have bought it for full price."
8862,"It only takes 2 hours to beat but it's enjoyable for the most part entirely because the momentum and joy to be had from the platforming mechanics are so prevalent and tight. 

The people recommending for the story must be brain dead; it's mediocre as hell. The voice acting is passable but lines carry no emotion at all, not that good voice acting would change the poorly written script. It's not offensive and mostly non obtrusive, but it would have been a better game without it. 

The score is subtle but overall good. The art direction is the other stand out aspect due to the use of lighting and range. You get a real sense of grandeur from the environments and it makes up most of the atmosphere and does what the story doesn't in setting tone.

Overall I'd recommend it. It's a solid, above average game, but I can't help but feel it could have been something great like Portal if the script was handled better."
8863,Grappling hook and blue people
8864,"Relaxing game, nice surroundings and smooth gameplay. Story is good too. For me it is 9/10."
8865,"Pretty enjoyable game.
Lack of checkpoints was frustrating at times but I still managed to complete it, so it's manageable.

"
8866,"A Story About My Uncle is a pretty good game. I recommend buying it, but wait until it is on sale. Just like any game, there are pros and cons. Let's start with the cons.
Cons:
1. The game is rather short. I beat it in around 2 hours (just shy of 2 hours). 
2. Some of the dialogue is a bit rough, but not much of it.
3. There are some bugs, and sometimes if you land on something the devs didn't think you would jump on, you can fall through or get stuck. Also, there are a couple invisible walls that you might run into if you jump in the wrong spot (meaning you didn't go where you were supposed to go and you may get stuck or fall).
4. The controls were sometimes (very rarely) broken.

Pros:
1. The story is pretty good. It's no Portal 2, but it has a fun story that I found myself engrossed in. 
2. The game mechanics of the grapple and the jumping are very smooth 99% of the time. It was extremely enjoyable to jump from platform to platform while swinging from floating rocks.
3. The art style felt old, but in a good way. It reminded me of playing a classic playstation game from my childhood. I don't know if this was the intention, but I loved the nostalgia. 
4. The music was perfect for the environment.
5. Each level environment was fun to explore and soar through.
and finally, 6. Though the game had a short run time, I can definitely see myself replaying this game over and over."
8867,"Overall, a fairly enjoyable experience that is well worth the price when it goes on sale (which is often). 
Enjoyable platforming with tight controls and a short enough timeframe with enough innovations per level so that it doesn't get boring (except for one level at the end). The story is fairly simple with parts of it being surprisngly touching, and a nice ending. The music is ok, a bit generic but the weakest parts of the game are definitely the visuals and the voice acting."
8868,"This is one of my top games ever its just a nice short fun game, the only down side I see is that it is so pretty short and theres no sequel so once u get sucked into the story ur fucked when it ends
"
8869,A very enjoyable atmospheric adventure game with beautiful graphics and a fun storyline!
8870,"The game has great atmosphere and soundtracks but that's all. Weak story, not good enough gameplay and repetitive maps. To finish it you're gonna restart from more than +50 last checkpoint. It shouldn't have been that hard. Extremely absurd, weak, short story. Also doesn't make any sense 

Gameplay: 6/10
Graphics: 9/10
Soundtracks: 9/10
Atmosphere: 10/10
Story: 0/10

Just play for the gameplay, don't expect anything.
It takes 3 hours to finish"
8871,"Cool, but a little too short."
8872,Great but short game with stunning visuals.  Definitly worth picking up.
8873,"This game is ok‚Ä¶
It shines in its gameplay and is great for a couple of bucks.
The story is bland and predictable. The characters have no dimension and are not likable.
The graphics are fine but could be better and I know its an Indie game but i've seen Indies with superior graphics.
Its an excellent 3d plateformers but is too short but is replayable. I really like the artstyle and it can differenciate from other games. The world is great and goes well with the artstyle and th universe.
Overall I like this game but would recommend it only on sale,"
8874,"The first time I saw this game was when it was in early development via a Youtube video.  The second I laid eyes on the graphics and the movement system, I knew that this would be a nice game.  The story is rather unique, albeit a little short.  The voice acting isn't what I was used to, but it didn't really bother me.  It kept with the story.  The only problem I had with this game were, one:  The ending wasn't exactly what I expected.  (I guess that's my inner fiction writer coming out.)  Plus, I felt like this was rather enjoyable, even in the first segment, simply because of the number of easter-eggs they hid around the house.  All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10, just because of the story and gameplay being really nice.  Though like I said before, the voice-acting isn't the best."
8875,Fun game with cool mechanics and beautiful environment.
8876,"Beautiful story, great gameplay. It was definitely short but then again the story made up for it. Quality stuff mate."
8877,"TL;DR - 8/10 (great atmosphere, amazing narration, gameplay is top for a platformer, even the achievements are worth fighting for like a personal skill check but the ending is just not fulfilling at all)

""A Story About My Uncle"" is a beautiful adventure through an unknown world, a journey of search, it's very cool and amazingly well done. The platforming aspects are challenging yet doable, there are a lot of shortcuts and secrets to discover and if you die it's just your own fault because you were simply bad at aiming or too slow. Some jumping puzzles are really challenging and the achievements make it worth replaying to test your own skills again.

In terms of the story, everything works so well and is told in a beautiful way, all the characters you meet fulfill the necessary requirements to help you, even though they can be a bit dull. However, the hugest letdown was the ending where I just felt like everything I did was just for nothing. Ofc you got the experience to share and the fairytale-esque character to it but still it's just like ""kay you've reached the end, here have a cookie"". It was a huuuuuge disappointment to me.
Up until that point however it's great and in total definitely worth it's price even though it's just a couple of hours for a full playthrough.
But, as I said, the replay-factor in terms of skill is there if you take a look at the achievements. Some of them are really challenging and fun to tackle."
8878,"Good game, nice to complete over a few hours. Story isn't amazing however some of the levels are quite pretty. Well worth picking up on steam sale"
8879,"TL:DR The unintsallation process was more gripping than the story.

The gameplay and graphics are pretty well done for a game like this. However, the story was rather boring and at the end I feel I didnt accomplish anything. I say I because I assume the game tries to put you in the narrator's place. Not much of why the things the way they are in the game is explained either.

5/10, good gameplay and decent graphics, weak story"
8880,"Got this game for a few cents. Definitely worth it. Then sense of achievement when making successful grapples and jumps adds to the ""thrill factor"".

Pros:
- Amazing scenery
- Zen type of platformer
- Can be challenging but not too much 

Cons:
-Some of the character models were ""meh""

BUY IT AT A DISCOUNT OR IF IN A BUNDLE"

8882,"amazing game to help yourself relax and has a great storyline aswell
i have now finished the game in 3 hours and it is amazing"
8883,short gameplay will take around 2 hours dont buy this when 14$ get when its on sale and this game is an absolute blast
8884,game is fun
8885,"Very linear, fun little game. Also g-rated, so it feels like a children's story, but I wouldn't buy this for your kids if they're under 12, and I'd say most kids 13 and older probably wouldn't enjoy the story. Gameplay can be pretty difficult even for an adult. Very wholesome story, which is a nice break from the constant dark, bloody themes in most AAA games today. Also pretty short. I beat the entire game in just under 4 hours. I doubt I would play it again, there isn't much to do after you complete the story. I enjoyed this little gem, however little it is, I recommend buying this game on sale since completion is just so short. Only complaint is the voice acting, seems just a bit lackluster. 8/10."
8886,"Worth $12 Maybe...... On  sale for $3.24, its a steal. Cool platformer, seen videos of it but it was as background play and they never sited the game. The controls and physics are a bit diffrent then i thought they would be, which wasnt a bad thing. I was expecting really faced past movement that this game didnt reach but was satifiying. Like i said, pick it up while its on sale. I beat it in less than 3 hours. Still havemt done time trial or played the levels again to search for the machine things to get the unlockables. Highly recommend while its on sale."
8887,"Waste of time, jumping around with my uncle boots simulator.doesnt have a story but just some weird blue dwarfs."
8888,The only platformer where I actually enjoyed the platforming
8889,It's short but it's one of those games that are so good you can replay it over and over again
8890,"This game made me cry... The game was challenging, specially in the last two areas. The music was alright, the characters... They were good, except that I would've loved to know more about them aside from the main character and the uncle. The ending really got me, it was something beautiful. If I were to recomend a quick, cheap, and short game. It would be this one. I give it a 9.5/10. :)"
8891,A decent little adventure. A very short game - I managed to complete it in just under 3 hours. Worth playing if you can pick up on sale.
8892,"I to have a story about my uncle, I'll start from the beginning. He was a short man and suffered short man syndrome and he wore shoes that had extra high soles to increase his height. Trouble was the sole was never high enough, he was always chasing more shoe height.

 He had reached the limit for off the shelf height increasing shoes at 5.5 inches, so he decided to make his own and was going all out with a full 10-inch lift, which would make him the grand height of 5'6"". He worked day and night on these shoes and finally the day arrived that the 10-inch shoes were finished.

 He put them on, shaky at first, it was hard to get used to the extra height. But soon he had mastered them and he strutted around town at the grand height of 5'6"" and finally he felt like a man.

 He felt so good he noticed that he had become aroused and realized it was the shoes that were turning him on. He found a public toilet with a free cubicle, just when he was about to relieve himself of the now fully erect 3 inches of arousal. Which surprised him as 2 inches was all he could muster before the 10 inch shoes, his ankle twisted under him. 

 He then collapsed and hit his head on the side of the toilet bowl, now unconscious his head splashed into the bowl where he drowned.

 When they found him they said that the toilet he had died in had not been working for weeks and had been full of faeces.

The moral of the story is if you're a short man always find a cubicle with a working toilet."
8893,"Short and sweet; takes one or 2 very good mechanics and elevates them to an art form. One of the few games that makes me flinch as I miss a ledge or an icicle drops towards me... Don't expect a huge amount of story, but expect wonderful, imaginative landscapes and around 3 hours of (only occasionaly frustrating) jumping, swinging and gliding."
8894,Good game but I find it deeply annoying in it's controls. Missing jumps or clicks is kind of infuriating to an extent.
8895,"Movement mechanics are extremely fun when they work, but finicky. Losing all forward momentum after a certain point when you fall instead of arcing is also not great. 

Still, game was enjoyable and got it on sale."
8896,"A story about my uncle is a relaxing platforming game, offering the player a very decent story taking into account the length of the game. The views in the game are stunning, and you'll often find yourself looking around and absorbing the sights around you. The game is family friendly and is very atmospheric, offering cool gear with powers that make you wish you had them in real life as well. A minor complaint is that it glitches sometimes, making me re-do a stage or a certain section of a stage. Therefore, my rating for this game is 9/10."
8897,"The game is immersive, beautifull and controls are great.

however the game story is pretty small."
8898,soft
8899,"The only part of this game that is good is the nice backgrounds, which are really really well done. 
Voice acting sucks, story is terrible, and the mechanics are wonky. (Do the same action twice but get different results.)
Overall, game is really tedious and boring after a short while. Only play if you only want a speedrun/parkour like game."
8900,"In short, FPS platformer with many jumping actions. Could be frustrating in some areas since it requires precise timings to chain your hooks and boost.

This Uncle game is rather on the short side, two hours maybe with some annoying achievements I didn't bother to earn. Story is forgettable, but I can be spiderman jumping around with my lightning web and booster so it's worth it.

I doubt I'd ever replay the game, although it has time trial and some achievements for challenges, though.

And oh, motion sickness-inducing game.

Still recommended game when you're bored. 6.5/10"
8901,Great game!
8902,"A charming little game with awesome mechanics, great atmosphere, stunning visuals/artstyle and a tight narrative, this one has it all. Not very long but long enough to stay fresh and challenging throughout. I enjoyed this experience very much! 
"
8903,"Lovely experience with very pleasant exploration. Moving around was surprisingly fun with the powers you're given.

A fun experience for sure."
8904,This So Hard
8905,"Its a nice game, but its overpriced for playtime."
8906,"I picked up this game on sale because it looked interesting. 

Things I liked...
It tells a nice little story.
The environments are very imaginative and kind of fun to explore. 
The game mechanics are interesting as a kind of first person jumping puzzle.
The narrator was good and didn't annoy me.
There are plenty of checkpoints so if you jump and fall, you don't have to suffer too much and the game is pretty forgiving of your falls making for a nice, casual single player experience.

Things that I didn't care for as much...
Occasional glitchiness in the game's mechanics. (i.e. the indicator not registering a grappling surface you're right next to... sometimes you land on a surface but it still registers you as in the air and you pretty much have to jump off the ledge and die) They don't happen all the time, but they are a little more frequent if you go spelunking off the main path.

Maddie. I'm sure the voice actress is a wonderful person, but I could not stand Maddie in this game. From her character traits to her voice, everything about her bugged me. And what's worse, you have to carry her around for about half the game. Occasionally I jumped off the ledge, just because taking her with me brought me so much satisfaction.

The look of the frog people. I like the idea of the frog people, I didn't care for the actualization of the frog people. I just think they could have used a little more work to make their villages look more dynamic.

OVERALL
The game is ok. It tells a nice little story. The game mechanics and exploring the world is kind of interesting. The environments and story are imaginative, but there are a few irritating elements and it's not a must play in my book.

Is the game bad? No.
Is it something I would want to play again? Not really.
Do I feel like I wasted my time? No. Like I said, it's an ok casual first person jumping puzzle experience.
I'd definitely recommend picking it up on sale. Don't know about full price though.

6/0 - Nice little jumping puzzle game. Tells a nice little story. Some thigns that annoyed me but not enough to make me give it a bad review.

"
8907,I'm stuck
8908,"I fell into a coma of boringness while playing this game
"
8909,"TL;DR: Buy the game.

This game is sort of a hidden gem in my opinion. It can be your casual game, where you follow the original story and just play along. Even that would be good enough, but it is nothing compared to if you decide to go for the achievements. That makes the game quite hard, so you will not feel like you are wasting time replaying the story, because now you will be focusing on new things and will be seeing the game from a totally different perspective.

10/10 would goat mode again"
8910,"There is a lot to criticize about this game: terrible voice acting, stiff NPC animations, and sometimes frustrating difficulty spikes. That being said, the environments are quite pretty, the story is simple but endearing, and the world is interesting. But the main thing is the movement mechanics, and they are a lot of fun. You will have to replay certain sections several times, but the reload is immediate and the checkpoints are reasonable. I did get frustrated in a couple of spots where the level design seemed more about luck than skill. But when you nail it, the sensation of momentum is thrilling. It's not long and it's only frustrating in a couple of spots, so I definitely recommend it if you enjoy first-person platformers."
8911,"
Honestly its a great game! I would recommend picking it up!

However what I would encourage is playing this game and completing it in around 2 hours so you can refund it afterwards. But only do this this you're not a perfectionist! This game has limited replay ability and the replay aspect of it didn't interest me at all! This was a great game but ¬£10 for ~2 hours of entertainment didn't sound worth it to me!

I would 100% recommend this game when its on sale but if its full price I would recommend trying to push for that refund.
"
8912,"I'm gonna say one thing and that's 'I don't like Maddy.' Sorry...but...I didn't find her cute in the slightest, I found her irritating and two dimensional. Also felt a little bit like it was less opinion but made out to be fact and being pushed on me several times, which irked me. Maybe that's just a personal thing though.

Anyway...

Let me start by saying that visually, this game is beautiful, and it's well optimized. The soundtrack is great, the controls are tight, and the grappling/jumping is fun and feels...correct. Well balanced.

I can see why others like the story, and I enjoyed the attention to detail initially looking at things like Fred's house and the village, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's a repetetive design. This was a minor niggle, actually the thing is, I didn't find the story that entertaining. It just felt..bland...
I enjoyed the storytelling aspect as you play! What I didn't enjoy was the weird way the narrative reads, like the guy has a rhythm that's just...slightly off. I couldn't say precisely why, but you may pick up on it as you play. Maybe it's more noticeable to some people.

When I picked this game up, I thought it was - due to the positive reviews - meant to be relaxing. I didn't find it to be relaxing, but this is mostly due the physics and the exceptionally linear gameplay. I wanted to explore more and know more about the place, and instead I found myself bouncing off walls or going way faster than anticipated a lot, and once or twice even flinging myself through the scenery completely at random. That might just be my uncanny knack of finding bugs or falling through floors but idk...generally the repeated clipping an edge slightly and flying into god-knows-where put me off. I also don't think it really has any replayability.

But, for a short game, it's well executed and fun - if you don't mind flying. A lot."
8913,"I guess this is a cool little game and a cool concept but it becomes boring very fast.
I only recommend this game if u get it cheap!"
8914,"This game has unique gameplay and an equally unique story. Though that is really about all there is. The gameplay is unique but also extremely limited in function. The story is unique but also extremely limited in scope. When playing, one does not really become very involved with the narrative or the environments. It took me about two hours to beat the game, so it is very short. Overall I cannot recommend this, not even for the low price point."
8915,they should add a noose grapple
8916,"Love this game, need more tho shit is like drugs 10/10"
8917,"A fun game, however i would only recommend you get this game on sale. Deep sale. i beat this game in about less than 3 hours. a rather lighthearted story, the gameplay is very easy to jump into, don't expected a hard game, maybe a bunch of difficulty spikes here and there, if it was longer maybe i'd recommend buying at full price, but for now... not really"
8918,"This has some fun gameplay and is artistically gorgeous. The gameplay starts to be problematic though. Even if you like first person jumping challenges, brace yourself for some rage.
The story is ok, sort of  the Twilight Zone meets Fraggle Rock. The story aspects of the game could have been better, but that wasn't my real problem. I didn't mind needing to account for momentum, the physics seemed fine. But then you add the level difficulty spiking and the registering of the grapple feeling inconsistent and you have a recipe for frustration. The devs seem like they knew what they were doing so it seemed almost sadistic that one second I felt like electric-whip-Spiderman and the next I felt electric-whip-JoeBeerbelly-guy. There should be a range of difficulties, but there is not.  The soothing music and the stunning visuals help, but I decided to avoid a heart attack and watch the end on YouTube.  I think if you like SEUM speedrunners you'll probably like this even though it has a more kiddish flavor to it. Despite it's flaws I still recommend this game because it is fun for a while and the level design is on my short list of prettiest ever. Just get it on sale or in a bundle."
8919,Short and Sweet is the best way I would describe this game.
8920,"Relaxing parkour game and great story. Very short though, i did finish they game after roughly 4 hours."
8921,"A short, sweet physics platformer. You can tell the developers put heart into making it."
8922,"It's a fun platformer /adventure game. The mechanics you see in the trailer / images are fun to play. People say the game is short, but in truth, if it would be longer it would become boring. 6.5/10

Thanks for supporting Linux."
8923,Great game!
8924,"wayyy too short, great graphics, and a pretty solid story.

"
8925,"Short, but fun game with a unique storyline :)"
8926,This good
8927,"It was a dull adventure, but playable."
8928,"One of the better platformers I've played in a long time.  You get a few upgrades over time to help with mobility.  There are no enemies you need to worry about(well, one for a few minutes but you don't fight it).

The story isn't great but the setting is pretty neat.

Gameplay is satisfying.  Not too easy and not too difficult for the most part - a few places near the end are a bit frustrating.  There are generally easy sections after a very difficult one and checkpoints are normally in a good location."
8929,Good ''Adventure'' guys :)
8930,"Pleasant game, buy it if you like relaxant games."
8931,scew fred he gave me 10 concussion
8932,"So far, I am very impressed with the voice acting, the physics system, the movement options, and the overall quality of the game.  I'm glad I picked this up."
8933,"A very short game about your main character telling a story from when he was a child and he went to find his Uncle. It has some deep story-telling subtones about enjoying life and finding your own adventure in the world. It is a beautiful short game with some added time trials if you want more of A Story About My Uncle. A beautiful game that is a must play, so pick it up on sale if you are skeptical about the amount of play time for the price.

The gameplay consists of mainly platforming with a grapple hook like beam, some super jumping and sprinting and later you get rocket boots that launch you mid-air in whatever direction you face. It is a beautiful game with great scenery and is fun and relaxing."
8934,"I've been meaning to play this game since about a year ago when I played a few minutes on my friend's PC. I'm glad I finally got around to it. It was a short and sweet experience. It has a magical charm and sense of wonder that creates a good bedtime-story vibe. The gameplay and mechanics are fun and the spaces the player explores are beautiful. At one point you lose an ability which felt like a lazy attempt to increase the difficulty or spice it up. The voice acting is mostly good; occasionally a few of the voices sound unnatural. I liked how the narrator responds to NPCs; it reminded me that this is a story he's telling. 

It's a great little game, and I'll continue to play it to find all the collectibles and to return to the enjoyable gameplay and beautiful environment."
8935,"I am always on the lookout for unique games. Games that push past the AAA developed titles and try to forge a unique path. This is a really good game. I takes a narrative direction which is great and combines it with a very fluid set of tools to let you traverse the world. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a single player game that has good gameplay. The story is eh, but the way you get to swing around with your grapple hook more than makes up for it. 

cheers!
"
8936,"This is a story about a laser grappling hook.
This is a story about caves and the sky.
This is a story about creepy blue frog people.
This is a story about teenage rebellion.
This is a story about the spirit of exploration.
This is: A Story About Some Dude's Uncle."
8937,no very long but great mechanics and atmosphere definately worth it
8938,10/10 the uncle looks like that guy that pretends to be a dad at a playground
8939,"This is a good game. With good story, beautiful world and challenging gameplay (for me, that's challenging). The story is short but impressive, worth to give it a try."
8940,"From the very first frames, A Story About My Uncle makes it clear: in the local script there will be no heart-rending drama or a confusing detective story. Instead, it‚Äôs a childishly naive adventure in a beautiful, but not always logical, fairy-tale world. A tale that a father tells his child before bedtime."
8941,1 hour into the game my balls hurt from heights and it's obvious uncle Fred has Frog Fetish
8942,Pretty nice game to try out. Chilling and challenging at the same time. Worth buying for like 2 euros.
8943,"Great story, short game. Get it while it's on sale."
8944,"I waffled back and forth on weather to recomend this, but at the end of the day it's just a little insubstantial. The gameplay is solid. First-person grappling hook based platforming, which is fun, and the art direction is top notch. 

Unfortinately, where this game falls down is story. It's incredibly straight forward and told through some of the flattest  narration and voice work I have heard. The main offender is the narrator, who sounds bored and out of the moment. 

There may be more to the story if you go plundering for interactable objects, but there wasn't anything about this world that made me want to linger longer than to get to the end credits. The game IS short though, so on a sale it may be worth picking up just to give the grapling mechanics a whirl."
8945,"Probably one of the best platoformers I've played in a long time. Really takes me back to some of my first games I've ever played, like Spyro or Super Mario 64. If your into platformers I totally recommend this. However I should warn anyone who wants to buy this game wait for it to go on sale as it's pretty short story wise, about only 2 hours if your good at it, lol."
8946,Lots of fun! Relatively easy to finish but had a good story and interesting gameplay
8947,"A fun parkour game, able to be beaten within an evening. Not much replay value as it is strictly linear, but there is a time trial mode if you enjoy speedrunning. Controls are a bit floaty in the air though with no airstrafing outside of items used."
8948,"Unenjoyable ""jumping"" game with an annoying narrator."
8949,short but good
8950,NICE STORY the game is awesome but if it would be for lower specs it would be awesome
8951,"Would recommend(Have recommended matter of fact)
10/10 Graphics/Visuals; It's got a rad atmosphere to it.
10/10 Soundtracks
10/10 Storyline

If you're lookin' for fun single-player, story driven, atmospheric, Indie games, this right here is one of 'em."
8952,"1st Time i saw this look awesome, while im playing still awesome (not really bad).
But I Think after in Ice Cave , i meet my Dead End , So Hard even already Try many times.
No Tips etc in this game, u should do with ur own brain looking the right path to jump.

Playing this make me feel wonderfull sometime with the panorama view
but also make me dizzy cz' too much thinking. Hard to control."
8953,Great game! Must have if you are a fan of the platforming genre.
8954,"its just jeff. This game is peacefull and very relaxing. Playing it after a cancerous LoL, CS or PUBG match is the best."
8955,Short but awesome.
8956,"This game was short, but so terribly charming.  it was moving and sweet.  I haven't felt this way in a long time.  I heartily recommend this experience to anyone.


It made my hear warm."
8957,"Definitely a game to play for the atmosphere and story, because both are A+. The grappling mechanics are smooth and feel weighty, which makes for a great experience - really feels like you're a person flying through the air!

A few sections (especially in the Ice Caves) could have used more frequent checkpoints - they got a bit frustrating to play through, although that could also have been because I'm not a particularly accomplished player.

I definitely went into the story expecting something a bit more dramatic, but I was pleasantly surprised by what I did get. The slow, thoughtful tone made for a really great game."
8958,I feel like the game would only last half the time if I didn't do Maggie's challenge...
8959,"I like the storyline, and it's pretty fun."
8960,"Very fun little adventure game set in a wonderfully fantastical setting.  From dark caves to floating islands, this game paints a beautiful picture."
8961,"A Story About My Uncle is an innocent and touching exploration and 3D platforming game, with the moving storytelling of a dad that tells her daughter a bedtime story. We immerse in the younger self of the protagonist as he follows the trail of his Uncle Fred and discovers a mysterious whole new world.

With fun gameplay, plenty of achievements and challenges (some of them quite hard), and good replay value, ASAMU is a title worthy of it's price."
8962,Amazing Parkour game with a short yet interesting story. I'd recommend this game for everyone who's into the Parkour Genre!
8963,Rip Leafy's Channel
8964,"First off, this game is beautiful. I can honestly say that the graphics have bested any game that I have played to date, but as most people know, it's not the graphics that make the game, but the gameplay.

The story in this game is, in my eyes, touching. You won't find any crazy plot twists in the game, but the narrative viewpoint of a Father telling his daughter a story is wonderful, and while it has been done many times before, I feel like this game has done it in a unique and artistic way that adds depth and character to the game. Many will disagree, but I for one got completely engaged in the story from start to finish.

The gameplay in this game is good, not great, but good. The grappling hook type device you have combined with rocket boots and a superjump make this game really enjoyable in both a casual and competetive way. For example, you can just sit back and watch as you float effortlessly across skies filled with stars, or go completely hardcore and speedrun the game. On the other hand, the gameplay can get a little repetetive further along in the game, but it was the scrutinizingly detailed landscapes and immersive story that kept me coming back. I feel like this is more of a piece of art than a game, which in my opinion is a good thing, and I did purchase it in the summer sale, but I would pay full price for it any day. 8.5/10."
8965,"9/10

"
8966,"Lovely game. Narrated by a father telling a story ... about his uncle... to huis daughter, the narration works really well as does the world they created in general. Music is nice too.

The plateform part is also very well done, you progressively gain new capacities renewing the challenge of the stages will keeping it simple and intuitive. The controls are a charm which i would consider essential in a plateformer. The sensation of freedom of movement the special suit is supposed to give is very well translated.
The difficulty is very well managed from very easy and really leaving you the space to explore what you can do to actually pretty challenging parts towards the end.

Nothing to say about the lenght, it's right, i would have wanted more but it is very honest and coherent as is. Maybe create a community map editore like portal ? :) Please ?

Overall i can clearly recommand it if you're looking for a nice fps plateformer with very relaxing part without a dumbed out difficulty, everything in a moving narration."
8967,"awosome gameplay and engine, realy disapoiinted from the length though
still a great game with a ton of replayability
"
8968,"One of my favorite Games! The game play is fun, its a beautiful game and the story line is amazing!
It gets a 10/10 from me. I highly suggest this game to people of all ages!
<3"
8969,"The platforming is good, although it suffers a little from being first person (as it makes it harder to sometimes know if you'll hit a boulder or just glide by it). At the same time, it's a bit unforgiving, some jumps you miss because you jumped slightly too early and you see the next platform just pass at arm‚Äôs reach, which is frustrating. The powered running jump can be tricky sometimes, as being first person you will sometimes run out of ground beneath you before jumping, resulting in you plummeting to death. I believe the game would benefit from a different respawn mechanic, as right now it kind of breaks the ambient just falling with a frog on your back silently judging her life options. Something like a last-ditch safety measure of the suit that would automatically make the jump to the previous platform, activated by the checkpoints (which could be beacons for that mechanism or simply tethering points for a rope). In terms of exploration it could also benefit from such a beacon system and a map - in levels where you want to explore you could fast travel between those beacons, for instance. It also needs some 'unstucking' mechanic, as right now you can become imprisoned between some rocks and buildings in one of the floating villages where you are unable to jump and stuck between some ice platforms, eternally falling. All in all, the story is not the strongest point, probably by the bleakness of the places you visit. There‚Äôs little lore to the world, few characters even acknowledge your presence in a world where you are a complete alien. It‚Äôs like a Martian coming down to earth in power armour jumping around all over the place and everyone just keeps on with their lives and ignore him, it breaks the illusion. There are a couple of youtube links right in the beginning that could be used to further explore the world (like video logs from his uncle providing tutorial info or his findings) but are simply links to jokes. It would be fun if some of those where given in the strange alphabet you find latter on, maybe giving clues to what happened to the frog people and your uncle. It seems it was well made in terms of programming the mechanics but felt short in story and world building."
8970,"Great game. Short - finished it in around two hours with no rushing. I think the price is a little steep but the replay value is most definitely there. The story is sweet and the voice actors are pleasant to listen to. The ending was great. 

Overall 100% recommended but probably not at full price."
8971,"Parkour simulator. story is fine, wish they fleshed it out more or even gave more levels but it's passable. Requires a level of buy in and main draw is the scenery, as for being a game I didn't love it"
8972,very very nice game
8973,good
8974,Is good game I guess. Nice looking and an interesting story.
8975,This game was so calm and breathtaking. It relieves any stress you may have and the storyline is interesting as well. 11/11 pudding cups
8976,"good game, but a little to quick, and quite difficult"
8977,"Personally I rather liked it. Some of the areas were frustrating and the grapples can be difficult to execute, but overall it is a solid somwhat challenging game with a good story behind it and some truly stunning scenery. It isn't very long, but it's a lot of fun, definitely would recommend."
8978,"A nice little adventure platformer. The story is fairly well done, but the grappling mechanic didn't seem fully realized to me. The physics feel just a bit off. Especially when you want to propel past a platform but end up smashing into it. 

The game is pretty forgiving though, with checkpoints after just about every section. 

Mostly enjoyed it, but with it's problems and length (beat it in a few hours), I'd wait for a sale."
8979,"This is probably one of the very few adventure single player games that i don't mind playing (I'm into multiplayer games more). The story gets better as you get deeper into the game, it's definently worth the purchase."
8980,"Maddie's challenge is a pain in the back and it had me more than 2 hours to play it. 

But the graphics is good, the puzzles are amazing and all inside of it is just mesmerizing. Shame that it's just short tho and was supposed to finished under 2 hours but like i said, i tried maddie's challenge so yeah...*Try hard*

I recommend you this game if you love the graphics and designs. If you get attached to it, well let's say you would probably ask almost everything. And ya gotta be ready if there are puzzles. you need a plan or just go with it and have fun."
8981,"Worst Game Ever

Bought it on sale, not even worth it for 2 DOLLARS

I bought a cheap game and I got cheap experience out of it, DON'T BUY THIS AT FULL PRICE, NOR ON SALE"
8982,"A short, fantastic adventure. If you're a fan of platformer games you should check it out!"
8983,"If there was an option for it, I'd give this game a neutral review.  It isn't bad, but it's not good either, and the cons outweigh the pros.

Except for the frog-people, everything looks nice.  The game is very picturesque and it is one of few games where I don't mind just sitting there looking around admiring the scenery.  The lore of the game is interesting, despite how short the game is.

That's about where the pros end, though.  I found the character detail level awkward at best - same sort of feel and graphics as Oblivion for the characters, except you can move around and you don't get to choose what to say.  The voice acting for the main character and Fred were ""just ok"", and for Madeline was poor.
Despite how detailed and alive the villages seemed, that life seemed to dwindle quickly, since you were basically invisible to everyone.  So much to look at, but so little to do.  I also found it relatively easy to get lost, where I felt like I was traveling blindly, to the point where I wasn't sure if I was even backtracking, or where I found myself jumping off random cliffs hoping to find something useful.

I found the gameplay a little repetitive and tedious.  You have an ability like Spiderman, except you get pulled straight into what you grapple into, making you lose a lot of momentum.  Grappling can also get frustrating since there's a relatively short range in which it will work, and you often need very good aim or else you'll miss the shot.  Normally this wouldn't bother me, but the problem is the finite grapples.  Sometimes you need to repeatedly click the grapple in order to grab onto a surface that is approaching the right distance, but since you don't know exactly when it will come up, you might accidentally let go.
I think what got on my nerves the most was the amount of trial and error.  Seeing as this game is a story, it should be believable that you (and Fred) managed to traverse this foreign world through sheer skill.  But most of the time I died, it was because I *had* to in order to figure out where I was supposed to go or what I'm supposed to do.  I'm pretty sure Fred didn't just jump off a cliff and hope for the best. The physics, though consistent, are also pretty wonky.  In the scene where you're challenged to not use the grapple, the only reason I died 20 times doing it is because the run-and-boost would sometimes fly me way too far or not far enough.  The is also some air control, though its very subtle so it can be difficult to know if its actually helping you.

Lastly, the game had a few unnecessary challenges.  Aside from the trial-and-error situation, the most glaring challenge was the scene where these blocks are falling from the ceiling.  Normally that wouldn't be so hard, except you start at a relatively low point in the room and most of the blocks are too far away to reach.  Most of the time I died was because I had nowhere to go.  Pretty annoying for a randomly generated room."
8984,"Keyboard smashing

This game is very good. HARD. CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. certain points are excruciatingly hard, so hard I even smashed my keyboard. Not good for ragey people like me."
8985,"This game is great. The quality is amazing, the controls are easy to get used to, the story is to die for, I just love this game. I'm very curious to see how it ends. If you want to follow the adventure with me or if you want to get a better idea of what this game is about, check out the let's play that I did of the first little bit of the game. Link to it is below, have a wonderful day.

8986,"Playing the game while listening to ""Shelter"" by Porter Robinson 

Best feeling of freedom of movement 

10/10
"
8987,"This game is amazing.  The entire game screams ""Freedom of movement"".  Decent story with amazing art, level deisgn, and most of all gameplay.  This is a platformer through and through, but I only wish that other platformers were this good."
8988,Wow that¬¥s really cool game ! Insane graphic and story. Now it¬¥s my favourite game !
8989,"Very interesting story & level designs. Great game, only thing is I found the controls to be a bit clunky but it takes some gettting use too."
8990,"A really fun, short game with some regrettable bad voice acting.

It's nice to get a first person platformer that plays as well as this one and has such gorgeous backdrops.

Def worth the time and money!"
8991,"The most frustrating game I have ever played. Do not try this game if you don't want to break your PC in half. One of the worst games i have ever played, the controls are horrible and the mechanics are beyond comprehension. To put it simply, this is a DISASTER."
8992,Good content for the price. A bout two hours of gameplay but it has a really cool story. 7/10
8993,Enjoyable platformer but too short (3 hours). Buy it on sale.
8994,It's now out for Mac
8995,"[strike]terribly optimised. good achievements doh. make the game actually challenging, especially with 10fps.[/strike]

Edit: I don't know how or when was the game optimised, but it feels much more fluid, finally got around to finishing the last challenges and it's quite a chill experience."
8996,"A Story About My Unlce is a shortish (about 3 hours if you rush) first person platformer. You play as a nameless kid who goes into caves to find his Uncle Fred. He does have some help, in the form of a suit that allows him to fall a considerable height and suvive, as well as giving him a long running jump and a very high charged up jump. You also have a grappling device, that pulls the player closer when it gets attatched to a surface. Between each grapple the player needs to stand on the ground to be able to grapple again.

 It starts out simple. Grapple a ledge to swing from point A to B. Then you unlock the ability to grapple up to three times between a recharge. Then you get rocket boots, which allows you to jump once in the air. By the last level you have to grapple three places (With just a limited grapple space, not the whole surface), recharge in in the air by hitting crystals with your grappling hook and use your rocket boots. The last level of the game is very hard and frustrating but up to that level the rest of the game is great. 

The story was ok but the ending was stupid. There are a few characters in the game and their voice actors did a good job. The animations, however, is not that great. Its on par with a 2008 AAA game. The level design is good with a reletivley linear beginning but the last two levels have splitting paths and a lot of room for playing your own way. The paths still ends up at the same place, it`s still nice to have options.

The lenght may be short but I felt that it fit the game. If it was too long the mechanins would become either too complex or boring. If it was shorter then in would have been a glorified demo. If you are looking for something different or a great ne game but don`t have weeks to play it, give this a try.
"
8997,I would pay a lot for you guys to make a second one
8998,A beautiful little hidden gem that has tight controls and great mechanics.
8999,"The game for what it is is great. The main issues I had were it's linear gameplay, forced ideas, and shortness. 

The game to me seemed too straight-forward for the concept they were presenting. There were not external paths or alternatives you could do. I really enjoyed the Ice level most of all because that one had much more creativity and the paths were a little more open. 

Moving onto what I mean by saying some things were ""forced,"" I feel like there was very little character development. The character I felt most attached to was actually the narator's daughter. Maddie was an extremely forced character in herself. The idea of how she was shunned for her creativity and intelligence is something we've seen done a lot, and it felt like it was just crammed in there. The connection with the uncle was kind of cut short. I wanted to hear more about his relationship with his nephew, but we only really have 1 memory and that's the eggs story. I feel if the game was longer and had time to be in-depth with all the development and concepts they were trying for, it would've been much more satisfying. 

This leads into my next point which the game was cut too short! I loved it, and the level design just started getting interesting when bam, you're forced back into your world. I realize game design is very difficult, and for the couple hours there was to play the gameplay mechanics and animation were outstanding, I just wish it could've continued. 

All-in-all, I would not buy this game for $13; however if it ever comes on sale you should consider all the good things about it. Go read some good and bad reviews and make a choice on if this is for you or not. Regardless, I hope I was able to help."
9000,"This  game is beautiful, open world and charming to play. 

5 maps.

Secrets to find.

Probably the best exploration I did in a game.

Story is actually good as I have not much care for stories.

I recommend super much."
9001,:)
9002,Short and sweet. Finished in 1.9 hours.
9003,"Great game, however its short and sometimes frustrating very fun."
9004,Fun but very short.  Beat the game in about 3 hours.
9005,"great story,  awesome gameplay, incredible physics  its a little bit short in length but it left the end with the posibility of  a well expected sequel if you like games like portal/ puzzlelike mysterious lore  great music and ambient please purchase this game it worths every penny"
9006,sounds suggestive
9007,Great Indie game. Beautiful tectures and awesome concept. I will warn though that the mouse may not work always. I'd have it wig out on me during very crutial situations... I recomend patience when it does this as that the game isn't very long.
9008,Really cool game. It's a bit short for it's price but if you get to pick it up during a sale definitly worth it.
9009,"The hook mechanism is weird. Sometimes you're very far and the target's reachable, other times so close and no connection. Makes some parts of some areas kind of frustrating. Other than that, a reasonable story with a nice atmosphere!"
9010,"This is a fun little game. The story is only around 3 hours long but it is a pretty fun 3 hours plus there is also time trials and collectables to find. The story isn't too bad either, it's not the best but it's surprisingly good. This game had good gameplay and mechanics. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a quick game to play in their spare time or really anyone in that case. Just give it a go.

*NOTE*: Saying this I'd wait till it goes on sale. I don't think it's worth $13"
9011,"It is good, not perfect though."
9012,It's really short and disappointing like myself
9013,A fantastic 2 hours of my life.
9014,"Calm atmosphere, I recommend this game if you need to chill down from other games and like a nice futuristic fantasy experience."
9015,"Weak story, just challenging gameplay but still worth a few mins of playing"
9016,Press LMB to spoderman
9017,yes
9018,"It's a cute little 1st-person platformer, but you need a bit of patience later on....it's kinda hard to estimate distances in 1st person and you have to repeatedly fall into neverending pits of doom before you find the correct paths and timings by trial and error...it's good if you like this kind of games..."
9019,A really good platformer with a simplistic and easy to follow story.
9020,"I love this game. It's honestly just good fun. It's about 4-6 hours long depending on how good of a gamer you are. Really fast people could do it in less. I just love the feel of the momentum and swinging through the air. I also like the feel of immortality where you don't have health or life, it's just movement and story."
9021,"This game was decent. As others have said, it's quite short. I completed the story in around three hours.

I found many of the areas pretty difficult to get through. Some of them require you to get lucky to get through, others require practice and good timing. I died a lot in this game, and got pretty frustrated.

I didn't think the story was particularly engaging, the voice acting is pretty bad, and the visuals are kind of simplistic.

If you want to run and jump and grappling hook things in a stunning environment, get Valley."
9022,"A very beautiful game, with a short but sweet story, and interesting gameplay!"
9023,"Tho it may be too short, it's a great game
It controls perfectly at least with controller
might replay it later and test it with a mouse and keyboard
Great art direction as well, I always knew where to go even in the darkest areas
And finally, while the story is not it's main strenght, it's still quite enjoyable from start to finish"
9024,"Alright, I don't normally write reviews so here goes.

I got this game on sale, recommended to me because it had the platforming tag, and I was feeling a platforming game. I bought it, and loaded it up, and it was nothing like I expected. I'm not saying this game will change your life, but this game will certainly show you a good time. Great mechanics, great stylized visuals, and a great story to boot, and this game is an amazing package. I've replayed it over and over and I still find myself drawn back to it.
 It isn't the longest story, and in the end, I wanted more, because the gameplay and story were so engaging. The animations of npcs are a little rough and for a grappling platformer, it can be quite linear, but the challenging level design and environments really help to offput that.

Overall, I'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10 and would definitely recommend it for any fans of grappling games, or 3D platformers."
9025,Both the story and the grappler mechanic are good. It's a fun game which will keep you interested for a while.
9026,"would reccomend on sale for something to play chilled.
Pros:
game mechanics
originality
narration
some  challenge

cons:
story ends fairly abruptly/ anticlimactic
WTF ARE THOS CREATURES
"
9027,Good game 10 of 10
9028,"This game is NOT worth $13.00. Lemme list out the pros and cons for you.

PRO
1.The gmaeplay is pretty smooth. You get to jump around and its great for speedrunning. 
2. You can jump from rock to rock
3. More rocks
4. Hey a blimp
5. MORE ROCKS and some ice

CON
1. The story is horrible. Now SHUT UP I can explain. There is no charecter development at all (EX Mad Maddie) and the ending gives us no satifaction. In fact the ending just ruins the whole story by making it pointless (If you cried at the end of this game you honestly must be straight out of the freaking womb)
2. The charactors design makes me want to barf every time I look at them.
3. Its only 2~ hours of gameplay (Unless you go back and speedrun) 
4. Its 1 GB of game for $13.00. with that logic DOOM should 70$

In Conclusion, get this game for the GAMEPLAY not the story. I would rate this a 6/10 becasue it is a lot of fun gameplay-wise."
9029,this game needs dlc's or a new gamemode i dunno. overall nice game to play
9030,"This game being 14USD after the summer sale genuinly confused me, it's not good and let me tell you why. Do not belive the rest of the comments, the story is about the worst part of this entire thing, and it's due to the underdevelopement of characters. They will throw a promanent charater at you who just tags along and say nothing about their personalities or backstories, then dump them a few gameplay minutes later and try to make you sad about a character you didn't know. And the reasoning for the ending is something to abhor. Gameplay is fun, not fun or inivative enough to justify its pricetag however. Overall bad game, if you really want it it's 88 cents on G2A."
9031,"Nice but short game.
Tight controls, Huge levels with the difficulty rising in a steady pace. 
Story is nice, the atmosphere is even better. 
"
9032,"This game actually was better than i expected.

The platforming is so much fun, the characters are... meh, but everything else is super creative, fantasy sci fi esc, and overall just good design.

Totally pick this up!"
9033,"[h1] Starter Off [/h1]

A clever platformer that has mostly solid mechanics that tries to stay true to it's storytelling narrative. This game does alot of the actual gaming features well, with only one mechanic not being as effective at times as you hoped. Back to the specifics later though. There are menu issues as well, as well as the method you are forced to get the challenge achievements with. I'm recommending this because of the way that the game plays mostly and ignoring the many little issues that this thing does to you to drag out the time spent in game. 

[h1] The Good Stuff [/h1]

The gameplay, plain and simple. Platforming with an interesting twist, and it feels fluid as you move through the maps. The maps as well have a distinct flavor to them that offer different types of challenges that match the surroundings well. The world's air of mystery is a positive through a portion of the game. Even with the few issues such as inconsistent latch distances, or losing your latch at the most random times never happens enough to make you feel robbed from something unexpected.

[h1] The One Caveat [/h1]

The power leap combined with the sprint. This mechanic gave me issues often enough that I need to say something specific about it. It has about a 75% detection rate. You'll sprint toward a ledge, charge you power jump, let go of the power jump while still sprinting and you're supposed to rocket forward. Instead, often enough, your idiot teenage protagonist will just jump straight into the air. This frustrated me at least twice per level usually. It's easy to recover from this without dying and try again but it just hated registering at crucial time trial moments. This is by far the weakest mechanic involved in the actual gameplay.

[h1] The Annoyances [/h1]

This game is plagued by minor, convenience, issues more than anything. I had two issues with the menu's that didn't help me enjoy the end game portion of this. First, was the lack of a restart option in the time trial portion of the game. Literally you are unable to just restart the level. You have to exit out of the level then go through a few menu options just to get back to the start of the level. Like I said, convenience issues mostly. 

Second, was the challenge achievements and their appropriation methods. You can only get the achievements in the story mode. Why? I don't have any idea the levels are identical, you just don't have to listen to the same 4 sets of dialogues over and over again. Also, story mode doesn't have a restart option either. So you'll need to go out to the menu and restart the mission because loading the previous checkpoint just warps you there and doesn't reset any falls or misuse of the grapple.

[h1] The Average [/h1]

The way the story progresses is kind of ho hum. It does a lot of setting up and then never delivering. Why is she Mad Maddie... [spoiler] You won't find out running through the game. [/spoiler] I felt like the narrative device about the story was underused and never really added to my sense of wonder for the place. The characters are shallow as well. You'll talk to all but one of them once. They feel more like a filler moment than anything else. As well any real development of the story lines requires you to find the secret story items.

[h1] The End [/h1]

This is a game that did what was most important correctly, the gameplay, and chose to put everything else as a filler item in between those moments. There are plenty of secret items to add to the world but whether you seek them out will be a case by case basis since the art style, and world creations will need to have an impact on you. Unfortunately the game is kinda short as well taking me about 2 hours to run through a first playthrough. How much you can get after that will depend on your competetive spirit and your investment in the world."
9034,"Quite a cool game, the mechanics of it are a lot of fun and the slight openess of it in some parts allows you go around however you please, making use of the grappling, jumping and rocket boost mechanics in whichever way you desire. The story is interesting and there are quite a few nice little easter eggs hidden in the game. Also thanks to Gone North for bringing this to Linux!

Very recommended."
9035,Great
9036,game is fun and have some level that is a bit challenging but the ending didnt satisfy me
9037,"I really liked this game and the change from all the fps and gore games i usually play, i would definitely recommend you get this game if you can."
9038,"Good game, amazing gameplay, very recommended"
9039,"A truly incredible game. 

encapsulating atmosphere
great story
fun gameplay
cheap

cons:
?"
9040,"10/10 really fun gameplay, solid story, awesome concept, trippy, exceptional visuals"
9041,Great game but too short story line :(. I really enjoyed it tho!
9042,"I need more games like this, A Story About My Uncle is an amazing game,
I enjoyed playing it (even in the parts of rage).

If you like challenging platform games with the sense of adventure, this is the game for you."
9043,"This is a great game. It's an interesting platformer, which is suitable for everybody whether you good at platformers or not. It's 3D platformer with decent graphics. They could be better but main focus is the story, because the setting is that a father is telling a story to a doughter about his uncle. Without any spoilers the story in this platformer is surprisingly very good. The only downside of this game is that I felt it's rather short, I wish it was longer.

Anyway I think it's an 8/10 game and you should defenitely get it."
9044,"[h1] SHORT, SWEET AND FUN [/h1]

[b][i] ""A Story About My Uncle"" [/i][/b] is a game that I can label short and sweet, even though the game has a narrative [u]it expects you to replay levels and gather collectables [/u] to unlock special modes and get true value for your money, even so the price is worth the once off experience"
9045,This is by far one of my favorite games its addicting and it can run at 40fps on my toaster shit PC. Anyway this game is amazing the graphics are stunning the creativity is out of this world I just love this game. The one thing that i do not really enjoy about this game is that a cant lure kids into my house with it.
9046,"Great atmosphere, story and characters."
9047,"Cute story and a lot of fun to play, but not actually that hard, also I feel like it should have been longer."
9048,"I really liked it, and I do recommend it to anyone. Although I would have liked it if it was a bit longer, I managed a playthrough in about 100 minutes."
9049,"I love a game, where you can just sit back and watch it unfold. Great game, please make a second !! ;("
9050,"Frikin love this game! The Game has a great storyline, good graphics and it gives you alot of freedom to move around.
Buy this game, you wont regret it! 11/10

Edit: Buy it on sale, for 12 dollars its a bit overpriced"
9051,Are those supposed to be frog people?
9052,"A Story About My Uncle is an Adventure/Parkour game for your wishlist. It's smooth as silk and offers quality gameplay. Every checkpoint got me excited for what more the game had to offer. It's only lacking in play time, which isn't too bad if you get it on sale. 8.5/10 in my book."
9053,"I got this game for 2.09$ on sale and after beating it in one long sitting i relized that it was worth the original 11$!
In this game you play as a father telling a story of when he was a kid his uncle was gone for a long time so he went to investigate. past that have fun grapling from rock to rock."
9054,lit af pls buy
9055,"[h1] What is this game? [/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is a first-person action platformer that gives off [i]Mirror's Edge[/i] vibes. The objective is simple: get from point A to point B without falling. However, you are given several gadgets (unlocked through play) that lead to some interesting puzzle-platforming mechanics, which keeps the game fresh throughout its quick 2 hour playtime. Surprisingly (or maybe unsurprisingly, given its title), for such a short game it is very story-driven, which I will not elaborate on for spoiler reasons.

[h1] You Should [b]Buy[/b] This Game If: [/h1]
[list][*]You like parkour-style/speedrunning games
[*]You're looking for a concise gameplay experience (~2 hours for a casual playthrough, possibly replayable)
[*]You like forgiving games (plenty of checkpoints allow you to retry instantly after failing)[/list]

[h1] You Should [b]Skip[/b] This Game If: [/h1]
[list][*]You want a longer gameplay experience
[*]You don't like platforming (it's the only thing you do)
[*]You're looking for great graphics/visuals (this game isn't ugly, but by no means visually stunning)[/list]

[h1] My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This) [/h1]
I received this game in a bundle and tried it on a whim after hearing how short it was. Simply put, it's a decent game that I had fun with for a single 2 hour playthrough, and honestly that is probably the perfect length for this type of game, as I doubt it would have kept my interest for any longer. If you can get this game heavily discounted and enjoy first-person platforms, give this one a try. However, for full price there simply isn't enough content here (unless you are willing to replay it) and thus I cannot recommend it."
9056,"Solid and novel platforming mechanics and no enemies make this a relatively relaxing game to play, although some ambiguity and what feels like a lack in consistency in terms of how far your grapple goes makes some sections needlessly frustrating. The story isn't bad, but the design of the creatures that inhabit the fantasy world is pretty offputting and the voice acting is similarly weak. Gorgeous environments and a tight runtime finish off a commendable if not somewhat unpolished experience."
9057,"This game is absolutely perfect, the graphics are precise, the movement mechanics are great, and the actual story is on another level, for the price this game is currently you would be missing out to not actually buy this however, the only problem I found with this game is that the actual game story is indeed too short I finished it in under 3 hours."
9058,Very fun and beautiful. Best $1.94 choice I've ever made. Ended up getting a little over 2 hours out of the game and enjoyed every second of it.
9059,"I didn't enjoy this game. No part of the game appealed to me. The environments were boring and uninspired, the voice acting was amateurish, the story was trite. The main problem, though,  was the gameplay. It was so mechanically simple as to be boring. Grappling around isn't satisfying, what you can grapple to feels inconsistent, and the penalty for failing a jump feels far too large. I struggled through for 45 minutes, and then realised there was not a single reason why i wanted to continue"
9060,"Got this game at a steal, honestly, as it is well worth the full price. I got about 4 hours of good fun out of this, and the extra two are from all the retries and leaving my computer on.

1. This game has a beautiful Linux port which runs perfectly.
2. This game is so well optimized on my shitty build that I was getting 50-60 fps. 
3. This is a beautiful little game with a good story.

[u]Pros[/u]
 - Amazing atmosphere
 - Amazing Music
 - Decent Story
 - A lot of fun using the mech suit thing and all its upgrades.
 
[u]Cons[/u]
 - [spoiler] I really really wish the mystery of the frog people evolving from eggs that Fred brought was not explicitly told to the player. It felt just right with the painting on the wall of them evolving like human beings. [/spoiler]
 - Sometimes the game got really frickin hard, but it was still fun throughout.
 - The story was lacking but not bad.


Overall, everyone needs to play this game so that they can experience the beautiful atmosphere and scenery."
9061,"Great game, of all the leafy simulators out there this one makes me feel the least edgy. 10/10"
9062,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review

PLEASE NOTE (2017): Due to recent false accusations of plagarism, I (the reviewer) would like to stress that all these reviews and upcoming reviews are original and are not blatantly copied. Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]

A Story About My Uncle is a game developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios

The game is a 3D platformer type game with a nice little story, nice graphics and music with some good voice acting in the mix. It is a nice little game to play over periods of time and I did thoroughly enjoy it

The only thing which may annoy some people is the platforming bits are a bit annoying and you may die quite a fair share number of times and about half way through the game, you get a pair of rocket boots that give you a boost. Most of the jumps don't require a boost, which made it seem a waste

But overall A Story About My Uncle is a wonderful little indie game that should definitely be bought especially during a sale!

[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]"
9063,"Thin story, thin gameplay."
9064,Lighthearted fun that will keep you entertained.
9065,Spoiler: He puts it in the butt
9066,A simple yet well polished game.
9067,"I wanted to like this game, but I just didn't find it enjoyable for myself. By the time I was nearing the end of the game, I was playing the game for the sake of beating it when I knew I was so close. In hindsight, I wasn't enjoying my time playing the videogame, and in my mind enjoyment ought to be the motivation for playing a videogame.

The platforming is a cool concept that I enjoyed at first, but it got very tedious for me, which is saying something for a game that took me under 2.5 hours to complete. There are a few other tools added to the game other then the grapple, but the game really revolves around that one mechanic which is shown in the trailers.

As for the story, I didn't find any depth in the one-dimensional characters, and I wasn't a fan of the voice acting. The story overall felt very childish to me, which very well may be the intent-to me this seems like a game geared towards a much younger audience (think 6-8 years old). I think this would be a [b] fantastic [/b] game for a kid to play for a few hours, but as 19 year old I just couldn't enjoy this game"
9068,"Kindof short (says so in the description, and the only downside is I want to play more.)  great game, the mechanics are fun, and the story is simple and easy to follow.  

I would love to see more from this company.

PROS:  
-Fun gameplay mechanics, doesn't clutter the game with ""powerups"", and gives a very fun gameplay experience from it.
-Story is simple and fun/easy to follow
-controls are straight forward and easy to get good with.
-Visuals are pretty.  Nothing incredible, but the use of contrasting brights and darks, and some of the views are very beautiful. 

CONS:
-short (but again, my only complaint is that I want more jumping around.  The mechanics get really fun later in the game.
-story is simple (this can be a con for some people)"
9069,"Great game about a colony of frogs that was sent into the caves to mine meth crystals for an elite frog society. The commentary on the proletariate and bourgeoisie is amazing. They even managed to include a massive threat that keeps the proletariate down in the form of a giant worm (the symbolism for fear is stark). 

Marxist remarks aside you're sent on your way to find ""Fred"", your uncle, an explorer who aparently started the society in the cave. You must navigate a series of increasingly difficult platforming segments with a special suit that makes it so that you can grapple to surfaces, you can bound very high in the air, and at certain points you even get some rocket boots. 

It is a very short game from what I understand and I'm most of the way through it. Hopefully I finally find my uncle and confront him on the socio-political devide he has created among the frog people and right the wrong that he has made by surpressing the poor cave frog people."
9070,get it. just do it
9071,"I got this game for around $2. This may have been the best $2 I've ever spent. Seriously.

This game (I think) could be sold for $20, easy.

I score catagories with price in mind. I'm not going to compare this game to GTA V, but I will compare it with $2 in mind.

Gameplay: 10/10
This game creates a fun adventure with a great story, fantastic controls and some overall amazing gameplay

Stability (Is it optimized?): 10/10
A toaster from the Dollar Store could run this game.

Graphics: 10:10
For $2, this is compareable to a game like GTA V. It is beautiful.

Overall, 10/10. A fantastic game."
9072,Amazing game! 10/10
9073,"Amazing game that everyone should try. Never played anything like it, super fun and addictice. Completed the entire game in one sitting, the story was fun, gameplay fluent and intuitive, and the world was stunning!
Wish there were more games like this!"
9074,"The best part was the overused MLP meme. (No seriously, its in there)"
9075,"9.5/10 took me 2.5 hrs to complete 200% worth it, Such good story and fast paced action. I would not pay full price for it though... A drawback is the story sometimes feels long and sometimes feels too short."
9076,"It was a really good game, i did not particularly enjoy maddie's challenge as it was quite CHALLENGING.
It did have a really good story though"
9077,"This is certainly the best single-player game I've ever played and it's on sale? 1.94 dollars! Buy it before it gets more expensive, I promise you. Within those 2 hours you will get moments of joy, a marvelous adventure and even: tears. Yes, I shed a tear in the ending... 

A huge congratz for the team to being able to make such a story-rich game. I'd love to see more games from them or a followup from this game."
9078,"Me likey
Me recommend
Me yes,
Gotaki.

"
9079,"This game is pretty, short and sweet. It took my 2 hours to complete the game, but I've replayed it so many times because the engine it's built around is so smooth and fun to play with."
9080,"A Story About My Uncle introduces you to a fantastical linear winding platformer where you navigate floating rocks through grappling.
What little music is soothing and the descriptive voice acting draws the player in.
The 4 story acts journey the player through different atmospheres with their own little world of eerie and wonder.
However, there isn't much to explore, but the grappling is extremely engaging as you hurtle through the air.

Very enjoyable.

Note, that although there is controller support, parts of the later stages in the game require fast mouse movements."
9081,"A very nice story, but it is very short."
9082,Sooo fun
9083,"A Story About My Uncle is a lovely journey through the life of a father. Platforming is fun and gets more challenging through out the game but never gets too hard. The voice acting is solid and the scenery is bright and beautiful.

The only negative I have to say about the game is that it ended a bit early. I felt like the journey could've gone on for about another hour or so.

4 1/2 out of 5 stars.
Play it."
9084,"
gud
"
9085,stood in awe silence as I played with the incredible mixture of colorful visual images and marvelous gameplay
9086,Gud
9087,Amazing.
9088,"Bought it on sale for 2 euros, after finishing it would not mind paying the full price. Really astonishing and heart warming game. I didn't feel this moved in years, it really brought tears to my eyes thanks to it's beauty"
9089,"This game does a lot of things right:
Gameplay is really good. You are highly mobile due to boost-boots and grapple-hook. It is easy to understand what you can do, but it's not easy to get all the jumps right at first try. You always know what you can change so that you get it right some tries later, which is perfectly balanced difficulty. Sometimes you need a few seconds to look around and see where you have to proceed.
That's it. That may seem little, but it's okay, because of several points:
- It works really well. (Some other platformers just have unpolished gameplay destroying the fun.)
- It is enough for a platformer as gameplay elements. There are a lot games with less to offer.
- The game is not long enough to need much more. (It's exactly as long enough as it needs to satisfy you, though.)
- Environments are so beautiful and diversified, that helps the game not getting boring.

Atmosphere is what really shines. The world you visit in this lighthearted yet emotional story is simply gorgeous. Graphics are nice and the places sometimes remind me of bioshock infinite, but are more peaceful.

When the story is finished you might come back to get the achievements, to get collectibles or to do some speedruns. That are after-story-tasks which make sense for this kind of game.

Maybe one could compare the game a little bit to the well-received game ""journey"" (PS3), although it is less abstract/spiritual and more challenging.

So you have nice platforming and a beautiful world, if you like that, get the game! Consider, that there are no enemies and no fighting, though. I think that fit well to the game and was a good thing."
9090,"Great gameplay & great grappling mechanic. ~3 hours long. 

10/10 would play again."
9091,"Fun little platformer with a nice story.

If you can get it on sale I highly recommend it. 7/10."
9092,+++
9093,"This is seriously the best story game I have ever played. 

This game is very relaxing and enjoyable, a nice change from the games I normally play. I beat this game in 3 hours and got it during the steam summer sale for just $2, this game is definetly worth playing."
9094,"it's fun, and novel. the grapple mechanic, while not completely fleshed out, is a good deal of fun. the game is rough around the edges, to say the least. the writing falls a little flat. the voice acting is only really passable. the models aren't very impressive. but all of that is very worth going through to experience the main mechanic. the grapple system is pure fun. it very much carries the entire game despite even it not being perfect as it is hard to control at times. 

it should be obvious from the above, but this game is extremely rough all around. it's not worth the $13 price tag, but for $2 (which is the price that it was on sale as i write this) it is very much worth it."
9095,"This game is amazing. The graphics are beautiful, the story is very good, and the overall imersion and game play experience is really good."
9096,One of the best games I played. I payed $1.97 and this was better than most of the other 46 games I have. BUY THIS GAME. The gameplay is so fun!!!
9097,Fantastic.
9098,"The game is sometimes too difficult, and I could unlock non of the achievements :( However, I still recommend this game, it gave me fun and kept me peace in mind. The story made me relief and the graphics were enjoyable."
9099,11/10 -IGN
9100,"very cool game, I saw LEAFYISHERE play this game in a lot of his videos back in 2016 and was very intrested in it, the swinging and all the jumping is very satifying for some reason and I would REALLY recomend this game."
9101,"A very asthetically pleasing game, not too difficult as it is more focused on the story. With amazing platforming and some challenging areas, a great game for a great price."
9102,Okay game with really beautiful art.  The story was just a bit overly cutsey for my taste but decently presented. My main problem was the puzzle gameplay wasn't too fun. One fundamental problem with it is trying to get on top of platforms which is way more difficult than it should be.  I also hated how when you run into a platform it breaks your momentum and you fall which happens a lot. To get around this you have to learn to put more swing in the way you move and grapple which doesn't feel as good as it should.  It's pretty fun soaring through the air and you get a rush from it but the iffyness with the platforms distracts from how fun it could be.
9103,Great game. A little short though.
9104,"short story - fun game

buy it while its cheap"
9105," 
*Review contains minor spoilers*

A story about my uncle is a smooth and pleasing platform puzzle game, with stunning scenery and a classical storyline. 

Graphics 9/10
The graphics are ecstatically pleasing, reminding me of good quality 3D movies that i watched as a child. The game had stunning views and since it basically revolves around floating islands the game is full of them. Its basically a couple of hours of eye candy.

Sound 9/10
The sound fits the scenery really well and it creates a relaxed and laid back atmosphere. The ‚Äòsafer‚Äô areas with pleasing sceneries have relaxing music the more ‚Äôsinister‚Äô areas have more sinister music, the game pulls this off very well. Not much to say, it fits like a glove

Story 6/10
The story is a classical tale beginning middle and an end told by a narrator. The reason why i didn‚Äôt give it a lower rating on the story is because it feels as if there aren‚Äôt many games that have that nowadays. 

Gameplay 7/10
The gameplay revolves around jumping, rocket jumping and grappling. Personally i love all three of those things and they exist in abundance in the game but in principle they are the only things you do. If you do like such mechanics then the game is definitely for you. 

Characters 6/10 
The voice acting had a bit lower quality then i expected but was good nonetheless. The issue i have is that aside from the main characters there is literally no interaction with other characters they might as well be objects in the background, like crates or rocks.

Overall: 7.5/10 
The game, depending how you play, is relatively short. I completed it after 4.5 h (i like to explore and take my time) but it  can be completed in less. It has replay potential depending on your preference. If you are a completionist or just enjoy challenges with limiter resources then you will find no problem in replaying the game. The same can be said if you just want to relax and enjoy a good scenery with some exploration potential. Personally I did like the game, but as previosly mentioned it is a bit short aside from that i would recommend it.

Price: As for the price, i cant say much since i bought it on a sale and it was only 2‚Ç¨ (definetly worth it)"
9106,"Um, ok. I really liked this game. I went in blind, not knowing any information about it, but only seeing a few seconds of gameplay, and it looked cool. So, this game has beautifuly crafted platorming. The mechanics are nailed, and the gameplay is perfect. However, the story lacks A LOT. It isn't terrible, but this game seriously had so much potential, and they threw it away. It also leaves a bunch of questions unaswered. 12 bucks is also a lot for a 2 hour long game. I probably wom't play it again, but give it a shot. It's a great game, I was just expecting a little more."
9107,"I feel somewhat ashamed of this game being in my library.  The enviornment graphics are alright but he animation of the Frog people you meet in the 2nd level makes me feel sick.  The voice acting is bad. The gameplay is way too slow and floaty for a game like this.  I'm not invested enough in the story to even tell you if it is good or bad. 

I probably should cut a little slack, but even though i wasnt expecting an AAA title, I couldnt really enjoy it.

3/10, maybe its worth a dollar if you have nothing else to spend that dollar on.

9109,"A Story About My Uncle ( there won t be any kind of spoilers throughout the review )

A great little game that u can grab when u just wanna chill , let your eyes see some beautiful scenery of it s virtual world.

-Pros-

-Beautiful graphics
-Enjoyable story , interesting characters
-mechanics are easy to learn 
-has trading cards
-Steam worskshop maps

-Cons-

-The story itself is imo too short , but u can play it multiple times whenever u want (or there are those maps from the workshop)
-Some of the levels have little bugs like the surface s geometry doesn t seem flat , but u can land on it

To sum up , I fell in love with this little game , the story could be longer , or they could make some sorta dlc.
Also , I would wait til there s a sale , the price is a little too much for a game that offers maximum 2 hrs of playtime with it s story , but if there s one , go for it , buy it immediately!"
9110,Haven't finished it/still love it
9111,Amazing game :)
9112,"Right up my alley, a challenge. I've played first person games before like Portal and stuff, but not like this. ASAMU is a first-person platformer, which is something I need to see more often. The best part, though, at least for me, is how it's actually hard. I mean, [spoiler] screw ice cave! XP [/spoiler] The way you progress and the new abilities you get are so fun to use! The story was amazing, the detail you put into the game was amazing, and I like the trailer on the store page too. Basically, the 12$ you pay for this is far from a waste."
9113,free stickers
9114,This game is a lot of fun I beat it in 3 hours
9115,"This Game is simply amazing, short, but amazing.

The title says it all, but it has more stuff, the game has awesome graphics and controls, cool camera movement and the most important thing, the story, i cried when it ended because i was very inmersed in it, we need more games like these.

i hated you maddie, but then i cryed for you. you stupid little frog :'c"
9116,this game is great. shame it's over so fast though
9117,good
9118,"Smooth gameplay topped off with beautiful and diverse scenery even on my hunk-a-junk laptop.  Wish there was more to it, I had a blast playing it.  GG"
9119,A very good gameplay mechanics but the story is meh.
9120,"Very good game. I found this game extremely fun to play, it's very good at helping you get better at being precise with your mouse. It's also good at helping you learn to think quickly. All in all it's a must play."
9121,short game... get it on sale only
9122,"Though a fairly short game I found I rather liked this game.
First Person Platforming tends to be something cringeworthy, but this game's mechanics of a grappling hook and in-air control makes platforming in first person a really good experience, which is good since it's what you're going to spend all your time doing.

No guns, no cover mechanics, no ""Press U to wallrun and tag the wall for big points"". You get movement, a jump. Then a charge jump forward and upward. A grappling hook to swing from and finally something to save you from falling to your doom. But with those mechanics A Story About My Uncle presents you some not too tough challenges running, jumping, swinging across bottomless pits.

Graphics wise, this looks really well. Up close you might find some jaggy edges or not too pretty textures, but the visual style as a whole and the environments made me stop to take in the view several times throughout the game.

Storywise...there is one, told sparsely as you explore the (linear) world. Some might derive a deeper meaning and message from it. Personally it was a nice background to why you were doing death-defying jumps.

Overall, I can recommend the game to anyone who likes the idea of first-person-platforming. It isn't a very taxing or long game and you might want to wait for a sale, but I certainly didn't feel it a waste of my time."
9123,You can kind of fly
9124,"yes! thats right. ok;
that's that........."
9125,Great gameplay and great story. I recommend this game.
9126,"Great game
This game is one of these special kind of games
it has a great story , a great soundtrack , and ofc the environment of the game look absolutely stunning 
and the gameplay is hella of fun 
the cons of this game that's it's short 
i finish it in 3 hours"
9127,relaxing and great for a background video on youtube rants
9128,"A Story About My Uncle has amazing gameplay and almost nothing else.  That being said, this is the best first person platformer I've ever played, not that it has a whole lot of competition.  The game is centered around a grappling mechanic, which accounts well for the age old first person platformer problem of not knowing where your feet are.  Platforming is fast and exhilirating.  Zipping onto and off of floating rocks feels great, and the game balances its challenge very well.  It also knows exactly when to end, not stretching out the mechanic needlessly; however this does mean the game clocks in at around 2-4 hours.

With that said, now I'll talk about my problems with every single other aspect in the game.  The graphics on everything look muddled even on the highest resolution but otherwise fine, except the character models.  With the exception of one model at the very end, they all fall deep into the uncanny valley.  The characters aren't human, so Coffee Stain may have been going for that, but they did their job too well in making the creatures look awkward and unsettling.  The sound design is uninspired, and unremarkable.  I struggle to remember a single piece of music from my entire experience, but what I do remember was generic kids' movie fodder.

Speaking of kids' movies, that transitions badly into the plot that's hyped up by a lot of commenters.  It's completely generic, getting from point A to point B with no twists along the way, and knowing exactly what will happen if you've seen a kids' movie in your life.  The plot isn't the main focus here, but it is worth noting that it's mediocre.

Despite those issues, it's still worth buying because soaring from stone to stone, across miles in a single jump is one of the most enjoyable platforming experiences I've ever had.  Just don't go in looking for more than that."
9129,"nice game, nice environment"
9130,"This is a beautiful, atmospheric puzzle platformer.  I understood the mechanics of movement thanks to a lifetime of FPS experience so it was a breeze to get through (not that I didn't fall a bunch).  A nice, intuitive use of time - (bought during a sale for $2.)"
9131,pretty nice
9132,"ABSOLUTLY RECCOMEND!

I really can't think of any cons besides that there should be an open world mode.

JUST PLAY IT, NOW.

Why are you still reading this comment play it!"
9133,"This is truly one of the most atmospheric and gorgeous games I've ever laid my eyes on. It's very short, but kinda in a good way. 
It's really relaxing and very enjoyable."
9134,"Short, sweet, and absolutely beautiful.

Thank you, devs, for such an amazing work of art."
9135,Just awesome. Played with my best friend so we took turns because some areas were quite difficult and frustrating. But you just want to keep pushing forward and find Fred. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for great games that don't require mindless slaughter.
9136,one of the best game i would highly recommend 11/10
9137,"I really enjoyed the heck out of this game.The whole game was amazing, super fun to play and amazing to look at!"
9138,"puzzly thing, I must admit!
liked the atmosphere it had but gameplay was just not my thing...too short also...got bored after dying far too many times
Give it a try if on steam sale though"
9139,too short but beautiful story.
9140,"Good Game, I guess"
9141,"Nice game, very chill."
9142,great game
9143,"I am not pro at this game. And I acknowledge that, but it wasnt the gameplay and how I'm not good at it that made me give this game a negative review. It's about the story and how it felt like a chore to finish the game. Maybe I'm just a noob. But that's what I think."
9144,It's a very relaxing game. It's worth it.
9145,"One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Played in first person mode and built using the Unreal Engine, the game looks stunning and the gameplay is challenging and fun ! 10/10"
9146,Amazing game! Really pretty too!
9147,Nice graphics and story but way too frustrating to enjoy.
9148,A simple idea with a very solid execution. Just long enough for the puzzles not to get too repetitive. Short but sweet.
9149,Finished in 90 minutes... needs more content to be worth the price.
9150,pretty nice game.
9151,"The game is great. The artwork and styling are beautiful, the narrative is simple yet compelling, and the physics based platforming is done stellarly. After the initial tutorial the game somewhat guides you on how to complete each level, but it's ultimately up to the player to decide their own path. There are collectibles for people who like to search for things and there's a time trial version of the game for people who like to speed run things (which has proven a fun little challenge.) The story itself isn't incredibly long, but still a great game, especially for the price you're paying. If this game is on sale at all I would 100% recommend it as a must play."
9152,"such a good game, a huge time killer as well"
9153,"I initially had a positive rating for this game.  I changed it because the saves aren't working correctly.  

You cannot do any manual saves; it autosaves the last checkpoint you are at.  I was probably 75% completed, but when I went back to play the game, I was sent back to an old checkpoint which was a lot of progress lost.  I replayed most of the lost progress, but when I died close to the same area, I got sent way back to that old checkpoint again.  I gave up.

This issue is disappointing because I liked the game otherwise."
9154,"This was really quite an experience. The mechanics are brilliant though it lasts little linger than and hour and a half. This brings me to my next point, which is value for money. I recieved this product for ¬£1.49 in the sale, however i would not pay the full ¬£9.99 for it. Overall i would reccommend it if you are bored."
9155,2 hours well spent.
9156,Thought it was very boring. Pretty graphics and nice story but I felt like it was just the same platforming over and over again.
9157,"A story About My Uncle is a charming little game that explores the curiosity and adventure of childhood. The game is short, only about two hours long, however if you pick this game up on sale i believe it is worth every penny."
9158,"These days, everybody is searching for a /different/ game, or to put simply, something that they are not used to, or something that is new, fresh, and something that has never been done before. A Story About My Uncle brings this to the market with stunning graphics, a great story [...no pun intended...], and a great movement system.

The length of the story was not favourable, coming in at a mere two or three hours, howevver it was a great experience that I would definitely not mind playing over again on my free time.

In short, for the small price of two dollars [...Canadian...] it is a game that tells a nice story with a much different movement system from most games on the market, with stunning graphics alongside everything else. I would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who needs a few hours of entertainement!"
9159,"YES!! I love these kinds of games. I don't care how long it is. It is a piece of art. You do not judge a painting based on how many strokes it got, do you? You judge it based on how it makes you feel and what mood it puts you in. The same way should you judge this game. Yes, the game is short. however, for what it is, it is one of the best games i have ever played. Though it lacks a bit in voice acting, it still manages to tell the story in a immersive way. 

All in all, I think that this game does an amazing job at both telling a story and being a challenging game with inovative game mechanics.

9/10 Would talk to frogs again"
9160,"A Story About My Uncle is... dissapointing. 
Pros:
-Innovative Gameplay

Cons:
-Horrid Voice Acting
-Short for its price ($12.99 - 2-4 hours)
-Wasted Potential

Neutral:
-Ending

I feel this game is good, but in other ways its not. Some of the areas are so confusing that I ended up backtracking multiple times. Lots of things in this game (Characters, New types of platforming, etc.) are used once before you continue to start the same repetitive path of the same sequences. Maybe one day they'll make a sequel that uses its mechanics correctly.

Overall: If you're gonna buy this game, at least wait for it to go on sale."
9161,"Damn this game was sadly very short.
But it is 100% well worth all the money. I finished it in one go basically as it really kept me excited and entertained.
Graphics, controls, audio and story - everything is amazing.
Definitely recommended game by me!"

im in love with this game

only the problem is gameplay is very small... like it would take u only few hrs to end it and then ull be in a feelin that i need to play this game but damn story would be finished :("
9164,"Fun platforming game. Get it if it's on sale. Play it if you have it from humble bundle. 

"
9165,Trailer already shows you it's grappling-hook parkour stuff.  Has a tidy little story to go with.
9166,"A Story About My Uncle starts with you as a father, tucking your kid in at night. The kid requests you tell them a bedtime story about adventure, and the game starts as you play through the adventure you are telling your child. Your uncle has gone missing, and you follow him through a weird wormhole-type-thing to a land of floating rocks and caves. Using your special adventure suit, you follow your uncle's trail by running, jumping, and grappling through the world. As you progress through the story and discover more about the world you've been transported to, you gather more components to the suit which grant you additional options, such as using the grapple multiple times in one jump.

It's an addicting platformer based around parkouring around the skies and caves of some fantasy world. Grappling becomes a simple dexterity mechanic and once you get comfortable with it you will find yourself running through the world quicker and more instinctively. It's rewarding when you chain your jumps together, but there's still a challenge in timing everything correctly so you don't plummet towards the ground.

The narration is interesting. There's a certain charm in listening to the narrative unfold in the form of a father telling his kid a bedtime story. But there's always something off- whether it's the voice acting or the script I'm not sure, but when you reach the sections of the game with narration it takes you out of it. It's nice when the game gives you a chance to slow down and appreciate the setting compared to the faster-paced grappling, because the caves and worlds are beautiful, but I still got taken aback by the narrator.

As for the gameplay itself, the whole thing is rather linear. You follow your uncle's path, and there's usually only one way through. Sometimes you get to choose how you approach the path, but even then the choice is often just a challenge of ""do this part only running and jumping, no grapple"" or ""do this part only grappling, no touching the ground"". There's no impact on the game whether or not you do the challenges, just a voice line saying ""yay you did it"", ""haha you didn't do it"", and then a Steam achievement to go with it. It's definitely more like a puzzle game than a sandbox, but that's fine.

My biggest complaint is that some of the jumps you have to make are so specific it's maddening. The difference between you beating the section or restarting at the checkpoint is so miniscule that there's really nothing you can do to improve with each attempt. I was breezing through most of the game until I came to one part I spent a half hour on, and when I finally succeeded I didn't feel like I actually got better and beat it, it felt like I randomly got lucky with timing. Thankfully, occasions like this are rare, and even when you get to these parts the checkpoints are literally right before them so you don't have to replay long sections of the game just to retry a specific section that's giving you trouble.

All in all, I enjoyed the game. I don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but when you get it on sale for $2 there's not much that can go wrong. It's a great way to spend an evening."
9167,"Great fun little Game. You play the bedtime story about an uncle and grapple through an fantastic and beautiful world.
It gradually introduces you to its mechanics and gets more and more challenging as you play further. The quick loading and many checkpoints keep the game flowing fast if you miss a jump, minimize frustration and maximize fun!
Its kind and violence free story is well executed and the game can be finished in 4 hours.
Great visuals and good game play are its core elements, well worth the low price."
9168,My uncle recommended this game!
9169,"A Story About My Uncle is an amazingly smooth and beautiful puzzle platformer. You follow a breadcrumb trail to find your Uncle, Fred, through magical floating islands. This journey looks gorgeous, and the path is clear most of the time. The characters are likeable, but kinda shallow. This whole adventure is wrapped up in a frame story where you are telling your daughter a bedtime story. It‚Äôs honestly pretty cute, and there are a lot of small details like when you close the game, you hear, ‚ÄúI think thats enough for one night‚Äù
 
I had a few issues with this game though. About half way through the game, you get a pair of rocket boots that gives you a boost mid air. Most of the jumps don't require a boost, and I ended up using it as a crutch 90% of the time. I think that this should‚Äôve been given to you in the beginning of the game, and then taken away halfway through. This would help players just learning the system, and add a layer of challenge to the latter half. Also, I found myself getting caught on the geometry of the last level.
 
Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a heckin‚Äô good game. It has flaws, and I don't know if I would buy it for $13. I‚Äôd wait for a sale. 

Also, I should clarify: I got this game on Humble Bundle a while ago."
9170,super fun and beautiful graphics
9171,This game is amazing and tells a cute story about the protagonist's uncle Fred. It's a well written and gorgeous game and one that flows beutifuly and I had no problems with it from a technical or story wise. 10/10 Please get this game.
9172,"If you like  platformers, buy this game.....
Gameplay Nice, Environment Nice, Story Cosy. Game too short is the only negative but for the price it is worth it.

"
9173,"Gapples. Rocket boots. Massive world.
Speaks for itself.
Get this game on sale not for full price since it`s 2hrs of gameplay,i got it for ¬£1.49, however there are time trials too.
Still AMAZING and thumbs up from me BOOM!"
9174,"10/10

leafyisnothere"
9175,"This /seems/ like it'd be so fun, if the central mechanic (the grapple) wasn't so obnoxiously broken and inconsistent.

Sometimes you can grapple to rocks, sometimes you can't. And then you land on a rock you can't grapple to, and suddenly you CAN grapple to the exact same rock you couldn't grapple to a second ago.

I assume they limited the grapple targets because without the limitations, the game would be too easy, but the result is it's basically impossible to make any predictions about what will work and what wont, and as a result you end up just dying continuously why you figure out what the ""intended"" path is, rather then simply finding one of an infinite number of other possible paths that the developers just couldn't be bothered to make functional."
9176,"Good 3D platformer. Swinging around like spider-man from floating rock to rock.

The gameplay was the best part of this game. The story was shit. The length of the game was shit. The Visuals were okay.



5/7 would buy for $1.94 again


Do yourself a favor and use a keyboard/mouse."
9177,PRETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
9178,This game was very touching expecially at the end i felt a bit happy but also sad at the same time! I would rate this game a 7/10 it would be a 9/10 if the story line was longer if you like parkour and adventure type-ish games or you are looking for a causual game you sit down and play then i deffenitly recommend this game!
9179,"So I just want to start off my review with this.... I have been playing games for about 7 years now, and I have never played a campaign game as intruiging and amazing as this one. The visuals are amazing and the story is even better. It has a strong naroative and strong core gameplay and story which makes for my favorite game that I have EVER PLAYED. It is easily worth 13 dollars, I probably would've payed over 30 dollars for it."
9180,Great history and gameplay!
9181,"This is a good game but I wouldn't really recommend it. First the story, is good which is always a plus. Since its framed as a bedtime story I recognize there's really no need to scrutanize it too hard, and it's generally nice. The game is also quite nice visually. It does a good job communicating speed, with the visual effect, and there's a nice staisfying crash when you hit the ground at speed. The phsyics are predictable but unrealistic. The 'grapping hook' does not behave as you would expect preticlarly launching you in an arc, no it's much more liniar though I supose a beam grapple does get to behave diffrently then a rope one. when you mess up a grapple and kill your momentum by smacking into the 'cealing' you where grappling to there's an abrupt loss of momentum without any preticular recoil or audio queue which takes away from realisism. Levels often feel directionless while the next direction to travel in is usually fairly obvious, you never get an overall feeling for the direction of the level. It feels like you progress in random directions. While you never get turned around you ocasionally have to hunt around for where to grapple next. In perticuar late game annoyingly has situations where you can only see the next thing to grapple and the target after that only reveals itself mid jump. Finally there are constant checkpoints so the difficulty is low, but the jumps are very difficult making frustration high."
9182,Spoiler alert - the game is about his uncle.
9183,Great but too short. I completed the story in under two hours
9184,"I dont normally write reviews but this game surely made an exception.
First of all, the mechanics you see in the trailer and gameplay are just as good and satisfying if not more so when actually experiencing it first hand and for a game a couple of years old the visuals are amazing.

If you are here for a good story:
The story is fairly simple but the writing is very good at wanting you to keep playing. The narration is astonishing and i can assure you you will love the story, although you may find the other characters slightly annoying.
The main downside of the story is that you can complete it in around 1 hour or less, so im not sure it is worth it if you are buying it for the story itself, as much as I recommend it.

If you are for the gameplay:
Apart from rare clipping into walls which does not effect gameplay, you can't put anything down to do with the gameplay. After completing the agme you will unlock time trial mode where you can redo levels as fast as possible, which is where most of my hours have gone already. Its incredibly addicting. The one critisism i have is that there is no restart button, so you have to reload the map entiredly to restart thetimer, which can be annoying.

Overall i'd say you cant miss this game, especially if you are a fan of surfing, bunnhopping or other practise, ""time trial-ish"" games and recommend it to anyone.

Im gonna stop writing now because i feel like a nerd.
Also im half a sleep so its probably typo city up there"
9185,"Great Game! If you like fantasy, First Person, and smooth controls, this is for you! Also, it's very addicting gameplay makes it a terrific game!"
9186,"Game is awesome. Awesome characters, awesome storyline, epic voice acting. It gives you a feel of being lost in a fantasy world. It's one of my favorite games."
9187,"This game is really beautiful. While it seems incredibly simple and i though it was like just fly around after boxes, but it wasnt. the story is sweet, and the graphics are wonderful, enjoyed every moment playing this game.
Thanks!!!! <3

<3 Would recommend <3"
9188,"A really fun, short game... I completed it in like 4 hours which is probably way longer than it really needed but I struggled with the physics and mechanics of this game for a while, even though I am quite used to the Unity engine.

The graphics and art in the game were great, and had a good story and atmosphere that made you want to keep playing and explore.

I struggle to come up with anything negative about this game... Maybe it needs a little more tutoring or direction, because I am pretty sure I got off the ""right"" path a few times and missed some stuff. When I said earlier that I struggled with the physics and mechanics I meant I had a hard time learning how not to hit elements while grappling, which often brought me to a dead stop on way to many occasions. I also had a hard time with the perspective and judging distances in some areas... Not sure why I struggled with this so much as I never have in other games with similar mechanics in them.

All in all, I would recommend this to anyone of any age, there is no combat or violence unless I missed something big. It is just a simple first person parkour puzzle platformer. The only part I found odd is there was no wall running mechanic that is common in most parkour games."
9189,"This game is really beautiful. While it seems incredibly simple, it's got really fun and creative gameplay mechanics, the story is sweet, and the graphics are wonderful. 
"
9190,Short but great game.
9191,Amazing game once i started playing i played 3 hours straight until i beat the game soemone could probably beat it in about 2 hours but i spent like 1 hour trying to complete maddies challenge.
9192,"Pretty short game, the story is alright. The graphics are nice and the environments look really pretty. Gameplay wise it goes from ""ohh yes this is cool"" to frustratingly hard when you can't quite manage to land a particular jump.
Overall it's a nice little game."
9193,"A mix of fun gameplay which involves flying around all over the place feeling like spiderman and the immersive story and the characters that you actually got attached to. This game had my eyes watering at the ending and I see it as a must buy.

Only downside is that it is quite short but still very enjoyable."
9194,"Absolutely beautiful game, amazing scenery, challenging and enjoyable puzzle gameplay. would definetely reccommend."
9195,Great game. I picked this up during the Summer Sale and for $2 you won't regret your purchase. I highly recomend.
9196,"This is NOT graphically the most beautiful thing out.
 But it has been a great game to sit through.
Its more or less one big jumping challenge with some (sub par) narration but the actual story line is alright if a tad corny. Defintily took me back to playing older play station titles in a weird way.
Would reccomend on sale.
7/10"
9197,i didnt like it
9198,"This game alternates between fun and really frustrating for me- probably because I'm not particularly good at it and frequently miss hookshotting whatever floating boulder I'm aiming for.  Nevertheless, the progression is nice, and it's pretty.  Don't let me sucking at video games stop you from trying an interesting little swinging platformery game."
9199,"Cute little game, interesting ideas. Not very challenging but is nice to not stress too much over a game. Occasionally struggled with certain parts where you had to travel through the air and latch onto moving targets and having to set off at the correct time! But after a few attempts I got there!"
9200,The developers should add Steam Workshop to the game! =D
9201,"Fuck off, Maddie. Your games suck."
9202,"Short and fun game to spend the night with. The mechanics are simple and easy to learn. The depth of the platforming didnt go as far as i thought it would but it managed to keep the game challenging. The mechanics are introduced at a steady pace and the controls and feel for this mechanics are easy to get used to. Movement is not as fluid at first as i was learning the ropes, but it didnt took long before i got how the grapple works and the timing for it. Some moments definitely made me feel like a badass with some clutch saves and last minute grapples that got me through the level. The game is pretty forgiving with checkpoints which plagues the whole level. I even had one platform that i managed to activate the checkpoint without actually reaching the platform, which was pretty broken for me but its just one so i let it pass.

One thing that i found kind of weird is the character design for the frog people, which are a little cartoony. It contradicts to the design of the world and its artstyle which is more on the realism part. But its not that big of a deal. Most of the world is pretty dark and a little lifeless but some levels screamed life and beauty. It would have been great if it was more consistent on that matter.

Music is calm and relaxing. At times, it tells you to hurry up but never screams at you to hurry up.

Great game for something i bought for CDN2.09 this summe sale. Will i buy it if it was on full price? probably not.

Overall i rate it 8.5/10 (the .5 is from the rocket boots)"
9203,"Fantastic game, I got this game during the Steam Summer Sale for $1.94. I would pick this up for $12.99 though easily. Buy this and make my day."
9204,"A Story About My Uncle is one of if not the best platformer I have ever played. I highly reccomend this game, the world is amazing to look at and play it. The entire game however, is only a few hours long, but regardless It is still amazing!"
9205,"- jumps often require too much precision resulting in needing to redo sections over and over again (frustrating)

- not enough checkpoints, so if you fail, you will have to redo the same sections that you have already finished without a problem multiple times

- there was a lot of repetition in the jumping puzzles

- the game was sometimes a bit glitchy when landing on the edge of platforms, but luckily this didn't happen too often. Sometimes though it felt like the grappling hook didn't activate despite being near enough, but maybe this was just because you had to aim pretty fast and be accurate at the same time.

+ grippling hook and jumping feels nice

+ beautiful landscapes and artwork

+ charming story and characters (could have been more though, and the ending felt a bit rushed)

Overall I would not recommend this game, unless you really like platformers and the game is on sale."
9206,"A Story Anout My Uncle is one of the most unique platformers I've played in awhile, and it has many positive aspects. The grappling-hook centric gameplay feels incredibly fun and thrilling for the most part, the story is engaging and excellently narrated, and the visuals are the best I've ever seen from the aging Unreal 3 engine. However, the game is incredibly short -- You'll likely beat it in under four hours, and it took me five due to one jump I had to make during Maddie's optional challenge that seemed to take pure luck to make. As I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is great fun for the most part, but the designs of the last two levels are confusing and contain several checkpoints that require you to grapple on objects that can easily slip past your view. Myonly other problem with the game is that the ending makes the journey feel a bit pointless. I wouldn't reccomend paying full price for this game, but if it ever goes on sale, it makes for a fun afternoon."
9207,The game is way too short
9208,"surprise your uncle's dead

also the fucking horse joke makes me want to kill myself

make it illegal to watch children's shows if you're not a child, punishable by death"
9209,"This game is charming and relaxing, I really enjoyed playing through. I got even emotional :) If anybody wants a game that does not take too long to beat with a sweet story, I'd highly recommand buying this game. have fun"
9210,"A fun game but disappointingly short.

apparently I didn't recommend this game but looking back I think it was a very enjoyable experience to play. I just desperately want a sequel or anything."
9211,"No. Tl;DR at end. Complex explaination below.

Let me explain. This is gonna be my full experience with this game, so I recommend to you reading this even if this review gets downvoted. But then I also recommend not buying this game against this 93% positive reviews.

Let's get right into most important aspect of it's game that is story. It's bad. I don't understand praise in the reviews. 

Apperently you are an adult putting your daughter to sleep and you tell her story about how you decided to follow in your amazing uncle footsteps, becouse he was gone for long time to find him. On your way to find Uncle you also discover that your uncle apperently created a civilization of frog people who live in caves and on flying islands. This is pretty much 3/4 of the whole game plot. So yeah.

Characters. Noone of them you will ever reamember 2 weeks after playing this game. There is like you the main character, the frog girl that helps you just becouse he hates her village elders who want to keep her protected, your daughter that sometimes asks about details of the story and your uncle. Which you will eventually meet. And spend like 90 seconds with him before he sends you back home. Telling you to live own adventures. I hope those 4 hours you spent finding him were worth this.

Ok so before I go on I wanna talk about about this frog girl. I even took effort of googling out her name, not like it matters. Ok so Maddie. You meet her at beginning of 2nd out of 5 chapters. Probably plays most important role in the nonexistential plot here. She is frog girl who thinks of your Uncle as parent, similar how your character does. Keep in mind that apparently this uncle served for our character as father figure. So yeah she escapes village after elders of her village tell her that it's dangerous to leave this village. Becouse she wanted to find Ted. Or at least I think uncle name was Ted. So yeah she will make you carry her all around since your uncle left you pretty much IronMan suit. Then she will leave you.

Becouse she found other Frog people on flying islands.

Becouse this Frog people were fascinated by the fact she made a lightbulb using magical crystal.

Becouse this Islands frog people unlike cave frog people aren't afraid of technology.

Also when she goes off your back and wants to get back she will start screaming ever 3 seconds for you to go and get  her. Imagine pixie from Zeld but it's frog.

In the end of story your uncle doesn't even come back with you. He will be gone forever becouse he will go back to frog girl. Yeah he choses frog girl over his own goddamn nephew.

Ok we have characters and story out of way. Now time for the rest.

Music! It's there, I guess. I don't reamember any songs which isn't necessairly a bad thing since that also means noone of the songs managed to piss me off. Unlike the next part.

Gameplay. I needed now to stop for 10 seconds to find correct way to express how much I hated gameplay. 

So like I mentioned Protagonist does have this suit. He takes no fall damage, can do charged jumps forward and up, use line to hang to things like spiderman, but less cool than spiderman becouse he needs to land ever 3 swings to regen this swings. And you will later in game find rocket boots which allow you to boost in direction you chose, but will have to regen similiar to swings.

This game is on Unity. Or at least something similiar. I;m gona say visuals of 2nd and first location are nice, but:
3rd location is pitch black.
4th location uses same background texture, becouse flying islands.
5th location is just inside empty frozen mountain. 
So that's about visuals.

First few Platforming levels aren't to bad. But then you get to chapter 4 with flying islands and you gonna hate this game more than ever, You have very limited to none space where you can use grappling device and sometimes when you catapult, you will miss a jump just so little, that you will bounce of the platform you were aiming for edge. Also there is Maddie challenge. HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

So I do not recommend this game. None of the characters are memorable, music isn't memorable, platforming was ok for first few chapters but then it turned into nightmare. 

However since you took effort of reading this review I'll recommend you some good games you can play instead.

If you are looking for memorable characters and amazing soundtrack, where both will stick in your head for long time, buy Undertale. It's cheaper and characters, story and music are way better than in this game.

If you want however a game fully focused on intreasting story and exploring intresting world, with protagonist that won't let you forget about them, and probably some most creative and 4th wall braking puzzles I've ever seen go for OneShot. 

And lastly I'll recommend OwlBoy, even though fights in this game don't have difficulty curve, but more like difficulty staircase.

TL;DR: Forgettable uninspired characters. Bad platforming after 3rd chapter. Annoying characters. Ignorable music. Ugly visuals since 3rd chapter. The ""Story"" isn't going to change your life. Go play Undertale/OneShot/OwlBoy/Lisa/Bastion/Off instead. All this games carry out their messages way better, and are also way more memorable. All good I can say about this game, it was playable. 2/10"
9212,"A platformer puzzle game with fun travel mechanics. The game is a little short and the story is simple, but there are some nice looking environments to work your way through."
9213,"Absolutely fantastic atmosphere and story, good voice acting, very immersive, BUT it's way too short! I would love some DLC or even a sequel to this game, overall a great buy especially when on sale. 8.5/10"
9214,Excellent game
9215,its ok!
9216,"[b]***RECOMMENED***[/b]

9217,"Good platformer. Beautiful scenery. Fun gameplay. 

Way too short. Seriously. I could buy a game for the same amount of money and it can last me a month of near constant playing, and I get 2 hours out of this.

The story had no arc, either. All buildup for nothing."
9218,What a fun little game! Storyline is interesting and the gameplay is fun. Nothing too terribly difficult but I really enjoyed swinging around and jumping from platform to platform. Beat it in one sittting. Short game but wonderful.
9219,"Super frusterating game marred by an insufficient amount of checkpoints, janky controls, and unforgiving environments. When the grappling hook physics works, it feels fantastic, but unfortunately these moments are few and far in between. The developers seemed more interested in testing your patience rathen than focusing on situations that make you feel like you are in control. 

Well crafted difficult games compensate for their innate toughness by an awesome soundtrack, super tight controls, and a quick reload. A Story About My Uncle has none of that. The soundtrack is dull and boring, the 1st person controls aren't tight as they need to be for the level of precision the game is demanding, and you spend an inordinate amount of time falling to your death when you miss a grappling hook anchor. 

The bedtime story narrative is endearing but it ultimately only served to contrast with the fact that the main character was constantly putting himself in peril and falling to his death. 

There is a spectacular game burried underneath here. If only the environments were more forgiving this could have been an experience to remember."
9220,"Beautiful scenery graphics but pretty bland and ps2 quality character graphics.  Music is nice but nothing outstanding.  The platforming is usually fun and occasionally frustrating but the frustration comes from knowing the designer seemed (to me at least) to have generally only one way of getting from A to B in most situations.  A to B was usually fun though so I can't fault it too much.  

This is an above average indy no combat 3d platformer, but it is fairly short so keep that in mind.  Recommended as above average, but needs some more polish and maybe something else to be more than that."
9221,"This game is outstanding, the gameplay is fantastic and makes you want more, great story, and the world is beautiful. Only complaint is that I wish it was longer."
9222,"This game is awesome.Awesome story.Awesome gameplay and funny caracters :))) BIG UP!!!!! :D

"
9223,"Very neat game. IT took me roughly 2 hours to compleete it. It was worth every cent though. I loved the game. It is nice, calming, relaxing and sweet."
9224,Very good game concept and story.
9225,"Nice platformer relying on a grappling hook and lots of freefalls. A shorter version of Windlands for VR, but with a nice touching Scenario as a backdrop. Took me 3 hours to complete, would take more if you want to play the time trials and deathless challenges (personnaly not interested)

Recommended!"
9226,"Got this through humblebundle and it was a fun experience. At some points the voice acting is a little subpar, but the gameplay itself more than made up for it. 7.5/10"
9227,"best ten pounds i've ever spent

the atmosphere is the best thing about the game, its really subtle in execution, but you really get a good sence of fairy tale- esc story. the characters are simple, but likeable enough. 

It was clever to add the time trials and unlockables in, as it gives a more gameplay heavy side of the game, which shines through with competative replayability, as you stive to collet all the unlockables, and get gold times on every map.

speaking of the maps, they are all beutifully designed, evan though there are only 5 freerun maps in the game, four of which take place in caves, they are all unique, and give different vibes with seperate sounds and music. The art design is unique, but really works in presenting the game as it is."
9228,"didn't finish it yet, but fuck u why all this jumping over and over why?
the game is really beatiful, but I keep falling like thousand times just to get to a near place!
I have to say that I don't really recommend it, because it's a waste of time! and I hope the ending worth it!"
9229,"This game is absolutely priceless. Graphics are spot on, the story is amazing and the gameplay is wonderful. Enjoyed every moment playing this game, teared a bit at the ending. 

It's just awesome."
9230,"One of the best Indie-Games of all times. Very great atmosphere, easy controls and overall a very great expirience."
9231,"i completeted the story mode in 2 hours...
if you are like me who thiuks there no point of the game after the story mode dont buy it."
9232,I dont like this game. It just a jumping simulator.
9233,Perfecto gameplayo!
9234,"Fairly short if you don't go after speed trials or achievements, but I found it worth it."
9235,THE BEST GAME MADE 10/10
9236,"This game is fun, beautiful, and just an all around great time.

This game is really good, the parkour aspect of the game is just fantastic, I found myself stuck at a few parts, it does some take some practice initially before you can do pretty well without failing. My only real problem with the game is the length, its pretty short. I completed the game in probably 3 hours or so. It has a great story, great cinematics, the score is amazing. All I can say, is that I highly recommend it, buy it."
9237,"Portal-esq, I'm not going to go deep into this review as I normally do... but I highly recommend it.

Puzzles? Yes. Some get quite difficult but after some thinking you can solve them.
Gravity? Yes. This game is all about manipulating your trajectory.
Superpowers? Pretty much! You fly around and can fall from any height!

This game is amazing. I'm only about half-way through right now, but if you like Portal and puzzle games, you'll love this game."
9238,"$14.00 CDN for just over two hours of ambiguous and occasionally directionless platforming is a pretty tough sell.  It's fun, especially once you get all the upgrades, but despite the exhileration of long jumping between floating rocks being pretty thrilling the whole time I wasn't really tempted to play it again.  Slightly glitchy (easy to get stuck on non-flat surfaces with trees or bushes or meeting vertices), voice acting's a bit strained and the tether diminishes the whole platforming thing somewhat.

Still, given the setting and the atmosphere it might be a really good game to play with your child or even more appropriately your niece or nephew.  I have to give a negative review somewhat on principle, but I'm sure a lot of people will have fun with this.  I don't really know if it goes on sale, but it'd be much easier to recommend if it did."
9239,A Story About My Uncle is an amazing game. The game is challenging but not annoying. this game is really fun to play. It has a good story and is interesting. The game would be better if it was longer but 3 hours of fun is worth the money (especially if you get it on sale). 5 stars I think everyone should play this amazing game!
9240,A great game for a quick and fun experience.
9241,"I wasn't expecting much from this game when I picked it up in a humble bundle, but I ended up enjoying it very much and I have to recommend it."
9242,"This game is great. I would recommend this if you are  looking for a fun 3d platformer, or even if you aren't. The voice acting isn't perfect, but there is a great story. The game has great mechanics and concept, making a practically flawless game. I will say the game can get repetitive, but it is still a great game.

9.9/10"
9243,"It was hard for me not to check the dislike... The game is great. Awesome swinging mechaninc, great story, love it all. My problem came when the game ended. After about 3 hours of playtime, which felt like 30 minutes, the game ends. After which the only thing you can do is re-play the story mode. Over and over and over again. Returning this."
9244,"A great game to play and waste time although its not the most hardest game its mechanics are very diffrent in a good way. 
The game doesnt last that long but if you're a big collector you can collect easter eggs and get unlockables that are really cool."
9245,"1. I kinda figured this would be a walking sim w/ some platforming thrown on top but it is the opposite. It is a platforming game first w/ cute, sentimental fantasy plot thrown on top.

2. I start playing a 3D platformer and I immediately reach for the controller out of habit. This was the wrong move.  Or, I guess it is the right move if you like your games good and frustrating. The accuracy of a mouse is very helpful and I don't find that to often be the case.

3. While I was using the controller, I stacked a bunch of pillows on the side of my couch so I could have a place to safely chuck it, which wasn't as satisfying as crushing the thing to smithereens in a fit of nerd rage but a whole lot cheaper.

4. It's not really the same kind of game but this reminds me of [i]Portal[/i] as much as anything. There is a story overlayed via narration but you are not really involved in it. It just comes at you bit by bit as you progress. It's also a first person game where you have to aim and shoot things but can't kill anything.

5. The way the game works is, basically, you are Spiderman w/ rocket shoes. This is pretty sweet. Grappling is the name of the game here. There is a bit of challenge puzzling your way into finding the best root through a given set of obstacles but it's mostly about getting the timing right and aiming quickly. This works well and for the most part the game flows smoothly.

6. You play as a young boy who goes off looking for his uncle. In his house, you find a magic space suit and somehow manage to transport yourself out to a bizarre world of floating rocks and frog people. Adventure and grappling ensues.

7. I don't know where the hell the voice actors for this game from but they all speak like people who learned English as a second language and spent years perfecting it but still ended up like 1% short of speaking exactly the same way as a native speaker. They are in the accent uncanny valley. It is strikes me as kind of creepy at times but sort of works for the fantasy setting. If you tell me frog people from outer-space speak like northern Europeans who majored in English, who am I to say any different?

8. I found this much more difficult than most people. That is partly because I stubbornly stuck w/ a controller for longer than I should have and also because I was drunk half the time. Not gonna lie. 

9. The graphics here are not a technical marvel or anything but are quite pretty and alluring so I feel the artists accomplished what they wanted to so good for them.

10. Number 10 being said, I did have two issues w/ the graphics here. Firstly, there are spots where it is too dark to see your various grappling points in the distance. Towards the end, I had to crank the gamma way up to see what I was doing and I liked the look of the game much less once I did that--but at least I could see. Also, often, I felt that at times it was not clear based solely on their appearance what points you could grapple. This made some sections a little more trial-and-error based than I thought they should be. 

11. I played this solely on Linux. Thanks for the support! It worked almost perfectly but I did have some trouble w/ menus becoming unresponsive. Still, not nearly bad enough to avoid the Linux version. 

12. Most of the replayability here is going to come from just wanting to play it again. There are opportunities to find collectables to encourage some off-course exploration and a time trial mode if you are into such things.

13. It'd be a stretch to call [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] a perfect game if I'm being honest. The plot wasn't great, the platforming certainly had annoyances but it's cute, almost always fun and is the kind of thing you can knock out over the course of a weekend w/o having to block off a huge section of time so it doesn't overstay it's welcome. People looking for a little something different in a platformer won't go wrong by checking this out."
9246,A fun and charming game. An easy recommendation if you enjoy platformers.
9247,"fun as hell and moving and flying around feels really cool. not a perfect game, but offers about 5 hours of solid and fun gameplay."
9248,"The game was fine, and the gameplay was entertaining. However, the story was unfulfilling. The ending kinda just popped up on you and the last level wasn't that exciting.

I would recommend this game if it was on sale and you enjoyed short story-driven games with a gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master."
9249,One of the best first person platformer out there. But it's hard.
9250,Terrible game. Why? Because the creator watches my little pony. Unacceptable.
9251,Tedious and unresponsive!
9252,"Great game mechanics, pretty good story. There were a few sections which were probably harder than the developers intended, where I got stuck trying the same series of jumps over and over. The last section is really the only one where you could pick your own path out of two or three. I would have liked to see that more throughout the game. Overall a great experience!"
9253,this game is honestly amazing ... way to short best 8 hours of my life...
9254,awesome gameplay and great story
9255,"First person grapling puzzles in awe inspiring airial vistas.

""Hooking"" is a bit fiddly. It's fully organic, no autolock, and allows for unconventional or interesting ways to get around or pull out of trouble. On other hand, you sometimes get a half second window (with precise timing) to lock onto a passing boulder before it's out of reach or your trajectory become unviable.

Chechpoints some times could be more frequent. Get through a swinging section on 8th try, stop on an island, atempt next bit, fail, learn that you have to do the !@¬ß#$& first part again, over and over, sometimes gets frustrating. 

Enjoy the gorgeous views while swinging about like a sci-fi Tarzan with a jetpack."
9256,"This game is fucking amazing, I got it free from a friend and i'm so glad I got it! Playing with a controller is a bit hard but playing with keyboard and mouse is pretty easy! I got stuck near the end and it hurt me so much... Playing it once is enough, doing the speed runs isn't worth it. I don't like the speed runs but I do like the main story!

The voice acting makes me wet I MEAN IT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE UHH ( how do I delete that? ) ill google it later eh it's only $13 which is pretty cheap for what you're getting! 

I got just over 7 hours worth of gameplay since I was just trying to finish the main story not trying to get all the achievements, its not a hard game.. it's a pretty easy and simple game but trying to get all the achievements now that is hard! I can't be stuffed trying to do that right now anyway aha

Overall 7/10"
9257,"A relatively short and not to difficult game with a sweet and simple storyline. The graphics are rather old fashioned (think Fable or earlier) but they don't detract very much from the experience. The addition of the achievements is what pushes one to put in some real effort, and also adds substantially to the length of time one spends on the game. Plus swinging and jumping around from platform to platform is always an enjoyable experience. So while you may want to wait for a special before you pony up for this one, you could certainly do worse."
9258,"If you like parkor, story, and mysterious places this game is definitely for you."
9259,"Short game with pretty cool mechanics. Sorry is okay. Voiceacting is pretty bad and got on my nerves at times.

EDIT: I should add. I finished the game in 2.7 hours. I don't have much incentive to keep playing even if the mechanics are sorta fun. for me it's a 7/10 considering I got it from a humble bundle. Can't speak for the actual price here."
9260,Short and sweet indie adventure platformer
9261,"You are not ready for this
Simple mecanic and a rich story
I was not ready for this
after completion of the story and understanding the story...
im still not ready for this..."
9262,"As always with steam games, just put it on your wishlist and wait for it to be 50% off...

Really good story and character development given its length.
It looks stunningly good. Even on my potato pcs. 
Honestly think this is more of a parkour/free running game than a platformer. It really opens up at parts letting you choose the path you follow as you constantly leap off the next cliff not knowing what to do next.
The end does seem to slow down a bit and the path becomes slightly less obvious but this didn't bother me that much.

"
9263,Short game that's kind of like csgo surf but different.
9264,"Very difficult and challenging, especially if you want to get the achievements.

But, underneath the tough gameplay exterior is an actually good and well acted story. If you can stomach the trial and error type of gameplay, I definitely recommend this one.
The save points are close enough to each other, except by the end of the game where they feel more sparse. If you fall, you immediately get sent back to the save point and can reattempt the section. So its very forgiving, but also very difficult at certain parts.

Definitely playable for the nice voice acting and the feeling of swinging through the air."
9265,Beautiful
9266,"What a fantastic little adventure! I do not normally like platforming games, but the mechanics here are so simple yet satisfying. The game has an an enormous sense of scale, with the huge caves and large distances you must cover with your grapple and rocket boots.

The game hints at a deeper mystery while you progress through the story. Unfortunately it never follows through with this and the story leaves a lot to be desired, considering the title of the game. Despite this, the experience of the game is still worth it.

It only took me 3 hours to finish so I would not recommend buying it unless on sale. However there are challenge runs to complete that I did not attempt.
"
9267,Surprisingly little drunk uncle on child subplot (or is there?)
9268,"A short but fantastic game with amazing mechanics and gameplay, and a wonderfull story that makes you feel warm and fuzzy and a little bit sad."
9269,Bought it bc of Leafy
9270,"[h1]Really different and fun game[/h1]

Quite a good game, graphically nothing special, but its very  playable. 

My Score - 7/10"
9271,"The grappling mechanic is good and feels very fluid after chaining multiple together but the distance at which it can be used is not clear and this makes for some rather frustrating moments. But that isn't what leads me to not recommend it. This is the core mechanic and it works well enough. 

What leads to a 'no' recommendation is the lack of much else. 

The world is void of life aside from the few NPCs that you seemingly can't interact with. The voice acting is a bit hit and miss. I didn't mind the voice of the main character and his daughter at times during the narration but others felt a bit off.

The game itself is incredibly short - my playtime has 6 hours because I left it paused for ~2-3 hours while I made dinner and went out shopping. It took about half this time to complete and the story throughout this was pretty lacklustre. Just as you start to really get the hang of grappling and enjoy gliding over large areas the game ends. 

It might be an okay price at $13 USD to some but I don't feel like it had enough substance to it. Maybe wait for a decent sale."
9272,It is a short but incredibly fun game. Gameplay is king and is great. There is a story but it is not that important.
9273,"Damn, I loved playing this. The story was amazing and the platforming too. I'd hoped for a better ending, though. It was a bit meh. But I definitely recommend anyone to buy this!"
9274,A Story About My Uncle is a game that gave me similar feelings I had playing Portal 2 for the first time.  It is an immersive first person experience with what I describe as grappling parkour with a brilliant story and wonderful narrator.  It is worth your time to play through this delightful adventure.
9275,"[h1] Linux Version Review [/h1]

TLDR: The game is short with some replayability, but it's great. Performance is solid. 

A Story About My Uncle is a platformer game that utilizes mechanics that include jumping, (both regular and suit-assisted jumping which consists of high jumping and jumps with a running start to reach further objectives), grappling, and rocket boosts. The main character narrates the story by telling the story to their daughter as a bed time story. The jist of the story being while trying to find your uncle, you stumble across a suit and by chance stand on a platform and are transported to another world where the game starts. 

The game is pretty short. Some people have said they beat it in 2 hours. Personally it took me more like 4 and a half hours, since sometimes I misjudged a jump and lost my way which did slow things down. 

Although the game is rather short, there is some replayability. In my first playthrough, I did not earn a single achievement, since the majority of them have you limit your grapple usage or play a level without falling. Those who are all about challenging achievements will be pleased with this game. Also, after beating the game for the first time, you unlock time trials, where you complete a level as fast as you can (also has some achievements). However, it‚Äôs completely personal, so you can‚Äôt compete with other players on achieving the fastest time for a level. Not that it really matters to me personally, but something to mention. 

The Linux version took it‚Äôs time to be released, but it was worth the wait as they sure did polish it. I had no performance issues on the highest settings, and I don‚Äôt have the best hardware. So excellent job on that! Thank you for the Linux love!!

Overall, I had fun with this game and I defiantly recommend it!"
9276,"The game is very short, the plot is weak, voice acting is brutal but it is pretty atmospheric.
I enjoyed the grapple mechanic and that's really all the game is, a way to showcase a mechanic. 

If you can pick this up for five bucks then go for it.
Buy this on sale otherwise it's not worth it."
9277,Got this through Humble Bundle and I actually really enjoyed it. Its pretty short but its a enjoyable platformer.
9278,"A fantastic and incredibly special game on the surface, made even more so by its deeper meaning and little secrets. It holds a very dear place in my heart."
9279,"With this addition, the suit felt atleast 20% cooler. *sigh* 10/10 -IGN brony memes"
9280,"I beat this game in about an hour and half, and fiddled with the time trials for a couple minutes.

The gameplay is satisfying, with only 2 somewhat annoying parts.

It's fairly linear gameplay, and not super challenging.

The graphics look nice, especially the intro scene looks great, and the environments look beautiful.

the story however, is not good. It tries to make you connect to characters that you have known for all of 3 minutes, and uses cheap, cliche story telling techniques, although this does fit the theme of it supposedly just being a bedtime story.

It's fun, but for $12? I feel like it's a good purchase for $6, and if you're really frugal you can just beat this game and then refund it as it's shorter than 2 hours long."
9281,"Spiderman-parkour in Avatar's Pandora.

To be honest it is one of those games that desperately misses the ""maybe"" steam recomendation option. If picked up at a significantly discounted price and/or by someone who loves adventure-platformer type games, then change this recomendation to a ""yes"". It's a few hours of innocent fun/frustration probably worth a few ¬£$, but not full price.
Full list of pros and cons below:

Pros:
Movement can at times be rewardingly fast paced and fluid
Several nice looking environments
Gameplay premise and several level designs are good

Cons:
Movement can at times be very frustrating
Grappling to different surfaces and at different distances can be inconsistent
Relatively shallow world, no real feeling of depth or history to any characters or environments
Rather bland story, 'nice enough' but not particularly interesting
Very, VERY short (it could easily be completed in 2-3 hours, with little to no replayability)
Desperately needs workshop for user designed levels

5/10"
9282,If you like frustrating first person platformers I'm sure it's awesome. Not so much for me.
9283,Great adventure agility game
9284,"This game is too frustrating to be enjoyable, the controls are very sensitve so you end up flailing the mouse around while you try to find your target, and there are many times where you should be close enough to a target to latch on or a way to recharge the grapling gloves, but the game doesn't register that you've clicked, even when you're right next to the object. And it is very hard to be able to latch onto objects when the controls do work, the charcter often being too fast while the controls are too sensitive that you completely miss the target multiple times, and it gets even more frustraiting when you have to grapple across multiple object with stopping on the ground."
9285," A awesome-but-short game. A great atmosphere but with a little more gameplay features, we could have it really more longer or maybe a 2 one.
I recommend this game, it's an adventure !"
9286,"Short, linear, repetitive, frustrating, cliche-riddled, inconsistent, poorly paced, and the story neither has any weight, nor any payoff. Things just kinda happen at you and you're forced to wait for them to finish. Mechanics are introduced and promptly dropped, much like the characters.

The whole game can be beaten in under 2 hours, even if you fail repeatedly, like I did. Messing up even slightly can send you flying unavoidably toward death. The challenges range from punishingly hard with too few checkpoints to laughably easy with too many, and rather than rising in difficulty, it seems to fluctuate constantly.

But it was pretty, I guess. If you got this game in a bundle or as a gift then give it a shot, it's harmless, but I wouldn't go seeking it out. It's entirely forgettable. 

I suggest buying Valley instead. Same idea, better execution."
9287,"I had in mind to buy this game for some time, and I finally did a little while ago when it was on sale. I completely loved it. Excellent voice acting, the gameplay is very good, the levels are pretty well made. I cannot find a negative thing to say about it. It took about 4,5 hours to complete it which was great comparing with the price I bought it. Maybe I would not buy it for 13‚Ç¨, but if you find it on sale it is a must, in my opinion."
9288,"Short and sweet, this is a kinetic, high-speed first person platformer.  It's not revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it does the basics well."
9289,"Thoroughly enjoyed this experience. It is a short game, approx 4 hours, but it didn't really feel like it needed to be longer. There were some rather difficult parts, and a lot of the experience is just taking in the environments. I wouldn't say it's for hardcore platform enthusiasts, but its a great short experience. I would say probably wait for a sale of 5-10 dollars, but how much do you pay for a 2 hour movie ticket?"
9290,Short little gem with awesome game mechanics and lovely storytelling
9291,"This game was long enough that it left you fulfilled, but short enough that you didn't lose interest in it. You can beat it in about 1-2 hours and is a great play. I think Coffee Stain Studios would benefit from making a second game or DLC and I would probably insta-buy it."
9292,"A ""feel good"" game. The design and the sound of the game has a ""childlike wonder"" feel to it. So you don't just play as a little boy in an unknown world, you feel like one too. This game is made as a first person platformer but makes the movements very precise and easy to control. So the jumping and the swinging around are quite enjoable. The Story is also nice and doesn't disturb the gameflow. Short gametime is only as an adventage to it so the gameplay itself doesn't become tedious. It took me about 3 hours."
9293,"A calming game for everyone to enjoy.

Puzzles made solid.

Mechanics are sometimes bugged, but still great.

Makes you miss someone you dear most.

8/10


Buy dis shit fag"
9294,"Good game, fun but occasionally frustrating mechanic"
9295,"It was ok... 

Beat it pretty fast.  I feel like it had low replayability.  After just completing it I do not want to play it anymore.  

Swinging around was pretty fun, the graphics were pretty.   

But I hated the voices in the game.  It was so.... not natural.  For awhile there I thought it was being read through a text to speech player.  The character models look terrible, I know they are aliens but these models look like they are 8 years old.  

Over all get this game if it is super cheap ( like less than $1).  Otherwise save your money and play a different grappling hook game.  
"
9296,"This is a great little game, I love maddie <3"
9297,"Amazing story and gameplay, I got a good 5 hours out of it."
9298,"Ever wondered what it would be like to be Spider-Man in a giant cave? this game's for you.
This is a cute and fun short action game. The game is narrated as a bedtime story a father is telling his daughter about his adventure looking for his lost uncle. The game requires critical thinking, quick reflexes and patience to complete.
The two biggest draws to the game are the beautiful scenery and the feeling of swinging through the air like Spider-Man. Yeah, basically it's like a Spider-Man simulator, minus New York City and villains: you can jump really high and far, you have swing through the air and you don't get hurt when you smack into the wall. It doesn't take long to complete, and for the achievenement hunter, you can try to get through the levels using as few grapples as possible."
9299,"Pretty good game, even considered his short lenght (around 3 hours for me, didn't completed all the archvment) and a not so exciting story (not a bad one, if you prefer a more relaxed approach). I suggest you to play with a controller: much more challenging, and in my personal experience was even more enjoyable than the keyboard."
9300,"I really enjoyed this game. That said, it is really short, and from that standpoint I recommend not paying full price. There's some really fun 3D platforming here, and you can try to get better times in each level after beating the game, but the story itself is only around 3 hours. Really fun 3 hours, though. It definitely left me wanting to find something similar! Honestly, I'd love a sequel."
9301,"The only thing I'd recommend this game for is the platforming gameplay. And even THAT is only moderately interesting.

My favourite part was when the village leader pledged his full support and assistance before he even knew who the hell I was, or why I was in their land."
9302,"Amazing experience, sadly the story is way too short."
9303,"Completed in 3-4 hours with lots of time taken to look at scenery and find easter eggs. Quite a short game, but the time spent playing it was enjoyable. The platforming was fun and dynamic, but the degree of how linear the game felt seemed to fluctuate wildly. There were many times when the levels were very easy to navigate, and other times when you'd have to look around and figure out where you needed to go next, sometimes resulting in accidental backtracking. Regardless the game was satisfying and maybe worth multiple playthroughs for the additional ""challenge content"" that I haven't played yet.

I had a great time deciphering the numerous tablets/labels written in the game's 1-to-1 character swap language, whether I was uncovering a piece of lore or simply reading the label on a box the deciphering felt like a fun step back from the fast paced platforming that the grapple presents.

The story was presented well and felt rewarding to experience. While it was predictable at times I still felt engaged through and through in the uncovering of this world.

Overall the game was a neat, bite-sized adventure, with a decent amount of replayability."
9304,Best Game IRL
9305,Too short for the price
9306,Short but gold. Grate 3d platformer and nice nareation.
9307,"Great story, great gameplay (though sometimes wonky controls), great graphics. 
Its a short but welcome experience."
9308,"I wish Steam had 5 star rating, because this is a solid 3. But:
- 13 euro for 3 hours of gameplay
- in some areas controls were unreliable
- story is pure cringe

On plus:
- animations
- voice acting (they do what they could with given material)
- gameplay when you don't fight controls"
9309,Fun and chill game.
9310,"Story is dull, boring unskippable dialogue, sprint jumps are horific."
9311,"It was just an amazing adventure ! I recommend this game warmly. It's a great one and, wow ! This universe ! So worthy ! I pick this game up in a bundle, I pick this bundle not just for this game but in part and I'm just so happy of that ! Enjoy guys !"
9312,"I finished the game in 2.7hrs, I got the game in a humble bundle (So I ended up paying less than a dollar for this game) But, If I had known what this game was all about I would gladly pay the 14$CAD for it, And moreso if it was on sale. If you ever do decide you MAY want this game. I'd say it's a no brainer if you like this style of game. The only thing I wish like everyone else is that the game was longer.

10/10"
9313,"The graphics arent amazing, however the way the story is told is just phenomenal! Gameplay was also really tight and top of the line! The game was a little short, but you can tell that a lot of heart was put into it. You will not regret playing this game 9/10!"
9314,"Hidden gem of a game, very fun and relaxing."
9315,I find the Blue Bitch  Fucking annoying for the fact you can hear her smacking her lips every time she speaks... Other than that it is a great adventure/Puzzle Platformer
9316,"For a small little indie game, I thought this was a very pleasent experience. The gameplay mechanics are innovative and a lot of fun. The world is fascinating and beautiful, and reminds me a lot of the art of Roger Dean, which I adore. 

Length is very short, and the story felt very rushed during the end. It's a shame since I thought that the world introduced here had a lot of potential to grow.

I don't think that the ending could be said to be ""open"", but it still left quite a lot of questions hanging on. But then again, if you think of this as what the title promises without too much expectations, it delivers it well. 

I recommend buying this on sale because of it's short length. It's worth playing through.

8/10"
9317,"A wonderful, short little game that should definitely make it into your library.

I bought this game on sale, which is what I recommend that you do, as it is so short. It tells a wonderful little story about, well, your uncle. The world is rich, the mechanics are interesting and innovative, and the whole experience is entertaining and fun. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking to kill a couple of hours. (My total playtime clocked in at just over 2 hours - so when I say short, I really mean it). 

I give this game a 9/10, and the only point I take off is because the character models were a bit creepy sometimes, especially the frog people. However, I can't bash it too much because I can obviously tell how hard the team worked on this game and because it was so small I know they put love into it. 

Overall, an excellent experience!"
9318,"The perfect desribes words to this game for me is Magical game about movement. 

- Many mechanics of movement;
- Secrets;
- Story telling;
- Adventure;
- Music.

10/10 magical game!"
9319,"Amazing, one of the best games I've ever played"
9320,"This game is wonderful, it contains all the elements you can see in the title alone: it's a story about your character's uncle AND you get to be spiderman. I think that's enough reason to get it, and that's without mentioning how pleasant the storyline is. If you want action, look elsewhere. If you want to have a good time, this game is for you"
9321,"This is a nice game, it'll give you 2-3h of gameplay, plus some ""secrets"" and challenges. Nice and narrative, the story is quite interesting and the graphic design is really good. 7.5/10"
9322,"Game was awesome!! I absolutely loved it..the story, graphics, gameplay in general. Fun, cute, and even controller throwing frustrating at points but without a good challenge is it even a game? Buy it!"
9323,I recomend it
9324,"A Story About My Uncle!
The game has a great story line. However, the story line is a bit short. The mechanics and the different ways you have to climb the different platforms are both fun and challenging. The Atmosphere, and one of my favorite parts about the game was to explore, and look at the different ""stages"" of the game. 
 
Pros:
+ The narative is not annoying, and fits very well with the story.
+ The Atmosphere in the game just feels great, and you can actually explore a bit, and look around. 
+ The game is not too challenging, however I spent some time dead, but it was not annoying at all. In fact, it was rewarding, since I could learn from my mistakes and approach the obstacle form another view. 
+ The music just fits perfectly with the atmosphere, and how the game unfolds. 

Cons:
- The only thing I can think off is that the story is a bit short, however I wouldn't want the story to be longer, since that might potentially have ruined it. (You never know)
- The game can be clunky at times. 

Overall this game is really good. I personally baught this game at a sale, and I felt that it was worth every penny."
9325,"I am a platform lover, and this game came very close to being a recommendation. It has a completely unique playstyle, some really interesting environments, and a story that remains just interesting enough to want to see it to the end.

The sense of momentum you get through several successful grapples feels really fluid, and this ability, combined with a pair of rocket boots that adds additional propulsion, lets you traverse vast environments quickly. The amount of safe platforms are few and far between, which means you will spend most of your time in freefall over bottomless chasms, trying to reach the next grapple point that seems just out of reach.

And that's when you hit your first major problem: you will always struggle to know exactly what is out of reach. The aiming point in the screen lights up when you can grapple, which does help a lot, but the proximity you have to be in order to reach these points is never clear, and oftentimes closer than you actually are. The game could have easily rectified this by having a scalable aiming point, that is to say one that would change shape, let's say a circle that gets smaller as you get closer to the object you're aiming for. This could have helped to player begin to more easily visualize safe distances to attempt. In reality, you launch yourself towards floating points hoping to grapple, and begin clicking furiously as you fall just short of it, hoping for a last-minute grapple success. The fact that this strategy occasionally works to save you is not a positive thing from a gameplay perspective.

And that awesome sense of momentum I'm talking about only works occasionally. An attached grapple will always bring you all the way into the anchor point until you slam against it, thereby killing all your momentum, which means that you have to let go at a safe distance to keep your momentum going away from that object and onto the next. The issue is that your momentum vector is constantly in flux and awkward to manage, and it's very easy to clip an object as you're passing it and fall. The opposite problem is letting go too early, which means you will not have enough speed built up to keep the sequence going. Furthermore, you actually have very little aerial control of your character, and although the intention is to make the grapple your singular tool for traversing the environment, it is much more cumbersome to use than your average platformer's jump techniques.

The rocket boots I mentioned could have helped alleviate this issue had they been designed differently. Any good platformer (one that feels nice and precise) gives the player a decent amount of mid-air control. You only get the boots towards the end of the game. Usually they're designed to traverse distances otherwise unreachable with your grapple, and you can only use them once per midair sequence. In other words, they are pretty useless in error correction, Having a pair of boots that could instantly change your direction and accelerate you into a different vector could have really helped in making this game feel more forgiving.

I am teetering on the edge of complaining about the game's difficulty, but it's ultimately fair once you get the hang of it. A speed run through the entire game will take you less than an hour, but new players can expect to spend 4 or 5, and most of that time is learning the grappling mechanics, the distances, the momentum, and everything else the game expects you to understand without really explaining it. This leads to lots of trial and error. This is typical for a platform game though, so it seems fair to demand it of its players. What I judge a platformer on is based on how fun that trial-and-error is, and honestly the fact that you can rarely build up a good sense of speed while learning the game makes the learning curve not too exciting to experience.

Fundamentally, the time it takes to understand the mechanics is time spent hitting your head on floating rocks, vectoring yourself in slightly wrong directions, and coming within two feet of your target and coming up short. A Story about My Uncle doesn't give the players enough tools to really feel in control. Had the story and graphics been a real selling point, I may have recommended it, but the voice acting is poor and the animation is very crude. With only 5 levels to play through and only occasional moments of fun, it doesn't have enough going for it to justify a purchase.

I will say this though: as a VR release, I would play it immediately."
9326,"Story about my uncle is a new and refreshing FPS platformer game. Despite having a short story, it has brought something new to the platformer game genre and good one too. Worth to buy especially when on sale :D

"
9327,gud gem
9328,"Well, I just beat this game, and I found it to be one of the worst experiences I've had as of late. And I really wanted to love this game, I really did: colorful, well-designed world, interesting characters, engaging plot and great soundwork. What completely ruined it for me, though, was the gameplay, it's been one frustration after another. There was no pleasure at all in traversing this beautiful world, and every time I found myself trying sections over and over just because jumps and grapples have to be stupidly precise. This gameplay reeks of when 3D platforming was in its infancy, when developers hadn't figured out how to do it well yet and didn't understand that having to make precise jumps in the third dimension needs to allow for much more leeway than in traditional platformers. In this case, the grapple points were often too tiny to be of use, not to mention that the actual controls are way too floaty; the right way to do this is to make sure that the controls are spot on, they're not working against you and the game helps the player in reaching the expected objectives. Maybe it's my fault for playing this with a controller, but some sections were downright impossible to pull off (I actually had to enable fly mode right at the very end, or else I would get an ulcer from this thing; not even kidding). What baffles me the most is that with 40-something testers nobody thought that some sections were too annoying to play, so maybe it really is my fault. I hated it wth all my guts, and I wanted to enjoy it so much."
9329,"This Game is Absolutely PHENOMENAL.
Gave me so much emotion and passion through a well developed storyline, and beautiful scenery.
So sad and so heartwarming.
The ending made me want a sequel.
I freaking enjoyed this game. 

Conclusion: WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!"
9330,"a great platformer with super nice graphics. 

buy it on sale :)"
9331,"really liked the game, good graphics, easy to control and lovable characters. the story was AMAZING however rather short, would love to see more."
9332,"Not a great game, not a terrible game. Wrong balance of story & action. I would have enjoyed the game much more if it had  a more fleshed out story and much less PITA jumps. There's a just a handful of really bad ones, but I got stuck on a partcular jump for over an hour right after getting the rocket boots, finally had to watch a youtube walkthrough to see how he did it. It's also not particaularly clear which way is the way forward sometimes. These issues completely destory the story pacing and unless you enjoy the challenge of getting it just right, it's torture. They should really have made the most difficult jumps a little easier and put more challenges in for people that one them, without the ""Haha, I told you you couldn't"". The last thing anyone needs when trying to get something right is some mouthbreating NPC repeatedly berating you for failing each time.

Story has a prominsing start, but gets hung up in a couple places. You goto a villiage filled with an entire people you've never met, and stay for like 30 seconds. Foreshadowing is heavy handed. Lots of open ended plot threads.

Art style of the landscape, sky, and environments is done really well, but lots of reused assets. Can definitely feel Avatar's influence on art direction here. 

If you're big on platforming, and not looking for a deep story, you'll probably find a lot of fun in this game. If you're looking for a good story and a casual play, don't bother. My hands are cramped (used DS4 controller) and sweaty, and I'm not loving how little I got out of the ending for the time invested. I don't think I will play this again, and the gameplay was aggravating. 

While I don't think it's a bad game,  I don't think I'd recommend it anyone either."
9333,The game was fun and really kind of cozy.
9334,loved the game. way too short
9335,Very deep and nice concept too
9336,"F this game. Don't play it, unless you want a hand-cramping challenge.

What SHOULD have been an exhilarating game with a fun movement mechanic, providing a sense of freedom and mastery‚Ä¶is instead an exercise in repeated, soul-destroying, needless checkpoint restarts. Putting aside the really wild up-and-downs of the difficulty curve, MUST the difficult sections be tuned to require sprint-jumping off the VERY edge of a ledge (always fun in first-person‚Äînot) so as to have enough reach for a grapple? There are SO many minor changes that could have made this a better game, but either they devs didn't playtest it enough, or they INTENTIONALLY tuned it for difficulty.


I finished this game so that you don't have to. Don't make my sacrifice go to waste."
9337,fun game
9338,no
9339,"Thank God for the Mac & Linux Port.

This game is stuningly beautiful, not mention the game mechanics enhance environment explore, though it's limited, still pretty awesome.

unfortunately, there are somekind of hard-impossible-level, that really make you stressful, well there's the challange. 

still recommend"
9340,"In this butt clenching excercise game you will make the most tense jumps in videogame history, which in turn will make your badonkadonk firm.

game quality is okay if you expecting a mini game"
9342,"Usual review for this game.
`Its pretty good; worth a buy (particularly so in any Sale)`.

Dreamlike; fairly interesting mechanics; and nearly an amazing game for what it evokes.

Definite Thumbs UP this `very different` game; especially for all the re-mapping &/or Controller options provided to (left-handed) customers. 

Pity this games Dev wasn`t consuled for the Redout game `keyboard re-mapping` controls code (the commies there hate leftys)."
9343,"Good game ONLY on sale, which happens quite often."
9344,kinda portal-ish platformer parkour with aesthetic visuals and amazing story I LOVE THIS GAME OMGG
9345,Fun FP-Platforming with a touching story and awesome aesthetics.
9346,"I absolutely love this game, the atmosphere, the mechanics, the controls, the seemingly impossible achievments. all are amazing. but as I came to a close on the games story, i wanted more, and I thought that I was getting it, but it just ended, and while it felt bittersweet, it felt rushed like the game was in a hurry to get done. all in all an amazing game and I continue to recommend it to everybody I know"
9347,"If you just play story mode, the game only takes a few hours to complete, but afterwards, you can play ""Time trials"" which is pretty awesome. It's a fun game with a pretty nice story line. The voice acting is quite nice, especially the narrator. It's also graphically quite easy to run, which makes it really accessible. I'd defintitely recommend trying it out!"
9348,"+ Great game or artwork and screenshot Showcase
+ Fun game to play when bored or having nothing else to play
+ Great storyline 
+ Can replay any of the missions again
+ Great game mechanics

- Short game I completed it in under 4 hours
- Not much action untill the end 
- Litte to easy

Pick it up during sale like i did, its not worth its whole price!"
9349,10/10
9350,Fucking amazing :)
9351,"Do you like using a grappling hook, then this is the game for you. 
Great story but short. 

9/10"
9352,"In a nutshell this is a 3D [i]grapple-platformer[/i] - the story is ok, the graphics and sounds/music/voice acting is also good.
Controls are fine. Physics are decent.
What may end up frustrating you is that the UI and grappling distance doesn't work very well, in the sense that you can't grapple on all surfaces and it's hard to know when - likewise for the grappling distance, sometimes you can grapple to far objects, some other you can't to walls/rosk much nearer.

Some frustration aside, the game has some [i]grapple-jump[/i] challenges the requires you thinking and is overall enjoyable.
Only problem I have has been in some occasion it has been particurarly furstrating for some apparently [i]easy[/i] sections, instead some allegedly [i]complex[/i] ones, it has been a breeze.

I would say 7/10 - it has its good moments when you get the jumps/grapples at first time and you're impressed with yourself ;-)
The game is a bit short - ~3.5 hours to complete - if I didn't die once it would have been ~3 hours.

Overall I would recommend it.

Ps. I played on Linux - Ubuntu 16.04, in 3440x1440 on a 1080 GTX - all details and AA maxed out. The game is as smooth as butter.
I do own a PS3 pad - but I felt you need precision of mouse and keyboard - boy was I right... You need proper FPS controls to play this - with the pad is almosy impossible in some sections, accuracy of keyboard+mouse is unbeatable and necessary."
9353,"[h1] Swing into this title [/h1]

Imagine Tarzan with a grappling hook and rocket boots. That is basically the premise of this gorgeous, imaginative, and very escapist indie game. Who, as a child, has not dreamt of running around fantastical lands and exploring unique landscapes? This game very much taps into that part of us, the part that is still very much alive or smothered down by adulthood, but can never really die.

Gameplay is super intuitive. It is very much physics based and something not to dissimilar to what you might find in a playground. In fact, if you know how to swing around, you already pretty much know how to play this game. Well, not quite, but you get my point. But that does not mean the game is easy. This is a game in which the whole envionment is a puzzle and you can't just go in without thinking where you need to go next. 

Plotwise...not much of a plot really. You have a guy looking for his uncle, and part of the way he is joined by someone called Maddie. That's all. [spoiler] Except there is an underlying plot, if you know where to look. [/spoiler] It can be disappointing to first time players as the whole endevour can be anticlimatic. [spoiler] But only if you are not looking closely. [/spoiler]

Overall, this is a fun but challenging game that brings out your inner child. Well, it did for me.

Oh and if you are worried about the infamous ice cave puzzle, they have made it easier now. If I can do it (and by the way, I am very bad at this type of game), then you can too.

P.S. the game features no goats. I know, it is a pity."
9354,"It's short, let me say that first. I recently played it through a second time, and did it in one sitting of maybe 2.5 hours, but to be fair I knew where to go and what to do. Average time for a first run without achievement hunting is about 3.5-4 hours.

That being said, there are no other cons to this game. Other reviews mention a difficulty spike toward the end, and while it used to be pretty harsh, they've patched in a couple of things that make it much more forgiving. Still tough at times, but not like it was. The narrative is smooth and feels very natural. Dialogue isn't out of place and doesn't feel like mindless exposition. It really feels like someone telling a bedtime story, which is very relaxing. The level design is gorgeous. It's a beautiful world to explore, especially once you get out of the starting section. The music is very ambient, and really fits the world. Controls are exceptional. Most platformers struggle at times with this, and make you wish you could jump just a little higher or further, but not here. The levels are designed to give you freedom, even on a linear path. Your time spent on the ground is all about setting up for the next jump, and the mid-air control is very responsive. You never feel like you're just floating and helpless.

All in all, I would play a sequel to this in a heartbeat. I hope there is one eventually, or at least a game with similar mechanics from the devs, because they absolutely nailed all the important bits for a game like this. Many reviews say it isn't worth full price because of it's length, but I can honestly say I do not regret paying full price, if for no other reason than to support the crew that put this game together. I look forward to seeing more from them."
9355,Absolutely perfect for a modest adventure game. if you want an entertaining game you gotta try this.
9356,"This game is something else. I love this game a lot. It's so unique. If there was a sequel I would 100% buy it!

Pros:
Beautiful art style
Great story
Interesting characters
Good physics
If it was a girl I would marry it

Cons:
It's quite short

Additional points:
Definitely worth ¬£10
If a sequel/prequel of this is made I might cream <3"
9357,"OMG SOOO GOOD the only thing is the game is to short for the price. i got it on sale for 2 dollars then it was worth it if you are thinking about getting it i would advise you to wait till a sale (and o my gawd the ice cave ThE ICe CaVE AAAaaaaAAaa)
WOULD LOOOOOOOVE a sequal that is longer because the game i cant describe how fun it was and that ending tho THAT ENDING SAAAAAD (not that sad but..........I LOVE IT also a sad epolauge DEVELOPERS IF YOU ARE READING MAKE A SEQUAL that is all i have to say IIICCcccEEEe CCccAAaVvvVEEeeE AAAaaaaaaaAAAAaaaaAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAaAaa"
9358,This game is relaxing to play. The gameplay mechanics are really well made and the graphics of this game are beautiful.
9359,iza amaymay
9360,a brillant game love the storie its just a good game in genral
9361,One of the most suprising and fun 3d platformers Ive ever played. The grappling works really well. At times I felt like I didnt touch the ground for mins.
9362,pretty chill game
9363,Very nice story
9364,"My love for this game has no limit.

I played most of it with a controller but would advise to switch to mouse and keyboard towards the end where accuarcy is key."
9365,as best as I get for hooking
9366,games gud
9367,"This game would be so good if the level design wasn't complete garbage. I bought this hoping to have some fun jumping and grapple hooking but the level design completely ruined it. Whenyou're in the ice cave, sometimes even when yuou're in range of a block you can't grapple it. I had times where I was really closing to landing on a block and I try to grapple it so I can land but I can't, even though I'm lclerly close enough to grapple it. Then there's the windmill which you have to be so close to in order to grapple hook it's embarrassing. The problem here is that you're able to grapple hook rocks from so far away and then suddenly for some reason when you reach one of the windmills you have to be really close to grapple it or you just fall. This is one of those games that could have been fun to play had the levels not been so specific with the machanics."
9368,......................
9369,"Nice fun game, with nice settings. A bit short."
9370,Yes yes very good very good
9371,"you know the game is good, when it start you thining about you'r own life..... love the gameplay and story was amazing! <3"
9372,beatiful but too short
9373,Amazing gameplay and story thank you to the creators for making this experience.
9374,"if you want to remember how you could dream about stuff when you were a child, play this game."
9375,Beautiful!
9376,So fun!
9377,"I really enjoyed playing this, the story was really original and I'm a huge fan of the soundtrack. The gameplay was equally fun as it's a nice simple play till you reach the end and then you need to pull out all the stops and start really trying."
9378,"Definitely not worth the full price, and hardly even on good discount. 
tl;dr good world design, bad details, super easy and fast playthrough 

It's two hours of jumping around from easy-to-get-to platforms to another without need of map or compass (not that there is either). The levels never pose a challenge and you have unlimited retries, making this perfect for a babby's first platformer.

I adore the world design though. You can see there could've been a grander scheme and a better story for that matter, but then again the game could've been much bigger overall. It feels unfinished. 

Guess what else is unfinished? NPC models and animation. When you're there studying everything the world COULD offer, you will see how horrendous the character models are and how bland their everyday-life NPC'ing is. It looks like the details were never even meant to be looked upon directly, that the game is meant to be literally rushed through. A bit clashing with the ""wondrous and mystical new world"" theme in my opinion. Even the uncle at the end looks (and kinda sounds) like a damn sex offender nutjob! 

Good job, team. Slap yourselves on the asses for a cashgrab job well done because this one is never getting reinstalled."
9379,"This is honestly one of the best indies ive ever played.
It has some awesome platforming elements and its fun
its also very fun to speedrun
its a very good and fun game, the only thing i hated was the animation, voice acting, and models for the frog people.
"
9380,best game ever
9381,is alot of fun and the visuals are amazing
9382,"During my first playthrough, I collected 18/25 collectibles, found the Olaf easter egg, and managed to earn a whopping ONE ACHIEVEMENT. Maddie was so smug about it, I just had to complete her challenge.

The story is twisting and beautiful, but also touching and tragic. Much like life, this game starts you out with an optimistic innocence that makes you feel hopeful and scared at times. Toward the end of the game, the clues of the story begins to make sense and the tone changes from a happy fantasy to a heart-breaking story about life's hardships.

The gameplay is fantastic! Controls are tight, the learning curve is very gradual and the platforms are always placed where they need to be, so you never feel cheated when you fail. In the beginning you're given just enough power to navigate the claustrophobic chasms and tight walkways, but towards the end, you're given the ability to sweep through wide open chasms effortlessly. It feels amazing when you succeed and even better when you get it on your first try. There were a few spots where your path ahead is not totally visible, so eventually you'll find yourself having to take a leap of faith and just see where your jump takes you.

Though short and sweet, this game is a 10 for me, in almost every capacity. My only regret was that it was over so soon. I had just begun to fall in love with the game when I slammed into the ending full force, leaving me emotional and confused. I'd love to see another iteration of this game, with a bigger scope and less linear paths throughout the game. An open world version of this game would be ideal, as I'd feel more inclined to replay it and get all the collectibles. As much as I loved this game, I felt like I was on a rollercoaster track at times, with little room for exploration and innovation. You get the sense that this world is sprawling and open, but the set pieces are 10000 times bigger than the area in which you can explore."
9383,"I started out really liking this game. The scenery is beautiful, the music and voice acting are nice, and the story had me wanting to know more.

However, the game mechanics and level design need some work.

If you overshoot a jump or mistime a grapple, you get to watch a (fairly long) fall that can‚Äôt be skipped, before you get a chance to start the section over. This isn‚Äôt helped by the long distance between some checkpoints."
9384,"you know those times where you see someone's creation and say ""thank god they made that"" ..?(like you say to mobile phones and internet) well this is one of those creation that makes you go like that"

9387,"Game is FREAKING AMAZING!!!
however
it's too short...... :/ I love the graphics, the game play, and the story. but I think it should have had more to it than what it has..."
9388,"Really sweet, emotional ending and not too difficult, but with a few challenges. Very well rounded game, story is quite entralling, if you are considering buying it, I think you won't regret it! 8.5/10"
9389,Awesome!
9390,Well worth the $2
9391,2/10
9392,"FANTASTIC!
Other than amazing visuals, interesting mechanics, a fair challenge and a nice increase in difficulty which allows for a normal learning curve, this is mostly a great story.

Almost like playing through a nice fairy tail, it has great storytelling in a narrator voice, the character you meet, as well as the environment you move through.

Not very long game unfortunately, but a great story for anyone who cares for such."
9393,This game tells the story of a boy abused by his uncle
9394,"Amazing Story in my opinion and the gameplay is so fun and pretty additctive the landscapes are beautiful and unique, They should make a movie about this game.

9395,"Not much to say, gameplay is awesome, you make jumps 100 meters apart and flyetrough the air. it is not to challenging on the mind, but it is just a little bit on skill. above avrige gaphics with great 3d models and visuals. would recommend if you have the money"
9396,"really cool game if platform is ur type a great story but its a short one like 3 hours of story gameplay is actually really short but u can do some time trials and unlock some cool stuff, really beautiful graphics and gd physics

9398,Yes.
9399,IS GOOD JA
9400,great game
9401,"The game every YouTube commentator used in 2015-2016. Despite that, it's a rock-solid parkour game with a touching/emotional story.
[b] Definitely recommended. [b]"
9402,Took about an hour to finish
9403,"I'm a little late, but this game is not what I thought it would be. I mean that in the best possible way, I thought this would be the easiest platformer ever because of the trailers. It's not, it's not the hardest, but it is satisfying when you figure out a puzzle, it might be simple to one and difficult to the other. My only complaint is that it was too short, but I can always play it over and over again trying to unlock everything. I wouldn't pay more than 10 USD for it, but if you find it on sale for that or under pick it up, it's fun as all hell and I can't wait to start trying to speedrun it. The voice acting is lacking, but the story makes up for it."
9404,Good game and would recommend it for everyone but its too short! like really short! Done in less then 2 hours short! would love more content or a deeper story line but other then that its ok!
9405,very good game
9406,"Amazing game, absolutely beautiful, excedingly colourful and fun to play. I feel like they have taken a lot of inspiration from Dishonoured (with the hand animations and the graple being like the ""blink"" mechanic). I am really, really enjoying it and can find no flaws with it - other than the occasional absense of checkpoints.

The ending is beautiful but the final sequence of grapple puzzles is a pain in the ass.
:)


For anyone who gets stuck - you can unlock the cheat console by going to Documents\My Games\A Story About My Uncle\ASAMU\Config and open ASAMUInput.ini

Scroll down (about half way) until you come to a section marked [Engine.Console] and change the entry called ""ConsoleKey=None"" to ""ConsoleKey=/"" and ""TypeKey=None"" to ""TypeKey=slash""

This will allow you, when in game to open the cheat console (by pressing the ""/"" key). Use the command ""fly"" to toggle hover mode, and ""walk"" to return to normal.

DO NOT USE THIS ALL THE TIME OR YOU'LL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE GAME (I got stuck right at the end for weeks - so had to revert to cheating).

9407,Great game but could be a little longer i finished it in 2 hours  but still a great game :)

9410,"I don't know what to tell you... If first person plateformer is your thing... maybe.

+ Fonctional 3d first person platforming (with a original aspect).

- Story is ok, but, meh.
- After playing around, the gameplay is not that great.

It's a 58% for me, just a bit bellow the passing mark."

- Short game I completed it in under 4 hours
- Not much action untill the end 
- Litte to easy

Overall this game is something you should pick WHEN its on sale because i dont think its really worth ¬£9.99 where as i bought it for ¬£2, 8/10 would recommend this game."
9413,"This game's story is so fucking good , best 3 dollars I spent in my entire life"
9414,"To be honest I really expected something from this game. Tired from scrolling through thousand zombie killers, sandboxes, amnesia-style-horrors and pixel roguelikes, I bumped into this and pressed ""Install"" button thinking that finally I've been recommended something good. And my expectations were met.

""A story about my uncle"" is really beautiful game with lovely music, characters, locations. It only took me 2 or 3 hours to walk it through, but they were worth every second. I saw people call it ""Peter Pan simulator"" - can agree with it and can say, that I had many dreams in my life when I flied like I did in game. Most interesting thing for me were the locations - each level is unique and made me feel different, so I can say level designers and the artists have done their work perfectly.

Few things I didn't like:
1. Wish the game was longer.
2. Wish the epilogue was warmer as the latest feeling really matters and in my opinion it should be more cosy.
3. I had huge FPS drop somewhere in icy caverns near the end. I restarted the game and it continued fine.

Besides of the above 3 points this game is really worth each cent I've payed and each second I spent on it - beautiful atmospheric locations, music, gameplay and the story made me feel like I was there and just returned from this magical journey. So I definitely recommend it."
9415,"the story is short and simple, but sweet"
9416,"What I played of this game I loved, the art was neat, the characters strangely cute, and hurtling through the air with a laser grappling hook was awesome. Unfrotunately I only got past the first ""boss"" when the game repeatedly crashed with no solution and/or reason why it did so. I did every fix I could think of but nothing helped. I was also unable to change my mouse sensitivity (I perfer very sensitive settings) but every time I exited the menu the sensitivity would change whenever I moved my mouse meaning it was incredibly sensitive one minute and unresponsive the next. When you have to be precise over bottomless pits constantly shifting sensitivities is not fun. It only happened towards the end of my experience but still was incredibly annoying. I want to give this game a good review but I can't."
9417,This has got to be one of the most beautiful games Ive ever played. Super chill and relaxing with fantastic movement and stunning visuals. I would've paid full price but was lucky to get on sale. Would recommend to everyone. 10/10
9418,"A short fun/challenging experience with interesting mechanics and a compelling story that will make you ask for more. I deeply recommend this game for everyone in general. 




.... (Gone North games, I want a sequel)"
9419,"This game is simply great. Very fun with quite unique and challenging gameplay giving at least 3-6 hours of fun. The story is also very interesting which is quite suprising considering how short the game is... The ending was very good. 

Overall : 

+ Great Visuals 
+ Fun gameplay 
+ Interesting Story 

- Maddie's Challenge really took it out of me! 
- Short story 
- Some glitches here and there

7.5/10."
9420,"What can I say about this game that you can't already hear anywhere else?

The characters, as few as there may be, are incredibly engaging and serve to draw you further into the story with every word they speak. The settings have such great range each with their own spectacular vibrance you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere else. The audio and soundtrack has this light and airy, almost ethereal sound at most points throughout the game that really sell the notion of this fantastical new world you've stumbled upon. The movement controls are perfectly calibrated; there's rarely ever a moment where you feel cheated out of something. ([i]The grappling itself, however, can be a touch finicky at times with smaller contact points.[/i]) And the ending... [i]oh, the ending.[/i] So touching. After my first complete run of the game, I was surprised to find that the studios behind Goat Simulator and Sanctum were behind the making of this game. It's a complete tonal shift from either of the aforementioned titles, and I think it's a shift to much more suitable territories.

The game also boasts a fair amount of challenge, both within the main story as well as with the addition of the time trials; completing them within the allotted time frame will require not only strict memorization of the maps, some of which can be incredibly frustrating to navigate at times ([i]looking at you, Ice Caves[/i]), but also a mastery of sprinting, jumping and grappling to cut any corner you can and save as many seconds as possible. Some of the challenge within the game is also self-imposed, in a sense, as nothing you're told to do within the game besides the obvious is necessary to complete the game itself. Anything you do beyond what's already necessary is for your own benefit and accomplishment...

...and it's here that I have my only major gripe with the game: the unlockables. They are completely optional for you to use and activate in-game, but they'll be earned once you earn your first ten collectibles and every five thereafter for a total of twenty-five. And while the ability to [spoiler]change your beam color[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Midas Mode[/spoiler] are innocuous enough and don't actively help or hinder you, [spoiler]Goat Mode[/spoiler] can become annoying after extended use, and [spoiler]Acrobatic Mode[/spoiler] can be downright nauseating after the novelty wears off a few jumps later. Of course, like I said, these are merely add-ons; they're totally optional, they contribute very little, and they're otherwise harmless.

To make a long story short, if you're a fan of exploratory games with a few sprinkled-in puzzle elements, this game is definitely worth your time as either a casual player or a would-be speedrunner. I write this review as the game is on sale for 80% off, but regardless, I believe it's worth its reasonable full price and you'll easily get an hour of gameplay for every dollar you pay for it. Even if you're not immediately sold on playing it for yourself, watch someone else play it to really take in the breathtaking scenery and stunning soundtrack. I promise, you won't be disappointed."
9421,"Good game but it doesnt work well here is why:
Every time I tried to use the glove some times I had to click fking 7 times and that made me fall a lot and waste my powers quickly that was 80% of my deaths for, it is normal on dificulty, but with those fking gloves that dont work it is 10 times harder, at the end there is this part where it is so hard because it is difficult and so long, and if you die right before ending it you come back completelly to the beggining, frustrating but it looks good, I got it with 80% discount so what can I say, if it werent for the controllers that kept failing (it was not my mouse) I would give it 10/10 but because of this 7/10, at the end of the story I felt sad because of the memorial and the fact they never saw him again, good story, good graphics, but the gloves dont work at all dammit."
9422,"I ever watched it on one of youtuber in my country, but he played only in the first village (sorry i forgot the name). And about 2 days ago, i saw this game is on sale, it's around 20k IDR, i bought it just because i curious about this game, and when i play it for my first minute like ""wow, it's a beautiful game"". with this genre i loved it so much, it really fun to play, sometimes i failed to finish the stage, and feels like ""ahh let's try again at least till i finished this stage"".

if you want to play a fun game with beautiful graphic, buy this game, it's worth (when it's on discount XD). Why? cause i finished it after around 3 hours gameplay, maybe u can finish it faster, but belive me, you'll feel like ""ahh let's stay here and walking around for a few minutes"" XD

that's for me, sorry for bad english, that's not my primary laguage in my country, but i just try :D and sorry for a bad review, my first review in steam tho^^~"
9423,Had a few extra dollars in my steam wallet to burn and I picked up this game. However short the game has a very nice story and smooth mechanics to make it very appealing. I would definitly recommend this game.
9424,"I never write reviews, but I had to write one for this game...this is up there with my favorite games. The storyline is amazing, the world is gorgeous, and it challenges you to the very end. 10/10. The mechanics can be really challenging, but it makes it interesting."
9425,"This game is so relaxing.....its a must, such a gorgeous game, storyline, narrator voices and so on

EDIT: Just finished the game.....its a masterpiece...i am waiting for a part 2 if they ever think of making one"
9426,"So basically your creepy bearded uncle loves little frog girls and flying around with weird plasma-laser-beam thingies in super dangerous, oftentimes creepy places (there's an ice part, and im assuming that's where he hides all of the frog people that he doesn't like.. prolly in some sort of ice dungeon). I guess that's pretty normal o.O

Overall though, 8.5/10. It was fun flying around in lala land with frog girl. She leaves like midway or so cause some people complimented her crystal lightbulb contraption, and she gets all flattered and shit, which is kind of emotional and whatnot, but I didn't cry cause I.. nah I teared up a bit, but like whatever I'm allowed to have emotions okay. Visually speaking, the scenerey is often gorgeus and super vibrant. I suggest putting on some music as things can get kinda tedious and frustrating at times. Oh also, bonus note - If you are able to successfully complete frog girl's challenge, Idk what happens but probably something amazing..."

9428,"The game is short and sweet, but the mechanics are fantastic, and the game is beautiful."
9429,"A Story About My Uncle is a humble, sweet little game that takes you for an unexpected, albeit short, ride. The premise is simple and easy to understand, the setting is immersive and breathtaking, and the characters are endearing and compelling to learn about. I found it to be a unique and interesting blend between a puzzle game and a spicy drop of speedrun thrown into the mix to give you a sense of challenge. The message is uplifting, and I was left feeling intrigued and pleasantly satisfied. If you're looking for a quiet but thought-provoking first-person adventure, A Story About My Uncle is one to put on your wishlist."
9430,"Beautiful story, rarely has digital entertainment made me this hooked to a story. Truly, an adventure novel."
9431,"It just isn't interesting. Competent story, but nothing more. Levels come and go, getting more difficult and longer times between checkpoints, but never grating. It just isn't worth playing."
9432,9/11
9433,"+interesting game
+story
+run/jump without hurt
+graphic
+find hidden collectable for unlocking
-sometimes is hard
-short
-hard to get at least one achievement"
9434,"It's hard, but it's interesting, and we need chinese."
9435,"Beautiful game with refreshing platformer mechanics...loved it.
The only bad point is the short duration of the game, but overall it's totally worth on sales."
9436,Who?
9437,"It's aight, nothing amazing though."
9438,"Good game, short but sweet"
9439,"Charming, elegant, and utterly fantastic. The mechanics are simple and responsive, but you never quite feel in total control... And that's a good thing. The level design will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you'll find yourself groaning and grimacing with every jump as you nervously await your fate... At ¬£1.99 in the current sale, this is an absolute steal!"
9440,"Fresh and intresting story, fun gameplay. Thats all I ask for in a casual game an this game delivers. I love it, I can sit back and shut down my brain and just play it for hours, also decent replay value.
I wont reccomend it at its asking price, but as soon as you can get it on 30% off or more, BUY IT!"
9441," A Story About My Uncle is a pleasurable suprise. I went into the game not knowing what to expect and worried specifically about depth. This never really became a problem, althought the game is obviously a lower budget then some, they pulled off a fun, well paced story adventure without a single moment of combat. The story telling is nice.(kept me hooked for the most part) The voice acting was OK, the narrator wasnt bad at all. A problem I had was telling the different between the daughter or madeline at times, but that was probably due to the fact my attention was pulled else where. Overall the game was the right length, had fun game play and a nice story. It took about 4  hours to complete and has some extras in there aswell. Id go with a steady 8/10, with a higher budget and a little more life in the enviorment id bump it to a 8.5.
Thanks for the game!"
9442,"I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!! I have only played for an hour or so, but it already has an amazing storyline (the game isn't centered around the story, you can explore). GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

9444,"Just got the game for $2.59 and beat in about a few hours. I really liked the game, I'm glad I bought and played it, but I think I would have been upset with the length if I had paid full price for it. Overall, my feeling is, it was nice. Really nice controls, a nice story and... okay the graphics fall a little short of nice, but I liked it."
9445,"I would only recommend this on sale really, I beat in in 102 mins, which isnt really worth the 13 dollars. they could have had a better ending and the monotone voice of the main character is really really annoying. it was fun for a little bit and none of the puzzle get to a point where you have to sit and think. it is a good looking game but wasnt for me."
9446,"Well not a bad game not a great one. I was excepting more from this game from the people who make this so holic. Cartoonish style is not bad but not good enough though, I like more this style in Telltale games series actually.

You can try this game if you really wonder it."
9447,Its good
9448,gameplay is a blast and world is pretty. story is very simple and boring.
9449,A must have for all leafy clones.
9450,"This is a really awesome game, great story, great platforming and mechanics. Havent played a game like it but, its really short. Too short, for $12. Id suggest getting this while on sale and save some money."
9451,"The game was brilliant. Despite a few times I got lost while glitching my way though something, the game was very good at telling you where to go and giving you the power to get there. The game did lag but that probably says more about my computer than the game. Also there are several glitches but none that hurt the experience."
9452,"Good: Unconventional platformer. Wholesome story.
Bad: Maddie was annoying, I wanted to throw her out of a helicopter."
9453,"Really surprisingly fun game, some of the best first person platforming I've ever played. The different mechanics work really well, and the physics are good.

Don't play this if you are big on easy acheivements, if you aren't following a guide they aren't going to be prevalent. That said, if you don't really care about 'em, then you should jump in.

A word of warning. There's a late game difficulty spike that is epic. Truly, the first ~70% of the game requires some finesse, but nothing crazy, then suddenly you need to be on your game. Luckily the checkpoints are mostly pretty good, but there were more than a couple times I was nearly sweating from tension.

If you like grappling hooks and platforming, you will likely enjoy this game."
9454,Very fun and entertaining storyline Its a bit short tho.
9455,"This game is an amazing piece of work. But let's start with the cons.
Cons:
- Short! 
I finished it within 3 hours, which is a fair gametime for this kind of games, but it leaves you with a sensation of ""Is this it?"".
I would not mind payed DLCs or additional content, more worlds to explore. You not always need more ways of solving a puzzle, or harder puzzles, sometimes the world and the plot are enough and here we come to the pros.
Pros:
- Story - the story is really catching - it's not a sad nor utterly childish story, it's just interesting and opening quite much possibilities - it will take you in.
- Gameplay - this part is well done - puzzles, movement - all working perfect and adding to the story.
- Soundtrack and Voice actors - those people did their job well :)

So I do recommend this to everyone that is looking for a game but doesn't really find anything interessting...I was looking for games, starting dozens of them, almost never finishing any. Give this one a chance, you won't regret it, you will just start missing it once you finish."
9456,Aliens!!
9457,"Fun, but that frog thing on my back almost drove me to tears"
9458,"A Story About My Uncle definitely merits a recommendation for its liberating and varied movement and incredibly detailed and fascinating worlds, but its a game that really begins to crack when it's played for any reason other than leisure.

Overall, my recommendation for this game is explicitly geared towards sitting down and playing this game comfortably. Once you actually start to go for achievements or the time trials, the flaws of this game are heavily highlighted and actually start to become unbearable, which is an experience that I would not recommend.

That being said, this game is incredibly short. I played through this game very leisurely my first time through and really took the time to soak in the environments and explore areas that I thought were interesting, and it was only about two hours. Those two hours were fairly captivating, although I honestly don't know if the asking price is equal to the amount of enjoyment derived from playing. I would highly suggest buying this game on sale, since I think that otherwise, there are just better alternatives to A Story About My Uncle."
9459,"This Game has really good mechanics truly, the storyline is short I've only 3hrs put into the game but I've done every level twice that's something I really wish was longer to be honest as the movements and mechanics are so well I could've Easily played 50hrs of new levels really easily on this game and not ever get bored I love the way the suit works and the way there's hidden challenges one doesn't notice tell later down the road so one goes back and completes them yes i like this game the only thing I wish was better is that it was longer."
9460,lit
9461,Great game! the story was really good and the gameplay was even better
9462,Interesting story and fun gameplay mechanics.
9463,Um..blue people
9464,"Amazing game which takes around 4-5 hours t o complete, well worth the money when on sale!"
9465,"Gr8 Game for gameplay
"
9466,"Really enjoyed this, I don't know how long it had taken me to finish the game. Had to update my lappy before it was able to get through the cave section at the end. Some places had me scratching my head at where to go to and then you can see a glimpse of light off in the distance where you need to get to. The story had me entertained."
9467,"Who doesn't like mega jumping and grappling around with a powerful suit without taking fall damage? Come on, take my money! 

Oh, it was a great adventure. No seriously, the atmosphere, the story and the almost challenging parkours will drag you out of your own world into this one for a couple of hours. This is one of the most accurate moments where I dare say ""Worth every penny!""."
9468,"The game is nice but the price doesn't justify 3-4 hours of game time. Get it only when there's a discount.

If you are into Portal-like platformers, this is a short little game with a cute story for you. You get sort of a grapplinghook and build momentum to swing around platforms. There aren't any puzzles, but there are collectibles if you are into that sort of thing.

Maybe the game can be extended by going for a trial mode or going after all collectibles, but even with a little bit of exploring I couldn't get more than 4 hours out of it. There also isn't that much to explore and interact with. Collectibles are always sort of hidden either beneath you or on the side of a distant platform which is easily skippable. There are no enemies in this game. No penalty for dying.

The graphics are relatively decent.

Narration is very good."
9469,"I played this game, and beat it in three days. I have to say it is a beautiful game, although short. 

Pros:

-Fun and challenging game play
-beautiful scenery
-good ending, despite being a short game

Cons:

-character graphics are a bit out of date
-the gameplay is short, and it would be fun to have some expansion


Overall I would say that if you want a fun game, thats relatively relaxing, it is a good buy."
9470,The narrative and voice acting was pretty hilarious at times but aside from that - was an absolute winner.
9471,"This game is wonderfully beautiful. I'm not usually into platformers, but this was a marvellous change!"
9472,Crappy controls ruin this game. It should have been good but the devs don't know how to do physics engine programming correctly. The 'hitboxes' are either too small or inconsistent. Too much trial and error is involved to do the jumps which are the central core of the gameplay. Constantly failing by no fault of your own is the death of any game.
9473,This game has a great story. Would defiently reccomend if you like shorter story games.
9474,The story mode is unfortunately only 2 hours long but it is a great game nonetheless!
9475,"Fun platformer with interesting mechanics and a good plot, the gameplay is always testing the limits of your abilities"
9476,"This is a fun game. The environment designs look really nice, and the gameplay is fun. The  character design is a little bit strange, but that's kind of a small issue in this game."
9477,"The game itself, was short. Finished it in little over 3 hours. But there are collectibles. Alot of collectibles. I recommend buying it just for the mechanics."
9478,"Story:8 / 10
Gameplay:8 / 10
Replayability: limited

A short game, with some amazing dedication from the dev. though because of the the way the story was told, replaying this game would be very bland, although you might want to replay with to unlock the bonus content"
9479,The story is pretty boring and you do the same thing over and over again through out the game.
9480,This game has great mechanics and in my playthrough I did not find a single bug in the game. The story and gameplay are absolutly amazing and you should really have a loook at it.
9481,Leafy made me buy this.
9482,"NIce but short game, would recommend to buy it on a sale.
It was beautiful but with some wonky animations."
9483,"Beautiful game, just not for me, get dizzy on first person view...
Player have to look/turn camera often to do jump"
9484,10/10 Worth the time playing it.

[i]Skip to the bottom for my Final Thoughts[/i]


A Story About My Uncle is a first person adventure platformer by Gone North Games, the same developers behind Goat Simulator. You must jump, grapple, and rocket boot your way through amazing locations in order to find your Uncle Fred.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle (which I will now on abbreviate to ASAMU) is an extraordinarily beautiful game for a US $12.99 indie title. The worlds/levels you must traverse are outstanding. From dark icy caves to floating islands, the art department at Gone North Games have my complete respect for the way they were able to construct such a beautiful world. The only complaint I have regarding visuals would be the humanoid creatures you encounter (the Villagers and the Strays). Although they don't look too good, they aren't a major part of the game and you can avoid them for the most part if you'd like. 

[h1]Audio & Soundtrack[/h1]
The soundtrack for ASAMU is for the most part really well done. I quite enjoy the Main Theme of ASAMU as it really sets the tone for the game; an adventure game with a deep sentimental backstory. Most of the music in the ASAMU soundtrack is extremely adventurous enhances the adventure atmosphere of the game. I don't really like the music in the Caves (the first few levels of the game) but the music only improves more and more after you emerge from the dark caves. Overall the music is really well done.

The voice acting, however, is in my opinion poorly done. The voice acting for the main character and his daughter were pretty well done and I quite enjoyed listening to their voices. The voices of  pretty ever other character in the game were godawful. I couldn't stand their voices, and I often wished that they would get to the point.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Oh my, what do I even say about the gameplay. What I can say from the getgo, however, is that the gameplay of ASAMU had me HOOKED! I absolutely love the feeling of intense freedom and adventure when you grapple and fly through the air across mystical islands and caves. I really enjoy the artificial feeling of zipping through the skies and finding your way across the expansive worlds. ASAMU is a platformer game unlike no other platformer. You have the power of magical crystals at your disposal, allowing you to jump great heights, grapple, and rocket boot your way towards your long-lost uncle. After beating ASAMU, I found myself constantly craving another game to quall my lust for more adventure.

My only complaint with the gameplay aspect of the game is that I often get lost in the huge levels. There aren't any markers that point you to where you are supposed to go, so you can find yourself at the start of the level by accident like I did many times.

[h1]Storyline[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle isn't really a story about the protaganists uncle. It is however, a story about your adventure finding your uncle, an adventurer who found his way into a new world (which is all I'm going to explain without spoiling the story). ASAMU is a rather short game. I managed to beat the game in 2-3 hours with the rest of my time either idling or replaying levels that I really enjoyed. I feel like the story was really hindered by the poor voice acting but the exposition delivered by the main character and his daughter are sufficient in getting the point of the story across. You play as a father retelling the story of him travelling to another world to save his uncle who had been missing for quite some time. Along the way you meet many different people and traverse incredible areas. ASAMU is truly a story to experience if you can get past the voice acting.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Overall I really enjoyed ASAMU. If you enjoy First Person Platformers or Platformers in general, I think you'd have a blast in ASAMU. The game is rather short and pretty easy to beat, so if you don't have too much time to play then I suggest you try out ASAMU. Although there is no sequel or prequel to ASAMU, you can replay levels to reaquaint yourself with jumping through the skies.

Rating:
Graphics: 8.4/10
Audio: 7.2/10
Gameplay: 9.0/10
Overall: 8.2/10

9486,"it's very long and draged out it's very boring...
"
9487,This is the most enjoyable parkour game I've played. Parkours are neither too hard nor too easy. It also has a nice story.
9488,"A story about my uncle is not an amazing story that will leave you hanging on every word. But it is a whole lot of fun, with great level design and game mechanics. It will take the average person between 2-4 hours depending on your skill level. So my only complaint is the game isn't long enough, and the story is pretty basic. That said, it is definitely worth the buy. As the 2-4 hours will be really enjoyable and there is replay value."
9489,"Well, this game is awesome. The puzzles are nice, the challenges challenging and the story okay. But I can't help myself to notice, that there is a big amount of levels missing in this game. Right before the last level it just felt like the devs decided to make the game shorter, than it was supposed to be. Another thing, that wasn't cool was the outro. There are many glitches at the end. Most of the levels got the problem, that you could land on a little invisible corner, instead of dying by falling down a cliff. That made most of the challenging levels a little too easy. Another point were the boots...they just made the game too easy. 

But still this game is awesome. If you have any kids, buy this game, because it is fun and kids-friendly."
9490,"I wanted to love this game, and I did love it for the first few levels. But it requires insanely fast reflexes, good timing, and about 50% luck to play the last level or two. I wish there would have been a bit more strategy instead of ""how fast can you click on tiny rocks while you're falling"" gameplay"
9491,"Great game to both speed run and play casually. Rather unique setting and gameplay make it a worthy purchase, give it a try!

PROS:
- Great gameplay
- Great replay value
- Fun setting and story
- Appeals to both speed runners and casual players
- Nice visuals and solid performance

CONS:
- Pretty short"
9492,"it is a short game cant lie but i like the story and game play.
good play for sure"
9493,Fantastic!
9494,"I love this game, it's a batch of freash air amongs the seemingly similar game nowadays, both visually and gameplay. I feel however that the game is way too short, you can do it in one night.

Good game, too short"
9495,The game has good action and stimulate people thinking. It is good overally though the environment is a bit repeatitive sometimes. Definitely worth the price.
9496,Uncle didn't touch me 0/10inaccurate
9497,"A fun mechanic that doesn't get boring, can a bit annoying when you can't hit the jump just right and you can replay the levels to perfection."
9498,It¬¥s a very short but buatiful and fun game. I played it through in one run and it¬¥s woth playing it again from time to time. It¬¥s not exiting but still very good for playing when you are tired and dot want the stress from playing othergames. Definitly recommendet
9499,"A story about my uncle, this game would be on my top 20's favorite games of all time. I loved the story, and over all loved the game."
9500,"The best way I can describe is the Portal gun meets Bioshock: Infinite's open sky atmospherics. The gameplay is built around a unique hand-grappling aparatus to locomote and solve spatial puzzles. whilst providing a relaxed and visually stunning tableau. If those invocations can't persuade you to give it a try, there's not much point saying more."
9501,reaklly faking gogood!
9502,"A really beautiful and short game. It takes a while to get used to the controls, but they're pretty easy to use. It took me just a few hours to complete my second run through. The landscapes are really amazing, too. And after you finish the game, you can play each stage as a time trial. Overall, it's a pretty and peaceful game to waste some time on. Great for relieving stress."
9503,Great game but too damned short! I was really longing for more after this emotional and fun ride. I can easily recommend this game to anyone who likes jump and runs and a emotional story. The game is basically the good parts of a walking simulator combined with a great jump and run but sadly only lasts for about two hours.
9504,one hundred thousand out of ten
9505,"A fun platformer, though it can be frustratingly difficult at times. The story was fun to follow :)"
9506,"With a quite innovative central mechanic, this game has some interesting bits of gameplay to enjoy. The grapple system is indeed fun to play with, but rather than offering you a more open environment in which the experiment, the game forces you along a series of linear platform routes where the challenge is in precisely controlling your movement. While this is not a huge issue alone, in combination with the dull sound effects and boring, virtually non-existent music it makes the game somewhat tedious to play for an extended period. Sure, the game has a cute, friendly art style, but this atmosphere it attempts to cultivate clashes with the bland, minimalist audio and linear puzzles. You might enjoy this more if you are more interested in first-person platforming than I am."
9507,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_Fgjq7AENM

9508,Amazing story based parkour game that is something very original and was done extremely well. I don't think we'll see something like this again. Stunning!
9509,worth the time worth the price the ending was fantastic! 8/10
9510,"Short, but fun parkour platformer thing."
9511,Amazing!
9512,"This was a really great game! The story telling and voice acting is stellar and the gameplay is smooth, entertaining, and a tad chalenginghere and there. I lost track of time and ended up playing through the whole game in about 3 or 4 hours. It isn't the longest game, but i think that is perfectly fine. This was quite the adventure!"
9513,Gud game!
9514,"This game is amazing, short, but has beautiful graphics"
9515,"A decent enough first-person platformer that's occasionally frustrating.  The frustration mostly stems from the first-person perspective, which often makes it difficult to gauge distances.  This will likely be the cause of a lot of your failures in the game.   

For the most part, the game does a good job of showing you where you need to go next, although a few of the areas have parts where it's tough to tell where your next destination is.  The gameplay itself is simple but solid.  There's no combat.  You have your grapple glove, which slowly allows more grapples per jump as the game progresses (starting with one and ending with three), and a few new gameplay mechanics are introduced later in the game such as rocket boots and crystals that can recharge your glove while in mid-air.  

The story was just kind of there.  It's not awful, but not really memorable either.  The voice acting isn't great.  Not offensively bad or anything, but like the story it's just kind of there.  Visually it's fine.  Character models look pretty terrible but the backgrounds, while not incredible, look fine and have a unique kind of pseudo-fantasy art design.  Given that this is obviously not a high-budget game, though, the graphical issues are forgiveable. 

The game is also short (I beat it in just under three bucks), although if you want all the achievements you're probably in for a rough ride and it will probably take multiple playthroughs and a considerably longer span of time.  I personally didn't bother.

Should you buy it?  At thirteen bucks (the current non-sale price as of the writing of this review), I'd probably pass unless you're in desperate need of a puzzle/platformer.  Grab it on a Steam sale."
9516,great game leafy is here plays it so thats the only downside
9517,"So I just finished this game. Well I felt that I took an eternity to finish it. The Best thing on this game is how the Story is procedurally told and This feeling of freedom when we use the Grapple Device However, I also felt that at some points this game was repetitive and Levels were just going quickly with the same shapes sadly which leads you to quickly change the game. Well I'll give this game a : 7.5/10 mainly because the excellent story-telling, the gameplay isn't that good."
9518,"[h1]A Story About My Uncle[/h1]

Is actually a story about the narrator‚Äôs uncle told as a bedtime story to a small child. Said uncle is a brilliant scientist ‚Äì a whimsical and even-tempered version of Uncle Quentin from the Famous Five books. A blackboard in his abandoned house reveals that he has built some kind of waste disposal system possibly powered by starlight. The story begins as the child version of the narrator enters the garbage disposal dimension rift thingummy to go looking for him.

The actual game is a first-person platformer set in a world of floating rocks. You trail your uncle through these environments using a fantastical suit that features a magical grappling hook and shock absorbers which stop you hurting yourself on landing. Later on you‚Äôll also find some jet-propelling boots which you can use to boost across greater distances. The controls are intuitive ‚Äì using the mouse buttons you charge the suit‚Äôs jump ability and shoot out grapple beams, and hitting space activates the boots.

Traversing the spaces is the best part of the game ‚Äì when it works it‚Äôs an absolute pleasure to be sailing from grapple spot to grapple spot. At a later point in the story, zapping glowing crystals with your glove will offer extra grapple charges so you can whizz about for even longer without landing. In this you start to see ASAMU as having the makings of a compulsive time trial game. Gone North Games aren‚Äôt entirely oblivious to this either and, once you complete the game, the extras menu offers up something of that kind ‚Äì timed levels stripped of any narrative. Beautiful grapple beam playgrounds, although ones which would benefit from clearer signposting.

When playing the main game you‚Äôre not nearly so free to move around. The segments you‚Äôll find in the time trials are still there but now interspersed with exposition and interactions with other characters. The main companion is Maddie; a kind of half-frog, half-child. She‚Äôs adventurous and skilled at building technology using the mysterious crystals which litter the world. However, her skills aren‚Äôt valued by her village and so she feels like an outsider, especially since her friend ‚Äì your uncle ‚Äì has disappeared. 
I liked Maddie as a character, and I enjoyed the conclusion to her story arc as she tags along with you. It didn‚Äôt stop her from being incredibly annoying along the way, though. For example, there‚Äôs a segment which her character dares you to complete without using the hook. I kept messing it up and she delivers the same smug ‚ÄúTold you you couldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù every time. My fault for messing it up but having a variety of voice lines for that fail state would have made the experience far less grating.

There are other problems with the voice acting ‚Äì some with delivery, some with sense. The Gone North team is based in Stockholm and the narrator of the game sounds like Sweden‚Äôs answer to William Shatner, with all the unexpected syllable stresses that entails. It oscillates between being endearing and annoyingly distracting. In terms of meaning, some of the lines don‚Äôt quite make sense or read in ways which weren‚Äôt intended. My favourite being when the narrator‚Äôs daughter was sympathising with Maddie:

Daughter: ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt have a real father right, if she was born from an egg?‚Äù
Narrator: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another thing we had in common.‚Äù

But there are also some lovely moments, like when the daughter is telling her dad about her friend who wants to marry a vampire ‚Äì his stilted response involves just the right level of awkward parental incomprehension.

The story itself is a gentle one, as befits the bedtime story conceit. It‚Äôs a journey through a strange land rather than an adrenaline-fueled adventure. You wander a very pretty landscape, occasionally finding objects to investigate so you can pick up backstory. There are pacing issues ‚Äì the game feels front-loaded in terms of narrative and in terms of varied content. Early on there are different environments to explore and even the threat of a monster in one of the sequences. The later game is mostly about navigating ice caves on your own. 
The bedtime story framing does throw up some conceptual oddities though. It works for films because the narrative moves forward constantly. When it‚Äôs a game you can get stuck repeating a section over and over and start wondering if your responses to this situation are influencing the tale being told. Perhaps the next morning in my narrator‚Äôs household there was the following exchange:

Narrator: ‚ÄúGood morning, is there any orange juice left?‚Äù
[Narrator‚Äôs partner glares]
Narrator: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù
Narrator‚Äôs partner: ‚ÄúWhile telling our daughter an otherwise charming bedtime story did you insert an angry and repetitive half-hour rant about grappling hook beams and stalactites?‚Äù
Narrator: ‚ÄúErr, why do you ask?‚Äù
Narrator‚Äôs partner: ‚ÄúBecause this morning she asked what stalactites were and what the C-word meant.‚Äù

The most frustrating thing about needing to repeat any of the sections is the checkpointing. It‚Äôs often slightly further back than necessary and so you have to repeatedly navigate an easy chunk before you get to the main section which is giving you trouble. I want to dive back into the challenging bit of the puzzle as easily as possible. Moving the checkpoints slightly or adding more of them would solve that frustration. Another addition which would have been welcome is if Gone North had included a wider selection of routes to explore. The grapple hook and jet boots are a simple-but-cool combination and I‚Äôd really like to have seen the developers explore their potential.

Ultimately, A Story About My Uncle is a pleasant but wobbly experience which only takes a few hours to finish. The checkpointing can be a frustration, the voicework is idiosyncratic, the prettiness can tip over into twee-ness and the story‚Äôs conclusion lacks punch. In the moments when it finds its feet you get glimpses of a pretty platformer with a great sense of momentum. It‚Äôs a shame, then, that the way the action and the other elements of the game are integrated keeps stopping that momentum dead."
9519,"Beautiful game, amazing gameplay, great storyline. I'd say it's a great game to kill some time and relax with."
9520,"Some of the most fun locomotion in any game I've played. The story isn't much, but it's enough to keep you going. More fun than expected."
9521,"awesomeness
"
9522,gg
9523,It's a great game with an incredible gameplay and an incredible story. 10 out of 10.
9524,"Pro's:
Short: Only the last hour is challenging, roughly 3 Hours as a whole. But the amount you play is enough.
Beautifyl: Great Art Direction
Parkour: Feels amazing, Gameplay is very fun.

Con's:
Voice Acting: Cringy 90% of times, dialogue is just badly written
Repetitive gameplay. Has ""Chasing the Dragon"" syndrome, you get wrapped up on gameplay but you feel like your just chasing a goal for no reason.
Bugs everywhere, you will fall on your own accord or the game's.

Extra Notes
Ending was Ok, you play the whole game leading you to a big reveal or surprise. Don't hype yourself, it is very sweet but nothing hefty. This game feels like a great project from talented people that just needed a little bit more polish. What they promise in the screen shots and video is great, the grappling feels amazing & the graphics are very enjoyable. Everything else is either frustrating or lackluster.

Would reccomend if you find it on sale. All things considered, for every thing that I like about the game, there is something I don't like."
9525,"(Recieved as a Gift)
As I am Writing This I currently have 4 hours on the Game
Good game Challenge/Puzzle/Surfing

Pros:
Fun Gameplay
Good Storyboard
Challenging
Long Lasting

Cons;
Graphics
A Bit Over Priced But Worth It"
9526,"Great game, I didn't like the ending very much but other than that i really enjoyed this game. Didn't like how short this game was though. Could and will replay this game many times in the future."
9527,"Incredible game. 
The end could have been slightly better.

8/10"
9528,"Game play is awesome I would get it just for that, the story is good, although the ending is not what I was hoping."
9529,super nice game with lots of cool gameplay
9530,"A very atmospheric game, nice enviroments...you slightly loose yourself when playing this game.
Gameplay is overall simple, but also has some tricky parts. When its not hard enough you can still try on achievemnts (like beat this lvl in 2 mins or so). Doesnt need much time to finish, but very enjoyable for the time being."
9531,"Fav platformer since Crash Bandicoot, 10/10 would hit stalactites with face again"
9532,A truly great platformer and beautiful game
9533,"The movement mechanics are very immersive - as your abilities increase, so does the difficulty. It's enough to be challenging, but not too much to be impossible (that being said, it might take you a few tries to get your jump timing right).

The attention to graphical detail is astounding in every way - not only NPCs, foreground elements, and items you interact with, but also the scenery and backdrops... Everything is just breathtaking. I really enjoyed the narrative story style, but it was on the short side - I went through the story in 2-3 hours. It should have been longer - this game deserves it!

In short, if you like first-person parkour games and want something you can play start-to-finish in one sitting, then this is the game for you!"
9534,"Fantastic game!! I can say that if comparing to the price they offer us. I bought this game because it is about puzzle and adventure, and as people know I love adventure game so much. Bad two thing for this game are the story and zero gravity. Story isn't that bad, but it lacks of storyline. Player will get board after 2 hrs, but for me I really enjoy scenerio and puzzle instead. Second as I mentioned is gravity - it seems to make this game easier, but once when you're floating on the air, you cannot even control direction well. I would recap this game is worth their price. If you like puzzle and adventurous type; check this game out you won't be regreted."
9535,KUL
9536,I like this game a lot.  I first found out about this game.... watching famous youtuber leafy is here who plays it in the background of his videos.  I thought got to get that game.  It is a lot of fun and can be very challenging as the game progresses.  It has a deep storyline in my opinion and the gameplay is unlike anything I have previously played.  Its not a blockbuster title you will not spend years playing.  Its a indie title and is worth the time you do decide to put in.
9537,"I beat it!  This game was awesome.  It is a platformer with grappling hooks and good graphics.  One of my best Steam sales purchases ever!!!

I do have a couple gripes...
The narrorator was absolutely terrible.  Killed the story.  I volunteer my time and voice to the development team ro redo the voice work.  It was monotone and not a bedtime story to a child or the sound of an adventurer...  My other minor gripe is the achievements.  I like going to achievements and looking how far I made it in the game compared to the world.  I earned zero achievements... zero.  I beat the game... zero.  Each of the over three hour long (multipe check points thank goodness) levels deserves an achievement.... just so I know how many people made it that far.  With this game it could also be fun to have some kind of leaderboard for how many times people died in each level.  

Great game guys!  I am greedy and want a little bit more."
9538,"great game, worth the price, and that ending tho, :D u just have to buy it and see it for your self <3"
9539,"The thing is, you could play this game for hours on the same level and you would never get bored of it. To add on to it, the game itself has a decent story and time race mode. I love this game in almost every way so I give it a 7/10"
9540,Good game but too short
9541,"Pros: 
Awesome Mechanics
Looks Good

Animations on characters can be very choppy

8.5/10"
9542,"If it was just a bit cheaper, i would like it much more, but overall its a really fun FPS platformer, which isn't difficult but provides a peaceful experience. The game is exactly what it looks like in the trailers, and there is no deception at all. Theres a main story, and then a time trial thing. It's good fun when you play."
9543,"A Story About My Uncle is an excellent game. Nice and soothing graphics, interesting storyline, and fun gameplay.
The game itself is rather short, and can be completed by someone new in around 2 hours. However the achievements are a different story, and are actually quite hard to get.

The only cons I have with this game is the non-skippable dialog. It is only worth your time to listen to it once on your first playthrough. If you are trying to get acheivements for each map then on 3 out of 5 you will have to listen to around 2-4 minutes of dialog each time. 

Also someone needs to get Maddie a toilet. She walks as if she has a diaper on that is full of her salamander shit."
9544,9/10 Chill Spicy
9545,"The game is challenging, but is extremely short. I have completed the game in under two hours, the game is amazing, but definately not worth the money for it."
9546,i likes dis gaim. dis gaim is pritty gud.
9547,"I absolutely loved this game.  There were times when I was really frustrated, but after taking breaks, I would come back and figure it out.  Very enjoyable, beautiful graphics, nice little storyline."
9548,"A short and sweet first-person platformer/rollercoaster!
While the gameplay itself is thrilling, the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing.
Featuring a sad and heartfelt story with decent voice-acting."
9549,"Just an amazing little game.

The story is uncomplicated and heartwarming, bringing me back to the creatures from games when I was younger, reminding me specifically of Little Big Adventure  2. 

The gameplay is fluent and has a close to perfect increment in the challenges presented, forcing you to gradually implement all the possible maneuvers at your disposal as you go.

So; good fluent gameplay and a lovely story and world around it. Treat yourself to a little break and get it :)"
9550,"This game is definitely very short, but also very worth it. It had such a great, clam, story. It had challenging obstacles and had gotten stuck a few times myself. It also is extremely beautiful! I highly reccomend this game!"
9551,"Fun but incredibly short story, excellent mechanics but falls short. No support for community maps, which would really make this game legendary."
9552,"This game if beaufiul and is such a lovely world. Very like Bioshock infinite. 
Its a pity but I dont think i can recommend it. 
It has very pernickety gameplay. 
The rocket boots that you get later in the game didn't work for me
Yet in youtube videos they seem to work for other players
I dont know if its a bug but it kinda ruined the game for me. 
Some people may like the frustrations. 
For example its not always obvious what direction you should go next in the game.

Be aware , its not a game for everyone."
9553,"One of the best story oriented games I've ever played, the graphics are amazing too, hell there's nothing bad about this game at all. P.S Prepare to cry at the end."
9554,"Hard to recommend the game, but still do:
Amazing concept, awful execution. 
The joy of the game is the feeling you get running/jumping/swinging through mid-air in death defying stunts and grabbing hold of a bit of floating rock just in time! However, the level design is glitchy and you can‚Äôt tell which bits of floating rock are in range or not. So, that amazing experience is mired by a frustrating fall to your doom again and again and again. It‚Äôs hard to keep the momentum going and spoils the experience. Level design typically has one path for the player to take, despite seeming open for problem solving. Forcing that one in-game path only exacerbates the frustration from falling just short of where your creativity wants to take you. 
It‚Äôs one of the few games where I actively ran past optional in game collectible so get to the end.
But that actual ending though, straight shot to the heartstrings. Voice acting is wooden, sure, but not without its charm.
It‚Äôs only a 5-hour game, tops. Buy it if it‚Äôs on sale for no more than $3-$4. Great potential if the developers wanted to use this concept in a cleaner style.  
"
9555,"Short, sweet, with fun mechanics.

A Story About My Uncle offers a beautiful immersive experience with great level design. The story is pretty light as is the difficulty, which is perfect considering the short nature of the game.

[*] Level design - Each area has a different, fantastically designed aesthetic and lasts just long enough for you to get your fill.
[*] Light, fun story - Nothing to get sad,  mad, or extremely happy about. 
[*] Fun mechanics

[*] No real challenge. Coming from a background of extensive platforming the difficulty here was very limited (Still fun, though).
[*] Very short without finding collectibles.

PROs:

-Unique level and mechanics 
-Good story
-Good price
-Leaderboards

-after finshing story not much else to do
-not very long story

Overall the game is quite good except after a while it does start getting bland

9558,recommend!
9559,"Has a great story, looks amazing and ingame mechanics work really well. I suggest you buy this game."
9560,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platforming game where as you play as a kid whose uncle named Fred has been missing for 4 months. So you go around his laboratory and stumble over a suit, that has amazing powers. You go trough a portal kinda thingy and start on your adventure to find Fred.

Story 8/10: it's a good story, but its a short one sadly
Gameplay 10/10: its a very cool thing just swinging around and at the same time challanging as it progresses
Music 8/10: it was very calm which i liked :D

Overall 8.5/10: Really good game i highly recomend, but it's kinda pricy for a not that long story, so would recomend buying when it's on sale or something. BUT since its a kinda short game i whish they could have made a level editor mode, where people could submit their on levels to the workshop, just so people can enjoy more of the game 
"
9561,Great Story. Great Game. I enjoy it.
9562,"So this is a cool little game, has a nice narrative to it that is relatively simple and provides a backbone to the platforming.

My only complaint is that a number of sections of the game require extensive timing, accuracy and speed that don't lend themselves well to a controller at all. The last section of the game I had to revert to keyboard and mouse to get past them.
However 90% of the game is very doable on a controller and I think I can forgive the problems mentioned given the indy nature of the development.

All the envrionments and level design are great, I'd love to see it in a better engine with some post effects as it'd look sublime but still looks great as it is.

100% worth a buy."
9563,"Amazing! This game is trully amazing, the voice recording especially is awesome. 

Most high budget game from EA, Ubisoft, and other big company doesnt even come close as good as this game's. 

The graphic and gameplay also awesome and addicting.

Too bad the game is awfuly short, only less than 2 hour of gameplay. But hey at least the game have decent ending, there's no sequel bait shit ending like TOMB RAIDER"
9564,If you love annoying voice actors constantly talking!
9565,"This game took me only three hours to complete. Even though the story was short, I wouldnt of chosen any other way to spend those three hours of my life.

9567,I bought this game on the steam sale for about 2 or 3 dollars and was positively surprised. The beautiful world design and sound effects create an gripping and astonishing environment. I can only recommend this quite short but awesome game.
9568,Beautiful story and pretty nice design for the money
9569,"The gameplay mechanics are a blast, and the levels were challenging enough to make me think a bit but not enough to frustrate me. I wish the voice acting and story were a bit more well-developed, but I can overlook that. I wish the experience was longer, but it was good for a short and sweet adventure with plenty of cool moments. It's the kind of game that would greatly benefit from a Steam Workshop and user-generated level design, because I would love to simply play new maps with the preexisting game mechanics intact."

DEFINITELY RECOMMEND KUTOS TO THE DEVELOPER CAN'T WAIT FOR ANYMORE FUTURE GAMES THAT MAY COME!"
9571,This game is amazing

9573,This game left me smiling after the end.would love to have another one of these...
9574,This game is fucking AWESOME!!!
9575,"It's like Mirror's Edge, but fun."
9576,"A Story About My Uncle (ASAMU from now on) is a rather unusual platformer which attempts a new take at the genre. 
Literally, the game requires you to jump or ""fly"" while grappling with a sort of energy-based hooks onto various objects, mainly small rocks and platforms. 

The game starts with a short introduction about your uncle, in his house, where you start to travel to a fantasy world, looking for him and Maddie. The plot isn't really very elaborate, although there are a few moments where you'll find yourself touched by the relation between your uncle and the world inhabitants. 

Overall, there are 5 levels plus the introduction and the ending - the game won't last long, probably around 4 to 5 hours, maybe more if you can feel compelled to go for the time challenges (imho not that worthy). 
The matter worth mentioning is that at least 20% of that time will be wasted in trial & error, because all the game controls rely upon are your mouse buttons and the spacebar, WASD obviously required for moving on the ground, BUT while you fly in the air you can only adjust your direction with a mix of inertia and the height + the spot you choose to grapple to. This does not only mean that the controls are sometimes very imprecise, but that is hard to repeat a step in the same exact way several times (which you will have to, because of trial & error). You will need to be quick and creative in the way you choose your path. 


Visually, lucky enough, the game will help you out with a few hints, and everything is nicely layed out so that you can have a look around, and despite the difficulty, get an idea of how to get to the next platform. Particularly, ASAMU is well thought in a way that lets you enjoy every single flight across, with some puzzles working around revolving/rotating objects. It really ""feels"" like flying, maybe even more so that the experience from Bioshock Infinite (where you'd simply grapple your hook physically to a rail). 

All of the levels make use of a good colour palette, and feel consistent with each other.

The one point where ASAMU might have failed is the character rendition: they simply look awful, there is such a strong difference in rendition between them and the landscape that you cannot simply ignore it. Lucky enough, they're voiced quite well, which makes them alive in some manner (the playing character rendition is the best one, a warm and smooth voice).

Sound wise, i wouldn't have minded a few more bits of soundtrack and especially sound hints and sound bonuses you could trigger once reaching a platform. There's some sort of ""sound notice"", but it's short and simply serves you to notice you reached a checkpoint."
9577,"I have only played 100 minutes of this at the time of writing the review, and I really think that this is one of the best storylines I have ever heard in a game. The mechanics are great, the visuals are great and the story is amazing. The only downside is that the story is very short and only lasts about 2 hours. Apart from the story mode, there are also time trials, and easter eggs which unlock various modes I haven't tried yet. Personally, it is very hard for me to get attached to a game, and thats only ever happened with Overwatch, but I really like this game and I think everyone contemplating on whether to buy it or not should definitely give it a go. 9/10"
9578,"How about ""Another Story About my Uncle"""
9579,it's so short but it's so good
9580,"If you like amazing graphical details, parkour, and relaxing gameplay, then A Story About My Uncle is definetly for you.
It's sort of short at 5 hours for the main story (although this is one of the few games I'd actually consider to play again.)

all around a 9/10 awesome and leaves behind a satisfying feeling after completing the game."
9581,"Overall very entertaining.

This game was short, only three hours for me, but i was enjoying every minute, wish it was longer."
9582,"I paid $2.59 for this, and I'd say it was well worth it. This is a first person puzzle/platforming game. The gameplay is innovative and very fun.The story took me about 3 hours to finish, and ended pretty abruptly and leaving some questions unanswered. This is the only real con of the game for me. I would say the game is worth playing through a second time, and there are time trials that you can do to extend your play time as well. Usually I wouldn't be interested in time trials, but the movement and grappling in this are very fun and it's rewarding to fly through the world speedily. This is a good game for all ages, and I'd say its definitely worth $5 or so."
9583,"A fun, lighthearted, fantasy platforming adventure with great art style and great gameplay dynamics.  While not very long, I very much enjoyed this game.  I found it peaceful and relaxing to play, yet also still challenging enough to be rewarding when you make it through that next tough section.

Since there aren't any difficulty options, many people may not see much replay value in this game.  Aside from the challenges the achivements provide (such as completing entire levels without falling or not using more than a certain number of grapples) there really  isn't much left to do with this game once you complete your first playthrough.  Also, once you've beaten it, you feel like you've pretty much mastered it (At least I did).

Still, an overall enjoyable experience that I would recommend to any gamer of any age."
9584,well the game is fun voice acting could be a bit better other than that i enjoyed the game.
9585,"A Story About My Uncle is about a game in which a nephew is teleported to a new world in hopes he will find his missing uncle. 

This game is probably one of the best indie games I have played. The mechanics are simple with only using perfectly timed grappling hooks and rocket boosts. It certainly is a challenging and fun game. 

After 5 minutes of playing the player is instantly drawn into the story and that is what makes this game amazing. 

I highly recommend this game esspecially when it is on sale!



The only con I do have is that the game was somewhat short, but besides that get the game now!"
9586,"Great game, honestly. The game is just same as the title. As short as a bedtime story and as great. A story about my uncle is a short first person adventure game that is really fun to play.

It's a fun game to play, lots of challenges, but you always do the same thing over and over, and I was expecting more about the story, it was a crapy ending!"
9592,"Great Story line but soo short!!
soundtrack is very nice."
9593,"It is, i'm sorry to say, a *very* anti climatic game.
While I thought the game was pretty cool at first, I quickly found it very repetitive, which is never fun, but the worst part was the storyline -- which for me, is the most important factor in games. The world is very magical and pretty to look at and I didn't really mind the funky graphics, since I'm no ""uh must be realistic HD graphics"" fanatic, but I missed having puzzles or at the very least, some sort of action, of which there is non -- which is kind of a bummer. 
But yes, I'm giving this a thumbs down because of the story -- I mean, how can you have ""story"" in the title and yet lack exactly that?"
9594,Nice Gameplay Nice Story
9595,"Pretty good game, great mechanics, great story, great graphics, but it's really short, i ended the game in under 90 min."
9596,"Quite a fun platformer.  Short and easy, but well planned out.  Never gets frustrating."
9597,"Such a fun game. quite pleasing to the eye. Runs well, good graphics, and good story.

CONS:
1. Leafy plays it
2. Would be more fun if there was a free play mode without the story."
9598,"Played this before going to bed.
Didn't end up going to bed."
9599,"Well, if you feel like crying buy this game. It's kind of tough, but you get used to it. If you get in the groove you'll be making up your own path and skipping steps. There's even a time trial if you want a challenge. I wish there was more, because it's so good. The main story was fullfilling. This is one of those must buy games if you like puzzle/platformers. The graphics  aren't mind blowing, but the art is stunning regardless. Character animations aren't too good, but the characters still hold weight. Depsite what looks like a low budget, the game is brilliant. This is the work of people who love what they do. I know I'm a sucker for some cash grab games, but this is something altogether different. The experience was like playing Portal for the first time. If you know of any games this good please post them in the comments section.

I got it on sale relatively recently, but if I had known it was that good I would have bought it the moment it was released. I first heard about it pre-release and didn't quite know what to make of it. 10/10 would buy this very minute if I didn't own it and knew how good it was."
9600,"Amazing game for the price, I strongly recommend this to neone who enjoys a soothing platformer that will have you emerced the whole time you play."
9601,"Time to completion: 3 hours
Price: $2.59
Conclusion: Get it for that price. Don't for full.

I had fun with it. I enjoyed learning the grapple thing, and getting good at moving about the landscape. There were difficult portions, but overall it was a pretty easy game.

There were a few things that straight up shook me out of the gameplay though. The dialogue of the characters was, quite often, only there to move the story forward. I understand using dialogue for plot points, but it all seemed so contrived all the time. The cities didn't seem alive, either. The inhabitants weren't doing anything, and it doesn't make much sense how they would travel if they didn't have the same gear you did. 

I wasn't at all absorbed into the story. I was just waiting for those parts to be over so I could get back to jumping around and grappling everyting. There were a few pretty moments of sky and whatnot, and I understand its not a AAA title and I'm was not expecting that coming in. Anyway.

It was fun, and worth the price I paid for what I got out of it. Get it for 80% off, but don't pay full price."
9602,This game is awesome!
9603,YOU FUCKING SNOT NOSED BRAT MADDIE I WILL FUCKING DO IT
9604,This little tasty gem will give you a mysterious atmospheric world. It is just like a sweet cookie and coffee duo after the dinner and it is worth more to be honest!
9605,"A story about my uncle is a good platformer with an  intriguing story.
It's definitely worth the full price."
9606,"Not a bad jumping puzzler. Mixes in extra gameplay elements to keep the jumping puzzles from getting too boring: forward boost jump, upward boost jump, grappling hook with 1 charge until you touch the ground again which by the end the game has 3 charges per jump, rocket boots to give you a one-time-per-jump long distance boost, and eventually glowing crystals around the environment to refill to your grappling hook charges. 

Story isn't bad, voice acting ranges from amatuer to pretty good. Fairly short (see my total playtime, that's 1 playthrough).

Rating: C+"
9607,"Fun game
nice short story, looks great!
buy it on sale
7/10"
9608,wee
9609,"Oh my god, wow, such a gorgeous looking game! I loved it, the story telling was lovely and the story itself was fun! I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles!

Well done creaters and thank you for this story. 

I was going to get it myself but popstuff gifted it to me."
9610,"This Game is one of my all time Favorites, Definitly a Top 10 for me."
9611,Seems like an ok game but I really didn't enjoy it
9612,"I haven't finished it yet, and will update when I do. But for now, I enjoy it. It's a very simple platformer, with jumps and a grappling hook. It looks decent and the controls are good. There's a definite sense of wonder as you roam around the world, and it feels genuinely good to fling yourself around the levels.

I will say, however, that despite the beautiful scenery, the game does feel rather empty. There's not a lot to do. I would have appreciated more puzzles other than ""How do I get from A to B?"", or perhaps stuff to collect. There are a few inspired set piece moments, but they're few and far between.

Some of the jumps are very unforgiving as well, mostly due to not being able to see what you can latch on due to distance. There's also sometimes not a clear path forward.

I could also nitpick the voice-acting. While the actors themselves are pleasant and well-cast, they have trouble delivering the lines. They're clearly reading verbatim from a piece of paper, and will sometimes hesitate, pause, and almost stammer, especially the main character. It's hard to believe a voice director would let that slide without another take.

Still, while that sounds like a lot of negatives, I still am enjoying my time with the game. Pick it up when it's on sale like I did; it's worth your time."
9613,"was looking around for a game since I""ve had a few dollars in my steam wallet.  I wanted something a bit different and found this game.  Needless to say, I'm addicted.   Love the graphics and the game play.  A few times I've gotten frustrated but right back at it.  I'd recommend it.  The only thing I I wish it had was a save game instead of the auto points."
9614,"The game is beautifully designed the cartoonish sort of graphics suit the story and the controles are extremely simple to use.In terms of gameplay it is only around 2 hours long and that leads me to my only grudge , it isnt long enough id love it more if it was longer ,but all in all the game is absoloutly worth it"
9615,"quite a short game to be honest.
but its good tho"
9616,"That is one very irresponsible uncle. 

It was pretty chill experience. It's not groundbreaking but still enjoyable when you are looking for something short. It looks like a lot of care was put into it and its environment which I can appreciate. The story itself isn't really much but eh, ok. I certainly liked the mechanics.

The graple's range sometimes seem weird, when you think you should reach it it doesn't and when it seems far away it's still fine. There are few harder parts that took several frustrating tries where I dubbed it 'The story of how my uncle tried to kill me with this crazy contraption' but I managed. On the other hand I thought it was nice that I found out different options of how to get through some parts with either grapling around or platforming."
9617,Gameplay was alright and the story was meh and preaty much has no replay value unless you really want to find all the hidden items
9618,Involves 100% less rape than my story.
9619,"Great game! But its short you could get this done within a day.
But still its worth the money"
9620,"A very fluid first person platformer.

This game uses a grappling hook as its main mechanic to allow you to move though an amazingly designed world. The further the game goes on the more tools it gives you to let you move through the levels faster and more fluidly. Nailing the level using the fastest possible route, sometimes multiple are available, feels amazingly good.

The graphics are to this day good enough, the shader quality is decent and the game has a lot of fancy effect which conceals the sometimes a little dated models and textures. The one thing that does look noticeably bad are the characters. Their anatomy looks very unnatural which in some cases can be excused by the game's ""cartoon"" look but most of the time just looks ""off"".

The environments though, that is where the game really shines. The art team really outdid themself here. The atmosphere of there areas are amazing. In combination with the music you can really immerse yourself into the world as you soar through the sky. A++ here.

The story is what I would describe as ""cute"". It is told using a narrator who tells a story to his daughter about, you guessed it, his uncle. The story does the job of making you want to keep going to find out what is going on very decently but it really is nothing special. The story really helps make the world come to life though, even if it is not really that special.

The game is not that long though, it took me 3 hour to beat, and does not really have any replay value. It is not really expensive either though and goes on ludicrous discount every now and then.

In the end I really enjoyed my time with this game and am still looking for news about some kind of DLC or sequel every now and then."
9621,"Nice game, like it."
9622,"Amazing atmosphere and story too bad it's only like 3 hours long
10/10"
9623,"Well this game.. i just dont know what to say amazing atmosphere amazing gameplay story , that was fun but its so short at the end of the game i was like SHIT I AM GONNA CRY best 2 dollar i have ever spent 10/10"
9624,"Has fun control mechanics, story and concept is really cool, and visually I found it to be pretty breath taking."
9625,"I beat this simplistic first person platformer, it only took me 2 hours and yet, it was a simple and beautiful creation of a plot. A bedtime story of a man that goes on adventures which is his uncle. It was just a refreshing tale of a nephew looking for his uncle, never would he have thought he was going on his own adventure. Now that the story is complete I'm gonna start engaging in the extra time trials included with the game. This is simplistic refreshing tale and I recommend for the price when it's on sale!"
9626,"[h1]Amazing parkur game.[/h1]
[b]+[/b]
+ nice graphic details
+ easy game
+ good story

[b]-[/b]
- short game [u][b](I want more levels)[/b][/u]
- Game time 3 hours"
9627,"It's a story about telling a story.
Inception.
No, but really. It's a great game. Alot of you will find this game out thanks to Leafy, cause he has used this game in his commentaries.
I give it a solid 7/10."
9628,It's a verry good game but it could have been longer and could have more options of getting to the goal and the end was a bit weak!
9629,Not my type of story telling sorry :(
9630,"The English voice acting is absolutely dreadful, completely monotone throughout. Other than that, the gameplay is fun and allows players to play it safe or zip through levels at breakneck speed, depending on your mood."
9631,"It's a great game, however incredibly short. I would reccomend only buying it on sale, $13 seems a little too much for a 3 hour game. I got it for $2.50."
9632,Bl√§
9633,I loved this game from beginning to end. The art is gorgeuos and the story is unique.
9634,Short But Sweet
9635,it is an awesome parcore game
9636,"Was never into games like this, it doesn't look like the best game ever but it really gets you thinking, The storyline is great, gets you guessing and the way the whole game is set out. would be better if it was a bit longer though. All round decent game, had my time now getting a refund."
9637,"Wow. This game honestly blew my mind away. I saw this game for sale and decided to pick it up. I had heard good things about this game before, but my knowledge of the game wasn't that in-depth.

The game took me through an emotional rollercoaster - at times I was frustrated because I couldn't time my jumps right, or I was apprehensive because of the warning signs left by the Strays. This game was over all great. 9/10

Pros:
+Amazing soundtrack
+Great story
+Immersive - you get caught up in the story
(there are more, I just can't think that well as I'm sleepy)

Cons:
-Graphics could have been a little better, (but I think it made the game more enjoyable)
-Could have had more hours

TL;DR: Great game, would reccomend, 9/10"
9638,Highly reconmend. Its an Indie Master Piece.
9639,"I really like the story this game is telling but I feel like the controls aren't forgiving enough. The graviy feels really off, I shouldn't be able to be falling straight down and have influence over my forward momentum as much as I do. I wish I was heavier so I landed harder with more precision. There are also a lot of times when I don't know exactly where I am suppose to go next. I find myself repeating the same step over and over and over and that causes the story to break. I highly recommend the game, I just wish the developers would tweak the physics to be a little more realistic and feel like a rope swing instead of a magnetic swing."
9640,"Short but charming platformer. It's a bit rough around the edges; there are some easy to find glitches, and the story moves too fast in some cutscenes, but I found it enjoyable.
Will probably take 3-5 hours to complete the main story on average. May have some replayability if you try to speedrun it.

8/10, highly recommend picking it up whenever it goes on sale.
"
9641,"holy shit its leafyyyy

decent game, nothing amazing, but above 5/10"
9642,"Its Just an awesome parkour game with great story......... i recomment it to you guys :D
"
9643,good game
9644,"A Story About My Uncle is a narrative focused, first person platforming adventure developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.

The story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.

The game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast; flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.

Like I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time; using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.

The sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The ""Whoosh"" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.

Additional Notes: This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!

Final Thoughts: A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.

*Review copy was provided by Gone North Games; Thank you very much!*"
9645,Literally the most beautiful chill game you will ever play its worth the money just get it.
9646,Love it.
9647,"The gameplay was truly a fun experience. The story was intriguing and just overall an amazing and relaxing peaceful game. A bit of a puzzle platformer style game, but truly amazing fun nonetheless."
9648,"Man this was definitely enjoyed playing this game, I was hesitant to buy the game because I used to watch youtubers play this game and it just looked like you were parkouring through these cool maps and it kinda got boring after awhile. 

BUT after playing the game for myself, I learned that it had its own story and more than just the 1 map all the youtubers would play. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The story was very intriguing and left me wanting more. However at the peak of the story the game ended abruptly and pretty fast at that. And that let me down bad, I was enjoying the game and was so into it then BAM game ended and I was left with an untouched feeling. The game was great however. Game only took me 2 hours to beat.

PROS:
Great Story
Maps differ in many different ways
Interesting
Fun & Addictive gameplay
Cheap


Cons:
Game ends abruptly at its climax
short story


Rating 8/10 Its a MUST play"
9649,"This is an awesome little game, it's definately worth the few bucks it costs. It's got an interesting story and it isn't too terribly short."
9650,do it
9651,"This is one of my rare reviews of the game, but... it was around 3 hours of game play from the beginning to the end, including a lot of annoying parts and I have to say: no more.

The game has good atmosphere, but that's all. It's short and in second half of the game incredibly annoying, because mechanisms are build to be really tight, so it's hard to go through some parts of the game - sometimes you simply jump and jump, there are a lot of save points and later, you have to go through long piece of path without any save and do long journey again and again.

I'm crying for ""lost"" money and the time. The game has much bigger potential - and even after The Valley, this... simply nope :)."
9652,Really good game
9653,"This is just briliant game.. the so simple and rich story is just beautiful.. For thoose who played Life is Strange, this is just kinda shorter and more interactive one.. All I can is to recommend it to you"
9654,"Atmospheric, fun puzzle mechanics and progessive difficulty. Voice acting is a little satisfactory."
9655,"simple mechanism, awesome gameplay !!! thumbs up for this game!!!!"
9656,"Amazing concept, easy and fun mechanics, beautiful level design, short and sweet. A Story About My Uncle is a great game to playthrough in one sit down."
9657,Grappling just makes many games more better...and this game is full of it.
9658,"Game is not worth the price i would wait for a sale even though it's a indie game the time it takes to complete is piss poor since i have finsihed the game 4 times.

Gameplay machanics are quite fun and the overall look of the game is quite pretty but still not worth the full price"
9659,"There's not much to say about this game, as it is relatively short, but here's what I have to say.

This game is a masterpiece, all of the parkour and the timing has to be so perfectly done and at points it gets frustrating. The environment is breathtaking. This game isn't known for  an amazing world, but it is good, from the ranges it has. The actual gameplay is pretty dry in the story aspect, but that's not why you play it, you play this game if you want to free your mind, and just jump through worlds."
9660,"GREAT GAME, it is short but sweet 7.5/10 if it was longer id give it a strong  9"
9661,"Really nice and calm game with beautiful environments
lovely story but too short in my opinion
really hoping for a second game with a longer story and better graphics
"
9662,Strongly recommend.
9663,great game m8 r8 80f8
9664,"One of the best games I've played in a while  - great story, awesome mechanics, beautiful scenery and soundtrack. It's kinda short at 3-4 hours for the main story (although this is one of the few games I'd actually consider replaying), which I definitely like - for somebody who rarely has time to play video games, this is perfect."
9665,"What pleasantly surprised me is that A Story About My Uncle doesn't focus exclusively on the story itself, but puts great emphasis on the simple yet engrossing narrative. This results in a high sense of immersion which becomes apparent only at the very end of the narration. ASAMU is certainly a non-violent interactive story videogame that pushes the genre one step forward, through its platforming mechanics. For anyone who thought Dear Esther as a surprising alternative to conventional gaming, ASAMU will certainly not disappoint."
9666,"Great game, great story, but it is ver short :( could have been much longer. It has the potential at least."
9667,"The game was great, though the story sucked.. A lot. The game was way to short but it had really fun stages"
9668,"I just want to say 'WOW!'. I played this game with special thanks to [b]Mr. Duck[/b] - he Donated it to me to be able to do my Youtube Let's Play on it. I was lost for words in my mind over this game. Not only Graphically, but how it actually makes you feel. This game was made by the makers of [i]Goat Simulator[/i]. You could say this is not there typical game to make. But by far it has been an enjoyable game with many moments I just wanted to stop playing.

It has it's own unique elements to make it what it is, this wouldnt be '[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i]' for nothing. With Gameplay Mechanics done to the tee, you have a Grapple Divice, Rocket Boots and a Sprint Jump (Boosted). It made it a Fun, Angry, Emotional Rollercoaster of a Game. I would recommend this to people who wouldn't mind sitting down to have a calm and relaxing experience with the added sadness and anger of not timing everything right.. or over jumping.

Anyway, if you haven't picked this game up I would recommend it. If you would like to watch my [b]Youtube Let's Play[/b] of this than use the Links below to Navigate the Parts per Episode. Now to go back and snap some sick Screenshots which I didn't do.

9669,keemstar 2v`
9670,i enjoyed the game alot for a simple consept it bacame a great game it was a bit hard at times but i did it but for the price and hours i got from the game i would like if they added more content or atleast lower the price but a game
9671,"This was an amazing game, very fun gameplay mechanics and a cool little storyline tied together wonderfully. I would recomend this game to anyone, even if they don't like platforming."
9672,"Played it while waiting for other games toupdate and absolutely enjoyed it. The story was beautiful, the scenery was amazing, the soundtrack was wonderful, the overall gameplay was fantastic. If you dont mind falling to your death multiple times, and have enough patience to keep trying you'll definately enjoy it in the long run. 9/10"
9673,legit
9674,"This game is awesome! The story is about a boy, whose uncle, Fred, has been missing for about 4 months. The boy visits the uncle's house, and finds an ""adventure suit"". He then enters Fred's laboratory, he stands on a pad and gets teleported into another world. In this world there's a lot floadting stones. He meets a half-frog, half-human girl, named Maddie. He arrives at a village where there's more frog people. That is the start of the game. I recommend this game everyone!

Mechanics 10/10: The mechanics functions very well, all though there's some minor bugs but those are almost unoticable and doesn't affect the gameplay.
Music 9/10: The soundtrack is very calming and nice, but is a little repetitive. I would love to hear more of this.
Story 8/10: The story is well narrated but it is little weird. The ending could have been better. But I liked it.
Gameplay 10/10: Man, it feels great to swing around and grapple floating rocks. Btw, I recommend playing it with mouse and keyboard.

I really love this game, everyone should try it! Totally worth the price.

I wish my uncle was just as awesome..."
9675,The game is pretty cool and fun. Relaxing and a good time killer. Some parts were a little tricky but not a hard game at all. Would recommend playing this fantastic game!
9676,I saw Leafyishere Play this and its fun
9677,"A short(2.7h) but enjoyable little game. Game mechanics can be incredibly fun, and incredibly frustrating when you fail to grab just the right spot. Could have used a few more frequent save spots, though could just be me being bad at it :P Art style is cool and the game has some memorable places."
9678,"Good game, it is very hard sometimes, but awsome!"
9679,"I loved the story of this game, there was always something to do, from you never knew what sort of adventure lies within each cave to the end of the story it was brillant!!"
9680,"really fun. i got it thx to leafy
"
9681,"Really great game! I played on a windows computer for a litteral 10 hours strait, but we had to throw the computer away. I really reccommend you make a mac version too! I bet a lot of mac users out there would love to see this game on their platform."
9682,I loved this game I would recomend this game to any one who asked. I loved the art design and story line. I wish the game was longer but other than that i loved all of it
9683,"This is a big step up in quality from Goat Simulator, that's for sure.

The game isn't that long, but the story works for its length. The physics can be frustrating to work with, leading to many deaths, but the reward of feeling like a complete boss when you pull off an awesome maneuver is worth the headache. The graphics are beautiful and make the world feel alive and alien, yet welcoming at the same time. The addition of a sort-of hidden and completely non-gameplay-realted alien alphabet is just the icing on the cake when it comes to atmosphere. A short one, but a good one."
9684,Pretty good
9685,"The atmosphere is simply stunning. You can't help but take the time and just enjoy the captivating views for a few seconds. Along with it is a nice little story, told in a clever way. A very enjoyable game, with stunning views, nice gameplay, and an enjoyable story. Definitely worth it."
9686,One of the best games I have ever played
9687,"A relaxing experience of swinging from rock to rock.  I found that the game was not overly difficult, but I wouldnt say that was quite the point of the game.  There is a way to play the game that makes it harder by limiting what you can swing on, but because that is purely a mental struggle to force yourself to follow I could see some people (who want the game a bit harder) to dislike that aspect.

A chill swinging experience"
9688,"Great game, only takes a couple of hours to complete if you're messing around and enjoying yourself. Pick it up when it's on sale."
9689,"This game is beautiful.  Play it in the background while youre skyping your friends.  Infinite replay value.  If you like replaying  puzzle games, this is the one for you.  Puzzles are fun and not too difficult.  Very creative.  Vibrant colors combined with good graphics make this game wonderful."
9690,"Storytelling with fun aspects.
Art as its finest."
9691,"Absolutely stunning... not only is the gameplay fluid and quite fun, but the graphics and scale of the world you play adds a degree of wonder and beauty to the game. There is also a fairly good story and a unique concept to go along with the game. 

8.5/10"
9692,"This game is relaxing mostly, but can get very frustrating when you meet a difficult jump. The landscapes are beautiful and your character feels weightless while flying around the underground maze. Definitley recommended."
9693,A buggy mess.
9694,"Beautiful game with excellent voice acting, nice story and a very children's storybook vibe. It has everything a kid would want in an adventure: action, scares, worry, awe, relief... all in all a very fun game that comes off as a little easy but very entertaining. It helps that movement in the game feels very fluid and the platforming is very well done. It's a little short but very much worth the price."
9695,"The entire gameplay is comprised of the main character trying to leap from one point to the next using a grappling mechanism. While fun at first, I quickly realized that the game is too repetitive, slow, and difficult to be fun. 

Some of my complaints are that...
[list]
   [*] The gameplay is very repetitive
   [*] Most of the play time is spent falling to death or desperately trying to grab onto objects that are a bit too far away. Neither is fun. 
   [*] The grapple distances are almost arbitrarily inconsistent
   [*] Some of the tougher jumps require 20-50 tries, which can be very frustrating
   [*] I have run into numerous bugs that forced me to restart from the last checkpoint
   [*] Sometimes, the checkpoints don't register correctly
   [*] The terribly-made blocky NPC models clash strongly with the rest of the graphics, which are otherwise quite good. 
   [*] The voice acting is terrible
   [*] The storyline is almost non-existent. 
[/list]
I know that I am in the minority in giving this game a bad review, but honestly, it is one of the least enjoyable games that I've played on Steam."
9696,"It's short, a little under two hours for my first playthrough, but it's still plenty good enough to recommend. The story is told from the perspective of a dad to his little girl, so it's a bit light and the wording is easy for little kids to understand. There are two bad lines of dialogue that made me cringe, a ""20% cooler"" reference and a ""winter is coming"" reference, both are very heavy handed and forced. But the story itself is nice enough and makes the gameplay coherent.

Speaking of gameplay, the movement and mechanics felt very well executed. Movement was responsive/sharp and predictable. After playing through a second time, the whole thing was much easier and there was a good amount of freedom depending on your skill. The length of the game means some mechanics didn't get explored as much as they could have, and there's only one thing representing a ""boss"" though it's pretty simple. There's only one frustrating point in the game, where you must traverse a room by grappling on boxes that seem to spawn randomly, and continuously fall meaning one mistake can ruin everything.

Also the visuals are nice. In the village areas, you can tell they only spent 10 or so minutes on the animation loops of extra villagers (short loops, stiff), but everything else is solid.

I think it's worth the money if you like platformers, the short length means you can probably beat it in one or two sittings and it has decent replayability."
9697,Beautiful.
9698,"Very quick game, but very much worth playing. Convinced me the adventure of fatherhood is worth it"
9699,A true hidden gem among a sea of boring clones. this is a  game that i would reccomend everyone play even at full price it will leave you longing to play more
9700,very cool
9701,"Buy it.
Beat it in under 2 hours.
Refund.
ez scam thanks for free game"
9702,"A really fun game, a great story, and an emotional ending. This is by far one of the best indie titles I have played in a long time. 
10/10, worth it."
9703,One of my favorite games of all time. If you want a game that takes around 2 hours to play and has an interesting game mechanic. this may be the game for you.
9704,:)
9705,"You get to be spiderman for a bit  
-7/10"
9706,"Amazing game, i just beat it, thats why im doing this review.

im not much into platform games, but this one seemed different, i cant explain why but i picked it up, and from the moment it started i knew it was going to be good. The story is not other games where you get a cut scene around every corner or a bunch of lorebooks to read or a lot of npcs talking, its narrated, told as a story, and even that does not happen all the time, mainly because a lot of the time is spent moving and jumping and flying through the air. I just fell in love with the way the game looks, the colours, the sounds the locations its all so beautiful i would highly recommend picking this game up when it suits your budget, or preference don't let this game slip through your fingers.

Stuff i didn't like about the game

-More interactions would have been nice, even if only a few extras.
-No Mobs, i know thats not the intention, but it would have added a nice dynamic at a few parts.
-One or 2 Side missions or maybe something Lore friendly would have been nice."
9707,"Worst game concept I've ever played. [spoiler]This is a student project from Sweden[/spoiler]
Terrible controls, awful level design, super empty, frustrating platforming, and overall boring mechanics."
9708,"An amazing game.
Easy to run, and still great visuals. 

I finished this in 2 hours and got a refund.
You can do it too. Just buy the game, finish it, and refund.

Although I had already played at a friends house, so I knew my way around the first few sections.
"
9709,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platforming game that focuses on narrative storytelling published by Coffee Stain Studios, the same people responsible for Goat Simulator.

Pros:
-The platforming is solid and responsive. You feel in control of the character and are able to react quickly to change in situations.
-The world itself is visually spectacular. From dark, unnerving caves to islands floating in the sky with a bright sun up high, the world draws you in to this game.
-Story is reasonably well developed, but the ending could have been alot better.

Cons:
-Main story of the game is incredibly short, took me ~2 hours to complete my first playthrough. (Other 14 hours is more playthroughs to complete all achievements)

The game is a gem among platformers, although I feel that it is not worth it's current asking price. Get it on sale when you can.
7/10"
9710,Worth the money 150% :D
9711,"Yo, I don't think any story from your uncle is as cool as this story about his uncle.

This game was really good, it was filled with mystery and great puzzling. The scenery and backgrounds were beautiful!
Could be very simple and enjoyable, however some of the obstacles got me, and I had to spend numerous...numerous tries to get pass them. Story was pretty great in my opinion. Very well worth the purchase c:"
9712,Loved the story. Game wasnt too challanging or hard. I had a lot of fun playing it.
9713,this game is so nice so to spend an enjoyable time when you dont know what to play. A short game but the puzzles in it makes the time go so much slower specially when you let the story take control of you. Worth all the money and time spent.
9714,this is fucking shit.
9715,very immersive and smooth parkour game would recommend for anyone who like cs go surfing or mirrors edge
9716,"This game is amazing, i mean absoulty amazing, just the story and the graphics and how it was written. Almost every aspect about... Except one.... Two things that go together, the price and the how long this game lasted. I think the price is a little two much for how long it is. I finished it very quick so im hoping they make a sequel to it. Well nvm 12.99 was worth it, but i wish the story was longer, or they should make another one about Uncle Fred's adventures or something like that. I really don't know just some sort of sequel. Now im done critizing it. i really enjoy this game i ecommend this game to all players all ages, even if you want blood and gore (which it doesnt have) this game is way too good for that and it is a nice relaxing game to clear your mind.
~Pie"
9717,"In general the game is Ok. Maybe not worth the 12.99‚Ç¨ its priced but definately worth it if you can find it on sale. But anyway, game feels pretty short (couple of hours), maybe story could have been more exploded, but that's fine anyways. Thing is with this game that, it consists mainly of two or three main mechanics, jumping, using your gloves to atach to things and on-air control. Anyway graphics are ok for this kind of game. Music is beautiful, and everything puts you in a chill and relaxed situation, so if you are looking for a game to have a good afternoon or simply relax from others this is a great choice in my opinion."
9718,"omg it is soooooo good worth it
"
9719,"Nice game with puzzles. 
- no music"
9720,"I picked this game up on sale and it was definitely worthwhile. I liked the atmosphere and the gameplay. It's pretty easy, though, espacially since the savepoints are usually pretty close. If you fail you just try hard until you make it. Making it harder would probably made it annoying.

The character  models seem a little cheap, though. Since, at least from my point of view, this isn't essential for the experience the benefits of this innocent parcours-like game certainly outweigh this flaw.

In the end I completed the story in two lazy sunday afternoons, for which it fit perfectly. There's probably more to discover, since I didn't earn a single achievement. On the other hand, this doesn't bother me to much. I'm not going to replay it any time soon."
9721,After playing this game you'll wish your uncle could travel parallel universes too :)
9722,I really enjoyed this game a lot. it was a good one
9723,"A Story about my Uncle - Gone North Games & Coffee Stain Studios

Always check settings and controls!

Do you know what one of the hardest challenges for a single player Game developer is? The answer: creating a videogame that's a first-person platformer. This is because there's something incredibly difficult about aiming invisible feet on an inch-wide surface while moving airborne at tremendous velocity. And here's the collaboration of Coffee Stain Studios and Gone North Games to accomplish exactly this nigh impossible feat. 

Welcome to the game. We enter a first room of a small house. A voice starts talking: It's us! We're telling our daughter about the day our Uncle Fred went missing. Upstairs we find a suit that apparently improves our jumping capabilities. It's a weird and clunky exoskeletal armor, but I'm sure it'll become fashion within time. Another staircase. This leads to Fred's observatory tower. In their is a switch that will activate the garbage disposal pad and sent anything flying into the great unknown. 

The game is divided in a handful of stages, which all feature an upgrade to the exo-skeletal jumpsuit. There's a grapplebeam and rocket boots. The big challenge lies within finding the quickest way through the level and let me tell you, jumping from ceiling to rock like spiderman is massively hilarious! Each level teaches us about one of the steps of how to handle grief, which is a promising premise and executed perfectly. Personally, I learned about the anxiety I inflict when hiding in the renown mancave.
What do I always say about the music? A good soundtrack gets stuck in your head and makes you want to come back. The soundtrack isn't extraordinary enough to be a stand alone album. A few months later and you'll have forgotten every song, though it is ambient and merges well with the environment. 

"
9724,"And here I thought my kid would take too long to fall asleep :)
A beautiful game with a cool mechanic that had me physically on edge a lot of the times, bending forward trying to reach the edge.
Also I think the last time I died so often was when playing vvvvvvvvvv (not sure how many v's go here).
Similar to that game, falling off the edge here just makes you want to try again and again until you finally make it, feeling like a hero and looking back over the abyss you just impossibly crossed.

The story, while not too deep, is still fresh and works for me.
The wonderfully sublime soundtrack supports the feeling of being there.

Do play!"
9725,An enjoyable first-person platformer with very smooth mechanics.
9726,"Very fun single player game. The story is a bit short but it is well written and very interesting to play.
"
9727,Nothing bad about it. Loved the story. Loved the game mechanics. Had a blast for 2 hours but it ended. only con is its a short game
9728,"Nice game. I got lost sometimes because the game lacks proper directions but that's kinda nice too, not super linear, its like exploring a semi-open world. Gameplay is original and fun. The only bad thing about this game is its length - short in my opinion and the story is kinda unfinished. Good game overall."
9729,"Must have of 2017, one of the most unique platformers I've seen on the market. Short campaign but high replay value with the time trial mode. Great game 9/10"
9730,I miss leafy.
9731,"If you can find a time when this game has an 80% sale you should defiantly get it, its a fun little story that was quite enjoyable."
9732,"It's an okay game. My biggest gripe with it is the fact that the range of your grapple varies with each level so it can get a bit frustrating when you think you're not actually in range. 

Aside from that, it has a decent story, nice mechanics, and it is pretty short. Upon completion, I felt underwhelmed as I didn't feel that the game lived up to its full potential. The ending is meh and leaves a bit to be desired. 

Story: 8/10
Mechanics: 5/10       Air strafing is good, but the range of the grapple varies.
Graphics: 7/10       Quaint, match the story well.
Overall: 6/10       I'd reccommend buying it during a sale since I personally don't feel that it's worth full price."
9733,"This game is excellent combination of the art, music and story. It simply is full of life, and it makes you curious through all the game. Just for me, the ending is not very clear, maybe it could be more dramatic or whatever I don't wanna give spoilers. Just enjoy this masterpiece :D Have Fun"
9734,I don't have anything particularly good to say about this game. Nothing struck me as exceptional but I think that's ok. I just liked the mechanics and gameplay and had a good time with it.
9735,"An enjoyable action adventure game, with a plainly charming background story, delightful attention to detail, and appropriately atmospheric world, graphic, and level design. I would love to see future games in this world, perhaps with a different gameplay style.

And here's the caveat, and why this recommendation must come with a warning: 1st-person 3D platforming is an abomination, and though [I]A Story About My Uncle[/I] offers an original take on this rightfully uncommon gameplay genre, it cannot fix its essential problems. As you whoosh through the air in big parabolas you have to use your mouse to see around you, while also using the caret to aim and grapple a limited number of times before you plummet to your death. These awful controls coupled with unnaturally confusing visibility and restricted grapple distance are a recipe for frequent frustration. Perhaps there are some amazing gamers out there who always jump just right in three dimensions, and always grapple just the right surface at just the right angle, but I imagine most of us will have to try and try again until they succeed. Furthermore, those of us with a fear or apprehension of heights will find it not only frustrating, but also nerve-wracking.

This would all be OK if the game were forgiving of slips and bounces, but it's not. As you progress it becomes increasingly difficult, with the last level being purely evil. Persevere and keep trying (30 times for me in one section) and you will be rewarded with a certain degree of satisfaction at beating a challenging game. I say ‚Äúcertain‚Äù because I feel that this genre always involves a certain amount of luck in addition to skill. It's kinda like winning at poker.

If this warning doesn't turn you off -- it might even turn you on! -- then do buy this game. It pulls you quickly into its originally realized world, and will leave you with a smile when you finally reach the end."
9736,"Pretty nice little game, without violence, only agility. Fun little piece, would recommend."
9737,"I am horrible in reviews but i would feel bad if i did not review this game positively. 
I like the story, the narrator, the graphics, the idea of the world created, the swinging and the characters. 


I LIKE this game. Despite me trying the ""jumping without using your glove"" platform 48 times before giving up."
9738,"[‚úì] Amazing Story
[‚úì] Amazing Graphics
[‚úì] Too Short
[‚úì] Speedrun Levels
[‚úì] LeafyIsHere"
9739,"This is a very interesting game, it has a really good story but also a great sense of adventure throughout, it feels like you have alot of freedom being able to fly through the sky and grapple from long distances, it is unfortunate that the game is quite short and can be finished within 3-4 hours, but, despite its shortness this game is brilliant 10/10."
9740,"Beautiful game, great visuals and storyline."
9741,"imagine you skipping school because your uncle called and he invited you over to his house.
the game is about you searching for his house.
while skipping school
shows how cool and intense( in a way ) it is.\

final rating:
8.5/10

would love a second game
a story about your mom
sounds neato"
9742,Very unique platformer. Worth every penny. The game is a little short but very fun to play.
9743,"Well, after playing this game for a couple of times, all I can say is: any chance for a second part? ;-)"
9744,"Really awesome game, big thanks to the cyberbully ;)
Only problem is that is short... But it's worth to buy :)"
9745,An enjoyable parkoring game
9746,"Most of the game is trying to swing on a tiny ass rock and you can only hook to one side of it.
I was really looking forward to playing this game. The play physics are top notch, its just the maps that are shit."
9747,"This is the first game I buy, it's good game but there are better games if it's not on discount."
9748,Touching
9749,I love this game <3
9750,"this game is amazing, just play it, its hard and frustrating but my god it is worth it 11/10 id like a 2nd one to carry on the story."
9751,"Very cool to have a game based around grappling. It looks great and the story itself is simple but the awesome gameplay is what really matters. It just feels great to fly from say a floating rock to a crystal-powered turbine. Areas are fun to explore and the game keeps throwing new challenges at you while you slowly upgrade the suit with more energy and more abilities. 

Maddie is a lovable frog character you meet in a cool looking village. Look hard enough and you'll see some easter-eggs there!

 Some parts of the darker levels are just too dark to see where you should grapple to next, however. It has plenty of replayability which is really challenging, going by the percentage of people actually getting the achievements. That said, there's still things to unlock the more collectibles you find and there is also a time trial mode, perfect for speed runners.


9/10"
9752,"A Story About My Uncle is an enjoyable 3D platformer. There's no combat, but you have a grappling hook. That's pretty much all I can say about this game. There's some story in it about these weird frog people but I honestly don't remember it."
9753,Fun quick and enjoyable also very atmospheric
9754,"This game have an Amazing game play, it's easy to lowd it's not a big game But still one of the most wonderfull game I own. And the story is very very nice 10/10. 
if you'r like me and you like chill game but fast at the same time, that your game :)"
9755,"It is an amazing game, with a great story line, and visuals, but the only downside is the price. The gameplay is only two hours long, and is not worth $12.99."
9756,"The mechanics are great. The puzzles are just right. It was a lot better than I expected. Really cute. Very fun. It's worth the price, but better on a discount."
9757,"Here's my story


FUCK you
- great game
- good view
- nice jumping
-fuck fuck fuck"
9758,"A visually stunning and unique story-driven platformer. Great music, mostly good (sometimes confusing and frustrating) level design. It's a bit difficult to recommend A Story About My Uncle at full price but definitely a good game to pick up on sale. It feels like a lot of love was put into this game, sometimes the dialogue and voice acting isn't amazing, and the story itself is probably only 3-5 hours depending on how good at platformers you are. If these aren't massive dealbreakers and you're looking for a short, charming and beautiful platformer, A Story About My Uncle is a great game. Probably a 7/10 for me."
9759,"A very charming game with some unique gameplay. It's not extremely challenging or long, but I enjoyed the 5 hours it took me to beat the game (probably longer than most). Definitely worth the money."
9760,"I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to others. It took me about three hours to complete, so buy it cheap. It has some frustrating moments but not often. The character designs are a bit dodgy, however the enviroments looks nice. The story is unique."
9761,Couldn't have been better. Please update with more levels!!
9762,Like retarded spiderman. Fun though.
9763,"this is a very fun game, i wish it had more levels"
9764,Simple platformer with some fun mechanics. Its not worth more than what it looks like from the short video. No real big boss you have to fight. Wait for it to go on sale.
9765,"Got it on sale. Definitely worth the money. I appreciate how this game is different from your typical 3D first person adventure. Not super long, not super challenging, but fun nonetheless."
9766,"The best Spider-Man game that isn't about Spider-Man. You really feel like a superhero swinging and rocket jumping around. The level design is pretty good, with lots of impressive, grand scale geometry[spoiler], especially the outdoor village. I just wish we weren't in caves most of the time. I don't know if that's a spoiler, I guess it's better to be safe than sorry[/spoiler]. The story is genuinely touching too. The only complaint is the sudden difficulty jump: the last level is much more difficult that the preceding level. Other than that, if you'd like some serious acrobatic platforming, this game is a definite recommendation."
9767,"make a sequel please 
"
9768,"Purchased on sale. Highly recommended at a sale price. There is deep meaning in the story if you look for it, and it's a sad tale. However the true highlight is the controls & mechanics of the ""suit"". I was sad that it was only 5 hours, and I'm sure some can beat it in far less time. There were parts that were very challenging, but eventually I was able to figure them out. I tried playing with a controller and found it too challenging. Mouse & KB are the way to go."
9769,"Man, I just completed it, and let me tell you. I loved. The story line was great, however I felt it could use more naration in some parts were I felt I was just dronning on. It was a real good puzzle to solve. I honestly dont think it could use any more major improvment, other than the main character having a voice when he talks to other people, but other than that it was excellent."
9770,"Disclaimer: I haven't completed the game yet

Recommendation: Price is fair but buy on sale if you're unsure of the game; read before buying

I just want to say this game is really adorable and fun to play. Everything looks gorgeous, the low gravity is fun to play around in and the story sounds just like what someone would tell as a bedtime story. However, it's obvious this is one of Gone North's first games. The models for some of the characters are very basic with incredibly wooden and minimal animations, the voice acting feels stilted, and some of the level design makes it unclear where you're supposed to be going to (this is made more obvious by contrasting it with the areas where they do an excellent job of directing the player but there are more areas of confusion than clear direction). I'd love to see what the studio could do with the resources to publish a more polished version of this game.

Pros:
- fun gameplay
- haven't come across a challenge that was too frustrating (yet)
- the idea's neat and cute
- level design is clear and excellent on occassion
- controls are tight and responsive

Cons:
- level design is confusing more often than clear
- voice acting's a bit stiff and unnatural (see trailer video for example)
- animations for npc's is stiff and wooden"
9771,"This is just the most amazing, fast paced and cute platformer ever. The physics are completelly unlike the normal ones (you know, the real life ones) you are used to, but thats what makes it fun. Must try."
9772,"Having played the game again after leaving it sit on the shelve for over a year, it seems they've fixed a lot of my earlier gripes (or maybe I was just not in the mood for the game and simply got pissy about every little failing that caught my eye.)
Anyway, adjusting my review as a result, but that doesn't mean some of my earlier gripes have been aleviated.

[strike]For a game that is all about grappling, they sure could have spend a little more time on the actual grappling mechanics, as of right now, it's rather rubbish.
- It's never clear what the actual reaching distance of your grappling hook is.
- 9/10 grapples result in you banging either against (bad) collision meshes (killing momemtum instantly) or the edge of a platform without the ability to climb/grapple up.
The power jump often won't fire because of how platforms are often irregular shapes resulting in the player going in falling state (even though it's just a 5 cm step.)[/strike]

Graphics and art direction are okay, pretty much looks like every other Unreal Engine based indy game out there.
Animation of characters is rather lackluster but functional.
The checkpoint system is complete and utter rubbish, forget about backtracking for achievements, as falling down will respawn you all the way back at the last checkpoint that could be activated (you can't reactivate checkpoints on your trek back.)
Unskipable cutscenes (which are bad enough on their own) but with the added illusion of movement, which on top of that is twice as slow as normal movement in the rest of the game.
Audio and music are decent.
Bloom and mouse smoothing can be turned of (thank you dev), but there's not much else in the sense of visual quality adjustment (you'll need to edit the engine.ini for that), but I doubt you'll need to fine tune settings much as the game runs smooth on high even on my old HD7950.
A small nitpick is the scale (either from the scenery or the character controller), at times it feels like I'm literally just a head with 2 hands sticking out of my ears.

[strike]This game to me is a missed opportunity, of all the things that would have been acceptable even if they had been mediocre, the core game mechanics are not one of them.[/strike]

Seems better than last time I played it, at it's current price point I might even say it's even worth it."
9773,"This is a fun game, with a memorable expierence, some levels are challenging but that's what makes it fun. I give it a 7/10, overall it's a great game."
9774,"I purchased this game way back during the Steam Summer Sale of 2015. I played it for about half an hour, put it down, and didn't pick it up again until today (7/1/2017). That said, because I couldn't remember how to play the game, I started from scratch and ran through it in one sitting.

To be honest... it's an all right platformer. Far from bad, but not neccessarily great, either. Because of how many buttons you have to press at once, results are pretty inconsistent. The sprint key could have just been removed entirely and the game would have been a lot easier to control. But even then, that's really only half of the problem. You don't really get that much of a margin for error when it comes to distance jumping. There was one level in the middle of the game where I just grew plain frustrated because of how many times I had barely missed the end of the platform I was trying to get to.

Of course, the end level was laughably easy in comparison. It's also riddled with unintented ledges where you can sit on and try again halfway through a jump. Where on the previous level, I was stuck and frustrated, this one I eased right through with little to no problems. It made the ending really anti-climatic. There just wasn't anything to make the player feel changed like how there was in previous levels. By the way, there are 5 levels if you count the tutorial level.

The artwork for the levels is really pretty and there are more than a few ""Kodak moments"" to be had. It's honestly the highlight of this game. The design and gameplay is really inconsistent and the story was so bland and silly that it was almost pointless. Character conflicts get resolved within a 2 minute bit of dialogue. Conflicts, which you never get any warning or reason with. They just happen and get resolved. And these are not small little conflicts, either. These are life changing conflicts. It would be like if I walked up to a bank and decided in the span of 2 minutes on getting a $50,000 loan for a house.

Inconsistent is just such a perfect descriptor for this game. When it works, it's really great. There's a few really great moments in gameplay, but they never great repeated again. The story starts off mysterious and adventurous, but just ends with disappointment and a totally lame with no true closure to the build up that the story starts you with.

On sale, I can recommend this game, but at full price, I cannot. This is a 2 hour game and while it is a fun little adventure, the only big positive it has is nice environments and some occasionally fun platforming."
9775,"A very beautiful game with a great stroy and game mechanic, I enjoyed every second of it and I hope the Devs can make some sort of second/sequel to this."
9776,"I love first person adventure (FPA?) Games. Portal was amazing. Something so great about not ever having to fire a bullet, murder a few hundred robots or create a few hundred grieving families for all the people I shot in the face. You just run, explore, solve, run, and explore. 

You get a grapple hook in this game, and you get to enjoy as you realize that thing is really short as you fall to your death often. Deaths aren't punishing as they are just really annoying. You will die. A lot. That said, it's still allot of fun running through the levels. 

The story is really good and there are some fun fan theories to keep you thinking on it well after the credits. 

All in all, this is one of my favorite games I've played in a long time."
9777,"Just didn't have all that much fun with it. Grappling hook was not very responsive at all times, and the story wasn't compelling to me."
9778,"A Story About My Uncle is a hidden game among the thousands of game on steam and it's incredibly fun. 

The game follows on a dad telling his daughter a bed time story about the time he went to look for his Uncle Fred using his invention which is a suit equipped with a grappling hook.

The story isn't really that in depth and the reason you might want to check out this game is the gameplay itself and the game is rather fun. The best way I can describe this game is imagine Mirrors Edge without the parkour element and you got up to the high places using a grappling hook.

In general this game is rather simple and is easy to learn, so you pick up really fast and you have a ton of fun playing it. 

You swing from place to place to get to Uncle Fred and you visit some really breathtaking locations. I mean a lot of these locations look amazing like the Ice Caverns, the windmill land and the other locations as well.

Graphically the game looks great, some of the locations look breathtaking and are amazing to look at, but this however can't be said about character models.  A lot of them look really ugly, but you only see live creatures for fraction of minutes so it doesn't really annoy me that much.

Game is around 3 hours long, but it has some replay value like a timed mode and collectibles, which would make the game around 5 hours long or even longer. I paid a single euro for it and I definitely had an amazing time playing this game. 

A Story About My uncle is an incredibly fun game. It doesn't have a ton of depth and it's a simple pick up and play, but with the short time you will spend with this title, I think you will enjoy it.

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Incredibly fun gameplay
+ Great environments 

Cons:
- Short
- Controls take some time getting used to

9779,"This game is fun from beginning to end, especially when finding unconventional ways to reach your destination."
9780,Get it on sale
9781,"Fun game with a nice story. Very relaxing to play for the most part, occassionally it was a bit frustrating when I couldn't grapple when it seemed like I should have been. Overall I enjoyed A Story About My Uncle quite a bit, and found it was the perfect length for what it is."
9782,"best story i have ever played and i have played alot of storys but none like this
"
9783,The way this game is designed leads to some fun and interesting takes on platforming.
9784,Just such a great game that one needs to expeirienc eby themselves.
9785,"Not much of a game, and the story is sort of interesting (it's not what it seems). Sadly that's it. Gameplay is bad, game is short. Not worth the time I spent playing (I forgot to turn it off for over 1 hour so the time played is incorrect)."
9786,Good game with a nice story and nice gameplay.
9787,"The last time I cried over a game was Undertale. This game, with minimal dialogue and a loose (but clear) narrative made me feel.

The game threw me for a loop at first. I got it as part of a bundle and I assumed it would be some kind of point and click puzzle thing. Turns out that's only right in the technical sense - you do point and click a lot, but it's so that you can grapple everywhere. The mechanics of this are quite nice and it's a brilliant experience.

The game is very immersive and I loved almost every part of it. The frog people might have been a little lifeless but that is acceptable given how good the rest of the game is. Unlike some, I actually liked their voices because it sounds like a people who have been introduced to English but might not be totally familiar with it.

All in all, I'd give it a 10/10 (9.5 if you want to be picky)."
9788,good game
9789,"nice meme
10/10 gameplay
crappy story tho"
9790,"I enjoyed this game, but it's too short.
13 bucks for a game this long is too much. I only bought it because it was on sale.

However, I do recommend it."
9791,"Game started out fun, but got boring overtime."
9792,"Great game nice visuals good story.
Very fun all though its a bit short"
9793,"Fairly short, but fun game. Cute story, and pretty simple mechanics. My kids enjoyed watching while I played, and died. A lot."
9794,"i reeeaaally enjoyed this game, i just finished the main story yesterday, and will probably go back to get some of the achievements. it was just hard enough to feel challenged, but not so hard that i got frustrated. its one of the most engaging and beautiful games ive played in a looong time. i would recommend this to just about anyone."
9795,"The game is easy at first, while it becomes very challenging in the final part. Sometimes it's too dark to find out the way. However, it' s cool to shuttle back and forth in a fantastic world."
9796,"I have to admit: I am really bad at this game. Although I enjoyed the story and the beautiful magical enviroment! Some parts were hard to get through (especially the ice caves) which made me almost rage-quit it. But I am glad I kept on trying until I made it to the next checkpoint. It is really worth a try, especially when it's on sale! A 'normal' person would've taken 3 to 4 hours to complete this game. Some more checkpoints would have helped to make it a bit easier. But maybe that's just my lack of gaming skills. I'd give it a 8/10"
9797,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. I'm a grown-ass man, and for the duration of the game I was a little kid gaming on the couch with my eyes glued to the screen. I love platformers, and this one was all the greater for not using invisible walls. I LOVED being able to go to the edges of the map where the terrain starts to get wonky. Being able to grapple to practically any location was incredibly satisfying. The story is rich, the levels are beautifully crafted, the 'side quest' of solving the language is fun, and the characters are memorable.

Thank you for an amazing experience!"
9798,"This game has a rather fun story, however it is very short. You can complete it in about 2 hours if you're fast. The graphics in this game are fantastic, however there is one thing I didn't like. The characters. Those frog people look so unnatural and sloppily made compared to the rest of the game, it ruins the feeling a little bit. 
The gameplay is fun and relaxing, but if you mess up you may get irritated.
Even though the game is short, it's a rather special experience and I still recommend it, but buy it when it's on sale."
9799,Great to play in one go! 8/10
9800,WINDOWS 10?
9801,"This game is EPIC! SO FUN! I love that you can grappling hook and stuff. 8/10

Problems besides my game page autominimizing, there's not that many scenes you can play at and it gets boring. It be cool if there was like custom maps and stuff. Otherwise, dank game."
9802,"This is an amazing game worth every penny. Here is how i found it! 
I was watching some leafyishere videos and i realized that the game that he was playing in the background seemed quite interesting! I tried looking it up and somehow someone else was looking for the same thing and told everyone what the name of the game was! 

Immediately i bought it and started playing. 

The game is fun but can be frustrating sometimes. The scenery looks good even on the lowest graphics set! The story is quite heartwarming even though there isn't much of it. 

The game is often on some sort of sale so if it is...THEN BUY IT NOW!!!"
9803,"Great game so far. Great story, Other worldy feeling, really gets the brain working haha. Very thankful to my friend for recommending this so I am definitely recommending this to others :)"
9804,Fun casual single player game with a good story. Progression feels very rewarding and movement is very smooth.
9805,"gud story gud gamplay, visually gud. short but worth every penny. gud game"
9806,"Game Is Great.
Pros: Fun
Adventure

Cons: Bad Voice Actors 
Beat the game in 2 Hours
Not Really Much content"
9807,"A Story About My Uncle, I Bought This On A Steam Sale Awhile Back And When I First Played It I Fell In Love With It. The Graphics And Story Are Both Great. But When You Encounter The Frog People It's Weired Because You've Never Encountered  Any Humans Or Any Other Sort Of Life Form In The Game. If The Review Helped Give It A Thumbs Up üÉèüî™."
9808,This game is AMAZING! I have quite a few games from Steam and this is the FIRST game that's compelled me to write a review. This game is SO MUCH FUN! It really does have a lot of heart.
9809,god game
9810,love it. if u like platformers this is the game for u. it has amazing art and stile. the speed runs are great also! ; )
9811,"This game is so incredible.  Although it will only take approximately 3.5 to 4 hours to complete, it is so worth it.  Fantastic gameplay and great story.  The ending is very emotional and by the end, you have built a connection with all the characters you meet on your journey.  100% must pick up in my opinion."
9812,"A Story About My Uncle is a fairly straightforward first person platformer. The premise of the story is that you have wandered into your absent uncle‚Äôs house and find a teleporter that takes you to another world. Using the suit he left for you, you must find your uncle and make your way back home.

The central mechanics are quite simple; there‚Äôs no combat in this game, with the game being wholly devoted to platforming through 3D environments. Your abilities include a normal jump, a super jump, an energy grapple you shoot from your hand that can connect to most (but not all!) surfaces and pull you towards them while allowing you to swing after a fashion, and later on, a pair of rocket boosts which give you an abrupt, very large bit of acceleration in a certain direction (yes, as if with a rocket) when you try to double jump in midair.

These controls are quite simple, and the game fundamentally consists of using them to traverse environments. You start out only getting one grapple per jump through the air, but soon you end up with the ability to grapple up to three times before landing ‚Äì and in the final area, refresh them mid-jump by draining glowing crystals on the walls.

Sadly, the lack of much variety in mechanics means that, in the end, a lot of puzzles ultimately feel fairly samey ‚Äì there‚Äôs only so much you can do with a limited control set, and it feels like you‚Äôve done it all by the end of the game, and probably more than that. A number of areas feel kind of samey, which isn‚Äôt helped by the graphics ‚Äì while each area of the game has its own unique look, each individual level looks pretty similar internally.

This is kind of annoying later on in the game, when it becomes increasingly more difficult at times to see what exactly you‚Äôre supposed to be grappling onto ‚Äì there‚Äôs a few points in the game where you have to do a bit of searching to figure out where you‚Äôre trying to go next, and it can be less than obvious. Combined with the game‚Äôs general aesthetic of ‚Äúrocks floating in midair/stuck in the sides of a cave over bottomless pits‚Äù, the environment can start getting a bit confusing and very same-looking over time.

Really, that‚Äôs all there is to the game; there‚Äôs three or four characters, with decent but slightly off voiceovers that contain the odd grammatical error betraying the writer as a non-native English speaker (or just some poor proofreading), but in the end, I didn‚Äôt feel a strong connection to any of the characters. Without this, there‚Äôs just the platforming ‚Äì and that wears thin after a while.

Overall, while the game has an okay aesthetic on the most basic of levels, in the end it ends up feeling too samey and there just isn‚Äôt anything else there to give it much oomph. It just is what it is, and what it is isn‚Äôt anything special. At the end, I was left walking away without feeling like I‚Äôd gained anything from the experience, or experienced anything really memorable. It just isn‚Äôt worth your time or money.
"
9813,"Amazing game with ok graphics, but the story makes up for it"
9814,"The game is mostly a platformer with some unique controls.  But honestly I just found it boring.  The story is cute but not compelling and - well cute doesn't mean interesting.  If you like platformers this may be worthwhile on discount but even though it is short, I found that 2/3rds of the way through, I had little desire to finish it.  Many of the harder parts are just timing a jump just right which seemed more luck based than skill so there is little satisfaction in pulling it off, more like a chore."
9815,"This game took me into an amazing, beautiful world where I felt fully immersed. The narration was simple yet fit the whole theme of the game, and the few characters you converse with make you feel as if you really are this nephew in this world. The atmosphere was created perfectly for each of the levels and the music greatly contributed to the mood of each section. An amazing game that took me on an emotional trip, this is worth the full ¬£10.00 for a good 10+ hours of gameplay including trying to get every achievment in the game. The sale price of ¬£2 this holiday was amazingly cheap for the game that it is. Stunning."
9816,"Beautiful little puzzle based Indie game. Short but appropriately priced, the story is well written and gets the player invested straight out of the opening sequence."
9817,Its a must have. I like the art style. its fun and enjoying . i like flying around in the game
9818,"Very good game, and for what the cost is, it's well worth the play. Took me around 6 hours to complete the campaign, but thats also with me taking my time to perfect some challenges and look around at the map/graphics. Which is another thing, the overall map and beauty of the enviorment is great. The uh... People graphics are ehh... but they dont show up much in the story anyway. And last but not least the story is really well put together with a couple easter egg type things here and there with a really nice narritive. 9/10"
9819,"Pros:
*nice story
*stunning visuals
*great voice acting
*gameplay is new and very fun
Cons:
*Not very long
*The checkpoint system can be annoying on hard jumps
*Controls can be annoying for things like the leap
*Some things dont register
All in all I'll rate it Borky as a 7/10"
9820,"Fun little game with puzzle after puzzle to solve to continue your adventure. Doesn't feel repetitive and the puzzles are not too difficult. The further you go the harder the puzzles become, but the story is intriguing enough to keep pushing you forward. Once you start the game it is really hard to put down, and the plot pacing really fuels that desire to keep playing to find out more."
9821,Best ¬£2 game I've ever bought (Steam Sales)
9822,"I finished this game after 5 and a half hours (singleplayer - only the story). In this time I had as much fun as I was going to blow the earth because of this level can't be this difficult!!!!! I really liked the gameplay and the story is well told) the end could be eventually a little bit better - but it is good enough as it is). The difficulty is between simple and ""What the heck is this, ARGH??!!!!!""

Because of this I recommend this game to everybody that isn't pissed that he/she couldn't make this specific level after 30 tries (you can be pissed, but you need to have the will to motivate you :). It was a good time.

[I wouldn't have bought it for 13 Euro, but I think for each sale price around 5 Euro this game is at absolutely worth it]"
9823,"This is a great game. Although it's a little short, the beautiful art style and gameplay will make up for it. Also, good luck 100% completing this. A lot of the achievements rely on you doing a perfect run of the levels, which you are almost guaranteed not to do. Still fun though."
9824,"To start of i have to say that this game has really good graphics and i liked it a lot, but the best thing about the game was the story it was pretty cool and the way that the story begins, its just amazing. This game is worth every penny that you spend on it and i would highly recommend you to buy it, if you like story games, then this game is for you. But the only thing that i did not like about the game is the fact that the story is not really long and i wouldve loved it more if it was longer. And thats all i have to say about this game!"
9825,"Beautiful, fun little story."
9826,nice
9827,"Short game with a decent story. Beautiful levels and could have defenitely used some more lore. I feel that the physics are a little bit off. If you like problem-solving and/or parkour games, this is something you might want to try."
9828,this game was awesome and has an amazing story if your even considering to get this game then just get it its great
9829,I really loved this game it had a good story line and all that. Down side is i finnished the game in 2 to 3 hours. Would love to see a sequal.
9830,"There are some things that this game does amazingly well, and some aspects in which it falls just short of greatness. The world that the creators have built is inventive, clever, and beautiful. Each new environment that one plays in feels like different and the stylized art is truly breathtaking. The voice acting is fairly decent and the characters are charming throughout. The mechanics feel fairly tight, with just a bit of floatiness which is fine for the majority of the game. However, about 80% of the way through the game, the difficulty spikes unexpectedly. From that point, the game became less of a charming adventure and more of an endurance challenge in which I would die twenty times or so while trying to figure out a path that would allow me to get enough distance to connect to the next obstacle. The story resolution is a little weak, but the journey is still worth the time. As a result I cautiously recommend this game for people who are driven by art or enjoy First Person Platforming, elsewise I would find a different title."
9831,"Great game. The story is very short and simple. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. There is also a lot of cool little references and easter eggs spread throughout the game. It really should have been longer, because I loved every minute of it. Just make sure that you get it during a sale, because it's a little expensive for how short it is."
9832,"i died so many times that i feel like 20% of time played was failed attempts. The other 80% was having fun ; 3
"
9833,"Strong gameplay, and great visuals yet a weak story from what I can tell since I didn't find all the collectables. Also, the voice acting annoyed me. Took me about 3 hours to beat while doing some of the challenges. I recommend getting it on sale."
9834,Delightful and ingenious :)
9835,"Pretty fun and intresting game.  Has a decent story although the voice acting sounds a bit strange, almost like they are 100% native american even though they don't look like it.  The gameplay is pretty cool too.

The main thing I have to complain about is this: its so, so, so, so short.  I beat it in about 2 hours and that was with me looking for the secret unlockables too, and standing still while listening to the narrated parts.  It's actually so short that by the time you get good at it and your running and jumping around like a pro, the game is already over.  Not worth the original price since its only 3 hours of gameplay at max.  Unless your into playing it over and over for some reason.  I picked it up for $2.50 on a Winter sale so at that price its worth it."
9836,"The gameplay is reminiscent of ""mirror edge"", and focuses on the movements of the character. It is greatly designed and the various elements are introduced progressively. The univers is beautiful and immersive. Good work from the actors who give their voices to the characters. I am not conviced by the design of the other characters (a matter of taste I guess), but this is not a big deal. The story is simple, presented as a children's story, with no influence of the player (well, this is not a RPG, so no disappointment here)."
9837,literally a grown man
9838,"Good game, oddly reminiscent of the final Xen platforming levels of Half Life 1 but much more fluid. You have a lot of flexibility in what movement tools you can leverage to get through levels, and the difficulty was about right for me, as someone who is into FPS' but not nightmare platforming hellscapes.

The story is merely okay, not a masterpiece, but also not completely without some emotional impact, characters that matter, and intellectual comprehension required to make the connections between different facts. Good enough for it's length at any rate.

The main downside of the game is the relatively short length, but it still took me just under 4 hours to get through and I didn't really go looking for the collectibles.

I would say not really worth it at its default price of $13, for that reason, but on steam sales where you can grab it for $2.50-ish, you'd be a fool not to."
9839,"Nice storyline, nice environment, nice game mechanism. Get this if you have the spare dosh in your pocket as it will be worth it."
9840,"For the winter sale this was only 2.59 and it was vvery much so worth every penny. Fun gameplay and a suprisingly compelling story in such a short game. My only complaints are the voice acting and the length, though I definitely got enough game for how much I paidwhen it was on sale, and I get why making more game would be hard for a small production team. But overall really fun and worth a play.
"
9841,The difficulty in this game comes from finicky controls rather than challenging gameplay. That combined with subpar voice acting and a weak narrative and ending in a story based game means that it was an overall underwhelming experience.
9842,One of the best games ive played in a while. It has a very good srory and it has a lot of replay value
9843,Very good.
9844,"Absolutely beautiful game. The story is magnificent and the chracters are very well voiced. The controls are very easy and fluent. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good short-story game. My uncle passed away before Thanksgiving and this game really hit home for me upon finishing it. It really made me realize how much he meant to my life.

Pros:
- Great Voice actors.
- Great controls.
- Easy to follow story.
- Astonishingly beautiful environments.

Cons:
- No VR support."
9845,"In A Story About My Uncle, you will cross a hostile and fragmented world to find your adventurer uncle. The game is easy and short, but pleasant, and its story is really moving in the end. I would recommend you to buy this game!"
9846,uncle touchy basement adventure
9847,"A great atmospheric, calm and challenging first person grappling game. Short, but well worth the price of entry if you get it on sale."
9848,"I remember playing this game way back when it was a thing. I heard that Coffee Stain Studios took part in this, so I decided to check it out and I was expecting no less than a goatsimulator-esque gameplay experience. I was god damn wrong and I couldn't be happier about it. The visuals were stunning and it was fun. Swinging around the map with this ""ancient grappling hook"" really makes you feel empowered and it promised a movement-based gameplay like no other, and best of all, it delivered. The story and the narration works so well I was so invested on what happens next, right after I slingshot my way across the map. I really wonder what happened to his uncle. It was an experience 10/10."
9849,"Great innovative story, absolutely fantastic gameplay, difficulty picks up a lot near the end."
9850,"[h1] A Story About My Uncle is a great game with grapples and salamander people[/h1]

[i]Where to start...[/i] A Story About My Uncle is a good game with awesome graphics, good gameplay, and excellent storytelling. Even though I have only played a little bit of it, I am in [b]love[/b] with this game. There is just something so special about this game that always wants me coming back for more. The atmosphere is so fitting in a way that will fill you with awe. The action of grappling is just so smooth and very fun. Sometimes, the puzzles are challnging. It is easy at first, but gets challenging later. At the time I am writing this (December 27th) the game is only $2.59, and it is a game worth spending your money on. Here is a summary of the game: [spoiler]You play as a little girl's dad when he was a kid and try to find your uncle, who has mysteriously disappeared for several months. The boy got curious and put on Fred's adventure suit, which was in a locker. He turns on a device, which is meant to be a trash disposal pad, and warps to a whole differnet world. He gains power crystals along the way, which help him grapple his way. He meets a girl and she leads her to a village. You speak to the elder, wanting to know where your Uncle Fred is. Then you enter the Chasms, a dark and scary place, Madeline, the girl you met earlier hops on your back. After that, you explore the Chasms and fight many enemies along the way and explore new and colorful maps.[/spoiler]

[h1]Summary of Review[/h1]
Basically, it has great graphics, awesome gameplay, and excellent storytelling. This game is definitely worth your time and money."
9851,GREAT GAME!!! yes.
9852,"a very nice game, if you enjoyed playing Brothers you'll probably like the story in this even though the gameplay is completely different. gameplay is best described as jump map-esque with a limited use grapple hook in place of rockets. its only about 3 hours which may strike some people as a bit short but it just feels right, no more and no less than the story needs."
9853,"Loved the feel of the game, it can be confusing at times though."
9854,"I like the story, the vast universe, the way you jump from island to island....almost everything.

The only things I dislike about this game are the facts that you don't interact with the characters or scenery so what's the point of it even being there? And two, some parts are so tedious that if you're off by half a second or half a millimeter, you die and it gets so frustrating that you don't even want to play the game anymore. 

The final level was designed to be nearly impossible to make up for how short the came actually is.
 
This game is a cop-out"
9855,"[h1] I got the game at: $2.59 [/h1]

[h1] TLDR: [/h1] [spoiler] Pick it up at 5$ or less, and it has a good value. [/spoiler]

Story - Pretty good and followable, but a tad bit forced. Still, one of the best mini-stories I've experienced in a while. Voice acting is ehhh at times, but at others it is great.


Gameplay - The grappling hook functions exactly as it is in the trailers, and bears a momentum system. Gameplay can be a bit choppy, but that's pretty rare. Getting from one place to another is more or less a linear path, although some have alternate routes you can take. Collectibles are there, but are not forced and are entirely optional. [spoiler] The rocket boots are a welcome addition, making obstacles easier to cross. Most of the obstacles and gaps you encounter don't even require the boots. [/spoiler]. Only problem is that the game is wayy too expensive for a 2-3 hour game. Some filler may make it seem longer than it actually is.


Presentation - Gorgeous visuals, nothing seems to be static and everything looks moving. Reflections are awesome, and detail is put into every little house or even rocks. Level design is subtly giving you instructions on how to approach a course, and then gives you another to practice on.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Very nice experience, gameplay is great and has good visuals.
However, since it's only really a 2-3 hour experience with some time trials thrown in, it's not worth the original price tag. 

Pick it up for 5$ or less and you can get some good value out of it."
9856,"I had a really fun time with this game, especially the last level. You also have a nice conclusion to the story. I have a hard time recommending it though because of the length. I beat it in under two hours. I recommend getting it at a discount if you ever want to try it."
9857,"I strongly reccomend this. The story was compelling and the gameplay had me held steady for the entire duration. Though, I need to admit it was very short. Deeper meanings, exploration and finding loved ones - this game holds all of those. Honestly, I don't want to spoil anything so I wil ltry keep the review somewhat basic. But if you are looking for a good, story-driven game, this is for you. Just take your time :)"
9858,Amazing story with a great adventure! Really really awesome and beautiful graphics. The game is incredably fun and the story is good. This is a great siblge player game if you just fell like relaxing!
9859,"Stellar platforming experience. Controls are perfect, difficulty curve is perfect, graphics are nice."
9860,"A mostly fun grappling game. For its type of kiddie-themed story, it was rage-uninstalling frustrating for certain jumps. I would had liked to have more options in many of the environments to go my own ways, instead of how the designers set up the jumps, but the level design was still amazing.

I also started out using my Steam controller, but many of the targets required mouse and keyboard precision to hit."
9861,"Amazing short adventure game that I recommend on sale.
I purchased it for 1 euro and played it for 3 hours.I think that's good for the price plus the story is good and the animations are well done."
9862,"The game has rather simple mechanics but they are well tuned and polished.

The Art style is well done and brings upon a strange sense of nostalgia.

The graphics are well done but not anything overly impressive but the level of detail is consistent and well done.

Sound was the one place I feel this game fell short. 
Not so much that it is bad just that I felt more could be done with it, That being said the sound is that is the game makes your feel like your replaying a dream, so it does accomplish what the designer set out to do.

Voice acting and writing were nothing to praise but again accomplished the desired result of telling the story.

All in all A Story about my Uncle is a brief but fun game that is worth the purchase and at least one full playthrough.
It's left me wanting to know much more about the world developed in the narrative"
9863,Goddamnit Fred...
9864,"Magnificent game, But sadly, too short..."
9865,"Beautiful. Emotive. Unique.

An excellent idea, executed with the utmost precision. 

Spectacular."
9866,"Overall: the game is 8/10. It could have been Top 1 seller on steam, if the creators would spend more time developing plot and spend some time to create dialogues with the villagers, to give better opportunity to explore the world. Otherwise you simply run through the world too quickly

Pros:
+ Dynamics is constantly engaging
+ Very cool plot idea
+ Very beautiful world
+ Frog people
+ Narration is very fitting
+ Low demands for PC

Cons:
- Plot fills abrupt
- Short, but understandable, because the price is low
- Few challenges"
9867,"Very good game, 10/10 would cry again."
9868,"Parkour game with good narration story.
It's a shame that game is quite short, although I would still recommend it."
9869,good game
9870,good game 8/10 IGN
9871,"graphics: 9.5/10

overall: 8/10
the game is pretty, unique and has positive vibes. It has beautiful graphics, the gameplay is interesting and enjoyable, and the story is cute for lack of a better word. voice acting is decent and the controls are simple. story is rather short so its fun to play bit by bit before bed. The game has a gentle feel with relaxing environments. overall the game is good and perfect for a relaxing game to play inbetween other games with stronger campaigns. buy it on sale."
9872,It's just a great Game it's not very long with 2 h but the game is so great
9873,"Bought this game during the Winter Sale for a little more than $2. Pretty good buy if you want to kill a couple hours. I'd recommend getting this game on sale (as I'm writing this, it is). I'd say the game is too short for the full price, but it's definitely fun and would love seeing a sort of sequel to this."
9874,"Fun game with gorgeous art and design, with a cute story, and amazing narration/storytelling. If you find this game on sale, you should pick it up :)"
9875,"It's a pretty short game, but it was enjoyable. Some jumps frustrated me, but that is my lack of skills and not a problem with the game."
9876,So far i love this game! It's challenging and involves alot of thinking but the story and everything is amazing! i highly reccomend this game! https://youtu.be/0rRV052JQbQ
9877,"Great story, game play was smooth and concept easy to understand."
9878,.
9879,A short but good first-person platformer.
9880,"I bought this a while back and i've replayed the story a couple of times and i must say it's a very good game, with great visuals. The only down side for some people is the length of the story, I thought it still was a really good story and i can't recommend this game enough."
9881,"""A Story About My Uncle"" offers a gameplay-driven experience in a fairly original fantasy setting. The gameplay focusses on jumping and swinging around with your gear in order to get from point A to point B, and the main difficulty in this game is timing and physics, although the game doesn't get too difficult or tense, except for some short stealth parts. The story is alright, though nothing too special, unless you're in for some fan theories and digging into the story to unravel some stuff the game doesn' tell you.

It's a pretty fun game. It probably is fairly replayable, however I only played through it once and don't regret doing so.

7/10 - Give it a shot if it's on sale."
9882,"It's a great bit of fun for a few hours... Unless you like time trials, then you get some more fun out of it."
9883,"My favourite first-person platformer of all time. Loved responsiveness and how even though where you're meant to go looked confusing and as if you'd be going the wrong way, you always end up following the correct path. 10/10 mapping.

The story seemed clich√© and odd at first with how you were playing a character from a story someone was telling, but you do get enveloped into the world as you play. That definitely works in my eyes ;)

Either way, definitely recommending this for those who want to have ~3 hours of unique fp platforming :D rating 8.5/10 for me."
9884,best game i've ever played.
9885,Great game I reommend
9886,"Good short game with a great story, I took longer than I should have on most challenges, but that just added onto the greatness of the game. Probably a 2 hour story (took me 3). Seems like a good $5 game, so I would say buy it on sale, but you should still buy it.

7.5/10"
9887,"Igaz√°n r√∂vid, de √©rdekes √©s egyedi j√°t√©k. A t√∂rt√©net fa√©k egyszer≈±, meg kell tal√°lni az elt≈±nt nagyb√°tyj√°nkat. Ha kev√©s id≈ëd van, de egy sz√©pen √∂sszerakott kellemes j√°t√©kra v√°gysz, keresve sem tal√°lsz jobbat."
9888,so that's what uncles do
9889,"great game,"
9890,"This is some good sh*t right here. 
It's basically if Disney made a physics-based platformer game"
9891,"Honestly I thought I would enjoy this game when I bought it, and it was so much better than I thought it would be. With a short, but sweet story and great fluid gameplay this game is a must have."
9892,"Fun game 10/10
Really good story,
Game of the century 100%"
9893,"Amazing game, I realy love it ! But wait for the 80% reduction :^)"
9894,"It was very good, and too short imo.

Get it when it's on sale and you won't regret it."
9895,"Haven't played this game ?
Then play it. No questions"
9896,"I would recommend this game if it is on sale, unfortenatly the only thing that got my attentiton other than the atmospher is the gameplay. At its current price of $12.99 it is not worth it, i completed the game in less than 3 hours and its pretty sad asking that much for so little. If you were to strive for all the achivements than youll probably pick up about 2 more hours. On a positive note i really did enjoy the game while i played it even though the story is basic."
9897,This Game is one of the best i have ever played. It has a deep and rich lore which can get any new player hooked in a instant. This is one of the best looking games ever it is like seeing god. and the end of the game made me cry it was so beatuiful
9898,"Tr√®s tr√®s beaux graphismes, belle histoire, bref tout ce que j'aime. Je vous le conseille vraiment."
9899,"Good story and fun gameplay, it's just a little short."
9900,"Great game, A little short for me but bueno"
9901,"Amazing game, 9\10. Wish there was more story!"
9902,absolutely amazing! a little short when you end it but its really good andIi could play it all day long (I actually did) the story is amazing and I love the characther(s). I got it cheaper than originally so it was a good price for me. You should absolutely buy it!
9903,im the type of person to not like parkour games but this game is good
9904,"I like this game, but don't love it. This game can get quite tedious and kind of frustrating if you dont get your angle right or jump at the wrong time. I can only play this game for a short time before getting quite annoyed and or stressed out, I know it sounds weird but that is just it. For anyone looking for a good looking game and reasonably good gameplay, I would recommend this to them, but this game is just not for me. I only bought this game because it was $2.00 on sale, if it was not on sale I would not have gotten it."
9905,"Such a great game!! I was in tears when i got to the end that's how great of a game it was; I'll miss you Fred, and Maddy"
9906,8/10 take your lazer and fly
9907,"l rate 9/11, no rly great game l recommend :D"
9908,"This game is lots of fun. The mechanics are simple and I enjoyed it till the very end. I beat the game in 2 hours, so I didn't really have time to get bored of it though... Other than that, the narration is pretty cool and the character/world design is well done.  Anyways, grab it next time it's on sale, it will be worth your time for sure. :)"
9909,This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I highly recommend this game to people of all ages
9910,"A Story about my Uncle is incredibly charming and suitable for any age player. Full of visually astonishing moments with some cool game mechanics and physics, you adventure through a strange gravity-defying world searching for your Uncle Fred. The mechanics of the grapple, jets and jump work together wonderfully to create a pretty whimsical physics defying parkour adventure game with a fantasy element.

"
9911,A Story About My Uncle is a fantastic game.  The grappling and jumping are extremely satisfiying and tight.  The story is touching and the settings wonderous.  Even though it is a short game it is worth buying at full price and a steal on sale.
9912,"I recommend this game if the game was on sale.

Pros:
- Great story line
- Atmospheric
- Story Rich
- Great Soundtrack
- Puzzles
- Textures

Cons:
- Short playtime
- Few glitches
- I think the ending was kind of predictable
- It has great story but the ending isn't enough to answer the mystery Spoiler [DONT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME.]: [spoiler]Like how do his grandpa make the inner world and why he decided to say also how he died.[/spoiler]"
9913,"8/10
Story-driven puzzle platformer.
+Sweet graphics and art style
+Somewhat original gameplay mechanics
+Nice story and level design
-Somewhat short story. Finished the game in 4 hours"
9914,"It's the spiderman game you've always wanted.

But honestly, the voice acting and audio management was kinda subpar, the writing was a bit obvious and trope-y, and it has multiple glitches, including some on the Options screen (that really shouldn't be a thing.)

But it's 2 hours of pretty okay fun. Not 12 dollars fun, but fun.
If you can get it for free, or <$5, I'd say it's alright."
9915,"This game has lots of potential in worldbuilding and philosophical implications, but it ultimately goes nowhere. It's worth grabbing on sale if nothing else."
9916,"This game tells a fantastic story with amazing visuals. The gameplay brings on the flow and it could take hours to look at all the detail of houses, characters and courses. Since it is a Unreal-Engine game, the effects are great and realistic. You could easily finish the story, but if you want 100% it could take it's time!"
9917,gg
9918,A short game with an amazing story!
9919,RGEB
9920,"Great Game. Bought it on sales, totally worth it ! I didn't make all the challenges and other, but the story is cool, the world is beautiful and I spent several minutes in each level to admire the landscapes !"
9921,"I bought this game during aa sale. around ¬£3.50, and honetly? it would be worth the ¬£10, the grappling mechanic is fun and awesome, The story is beautiful and the music is amazing. I really recommend this game 10/10 in my opinion.. cant really find any flaws at all"
9922,Got this because of Leafy even though I don't like him much. Was still worth it.
9923,"The game is decently short, but for the price, it is a great platformer. The narrator is my favorite part of the game, but gameplay is amazing as well."
9924,"An excellent, creative game that is great visually, with fun gameplay, and a rather unique storyline."
9925,"[b]A Story About My Uncle is a short experience with a neat little story behind it.[/b]
The key mechanic in ASAMU is the platforming with the hook, which makes for some well done fast paced fun. 
The swinging is fluid, the difficulty is reasonable and I felt no frustration throughout the game.
Once in the game itself you'll notice that it offer some really stunning visuals with a lot of detail that make the playthrough even more appetizing.
I can't really find a reason to not pick this up and take a quick look at the beauty that awaits!

If anyone cares: the game also has steam trading cards.

Try it out if you have the time, because it really is a little gem I don't hear people talk about anymore."
9926,"It's one of those short but sweet games that plays out like a dream. Really enjoyable and full of strange stuff/worlds but over all to quick. I beat it in 2.5 hours. I doubt I'll play it again but it rings like those dreams that were so good the memories linger.

Worth playing if you can get over the time to cost ratio. Buy it on sale."
9927,"It's a really nice game, I presonally enjoyed it a lot ! :)

- The storyline is simple and very beautiful.
- Graphics of the game is beautiful, you really feel like you are in another world for a moment.
- The design of the maps are simple and very very beautiful.

You can have an amazing experience during gameplay I would rate it 10/10 :)

Sorry for my bad English tho ^^"
9928,"Dream-like game. Gameplay is pretty simple, with a some fun problem solving for figuring out how to get from one place to the next. Loved taking in the beautiful world created while flying through from platform to platform. The narration was well done, too."
9929,"okay so I'll be honest here, I only got this game after watching leafyishere play it for a few of his videos. it was memorizing and definitely drew me into it. I didn't know anything about the story before playing it but this game is an absolute gem. I'm happy I got it when I did and I'm happy I played it all the way through to get all the achievements, this is definitely one of my favorite games. the movement in this game is just relaxing and I completely recommend this as a must play."
9930,"[h1] A Story About My Uncle [/h1]

What to say? This game is incredible. Not only because of it's platforming mechanics, but because of it's [b] great [/b] story. This game makes you feel [b] part [/b] of the story. It has some Unlockables wich are unlocked by obtaining Fred's Readings (Collectables), that are pretty awsome to be honest.

[h1] The Story [/h1]

I'm not going to spoil any part of the game, I'm just telling things that players will experience at the begining.

The story is about your Uncle Fred. You are his 8 years old grandson and you are trying to find him, because he ""disappeared"". The story is told by you, in the future, as a story to your daughter. The story is told as you progress in the game, so that it makes sense, and it gives you usefull information. Troughtout the game, you will find many symbols/runes and many scriptures, I suggest not giving it much importance for now.

This game has a [b] huge [/b] background story, but as I don't want to spoil anything of it, I'll just say it is [b] really [/b] well done.

When you finish the game, just go ahead and search as many things as you wish, but remember, it's a total masterpiece and don't be surprised if it blows your mind.

[h1] Summary [/h1]

This is a total [b] masterpiece [/b] , and no, I'm not getting paid for this nor got the game for free.

This game is totally worth [b] playing [/b] , I don't like saying if it is worth it or not for it's price, I'm just gonna say it's a [b] really good [/b] story, it won't give you more than 20 hours, but I am sure, that you will totally like those hours.

Talking about the price, I personally bought it with a discount, and I felt it [b] totally [/b] worth it.
If $12,99 is too much for you, wait for an offer. If it is not, just go ahead and buy it.

10/10.

I hope you liked my review, see ya :) Aasgar

PD: I apologise for my english, it's not my native language."
9931,"This reminds me a lot of my daydreams. High jumping, high flying, dream-like gameplay. Great game overall. Unfortunately it does have very inconsistent difficulty. At times it's intuitive and rewarding, at other times *endlessly* frustrating. My keyboard's a little worse for the wear after finishing this one. At least there were frequent checkpoints. Also it's too short. There's a lot more they could have done with it."
9932,"Paid a $1.00. Well worth my dollar, would have paid more. Finished it in one evening. Looks great, runs smooth and is beautifully designed."
9933,Its pretty.
9934,"This game is hard a rock, it is a good geme, But the price shouldn't be ¬£10 cos this game is more like a free to play than a pay to play.
"
9935,YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS! TRUST ME!
9936,"What to say about this game? First off, it's a fun story. Your uncle has gone missing, and you find yourself on an alien planet looking for him. 

The gameplay is a first person platformer. You have a grapple beam that you use to grab one rock and swing on. Eventually, you get the ability to make long jumps, shoot multiple grapples. But then it starts to get stupid hard. I mean, grab this rock, swing to the other, shoot the refill your meter rock, grab another, grab another, refill your meter rock, grab 2 more, hope you land on the right place. I haven't made it to the end. I really hope my next jump is the last jump in the game. Every now and again, I load up the game, and try that last jump again.

Update 4/211/17: HOLY CRAP! I beat this. Well, that ""last jump"" I'd been stuck on for months was about an hour before the end of the game, but I did it. Wow, do I feel good."
9937,"If you've ever wanted to swing trough the air like Tarzan, while constantly taking photos of gorgeous suroundings and listening to your pap tell you a nice bed time story with a lesson, then don't be afraid to jump into this one.

+ Well told story
+ Good voice acting
+ Every frame is like a photo waiting to be taken
+ Great responsive controls
+ Hidden ""Collectables"" unlock additional features (like Goat Mode)

- Short (but sweet)
- Grapple could have been used for so much more than just swinging
- Rocket boots could have been used for more than just filling the distance gap

It's a lovely eye candy with a tale to warm your heart.
Definitely a good buy during a sale.
Also, Goat Mode is a MUST; the goat screaming in sheer terror while rocket boots propell you trough the air is absolutely hillarious.

7.5/10"
9938,"Short, but very playable and very good fun. I doubt theres much replay value, but for a few hours of gameplay it was very entertaining."
9939,Short but sweet. Great and addicting gameplay and the story keeps you hooked and wanting more. Gets hard towards the end but the ending is worth it
9940,"I really love this game
"
9941,"A terrific game. Usually I hate small stories like this, but after I got to the ending my mind was just blown. Fun gameplay too"
9942,"Bought this during the Steam autumn sale for ‚Ç¨2.50 and what a bargain it was!
This is a first-person single player game where the aim is to make your way through obstacles using different kinds of leaps as well as your grappling device and rocket boots (you will get the rocket boots in Star Haven). 
The game looks very nice visually with vivid colors and runs smoothly on normal computers; I believe you will not have a problem running it unless your computer's performance is ridiculously low.
The fact that there is no multiplayer may lead to people not buying it so if you really dislike playing alone don't get it.
However, when you grapple (at least at first) you feel like a total badass and as the obstacles become progressively more difficult you feel a certain satisfaction once overcoming them. 
The achievements are fairly challenging and you will need to master the game in order to get them which is a fun challenge for those of you who are achievement hunters.
The gameplay lasted around 5 hours for me. I did not try to find collectables or interact with objects because I didn't know the game well enough so 5-6 hours is a good estimation of what the game should take at a reasonable pace.
Overall, this is definitely a fun game even though it's offline so as I said, if you only like playing with other people do not get this, but I recommend finding it on discount and buying it off Steam because it is definitely worth the ‚Ç¨2.50 that you will pay!"
9943,"Wow! Love the narration style, incredibly fun physics and mechanics. Impressive game for a studio as small as this. Touching ending!"
9944,awesome game
9945,"I loved this game, it has great graphics, good gameplay mechanics and the level design is great!

The only thing that I think it would be better is the lenght of the game, it's too short!!

Otherwise, great game and good story!"
9946,My uncle touched me
9947,"Like a good short-story. Lovely story, relaxed and simple gameplay, liked the level design. Had fun from start to finish. 
It's rather short and maybe a little too easy for the average gamer."
9948,"What do I think about this game?
Ive completed this game and I personally enjoyed the few hours the game has to offer. This game is amazing first person grapple game with some tiering moments in the mix (which I wont spoil). Unfortunately in my opinion the game isnt long enough for a game at this amount of money. I only suggest buying this game for around ¬£5 as ¬£9.99 isnt worth it when you can buy much more intresting games. They have used many fun features into the game which is listed below.

Intresting features embedded into the game:
- They have used intresting maps
- They have made a emotional story
- The style of the game (The way the world looks)
- The parkour

I hope you have made up your mind on what you would like to spend your money on."
9949,Very fun and short.
9950,"What a great game , with great visuals and story and soundtracks, too bad its short , but had fun every seconds while playing this game. Thanks for making this."
9951,"pretty good game mate, 10/10 gameplay, 10/10 story, just wish there was more."
9952,"it's the Just Cause grappling hook, but now a very creative game, i personally loved it and found it very pleasent.

9/10"
9953,"Amazing gun. Rich setting. Fun gameplay. No violence for once, very forgving but still fun. Beautiful graphics."
9954,"This is a good game for all you parkour loving gamers. Although the game can be long, confusing and misleading it it genuinely a great game that will bring hours of enjoyment. Great game for if your just having a break from a different game and just decide to play this game for 1 hour or even just 30 mins. However, once you finish the game there is not much more to do other than replay it to find achievements, or play time trials. However you will have gotten your $13 worth out of this time by the time you finish the great story line of the campaign. Overall a great game highly recommend it :)"
9955,"+hard as balls, grappling hook

-voice acting, hard as balls, character models, story

Don't buy this game for more than it's sale price of just over 2 dollars."
9956,"Fun game with fluid controls and some nice challenges along the way. However, the voice acting is pretty terrible and, unfortunately, the story ends around the time you start to feel you've mastered the movements."
9957,"All round great Leafy video,"
9958,23/10 This game is amazing
9959,"I got this for 1.99 in a sale a while back and I didn't expect to like the game as much as I did. Although it was kinda short (still took me nearly 4 hours) this was such a pleasant experience with nice graphics, scenery and gameplay. Will be trying to get some of the achievements now. Well done developers, you've done a very nice job!"
9960,"Beautiful game but sometimes its gets really annoyin
Like it very much"
9961,"Short, but sweet.

This is fantastic little game - atmospheric with fun game mechanics - that made me giggle with glee. The setting is so magical that the frog creatures cannot help but look disappointing by comparison, but overall, I was positively enchanted. Flying from platform to platform is a ton of fun, and I actually found myself holding my breath at times, leaning forwards in my seat like that would help my character land where I wanted him to.

From the people who brought you Goat Simulator, of all things.

Fancy that."
9962,"The story was good, and the gameplay was fun, but I can't really feel satisfied with how short it was. It was one sitting, less than 3 hours, to complete the game. It's a pretty decent platformer, a little easy, but I can't give it a thumbs up. I just don't feel like I got a full game."
9963,"Im not crying, There's something in my eye. I Swear."
9964,"A Story About My Uncle is a rather pleasant first-person puzzle-platformer.

It takes you through a number of areas from water caverns, dark shadowy abysses, starry-skyed mountains and ice caves, all with a calm relaxed narration as the game is told by a father giving his daughter a bed-time story. It's very linear but what else do you expect from a puzzle-platformer in the end?

The game's mechanics themselves are quite well thought out, and you'll be effectively rope-swinging through the levels with boost jumps here and there as well. There are some collectibles strewn about the levls as well, but they aren't all that out of the way, and I didn't see a use for them. Perhaps I didn't find enough to get an alternate ending or something? Not sure.

The art-style and sound design also creates a calming and relaxed atmosphere without tension which also plays to the game's strengths, there were only a couple of times when I personally got frustrated with the game. Those were typically when the paths were not well sign-posted, or some of the game's mechanics were a little temperamental. 

Worth a buy when on sale as the game only lasts about [i](refers to personal playtime)[/i] hours or so."
9965,"Story : 8/10
Gameplay : 10/10
Playtime : 1-2h (5/10)
Atmosphere: 10/10
Fun: 9/10

I highly recommend this game for people who love to play a game with a good story, fantastic and varied world and astonishing atmosphere. Although it is kinda short and easy to play, it is worth every god damn $$$. Buy this game during a sale for ~3‚Ç¨ and you will never regret your choice."
9966,like it!
9967,Amazing game and worth trying. Loved it!
9968,I only played the game for 2 and a half hours but it was amazing. Honestly a great storyline with great characters and overall a really fun game.
9969,"So,this is my first review of a game ever.I never thought I would write one,but after playing this game,I just felt I had to ! 
This game is worth the money,this game is worth every cent,its just worth your money,your time...the story takes about 4 hourse + trials or replaying challenges or just grappling around the world.The story is breathtaking,the graphics are not perfect,but the game has that kind of animation,I will always think its beautifull even 20 years later,I know that...You can fall into the story so easily,that I actually forgot about the time and just played,sometimes I would stop and just look at the sky for a few minutes and then continue.I love this kind of games more than anything,I recommend this to anyone...IT IS WORTH PLAYING.And I hope there will be another game like this or a sequel to this would be a dream.
+Price is not that big
+Beautifull story
+Beautifull graphics
+Beautifull soundtrack
+You may cry like a child at the end
+You will beg for the continuing of this game after playing it
..........
- Could be longer
- Few bugs (but just like every game has some)"
9970,"This is definitely my favorite platformer since the portal series. The story and artwork are awesome, and the puzzles always kept me interested even though they weren't all that har. It is more of a game built to make you want to speed run it, but if you like enjoying the sceneary, finding all of the collectibles can a be a fun task in itself."
9971,"One of the best platformers I've ever played it controls very smoothly and you really need to adapt your play-style as you progress through the story, It is a shorter game but it is a very fun one. very nice chill game"
9972,Simple & fun puzzle solving in a beautiful world! It's a little short but it tells a great story.
9973,"A wonderfully beautiful game about a man telling his daughter A Story About His Uncle.

[h1][b][u]Pros:[/u][/b][/h1]
Fun game mechanics
Well-written lines & characters
Good map design
Graphically impressive

[h1][b][u]Cons:[/u][/b][/h1]
Too short
Some NPC animations are amateur

Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10. I'd recommend this game for anyone with a functioning, human brain."
9974,Foi interessante at√© aparecer aliens sapos que vivem em casas de lixo.
9975,""" A Story About my Uncle "" is a Adventure/Plateformer game wich tell's a journey into a another dimension.

Basically, you have a suit which have a grappling devive, super jump and dash and a rocket boots that help's you seek out the uncle Fred¬¥s. The main character is his nephew, who is a curious child ;).

You use the suit because in this dimension the ground is suspended in the air, so you need to coordenate your resources and make some combinations in order to proceed your way.

There are no combats in this game, so its a non-violent game afterwards, it's ideal for children or for adults with a children inside :D because dreaming it's about that for sure ;)

This game is very short,  i beat it in 3 hours so it's better for you to buy this game in sale!"
9976,"
""Hey, let's play a game! I bet that you can't get through this part without using the grapple device!""

After 2 seconds I fell into a pit and died with a child on my back.
I'm the best person ever.

10/10 would play a game with an humanoid female frog again XDxDXDXDXDXDXDXXDXDDXD"
9977,Simply an amazing adventure!
9978,"Rather relaxing game, allthough on the short side ( finished it in ~2 hours ) . Purchased it on sale for that price def worth the experience, altough wouldnt have paid 13 euros for this game since i only got 2 hours out of it."
9979,"great game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
the sight is amazing"
9980,"Amazing storyline and not to action packed great moments worth the money, should make another one."
9981,It's a better Spiderman game than any actual Spiderman game. Some of the most satisfying gameplay around. Too bad it's so short.
9982,"Beautiful graphics, breathtaking gamepley, can't wait to get more from these devs and see what the community has to offer to make the game better!"
9983,amazing game that has nice visuals and a great story. 10/10 Haven't had a good game like this in a while
9984,Without a doubt you should consider buying this gem in a heart beat. The game provides a great sense of wonder and innocence that is lacking in most adventure games now days. Its a great game to sit back to and relax while soaking in on the wonderful narration.
9985,"So far, this game is SOOO cool!! I started a Let's Play on my channel. Check it out if you are on the fence! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbTcgwyQy2Y"
9986,"First things first, i think the price when this game isn't on sale is somewhat on the high side of things.
Still, I've spent a lot more money for a few hours i enjoyed a lot less and i assume you can make it last a whole while longer if you go achievment hunting :)
And despite only playing this game for 2 hours i have to say that I've rarely run into a game where the story got anywhere near as touching as it did in this one.
To make this short, this game has some lovely scenery, charming and touching story and an interesting playstile that i personally haven't seen anywhere else before.
If you have money to spare, this game's well worth it. If it's on sale, its a must-have as far as I'm concerned."
9987,"Wonderfull game, but i felt its a bit short, i want more :)
But its simpel, nice flow, easy to play and understand.
Story is simpel and nice

I just say, play it =)"
9988,Fantastic platformer. I'd reccomend getting it on sale as a competent player should be able to complete it in about 3.5 hours or so. I've gone back and tried to find new places. I love the art style and the subtle narrative told as you travel throughout seemingly different worlds. I reccomend this game completely.
9989,Pretty good
9990,"Amazing beautiful game, if your looking for an exciting platformer this is the game for you!"
9991,"""Do you recommend this game?"" Well of freaking course I recommend this game!
This game has one of the best stories I have seen in a game in a really long time: [no spoilers] A father tells his daughter a bedtime story about one of the adventures he experienced with his uncle. Now as the father tells his story, you play the role of the father in that story. The way the story progresses and is told works so good together with the actual game. You really want to find out what happened next and keep playing.
Besides the story, the world in which the story takes place is beautiful and epic. It's a true fantasy world which you could only dream of seeing in real life. The graphics are very well done! Only downside is the character design of the characters you encounter during the game. They seem pretty fake, lifeless and really don't seem to care that a complete stranger barges in their kind of isolated town.
I completed the game in around 3 to 3.5 hours - and I can really, really take my time playing a game if I want to - so it's pretty short, but nevertheless a great game. I will probably play this game a couple more times eventhough I finished it already. Very well done!"
9992,Just finished the game. It kept me on my toes the whole time. Highly recommend it.
9993,I saw leafy play this game
9994,It is awesome game if you are stoned af.
9995,Beautiful game.
9996,"Havn't finished yet but so far, so good"
9997,"why is this so short?
15/10, it should be able to stack game copies on steam."
9998,This is a FUN game.
9999,"Such an incredible adventure!!! I went into this game without any knowledge of what it was about and was blown away. This title is very short, I got to about 3/4 mark of the game in around 2 hours but it is well paced and the story flows nicely over the puzzles. I would definetly recommend this game for anyone who likes both puzzles and story games!!
It's also stunning and beautiful and gives you such a sense of an alternat world! Felt extremely emmersed in the worlds I travelled."
10000,"Every corner of this game had me intrigued.  So, so beautiful and interesting.  I made my boyfriend watch me play so I wouldn't experience it alone. Nominated it for the ""Whoaaaaaaaaaa, Dude"" award."
10001,"Very fun game to relax with, if your into platformers 12.99 is well worth it, if not get it on sale."
10002,Great game! Fun to play and interesting story. I love it.
10003,"My first thought as I started playing was 'ok, this looks really good', which held true until the last minute of the game. Gameplay essentially consists of jumping/grappling/boosting your way through a few levels while the main character narrates the story. The scenery, for the most part, is comprised either of colorful dreamscapes with floating mountains and cities, or else vast cavernous complexes riddled with bioluminescent life - and it all looks amazing. There's a soothing sort of awe in landing on a floating chunk of rock where a cushion-furnished gazebo happens to have been built. Who built it? Who spends time here? It's all very surreal. In fact, the space through which the player navigates is often littered with floating platforms and objects, odd-looking sculptures, sometimes entire villages, and the whole thing is so architectonically impractical that it could only belong in a dream, or a children's story and, well, the game works well on that level... dream or fable, it manages to endow the experience with a great deal of wonder. 

The narrative takes the shape of a bedtime story which you (the grown-up version of the protagonist) tell your daughter about the time when you were a kid and went on an adventure, looking for your missing uncle. The voice acting is flawless, and there's a melancholic tone in it that makes you wonder about the unspoken details of the main character's relationship with his uncle, and the reality which inspired this hyper-imaginative tale. 

I was really pleasantly surprised with this game. It's well-executed on almost every level and manages to convey a touching story with the support of simple and extremely fun gameplay. It may not be game-of-the-year material, but you know what? I wish there were more games like this."
10004,"Endless fun, Id jack off to salamanders again if i could"
10005,absolutley wonder full story rich parkour game 10/10 would recomend for anybody
10006,"Wonderful short game with amazing visuals and enviroments. The gameplay is what sold me. It had a Portal like feel to it due to the fact it is charming. If you haven't played this yet, you should."
10007,This is a short game only about 2 or 3 hours long but the game mechanics are amazing and the story is very touching.
10008,"Buy it
"
10009,Literally
10010,"This game is awesome.

Pros:

- A good story.
- Very easy.
- Very fun.
- Doesn't take 7 hours to complete.

Cons:

- A little too short.

Overall review:

Am i ready to pay 13$ for this game? Hell no this game is good to buy at 5$ or under. 
The game has a nice engine with good physics and fun gameplay.
I would recommend."
10011,This game is just awesome !
10012,"Don't let the name fool you, This game is wonderful. While there are some parts that may be challenging nothing is impossible. There are a few parts where it isn't exactly clear on what you're supposed to do or where you're supposed to go, but that might just be me. A simplistic and straightforward story line. It is extremely relaxing grappling from stone to stone, a beautifully rendered world. Awe-inspiring. Sublime. 
 
Two negatives:
-Too Short.
-No Skipping of Cutscenes. 
I recommend this game."
10013,good storyline with tricky and fun mazes
10014,"Enjoyable and smooth gameplay, nice story.Simply a wonderful game."
10015,Good chill game
10016,super cool game. i know about it from leafy. they should update it and stuff tho
10017,"I stumbled across this game on YouTube while watching a commentary and thought really nothing of the game itself, but thought the concept of grappling was really interesting. A few days ago, I found the game on sale for very cheap and decided to give it a go. Well that was probably one of the best games I have stumbled upon in a very long time and was much more than just grappling around a rocky environment and had one of the best simple story games I have played in quite some time. The art is extremely interesting and even though the AI seems a bit clunky with movement, the story makesup for it all and it almost seems intended with the art style making the game almost nostalgic. I highly recommend this game and even though the story is pretty short, there is still a lot to do after completing the game."
10018,"SOOOOO goood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
10019,"I first found out about this game from leafy - ughh - but it looked cool and I wanted to try it out. 
Pros:
- Really good music and scenery
- Really fun gameplay
- Interesting story
- Nice game mechanics

Cons:
- It's a short game

I personally got it for sale at $2.59, but I would be willing to pay full price. Trust me, it's worth it."
10020,"awfull game, too boring"
10021,"Buy it just for the narrator's voice alone. 
Well worth it.
Story is pretty touching as well."
10022,"Fantastic game. I bought it full price and it was worth every penny. Love the time trials and trying to get gold on the last map! Wish there was some more maps, but don't we all?"
10023,I cry everytime
10024,buy dis
10025,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! Very poor game mechanics and overall a really bad game. If you buy this game, do not expect anything to work properly. What I mean by that is if you're holding on to a rock or piece of land, sometimes it will automaticly disconnect you and if you try to connect to a rock or piece of land and your crosshair lights up it won't connect sometimes. Also if you land, sometimes the rope thing won't recharge. If you fix these awful errors I will paly this game more."
10026,"I'd easily pay $20 to play this game for the first time again. While very short, every second feels new and amazing, and instills a sense of childlike wonder. A really beautiful and imaginative game."
10027,This game was beautiful. Great story with a soothing voice over which was both relaxing and mesmerizing. Great for people who are like me and cannot play long haul story games and are looking for a quick relief in-game. Took me about 2hrs to complete and left me thinking about how Uncle Fred's story continued. Definitely a great pickup and one of the best (out of the few) story games that I have completed.
10028,"Aw onderful short little game, enjoyed every moment. just a bit too short, would have liked more ime in the world of the uncle."
10029,Good Potato
10030,It good game. trust me you will have fun time playing thus game
10031,i do parcore
10032,I like the movement and stuff
10033,"Different game then what I'm used to playing, short, cheesy, but overall fun."
10034,"Such a fun game, Good little story. Well made"
10035,"Surprisingly good. Short story, one run through took me about 3.5 hours. The story is a bit shallow, but still the interesting for the sci-fi exploration theme it is. It's more about the puzzles of how to move across the map and finding the collectibles. I was frustratingly addicted to figuring out some of the stages because I couldn't clear some areas after 10 minutes. Great game!"
10036,Very nice and open world game. The parkour is also really fun and is a great way to kill time
10037,"This game does a fantastic job of slowly building on its mechanics without overstaying its welcome. On my first playthrough I finished the story in about 2 hours but that should not be deterent from seeing the real value of this game. Due to the way the mechanics are built up, coming back to the early levels after completion makes it feel like an entirely different game. I felt an urge to see how fast I could cross every level (with a nifty addition of a time trial system) and realized that there are a multitude of different routes that can be taken in every area with a plethora of secrets I never would have thought reachable in my first playthrough. 

One of the only downsides I have found to this game is the way you cannot skip the in-game exposition moments which, while disabled in the time trial mode, can become a bit repetative when trying to get achievements on each of the levels in story mode.

Despite that minor issue I highly recommend this game to everyone because it provides a fun gameplay experience that can be revisited later for a replay value not often found in short single player games like this."
10038,Definitely a game worth playing. Movement like no other game can provide. Beautiful. 8.5/10
10039,Cool game 10/10
10040,"Good game, but short. Only 3 hours to finish it."
10041,"A sweet small treat for anyone who likes casual puzzle games. Amazing scenery, relaxing gameplay and a little challenge towards the end. The story is OK, nothing special. Otherwise I would recommened picking this up during a sale."
10042,"(Only 1.7 hours I played online, played 2 hours worth offline)

A Story About My Uncle is a weird game, haven't played anything similar to it. Overall it was enjoyable, but the story is seriously lacking.

Pros
- Fun and (mostly) smooth gameplay mechanics
- Good pacing
- Interesting universe
- [spoiler]Surprisingly emotional ending[/spoiler]

Cons
- Character development is rushed [spoiler] with the exception of the last Pro[/spoiler]
- Mechanics bug out a little sometimes, but not enough to ruin the experience by any means
- Short, about 4 hours worth on a normal playthrough
- No replayability

Overall: Pick it up on sale"
10043,Jumpy jump and loads of fun!
10044,This game is way too short for the full price of this game.
10045,Its one of those games that makes me really happy
10046,This game is one of the best games i've played so far. It has soo much emotions. Would really like to play more games of this kind made by these guys. 10/10
10047,"Graphicly beautiful, gameplay is smooth and intuitive, nice (but maybe too short) story and touching. 

If you look for a chill plateforme fairy game, this is for you"
10048,"Its a very fun game with a very nice story, the ending.. not so much.. also it is way too short, 2 hours is the maximum you'll be getting out of the main game. 
i'd only buy it on sale if i where you"
10049,"This game is short but sweet
Great characters and storyline
Great mechanics
Good chalenges but not too difficult
Extremely Relaxing"
10050,^_^  ·Éí·É£·Éì
10051,SUCH A DAMN GREAT GAME....REALLY GONNA PLAY IT AGAIN.....AT THE FKING MADDIE CHALLENGE U BASTARD
10052,Such a cute and fun game! I wish it was longer :(
10053,"the only drawback to this game is a sequel.
Its a very relaxing game,athmospheric and all.
9/10-for lack of a sequel.Would play again
Buy the game it is worth it,especially on sale."
10054,"A fun, time waster game that tests you in the speedruns"
10055,amazing.
10056,"This game is similar to Journey (see PS3) with great atmostphere and magnetic storyline. 
Throw in flying thorugh amazing enviroments at high speed and you have a very enjoyable game"
10057,"Just, this game is so beatiful. and i think it a AAA game, but the price is really low."
10058,Fun game with beautiful music and a decent narration.
10059,Great game with good music and a decent story. I've played this twice all the way through and still love it.
10060,A fantastioc movement system in a breath taking world. My only complain is that it isnt longer because I desperatley want more!
10061,One of the most individual games I've ever played. Well done. (EDIT: One year on i still absoluteley love it. Some of the controls can be a little annoying but it's still a fabulous and well-made game.)
10062,"Veri good, short doe"
10063,"I cannot rate this amazing game highly enough, It deserves all of its praise and is truely a fun and engaging platformer with an awesome story to boot."
10064,"good narrative story,good graphics,and really fun"
10065,Only a couple hours worth of gameplay but totally worth it!  A very clean fast paced game.
10066,"This game is a catchy masterpiece.
When I first saw the game I was very doubtful, not every Indie game is great and some want to sell more than they actually have. And yet while playing through this work of art I understood why people liked it and why I wanted to recommend it.
Plus side: voice acting is good, gameplay style interesting, the end will leave you wanting for more
bad side: character modes arent the best , can sometimes be frustrating
goat side: *insert goat scream*
I recommend it"
10067,It was a decent romp to pass a few hours on a lazy day. This is definitely a title for both young and old. The storyline is enjoyable for both crowds and the jumps are challenging enough to keep everyone hooked.
10068,nice
10069,"A Story About My Uncle is, as others have put it, one of the best bedtime stories around. It's an extremely beautiful and creative world, with loads of fun platforming to be had. While the game is short, it's jam-packed with interesting scenery and a touching story. If you've got a couple bucks while the game is on sale, I'd definitely recommend picking it up!"
10070,"Really good game, worth the price. Escpecially when it is on sale."
10071,A gently entertaining and enjoyable game.
10072,The story of this game is way cooler than i tought. The action are well imaginated and so are the personages.
10073,"Environments that remind me of the Myst series, puzzle platformer gameplay that reminds me of the Portal games (though with a grappling hook mechanic instead of portals), an awesome sense of movement, and challenging, but not impossible puzzles and challenges.  The story is cute, with a man telling his daughter a bedtime story about a search he went on to find his inventor uncle when he was a boy.  The ending tells a little more than that, but I don't want to spoil it.

Get this game and enjoy.   It's a little on the short side, but it's also very cheap."
10074,"For full price this game is little short, but if it drops down to, lets say, 50% grab it. Its fps puzzle game (like Portal for example) but focused on motion. And great world design :)"
10075,It was fun to play this game. GG.
10076,"Pros: 
Great way to kill some time
Intresting story. 
Fun gameplay

Cons:
Story only lasted 2 Hours
Limited replayability

- Would easy recommend this game, however pick it up during a sale, $13 is a bit to much for anyone who isn't a completionist."
10077,"This is an amazing game, short, but amazing. Definately worth a buy :)"
10078,"It was on sale and I had seen its name on Youtube a couple times. A wonderful two hours of gameplay and story. Loe that you can go back to every level to explore every inch of them and speedrun them. Not the best game out this year, but a good one. 8/10"
10079,"Amazing and entertaining game. Unfortunately to short! Definetly needs a sequal, a bigger one as well!"
10080,"Beautiful Game, that made me cri"
10081,"An amazing game with amazing visuals and gameplay. The story (presented as a bedtime story) keeps you wondering what will come next, and whether the protagonist is really telling the truth (a bit of Unreliable Narrator until the end). The story is short (4 hours if you suck at physics) The game has a bit of replay value in the form of the many achievements and challenge levels you can unlock and try, but overall it's quite an experience and doesn't need a whole lot of replay value to be great.

10/10 for sure."
10082,"Super calm, fun and relaxing game. It took me 2 hours to complete, could have probably rushed through faster, but got stuck trying to do Maddies challenge.

Honestly, I feel like I got bang for my buck. It was a cool experience, the controls are relatively tight. I'd definitely be interested in a full blown game with these mechanics.

Get high, pay the tiny price of this game, and have a blast playing this for 2 hours."
10083,"This game is unique, creative, and innovating. The narrative is amazing. Characters are awesome. And whats not to like about frog alien like world parkour? Get this game ASAP, a great time waster. 8.5/10 worth the money."
10084,10/10 hasn't any DLCs
10085,One of the most interesting stories ever in a Game with sad and happy moments
10086,"This game is fucking great, just flying around is the most fun thing ever. Story is only like 3 hours of gameplay but it's worth every second."
10087,"Adore the game already, played this since it came out on multiple accounts, well worth the price for sure.
"
10088,I picked this up in a sale. I wasn't expecting much so the game really surprised me. It's a nice tale with an unique look and fresh gameplay. I enjoyed every minute of it.
10089,nice game
10090,"+ heartwarming story
+ beautiful landscapes
+ nice graphics
+ awesome parkour adventure
+ relaxing

- the gameplay is a bit short :(

9/10"
10091,"Crysis 3 - meh
GTA V - meh
A Story About My Uncle - landed in the cave in the first level, looked up and saw the view - ""Whoa, that's beautiful!"""
10092,"I really love this game.

It is kinda short tho, but challenging if you want to get all the achievements.

The visuals are nice and the story is cute.

Also, have I mentioned goats? There is a goat-mode. You can play as a goat-person grappling through amazing landscapes. I love goats. 10/10 for goats."
10093,Great game. Just a bit hard to complete.
10094,veri sad but gud geim xd
10095,Great game I wish it was longer though 8/10
10096,Great story and gameplay.
10097,"Fantastic, whimsical game with awesome atmosphere and extremeley enjoyable platformming! A delightlyfully short yet emotional experience. Unique and excellent!!"
10098,Unique gameplay and stunning graphix!
10099,swinging is nice and narration is noice
10100,Good game to play when your internet is down.
10101,"great story telling, amazing visualls. if you like portal you will like this game.
It has alot of challeging puzzle parts, that will make you rage alot, but is really avarding when you manage to complette them"
10102,One of the best platformers I've ever played.
10103,"Thanks to this game, I can't climb on a stepladder without getting dizzy, and yet I still love it. The game that is. Not the stepladder."
10104,"It's unfortunate and really unfair that there remains some latent connotation between ""uncles"" and various forms of child abuse. But there does exist this comedic trope and given that, you'd think the Devs could have come up with a better name for this game.

Point blank: this may be the worst title for a prefessionally produced video game I've ever seen. 

The real shame of it is that the gap between how bad the title is and how good the actual game is can't be bridged. ASAMU, as I'll classily refer to it, is nothing less than a diamond in the rough. It's one of those games where all of the content in it is extremely polished. There are only a few worlds, but all of them are distinct and beautifully crafted.

Though some of the actual character animations are a little too cartoony for my taste, the overall design is brilliant. The game really succeeds in pushing a sense of wonder, that frankly, most games that even attempt fail miserably at. The gameplay feels fresh - and fair - even when it gets difficult. The achievements are pretty absurd, but the game itself has a great balance. 

If I talk about this game in generalities it's because I think the best way to play this is not knowing a whole lot about what to expect - particularly the main action mechanics of the game. 

You really have to treat yourself. Do yourself a favor Morty - load up this game and just start playing with no expectations. 

It's worth it despite the God-awful title that will shame your Steam Status."
10105,I'm writing this so I can get the badge for the Steam Awards tbh
10106,One of the best naratives ive ever played
10107,"Loved it, shed a tear at the end. I hope my uncle is still well."
10108,i loved this so worth the cost i love it
10109,"Wonderful game.

A Story About My Uncle has a dear story to tell you, and the gameplay will keep you engaged. It's very short, but one of my all-time favorite games becasue the storyline felt so playful and simple. While the story is short, it will no doubt hold your attention the entire time."
10110,I loved this game. I wish they would make a sequel!
10111,"This is a fantastic game.  The colors and characters are vibrant and the world is no different.  It's a good change of pace from all the current violent games and it allows you to just enjoy the simple story of a nephew looking for his uncle.  It's extremely adictive and enjoyable to play with a unique play style that I have personally have not seen in any games priar to this (by which I mean games I have played).  My only complaint is that the main story it too short for my liking, taking me only 3 hours to beat.  Regardless, I highly recommend getting this game."
10112,"The bad:
Unimaginiative story
Bad voice acting
Difficulty of the puzzles is pretty low
Variation of the puzzles is also pretty low

The good:
Quick, mostly fluid gameplay
Easy to pick up the gist of the game mechanics
Not too hard, not too easy

Overall it's a good game to pick up on sale. It'll take 2-3 hours to run all the way through. I'd recommend it, but not very highly."
10113,"This game was amazing, I've played through the story line multiple times. If you want to play a game with a good story line, this is for you."
10114,"A good story, but but a little bit short gameplay."
10115,I LOVE THIS GAME
10116,It's a blast with a good story.
10117,"A very interesting and involving story, was a little short but the story was full of life."
10118,"i only play the begginig but  is really awesome,is a New World,10/10"
10119,"This is the best Spider-man game ever made while not being a Spider-man game.

+Cool platforming
-Story somewhat too short and feels unfinished."
10120,"Very nice and beautiful jump and run (quite literaly) played in ego perspective.

The story is short and simple but well told . It unveils it's deepness only if you look for it, if you don't you very well can miss it.

It is rather short but has some re-play value due to time challenges.

It's very well worth the 10-14‚Ç¨ it costs and the buy is an absolutely no brainer when it is on sale."
10121,"Really fun and an amazing game

highly recommend it"
10122,It was an emtional rollercoaster for me.
10123,"A Story About My Uncle is a visually appealing jump/puzzle game with a neat story. Albeit a bit short, there are still things to do after your first playthrough.
If you like this type of game, I definitely recommend you buying it ."
10124,Badge
10125,"Great game really loved it.
This game is really nice it is easy to play through not to long and not to short. GG good game
I reccomend buying it"
10126,A game with well made story .
10127,GG
10128,Absolutely love this game.
10129,Great...
10130,"This game is such a great game for being so short that it is. It has great scenery and lovely characters.

Pros: Creative story
Good characters
Great scenery
Easy to get into yet challenging
Replayable levels with challenges

Cons: Not the best voiceacting
A bit too short
Clunky animations
Some buggy areas

Overall: A great game that deserves better reviews even though, at the time, it has 94% already but it still deservers a better rating!
"
10131,"Great game, has a really good story and has some repeat value like time trials and such. I would recommend this to a friend 10/10"
10132,"Really impressive story here, i recomend it!"
10133,"This is a very simple and rather short game. It's relaxing, with beautiful scenery and enjoyable naration. This game offers the tragic story of loss in a child friendly way, making saying goodbye so much easier. 
It is truly a wonderful game and I highly recommend it."
10134,"that's what i think after playing this game
what happened to maddie ? she still live there ?"
10135,"A great indie game, full of new concepts, and The views are just to great"
10136,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is a MUST play for any fan of platformers. It's a platformer's wet dream. I picked it up on sale; however, I can say with certainty that it is worth full price and is a steal at any price lower.

Pros: 
*B-E-A-UTIFUL Game
*Great Platforming & Controls
*Smooth Difficulty Curve
*Interesting envrironments
*Unique/Fresh gameplay mechanics

Cons:
*OH GOD THAT VOICE ACTING. ARE YOU JUST READING THAT OFF OF A SCRAP OF PAPER WITH NO EMOTION!?!?
*Occasionaly it can be difficult to determine where to go exactly, sometimes forcing you to carve your own path that wasn't necessarily intended by the designers. (Is that really so bad, though?)

Would highly reccomend. Get this game! Pay full price! If it's ever on sale, you have no excuse! Just Do It!"
10137,Relax...until you have to dodge big eyed fucking monster :D
10138,"Amazing game, made me cry a little."
10139,"This game is an amazingly beautiful platformer. The characters are interesting, the mechanics are fun, and the little references to the other games by Coffee Stain are highly entertaining. The achievements are really challenging to get and it doesn't give many freebies. My only real complaint is with the ending. I got the impression that the game developers wanted this to have a sequel and when they were turned down for the additional game, they decided to write the end in such a way that they can never go back and make additional content off the idea. The cut-scene ending was a major let down. Just close your eyes for the end of the game and play the first bit repeatedly because, ignoring the ending, the game is fantastic."
10140,good story and run throughs. i just wish that it was longer.
10141,tjis game is very good i like the story line
10142,My uncles a psychopath
10143,Very nice unusual game! I Recommend!
10144,"Adorable little game. 
Very much enjoyed playing it, got to the end and just wished for more."
10145,The only criticism I have is that there wasn't more to this game. I would happily have played it endlessly.
10146,More people need to play this game it is honestly 10/10. For $3 which is the current sale price at the time of writing you get greater than 3 hours of game play ( $1 1 hour) But its more than that it's a fun and enjoyable story thats about 5 hours long based on if you try to get all the achievements which are a blast.
10147,Got as part of a bundle and pleased to find a surprisingly cute story with some fun puzzle/platformer action.  Would recommend if you have a few hours to put into a cool little title.
10148,"great game, great history"
10149,"Dunno what to say, normal plot with OK graphic.

I can't say that i recommend it, but it's worth to buy it."
10150,It was really good.
10151,Left me feeling like a shell of a man.
10152,I would reccomend this game to anyone who wants great scenery and story telling.
10153,I thought this game was cool before it won an award.
10154,"A Story about my uncle, what an interesting name for a beam surfing game. Yes, part of the reason i got interested was because of Leafyishere, but i wanted to see it for myself. The concept itself is interesting, i like platformers (even if dying alot gets you though the game.) that test your speed and reaction to the environment. This game certainly delievers that fast paced/ quick thinking knee jerk reaction when grappling from place to place. But its also slow in certain places of the game, mostly for natration purposes and story telling elements. You are a grown up adult telling the story to your little daughter that you once went on a search for your uncle. I won't spoil too many details, but just know that you'll be in for some bumps and turns. Dying in this game is light hearted and not harsh, so don't worry if you do it too often (i certainly did it alot and i need practice for the speed trials). Play the game and see if you liked it, i know i certainly did and its totally worth the money spent."
10155,"A fantastic game with a great story, it's short, but amazing. I have never felt this kind of attacment to a game before."
10156,"Loved the puzzle aspect, was a little dissapointed when I saw the blue characters. I thought they were a bit cringy."
10157,It's a great game!
10158,"Great game for the price, very fun in spite of its low duration.

High replayability."
10159,"I was interested in this game when I saw previews of it on green light a few times.  A calm, collected adult narrator recalls his childhood of life in a winter cabin.  You play through the eyes of the young narrator searching for his uncle while a gorgeous piano soundtrack leads you to his trash disposal portal device.  Going in the portal yourself, a colorful and vibrant world of underground crystals and flying mountain towns.

This game is a little on the short side, but it tells a deep and emotional story through a child's innocent eyes and tells it well.  I loved the music so much I put it on my rotation to listen while I am studying.  A Story About My Uncle is a work of art and I would encourage anyone who can appreciate a cozy story with gorgeous music to take a look at it.

Also there is some platforming in there somewhere. With grappling hooks."
10160,Epic
10161,"Love this game, did not think i would like this game as much as i did."
10162,Kinda short byt very fun and unique
10163,The most beautiful looking bedtime story that I was ever told.
10164,"Really enjoyed this game, despite it being sort of short.  Loved the environment and graphics, had a blast zipping through the air and working through all the puzzles.  Well worth the price that I paid for it."
10165,"TL;DR: A+ title, on point mechanics, story as good as mechanics are, childrens book feel (in a good way), story length very short but does offer some amount of replayablility.

The first thing that caught my eye was the title. I just sat there and stared at it for a full minute or so, trying to comprehend the ramifications of it. Why would anyone name a game like that? Why not, Super Ninja Jumpy Master 9 billion or something else that sounded cool when you said it? I clicked on it. I was not at all disappointed in what I saw.

It was entirely worth it, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with My Uncle's Story. For one, great platformer/parkour mechanics. Everything in that theme is very thought out and balanced, this is not my favorite genre (not even close), but I was taken in by how great this game is. The other side of the game, the adventure/story aspect, didn't disappoint in comparison with the jumpy part of the game. It's like you get to be the kid in the children's book who gets to go a wacky and weird adventure. You are the one who gets to experience that lighthearted and fun journey. The plot and characters shine through and the setting supports the whole gig accurately. But unfortunately, that ""childrens book"" feeling carries to the length of the game as well. It's like it's only a few pages long. I found the game, installed it, and played it through in one sitting. Only about 2 hours long for me, someone who stops and waits for the characters to finish talking so I can hear it all. Also noting the fact that I am someone who hunts for the collectables as well. I then spent a few dozen more minutes messing about with the mechanics (again, this is not because the game holds bad platformer elements, just because I don't like the genre that much). I did see that there were things that, if I were somebody who was interested, could definetly keep me going for another 2-3 hours at the most.

~Wolfy"
10166,"Very good game, for me it was worth the price. I enjoyed the mechanics in the game and the story was good enough. It's a bit short, but you can always play each segments again to get better time."
10167,"This game is a wonderful experience and can be decently challenging aswell!

One of my favorites, good music and very charming!

9.8/10 Charming with solid gameplay!"
10168,"10/10 would follow cave/trash world girl again...Amazing story


I do wish it was a little longer, but you can try for a better speed if you go back."
10169,"i don't know how to make reviews, but man, if you have the money for this game, you have to buy"
10170,"It a great game, good quality, good gameplay
recomended"
10171,HARDCORE PARKOUR
10172,"I simply love it: beautiful scenes, immersive experience, smooth gameplay, well weighed challenges and great potential for  replays. 
cons: it could be slightly longer."
10173,"8/10. A well made game with a chill and peaceful vibe. The environment looks nice and the game was fun itself. Although it is very short, I'd recommend this game."
10174,"One of the most suprisingly fun games, had a lot of fun, but it was sadly pretty short"
10175,I like this game soooo much it is so cute.
10176,"This game is a ton of fun!  If you are looking for a game tha really puts an emphasis on getting grappling-hook FPS mechanics right, this is the one! I really wish I had VR for this game.. 

The plotline is somewhat secondary here but this is really a game made out of love!

highly recommend it! great fun!"
10177,"10/10, simply put. This is going down as one of my favorite games. It's a very smooth, fluid platformer with a somewhat short but sweet story. It really feels like a well written, interactive children's book in the best way. I was happy with the gameplay from the start but was pleasantly surprised by the diverse and interesting level mechanics. A must-play for me, definitely worth full price."
10178,"[b] Main thoughts [/b]
Really beautiful game. A game that you really can enjoy after a streak of matches on a more ""intense"" game such as CS:GO. 
Recomending this to everyone who want's to kick back and enjoy a adventure!
Might not have the greatest graphics, that might be the only negative thing about the game, but the beautifulness of the levels, and the story lines makes the games look past it!
BUY THIS GAME NOW!

[b] On a scale of 1-10 ? [/b]
I would give this game a strong 8/10."
10179,This game is very interesting. It was a lot of fun to play but the story is short. Doing the time trials once your done is fun. The mechanics are fun and it is a great game for fourteen bucks. I hope there is a sequel at some point.
10180,"Wonderful game, only negative is that its not longer!"
10181,"It's a great game, but it's not worth $13.00, I got this game for $2.50. The dialouge and characters are great, but it's like the developers didn't know what to do for the end of the game. 

Only buy this game when it's on sale."
10182,"A very nice short story that can be easily completed in one play through.The game isn't long, but neither is bedtime stories which is what ""A Story About My Uncle"" is. It's a bedtime story told from a father to a daughter about his adventure to find his Uncle who is an engineer and scientist.
The game-play is based around first person platforming with no combat but rather puzzles and mechanics for them. While majority of the puzzles are very easy to complete there still is a learning curve and difficulty to the game. The grappling mechanics and physics are very entertaining to use so it will bring me back to play again for a speed-run.

I highly recommend this game especially if it is on sale it is my favorite non-combative first person from Gone North. 8/10"
10183,"Fun little diversion. The story isn't anything exciting, but the gameplay is worth a run-through. Not much replay value here unless you fancy grapple-platform challenges."
10184,ANGER
10185,"If someone were to ask me whether they should buy this game or not I would say yes but there are a few sections within the game that feels incredibly linear for what is supposed to be a parkour game. Don't get me wrong there are areas which are incredibly open and you can decide your own way to go, but it feels a majority of the game is linear. I wished the added more open areas. Areas like the falling blocks were very enjoyable (despite falling a lot). All in all, I would give this game a 7/10."
10186,recommend fun game
10187,"I let a girl taunt me into repeatedly jumping into a gaping chasm just so that I could get a silly achievement. 

10/10 will murder myself and a little girl again and again and again until I get that silly achievement."
10188,"Incredible game. I was not expecting much, but I was floored. Highly recommend to everyone."
10189,"I generally like to play shorter games so that I can finish them before they become boring.

ASAMU is one of the very few games I finished that I wished were longer.

Great game, great atmopshere, pretty story.  Loved it!!

10190,"I won't go into details of the game, can't think of any.
It's a fun speedrun""ish"" game.

-Speedrunning is rly fun.
-Performance is good.
-Story doesn't interest me in the slightest.
-Gameplay and momentum are good.
-Achievements complemented this game, not tedious as in other games and collectibles actually are rewarding."
10191,"At times like this, I wish there was a ""neutral"" rating for Steam.

I really, really wanted to like this game.  A grappling based first person platformer is an awesome idea, unfortunately A Story About My Uncle fails at implementing it.  It gets a lot right, but unfortunately the platforming itself is finicky and boring.

Positives:
Interesting story - If you like short but engaging stories, this has a basic but enjoyable thread pulling you forwards with a satisfying resolution.
Beautiful - A lot of great vistas and areas to look at, really great art design.

Negatives:
Easy, boring platforming - The grappling mechanic works well, but everything else about the physics fails.  Most deaths will be due to sliding off or getting stuck on random objects, or unclear grappling surfaces.  The actual levels are extremely easy once you figure out what will glitch out and avoid it.
Really odd voice acting - The voice actors are clearly skilled, but English is definitely not their native language, which results in really odd intonations and pronunciations.  I would actually prefer they spoke in their native language and had subtitles, the very odd voice acting continually brought me out of the story.
Short - I was actually happy to get it over with when finished due to the poor physics, but even then, the game is very short.  I would recommend only buying it on sale.

I didn't hate this game, it had a lot of things going for it, unfortunately the core mechanic just doesn't work and hence I cannot recommend it."
10192,This game was beutiful in story and in its design. It left me wanting a sequal.
10193,"Short, but worth it. I like the game mechanics. Also the story was also fine. Graphics is good,
8/10 

Cons: 
- Short

Pros:
- Original gameplay
- Sounds
- Narration
- Story"
10194,this game was fun... until overwatch became revelant to leafys channel
10195,It's fantastic.
10196,"I recommend this game this game to everyone looking for an amusing and delightful 2-3 hour experience. To all developers out there we need more game like this. With beatiful graphics, good story, and simple gameplay. I'd prefer to spent my precious time on simple, short games like this, rather than games like COD Infinite Warfare and such.



10/10"
10197,Very captivating story and seamless gameplay. I was pretty impressed that this game was created by the developers of Goat Simulator because it actually has a story and a great one but sadly pretty short.
10198,"Ok where do i  begin..
This is truly a masterpiece of a game.
It has an  absolutely phenominal gameplay and a simple yet amaing story.
The environment is gorgeous to look at.
You are not regret buying this game and it is extremely cheap as well during sales.

The best part is when you try to exit the game,there is a small dialogue (i ain't gonna spoil it for you).Its always the little things that matter.

10/10 would read to my daughter again......if i had a daughter that is.."
10199,"Very relaxing narrative-driven game. Definitely was a nice break from the games I normally play. Controls were great, and the story was quite nicely written."
10200,"After finishing this amazing game I was left with a pleasant and refreshing taste that I had a lot of years to feel...
This game is simple and childish at times.
But it is beautiful...very beautiful and clever. 
I would recommend this game to everyone, the simple yet fun puzzles, the tools, the story, everything is so well polished !
And the scenery...oh boy...the scenery is a WHOLE different story, the visuals (not the graphics) are so beautiful and colourful that you'll want to reach out and touch the screen !"
10201,Great gamer just to short. i beat it in 6 hours
10202,Great game for a small price
10203,"Loved this game. Still haven't been around to the challenges, so I got more to do :D
I'd pick it on a sale where it's 5-8$. But really fun and a nice little plot. Some parts of the world are somewhat astonishing"
10204,"Nice story, beautiful music surrounded by enchanting world.
I really like playing this game. Soothing and interesting.
It's a good experience :)"
10205,What are you doing looking at all these amazing reviews? Go try it for yourself and enjoy this almost too short game. Makes you wanna relive it again just like i did :D
10206,Luv iet
10207,"The controls and story are both great, and it's really fun to grapple around. Definitely try it out."
10208,"Love this game... I have been trying to find similar games but found none like this. Please devs, make one more."
10209,Simple platformer telling a simple story. Very relaxing.
10210,"I had high expectations for this game, but I got really disappointed.
I really tried liking it, but I just hate it.
The story is cute, and graphics amazing but,
It's way too unpredictable what you can't and can do, in some places your graple reach very far, other places the reach is way shorter :/ also: do not play with controller, you have to aim so carefully that u should use ur mouse, or u gonna hate it even more.

I would not recommend this game because the frustration made me so mad I couldn't really enjoy the good parts about the game :c"
10211,Fun first person platformer.
10212,Good game but the Ice Cave section at the end drags on for tooooo long. Should have just had some sort of final boss fight instead. 4.5/5
10213,"Nice story and awesome atmosphere.
I'm not the guy who like to play adventure games but this one has convinced me.

10/10 - You have to play it."
10214,It has nice visuals.  Is a very short game but overall a solid game.  I would recommend buying this only if it's on sale since it's so short.
10215,totally worth it
10216,Liked what i played but so frustrating! an hour of what i played was just repeating the same three jumps over and over again. I dont remember the last time i cried out of frustration
10217,Though it was a pretty short game it was so worth it. Very fun game espesially if you like first person platformers
10218,So 1st things 1st I have only played like 2 hours on this game so far but i already love it! Being a game of adventure you are looking for your lost uncle in another dimension. This game is just so fun! There are moments where I have been playing the game whilst another friend was and we were laughing at how much we would rage at the game and our mistakes. This game's story is great whilst combining with awesome and addictive game play. The only real thing that could make this game better would be multiplayer mode. 9.5/10 for this game :)
10219,SO Good After credits the second ending It made me question some stuff about the character you play as.  Sad ending for me.
10220,This game is a fun game altought I wish there was more after you beat the game it still good 9/10
10221,"A Story About My Uncle is a short but sweet game. The main story took me about 3 hours but I think it was well worth it. And there is still time trial, which I¬¥ll probably come back to.
Generally every game mechanic is just super fun. Jumping has never been better. The sheer distances are incredible and the sights are stunningly beautiful.
The game is not very difficult though. I only had few sections where I had to try multiple times but I guess that¬¥s what made it so relaxing. The actors made a convincing performance and gave the story a unique charm that I enjoyed very much.
I felt like it was the perfect mixture of excitement and relaxation.

I give it a 9/10
10/10 if the frogpeople weren¬¥t so ugly ^^"
10222,Fun game. Good Graphics.
10223,"A fantastic game!

A Story About My Uncle is an atmospheric, puzzle platformer/walking simulator with an element of parkour.

The graphics & the music are wonderful. The voice acting is very good.

It's a very immersive game with a heartwarming story.

Sometimes it gets a little frustrating becuase the puzzle are hard to figure out (& that's the core of most negative reviews) but it's actually quite sloveable, all you gotta do try a few times.

The campaign is about 2-4 hours.

A hidden gem!
Highly Recommended!"
10224,"Lonely. I am so lonely. I have no NPC's to interaaaaact with! I'm so lonely. I'm Mr. Lonely. I haven't seen anyone! Except the frogs.

Plus I'm really disappointed that the frog girl wasn't animated to jump with us. Instead she's just on our back with a couple of lines here or there that make it seem like we're alone in this world. I wanted to see the frog people move through the air :'(

Other than that it's quite a beautiful looking game."
10225,The trailer was good
10226,"A tranquil platformer with simple mechanics, simple story and a childish feel.
Strangely fun. 9/10"
10227,"I never write reviews because most people who write reviews are faggots, But his game is fucking amazing. I don't know why this game isn't held to higher regard.

10/10 Would Write a Review Again"
10228,"It's short but the gameplay is so fun that, it could easily be replayed and you wouldn't get bored."
10229,"Great adventure, loved the story, but i was alittle disappointed with the ending tho. I dont think its worth $12.99, but if it goes on sale you really should pick it up. Overall great game."
10230,Great Purchase the Game is an Amazing platformer with a nice story and is Extremely addicting. 10/10 Best game i've purchased
10231,"An interesting game. Fun, but infuriating too. Playing with a controller makes it more difficult to pull off the trickier shots. On the whole though I did enjoy the experience. A+"
10232,I saw leafy play this. So i decided to play this. End of review
10233,"Short and fun platformer game where you used a ""grappling hook"" that pulls you into where it attaches, release at the right time and place to have your inertia carry you to your next destination. Kinda feels like Spiderman"
10234,"@!#$!@#$    FRED!

No Seriously   @!#$!@#$@#$    THAT mother    Q#W@$!@#$!@ -er     FRED!!!!!

DO YOU HEAR ME??

#$%*    YOU    FRED!!!!

-_-

If they make a part two of this game they can have it I'm done!  

It was fun in the beginning and then it went horribly wrong there after for me.

I can only recommend this game to people who like pulling their hair out, as this is what you will do
in the latter stages of this game.

Yes, it's a good game. A refreshing take on first person perspective just as mirrors edge was.

Yes, the story line is interesting. Yes, the game is enjoyable. (up to a point), however both of those ponits
loose their luster as you progress through out the game because of how increadibly Impossibly hard it becomes 
as you advance through the adventure. 

What should have been a fun relaxing enjoyable explorer game turned out to be a nightmare!

Literally everything after Maddies challenge is all down hill in the enjoyment department.

The game becomes a serious serious chore there after and I found my self just wanting to hurry up and finish it as quickly as possible. 

I didn't care about secrets, I couldn't care less about unlockables and the story line may as well never have existed
as far as I was concerned! I wanted out! But I like finishing my games so I stuck to it.

This game can be beaten in about 2 - 3 hours if you're very good, and I mean VERY VERY GOOD!

The thing took me about 8 - 10 hours of groaning, moaning, screaming, bitching like brat, pulling my hair out,
and working myself in to a headache!

A HEADACHE !    That is how I would like to describe this game!

It doesn't need to be this hard given the lack luster reward you get at the end of this game in my opinion.

My problems with this title are as follows:


CHECK POINTS WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY??

Towards the harder parts of this game especially the last levels ICE CARVERNS or whatever it's called.
There needs to be way more check points. This levels is damn near impossible man especially the hanging stalagtites
cave swinging bull crap that's going on there (god I wanna break something!)

The grapple beam controls are too precice AND imprecice at the same time; the thing requires that what ever
you want to grab onto be dead center in your targeting thingy! Yet, it doesn't accurately judge its range accurately.
 
It's supposed to let you know when you've got a lock, but it doesn't always. 
I've found im able to lock even when there's no indication, so sometimes you're waiting for the lock, you're in range but it doesn't come and you fall to your death!  

CONTROLLER MAPPINT??

Really? it's 2016 and developers don't seem to get that in this day and age that people would like to change 
all their friggin button mappings to what ever the hell they like! holy donkeys balls!!! what the actuall hell is wrong 
with these devs??? This would have made life sooooooooo much easier if they allowed it but no.. you get literally two choices for controllers... Only keyboards can do what they want?? REALLY??? REALLY???
Had they made this possible I'd play with a combination of controller and mouse.. Moust is way bette for aiming
but your jump button on the pad is on the A button If I were allowed to change this I could move and jump with my left hand and then aim and fire with the mouse problem solved but no.. now I'm stuck with either keyboard of controller.
ended up beating it with just the controller....

I HATE THIS MOTHER OF A GAME HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT!

"
10235,"I really loved this game. Its an whole new way of exploring a map. The grapple mechanic works perfectly, i have had no issues at all while using the grapple hook (except falling to my death because i failed to hook on to something, wich was my fault, not the games)

The only real downside is that its incredibly short and that you leave the only character that comes with you behind after not to much time.

WARNING: do NOT play this game when you have a bad framerate, that would just make it horrible to play, you will have to do quick graples to get to the end and bad frames could make this really hard/impossible.

Also this game has a really deep story, and touched me in the soul, wich made it even wors that it ended so quick."
10236,"Just a great story-driven game, about a incredible adventure. The storytelling was not to long not to short and the game in general had a pretty quick pace. The gameplay was challenging, but it was not impossible. you just had to get the timing right and visualize the whole puzzle in you mind.

8/10"

10238,Wish there was more story. Kinda has that portal feeling to it after its all over. :(

-Great story (I would never think about game in which you are looking for your uncle in other dimension with use of grappling device and rocket boots

10240,Such a beautiful and relaxing game with a good story.
10241,how to be a commentator on a budget
10242,Magical
10243,"The game has a fun premise, but overall feels lacking. The physics are horrendous and that's one of the most important part of a platformer. From what I can tell, there's a lot of gravity despite how flighty the jumping and grappling is. That is to say, you fly up very fast, float for a bit, and then accelerate downwards very fast. It's hard to get a feel for it, especially when all the puzzles require fairly quick timing. A little too late or early and you'll plummet to your death. 

It's a fun game within that, at least. The story seems forced and the narration is sporadic, but worth a play if you can get it on sale. Part of the reason I'm not recommending it is that is has such high reviews despite these problems--I think you SHOULD get the game, just not with high hopes for a masterpiece."
10244,"- A heartwarming story
- Beautiful music
- Grappling is really fun
- Decent graphics
- Short gameplay but quite enough.

It's way better than I thought it would be so, definitely recommend it!"
10245,Pretty much one of the best games of all time
10246,Hey Maddy. Go fuck yourself.
10247,"Saw it on sale and decided to give it a try.   It's very short, 2 hours, but I was surprised at how enjoyable it was.  Plays like a good bedtime story.  

It appears to support 21:9 ultrawide just fine as well.  Ran it at 3440x1440.  Cutscenes pillarboxed to 16:9.  All gameplay was 21:9 with no problems."
10248,Awesome game
10249,"Get ready to do the following:
+ sit aside at least 3-4 hours if you're planning on finishing it in one sitting 
+ ragequit on certain parts of the game
+ intense ragequit on the last level of the game
+ be immerse in a beautiful adventure of colors and parkour 
+ have some feels

This game has some very sad moments and very frustrating moments. Get it during the steam sale and it will definitely be worth it. It is a fairly straightforward and linear game, but it's sure to ""hook"" you in :{D


"
10250,GG
10251,"Mechanically, this game is really immersive. While it's a little floaty, you do actually feel like your swinging around with lazers: and let me say, that's pretty cool. On top of that, the atmosphere is just as well put together; the game offers distinct regions (each of which is very pleasant in its own way), a pretty soundtrack, and even a little bit of story to drive the narrative forward. At times the voice acting / writing can be a little goofy, but nothing worth avoiding the game over. I would suggest scooping this up on a sale, since the game doesn't last all that long and might not necessarily be worth the standard price."
10252,Incredible story and for a short game youreally do fall in love with the characters
10253,"An actually awesome Indie Game. The story, voice over, setting, and its laid back nature immediately pulled me into the game. Totally worth it at full price, but it comes on sale often. 

My biggest piece of advice would be to set aside a block of time (~4 hours) to just sit, relax, and get lost in the game. It will all be over too soon."
10254,"A fun game with frustrating bits. The power you can use in the game to ""parkour"" is something I've been dreaming about having in real-life, as well."
10255,"short and sweet like portal .

pros:

 the story
 the gameplay
 the graphics 

cons: 
i found the game to be a bit easy at some points.

conclusion:

good short game  but i would recomment buying on sale, i got nearly 3 hours out of it and imo thats not worth 13 euros but more like 5-8 euros"
10256,"[h1] [u] Story: [/u] 

The game A Story About My Uncle is a adventure game set in a another world. You play as Uncle Fred's nephew searching for Fred. As you continue on your journey you will face off various challenges. This game has stunning visuals and gameplay.

[u] Gameplay: [/u]  

The gameplay is smooth and the hand and landing animations are well done, using the grapple is fun.

I enjoyed playing this peaceful artistic game. A Story About My Uncle deserves a sequel, buy this game on sale!  [/h1]"
10257,"A great game that is much like a 2-3 hour interactive movie. Shorter than I expected but a very touching story. If this game had workshop access so we can play player created levels, this game would have a much greater replay value. I bought this for $1 so I would recommend waiting for this to be at about $5 but if it had the workshop feature, I would happily pay the full $12.99."
10258,"[h1]A STORY ABOUT MY UNCLE[/h1]

A Story About My Uncle Is a seriously relaxing and enjoyable experience. If you can pick it up on  sale, It's a steal.

10259,"This game has a great plot and aesthetic (it's seriously a goldmine for screenshot collectors) and the grappling mechanic was fun and responsive. There was significant variety to the different chapters, from tight dark caverns to wide-open floating cities and it stayed fun all the way till the near-end. Much like Psychonauts though, this game suffers from Meat Circus Syndrome and the difficulty goes vertical in a way that feels not so much deliberately challenging, but moreso ""this wasn't playtested"". Apparently the game was patched to make the penultimate section of the chapter a bit easier, but the game should've been patched to remove the entire chapter outright since every minute of it is irritating beyond belief. The last chapter is super janky and disorienting in a way where you're never quite sure where to go, or which way you came from, or even if you passed the last section in a manner that was intended. It's pure trial and error aggravation at the very end of a primarily narrative game, and it hurts the overall product and takes away the punch of the ending, much like the afformentioned Meat Circus or Xen in Half Life.

Still, much like Psychonauts and Half Life are bonafide classics despite their obnoxious endgames, ASAMU is too for the same reasons. Definitely great, but the 11th hour difficulty spike holds it back from perfection - worth a fiver, but not full price."
10260,A short and fun first person puzzle jumper. Loved every bit of it. Grab it when it's on sale. 10/10
10261,"One of my favorite games on Steam. The story can be a bit slow, but the game itself is incredibly enjoyable, and looks absolutely beautiful. If you're interested in parkour, you should get this (on sale)."
10262,"Beautiful story, fluid gameplay.
The main story only takes about 2 hours, but it was definitely worth the price especially if you got it on sale.
If you're on the fence about whether to buy this game or not, get it. You won't regret it, you curious child"
10263,Fucking Amazing
10264,"I've never played anything quite like this. A beautifully crafted universe, for a person that loves science like myself this is a dream game. There are video game references and pop culture references everywhere in the game. The characters are just unbelievable. The story is right up there with games like Mass Effect and BioShock. The game's parkour mechanics are better than kings like Dying Light and Mirror's Edge. And the music is perfect for the setting. This group of individuals is going to go on to make the next Minecraft, I guarantee it. The most surprising part is that they've only ever made this game and a few goat simulator DLC's. This game shows what they're capable of. I'll eagerly be awaiting their next game. 

I don't feel like this game should be priced as low as it is. It should be higher. For the dollar I spent I feel like I ripped the devs off."
10265,"

10266,"This is an odd game at first. I played it once, and I don't feel like it's a very replayable game. But the first time is really fun, and I enjoyed how you could ""fly"" around. This is a great game which is very nice. It has an amazing beginning and end, and the story flows very well. I'm not sure if I really like the lizard people or not. I did get lost at times which wasn't great, but I eventually got past it."
10267,"Buy on sale, too short devs"
10268,"The game isn't bad, but everything becomes stale after a while and the characters look horrible while the story isn't exactly there. The world looked kinda cool, but too empty and without a story, it's generic floating stuff and weird signs. The gameplay is fun at the beginning, but as I said it becomes stale and fascination is gone"
10269,"After having played through this game, all I can say is Buy this game.

What starts off as a simple bedtime story becomes an adventure as far as the skies can reach. The pacing and difficulty curve is well done and the story behind this game is well enough to keep you going. The feel of momentum as you traverse your way through the levels is top notch, rivalling and I'll even say beating its Triple-A title counterparts. I am in the process of creating a video review of this just because of how good it is.

The only downside is that I want more as it is rather short, clocking in around 4-5 hours. For ~$2.5 an hour, it is truly worth the price."
10270,"Game was great.  It had a great story, beautiful art, wonderful music.  The only thing was odd was the animations at some points.  They were a bit bumpy, but that was all during 'cutscenes'.  The gameplay was absolutely wonderful.  Simple, yet fun.  Good animation.  Would recommend to anybody.  It's short, and progresses rather quickly, but when your biggest complaint about the game is that you want to play more, it's not really a complaint.  Would recommend 100%."
10271,"This is a really nice game!

Not groundbreaking, but it manages to convey childlike wonder with its story and mechanics that I don't see too often.

It's a first person platformer, with a great sense of scale that, fortunately, works more in its favour than its detriment.
There were some sections where it was hard to judge distances, due to the huge scale, but it wasn't a problem, most of the time. And when it was, it didn't get too frustrating.

As the title suggesting, the game is about a story about the narrator's uncle, to his daughter.

It's a rather simple minded adventure through a mystical world with frog people and a grappling hook that almost makes you fly.
There are some darker overtones spread around the game for those interested (it requires attention to the environmental objects and also simple decryption), but the main game really did feel like an adventure.
A big help is the amount of freedom that the game gives you in your movement. It's not too challenging, most of the time, but it allows for some additional difficulty if you want to find the secrets.

One game I hadn't though about in a while is Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. This game reminded me of it, for great reasons! As I mentioned before, these two are the 2 of the few games I remember giving me this childlike wonder, making me want to explore all of these caves or suspicious paths. It's great!


It also looks really good, and while short, the few sections it has you go through look very unique!


One gripe I have with the game is the achievements. They're all very ""completionist"" oriented, which I don't really think fits in a game like this. They should have guided the player to look for the small details, instead of focusing on the ""100%"", which, in my opinion, puts players in a more systematic search for the required items, instead of actually exploring, if that makes sense? The objects stop being objects and start being an abstraction to get ""achievement points"", and you stop paying attention to how they fit into the overall experience.



If you don't mind short games, definitely give this one a shot! Won't change your world, but I truly enjoyed playing it.
Just strolling through the game and seeing the world they created is worth doing.
"
10272,Loved it had some trouble but still loved it
10273,"Fun platformer with an interesting setting.  There were only a handful of platforming-rage inducing spots where perfect timing was required.  The save points are close enough to not force you to redo too much if you do slip up.  The action feels just right as you are grappling and swinging from point to point.  No combat, just you against the level.  Absolutely worth a sale price purchase."
10274,"Though very short it was entertaining, sure I may have cursed at the skies at some parts (looking at you maddie and your stupid no grapple challence which I simply could not refuse or even do) but the visuals quickly put me to rest with the amazing landscapes. Would recommend."
10275,"This game reminded me why do I actually hate platformers. One of the most boring and repetitive game ever and even the story, especially the ending, is a big let down. I can't recommend it"
10276,"Couldnt get into this game, story line a little slow and the details as to what to do are a little vague"
10277,"The most beautiful looking bedtime story that I was ever told.

This game is definitely worth a playthrough. It's laid back and not too long.
The visuals are stunning and it feels satisfying flying through some nice looking landscapes.

There's not too much story as all you are doing is progressing through to find your lost uncle,
but the short dialogues are enough to give you a sense of purpose for continuing on.

Think of this game as a 3 hour interactive movie. Worth the watch!"
10278,"Short but beautifull and well dosed difficulty, not to easy not to hard, as some of these games mostly ends with fustration, but this one was just right. I would have loved an extra 2-3 hours!"
10279,"Short, but one of the best parkour/platformer games I've ever played. 9.5/10"
10280,Great story.Highly recommended
10281,"This game is amazing, it's one of the best singleplayer games i've played in a long time, the enviorment is beautiful, and the storyline is great. Overall, it's one crazy, beautiful, and fun game to play, and hopefully in the future there will be a part 2."
10282,"Nice landscapes, but a bit slow"
10283,"Great game, short and sweet. Story was simple but touching, used mostly to simply explain gameplay. Would highly recomend."
10284,Very fun litttle platformer. The locations are really pretty.
10285,"Story is alright, but slow. If the story doesn't get you, there might not be much else for you. 

Platforming elements are mostly good, ranging from great to boring repetition. Great fun starting out, but not so much after a while."
10286,"[b]SHORT VERSION[/b]
I bought this game on sale, but even at full price this game is worth every piece of USD scum. Buy it.

[b]FULL REVIEW[/b]
Hey guys, so I saw some guy without a chin play this game with this hand, and some weird symbol, and said out loud to myself, ""Hey, that's pretty good!"". I searched far and wide, deep into the jungle that is [strike]cancer[/strike] the Youtube comment section. I eventually found the name of the game: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/278360/]A Story About My Uncle[/url]. It looked fun.
I bought the game, months later, after seeing the name again. I thought I heard it somewhere, something about that LeafyIsBeefy guy. I clicked, and saw I was right. It was on sale. The sale was ending soon. I just [i]knew[/i] I had to buy it. So I did, and I was not disappointed. If you get it on sale, you'll probably pay around $1/hour of the main story. It's very short, but those few hours were well worth it. The graphics are pretty decent, but the character models are horrible. Fortunately, most of the time you're going to be swinging around, not looking at frog people. I set the graphics to max with 2x MSAA at 1440p. Optimization was a bit iffy, but I averaged around 110fps average, though I was locked at 60fps for some reason. It was probably my GPU drivers.
The entire game is some father telling his daughter about his adventure finding his uncle in a weird world as a kid before bed. 10/10 PCGamer cheaters

"
10287,"I got this game on sale, for less than half the price of what I would pay to go to a movie. And I was told a story, an interactive one, that captivated my imagination and gave me a sense of wonder. I'm going to play this again, with my 6yr old daughter so she can see what a beautiful and lovingly crafted world and story that has been created here. 

All in all it was just under 2 hours for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Every time the gameplay got close to feeling stale, some new element would be introduced, or a new challenge put in front of me. And in moments I was again feeling a rush of excitement as I swung from platform to platform mouth agape.

I recomend this to anyone and everyone who has a couple hours to spare, and an inner child that needs to see a new world with the same wonder and amazement we all used to feel."
10288,"Good, but short.
Certainly worth it for only 2 dollars!!!

thank you leafy, for showing me this game... bitch. <-- This should be a dirty word."
10289,Incredible voice acting you guys.
10290,"Overall this game is amazing but very short, although you can be kept busy by the time trials trying to get the best time. The scenery is breath taking and the movement is fluid. 
The only downside is the price only due to the game time, but i would reccomend getting the game on sale."
10291,"Great adventure game, game makes you forget everything about real life and it just grabs you in to the world of talking frogs and hovering mountains. I hope you check it out!"
10292,"This game is great. It took me about 3 hours to finish. There isn't much story to the game but theres just something about flying through the air that is amazing. I got it for $2.50 so yeah, I would say that it was worth it."
10293,"nice little challenging game. Hard at some points, but never unfair though"
10294,It took me 1.8 hours to beat. Which is short enough to get my money back. Not worth 13 dollars.
10295,Just Cause: Storymode
10296,"I play all my games on my laptop, a bad idea, I know. 99% of games won't run on it as it is truly a god awful piece of trash, so if a game runs on it, then it is immediatley good in my eyes. A Story About My Uncle not only runs my laptop, but it actually runs well. I am also absolutely awful at parkour games, they take me far longer than they should to complete due to the constant falling off, yet despite this fact, I enjoy playing this. The graphics are pretty and the gameplay is good, I haven't been playing it for long but what I have played I have enjoyed quite a lot. I don't know if it is worth it's full price but I would definitely reccomend buying it on a sale.

11/10 would fall off again"
10297,"Best adventure game I've played in years. 
Simple, relaxing."
10298,"My Fav Game, very nice adventure, last round was very nice, so i love this game <3"
10299,"little bit on the expenisve side for what it offers, howerver its pleasent and relaxing game and I would recommend."
10300,"A refreshing mix of adventure, story and agility. The jumps and hooking can get difficult some times, but as the story progresses in nice pace, it doesn't get annoying. Yes, there are parts that will have you drop for 20 times, before you get the jump right, but without penalty, it doesn't get to a point that you just want to quit. Good game, I can't wait to see how it ends. I got to the Chasms after about 2 hours play, which is a cool change of atmosphere. I suggest you try it out!"
10301,"Amazing game. Only one flaw, the ending. I'm not going to spoil the ending or any part of the game, but let's just say you will be dissapointed and sad and wish the game had more content to it. Still an amazing game, especially since I bought it for $2.59. Overall playtime was 2 hours for the story. Have not played time trials because fuck that I hate being timed. Highly suggest picking this game up, even if it isn't on sale."
10302,KINDA  HOT
10303,"Very short and very repetitive.  Essentially, you spend the whole game swinging around like a high tech tarzan through various caves with this grapple glove (see stock photos).  Storyline was intriguing at first, but it has zero depth.  Dialogue is on par with Sesame Street.  There were no puzzles or challenges at all beyond figuring out where to jump and grapple next.  I wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed with the ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù of the game at all.  Most of it is repetitive dark cavern.  The one redeeming quality is the narrator.  

This game would be awesome if it had VR support.  Very similar to Windlands.  As a desktop game, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it for more than a dollar or two."
10304,"A Story About My Uncle was a very fun and refreshing platformer.  The story was pleasant, but sadly the overall game was way too short.  Especially for its price point.  This was the main reason I was deterred from buying this game earlier.  A 2-3 hour indie game for $13 is way too steep.  But I highly recommend this game if you can get it for a cheap price point, considering I had a great blast being spiderman with rocket boots."
10305,"This game is pleasant.  It is certainly a 120-minute time killer.  But I must admit, I am happy that I picked it up on sale.  Literally most (if not all) of your gameplay will be focused on Spiderman web-slinging across the map.  The difficulty to reach the next checkpoint in every map does increase, but its easily overcome after 2 tries or so.  You meet a few characters, but won't interact with them for more than 5 minutes excluding [spoiler] one particular girl that decides to mount your back [/spoiler].

In summary, this game may feel like a grinding session to a lot of the gaming public.  This softcore parkour gem is merely an acquired taste.  I only regret that this game was extremely short and you had literally no say in what was happening.  It was all extremely linear."
10306,"Really like this game, 10/10 people found it on leafys channel ."
10307,really awesome game!! loved every second of it!! but it was only like an hour or two of gameplay...
10308,Awesome game
10309,This was one of the msot satisfying and impactfull games I have played in a long time.
10310,"-Awesome gameplay!
-Cool atmosphere!
-Great plot!
too bad its a really short game :<"
10311,"A fun little 1st person platformer. It can take a while to get use to the controls and they never really feel tight, but with some practice you and traverse around very fluidly.

I fun game to get for a rainy weekend where you want to just sit down and play something light."
10312,"A pretty damn good game, didn't expect much from it.. but it blew my mind, nice controlls, world is beautiful, pretty good story as well. Around 10h of gameplay, could of been a lil bit longer.. but hey.. can't have it all."
10313,"Beautiful story, beautiful gameplay but sometimes tough.
Astonishing graphics and environment.
Worth every penny."
10314,one of the best steam games out there my opinion the only thing i wish is that it was longer.
10315,"It's a good game. Nothing special about it. 
Tho I would say some puzzles require a lot of attempts to get right, which is frustrating. 
The length of the game is between 2-4hrs."
10316,This game is good in small doses. The parkour gets repetitive every once in a while so I go and start playing something different and the story is extremely boring in my opininon but for its price its fun and makes you feel like a bird that is eventually gonna fall to its death.
10317,this shit gud.
10318,"Holy shit this game is good. The controls are fucking smoothe as shit and are generally fun, the obstacles and level designs are great and the music is nice. The story is annoying for me though. I also wish I could just skip through the boring cutscenes instead of having to sit through them. The story and characters are fucking boring and annoying, constantly found myself groaning and saying ""AAAHHHH I DON'T CARE! GET ON WITH IT FOR FUCKS SAKE!"" And the game itself isn't exactly gorgeous either. It was made in 2014... It could have been better, ah well. The overall gameplay is fucking awesome and easily replayable, I would recommend listening to something while playing, like that ice theme from SMG, dire dire docks, washed out, idk. But the story is annoying and the game itself isn't too visually pleasing. 8/10"
10319,"Great story, great game mechanic, runs smoothly, but a bit too short of a play

Frankly, I think this could be easly solved with a multiplayer level creator."
10320,"I really think that platforming sections are the worst parts of ny fps that has  them, even worse than sewer sections.

This game is alllllll about fps platforming. The grapple helps. But it is still horrible for me.

I do not like it. If you like first person platforming, it might be to your taste, but I honestly hate this kind of game."
10321,"You spend about 2 hours trying to find your main objective through mostly perfect unforgiving grapple jumps only to spend 1 minute and 19 seconds with it before being sent back to square one, a waste of time"
10322,"I really like this game. Its atmospheric, nice naration, solid controls, fun to play, and affordable too. I will definatly be playing more of this game"
10323,"The game was amazing I enjoyed so much that I want a Sequel with long story campaign and many levels I would even pay 60 Dollars for a game like this. 

Pros: Engaging story, Dynamic and Fun gameplay, addicting, relaxing, and when you finish you will be thirsty for more (promise you that)

Cons: Like I said MORE content is needed!, 

make a sequel and with a depth story, this game is perfect for a sequel."
10324,"Great game! I would buy it on discount since there is only about 2.5 hours of ""true"" gameplay!"
10325,"It a beast of a game short fun good sorry ""god"" quality"
10326,"Excellent game! Really reccomend it!
For it's price, it's a great adventure game, and when there's a sale, you can get it for only $3!"
10327,A Story About My Uncle is a short yet impressive game with a touching storyline and brilliant mechanics. Definitely recommend for such a small price
10328,"One of the best Games i have ever played. Played it through twice. Really fun and challenging. The Story is decent, Graphics ok which all in all makes a pretty good Game."
10329,"[b]Pros:[/b]
-Amazing visuals
-Amazing story
-Emotional
-Wildly enjoyable gameplay

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Short
-Low Replayability

[b]Overall:[/b] This is one of those games that tends to stick with you.  The world is visually stunning, and the amount of care and love put into its design shows.  The characters and levels are all so cleverly laid out and beautifully rendered that the game is worth playing just to play around in the world itself.

The plot itself is awesome.  I won't ruin it.  It's compelling and emotional and really hits you at the end.

But the game is short, and the replayability is low.  And that's a shame, because this is one of those games I wish I wanted to go back to more than once in a great while.  For as short as it is, $13 is probably too much, but it goes on sale often enough, and anything 50% or more easily justifies getting this game.  It's a wild ride, it's crazy amounts of fun while it lasts, and I'm glad I played it.

[b]Bottom Line:[/b] Worth it on sale"
10330,"I literally played the game just to get to the ending, it seemed like it would be something really cool, but naah.. I'm dissapointed..."
10331,"Jumped into a bottomless pit with a child on my back
"
10332,gr8 m8 i r8 8/8. :^)
10333,"Fun game, but extremely short."
10334,"good game, very short, definitely worth buying while it's on sale though, i wouldnt say its worth 13 bucks. Fun gameplay though."
10335,pretty chill game
10336,"Wonderful experience-driven game. The gameplay is not anything especially challenging or ground-breaking, but the feeling of exploring this new world and drinking in the sights was worth every penny spent."
10337,"As weird as it may sound, first off,
[h1] Do NOT judge the game by its name. [/h1]

This game is an absolute gem, a gem I tell ya!
Its parkour like fun game mechanics with gorgeous level design, engaging story and sweet in-game soundtracks, makes it an absolute must buy as a PC exclusive title.

The game is a tad bit short, around 3 - 4 hours for completion, however there is a lot of replay value as the game is ridiculously entertaining and there are achievements to collect! 

It'd be great if only there was a free roam mode, where you'd swing around for as long as you want. 

Nevertheless, I would love to play a sequel to the game! Really anticipating it!

With that said, I conclude my review by saying: [spoiler] m8 no h8, just apreci8, it's gr8, I r8 it 8/8, it's a f9 b8, get it m8. [/spoiler]"
10338,"This is sort of like a story of me and my uncle, but in my story my uncle tickled my bum with his magic wand"
10339,Excellent gameplay.
10340,This was awesome game but bad thing is that it was kinda short. But it could make it boring if it was too long because this is almost all the time a same thing. This was just an amazing story!
10341,"Much fun, such wow. I haven't had this much fun in a single player game in a long while. So happy to have found this :) A bit more replayability would be nice though :)"
10342,"Rough around the edges, yet functional describes just about every aspect of this game, I think. The story is rather out there for lack of a better term. The gameplay takes a little getting used to, but once I did, it was incredibly fun. I picked it up on sale, and I can't say I would recommend buying this game full price, but it still isn't horrendously bad in any way."
10343,Really liked their gameplay. They've done a good job with the movement system. The world is this game is also very beautifully made. Nice way to spend 2-3 hours
10344,"Excellent game. Only about 2 hours long, but the platforming is really fun and it doesn't drag."
10345,"Oo boy where do I start? Well first of all, I know it was short, I know that there's only like 7 levels to go through, I know that there's not that much dialougue and characters and npcs blah blah blah..

Besides that, the mechanics are amazing. The whole idea of ""swining to and fro"" to get to your destination is both fun and creative. I beat the game in less than 4 hours, and I must say, the ending brought a tear to my eye. The message that the game is trying to tell you makes you stop and think as you watch the credits roll. All in all, solid game, worth the sale price, $2.59, and will never forget this game.

10/10 BEST GAME"
10346,idk if its worth the full price as it is so short but its an amaing game when its on sale and would 100% recomend when on sale
10347,"This game is amazing, beautiful, and creative. Also, the thing is with this game,you actually really can't rage! The music and atmosphere is so calm, and the game is shrouded in mystery. It's just beautiful. You should totaly buy it."
10348,"I bought this game for 2 euros on a steam sale- best experience for that price (up to maybe 5). I recommend this game to everyone with a need for a nice story, although it is a short one.

[b]BUY THIS FOR, QUICK, BEFORE A DINOSSAUR COMES AND ATTACKS!! (NO DINOSSAURS IN THE GAME BTW) [/b]"
10349,A short but well put together game with beautiful scenery and a beautiful and compelling story.
10350,i know a pretty good story about my uncle as well ;D
10351,Its a pretty good game. Too bad its not that long :/
10352,"/Very Moving story, great graphics and gameplay, feels super smooth to play, very calm and relaxing game, 9/10"
10353,"I absolutely love this game, excellent story, great gameplay, re-playable, and beautiful graphics."
10354,"Simple yet interesting story with great, addicting gameplay. Game is qutie short however, which would be the only downside  I'm able to find."
10355,"Great game for $1.50, I can't reccomend it for $15 but its a heck of a thrill playing the game."
10356,"Very fun, and sometimes very irritating trying to get the jumps...but all in all its a great game"
10357,since its on sale i would say definitely get this game. You can beat this game in a few hours and it is extremely fun. very simple concept with puzzles that arent too challenging but ver scenic
10358,"This game is just AWESOME, although short, the storyline and gameplay is great."
10359,short storyline but otherwise fun
10360,awesome game
10361,"love this game, makes me rage sometimes but the story is so much fun and is so good"
10362,"Really fun, and interesting platformer with a decent story. It's on sale now and I'd gladly recommend it to anyono."
10363,Perfect game for perfect people.
10364,its great
10365,"Great game, as short as my penis."

10367,"[b]This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] skip to [u]Results[/u] and read from there.[/b]

Gone North Games creates a thrilling first person platformer that offers a fantastic story with challenging gameplay. A Story About My Uncle is a fine example of a casual, yet challenging platformer experience filled with beautiful environments.  

[b]Story:[/b]
A Story About My Uncle involves the story of a boy, most likely a teenager, who is alone in his uncles cabin surrounded by tundra. The game starts as the boy recalls a story about his uncle and the interesting life he led. As you play through the experience you slowly end up living a wonderful adventure of your own while learning about the amazing world your uncle has created.  As you explore through caverns and floating islands you meet interesting characters who help piece together the gaps within your uncle‚Äôs life while forming your own story.

[b]Campaign:[/b]
Overall the campaign is a decent length, you‚Äôll probably get anywhere from four (4) to eight (8) hours of gameplay out of this. If you want to find every secret you probably could spent a significant amount of additional time playing the game. The campaign offers a variety of different environments, but ultimately it is relatively repetitive. You‚Äôll go through caves, some floating islands, then caves with floating islands.
The achievements act as challenges for this game rather than progression points, so despite the game essentially just being the campaign you could go back and play the levels as challenges to get the achievements, but realistically this has no impact on the actual game itself. 
The campaign is relatively easy, which perfectly suits the design and style of this game. You may die a couple times as you go through, but the smooth checkpoint placement and relatively simple puzzles make this game fun rather than annoying. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
As platformer FPS style games go this one is pretty good with the controls and hit boxes. You‚Äôll find yourself rarely thinking that you should have landed somewhere you didn‚Äôt or hit something you would have missed. As the game is an FPS you don‚Äôt have to deal with poor camera elements as you could see in an third person platformer, but with this same light you‚Äôll also find you may need to have your sensitivity up high if you need to make a quick turn-around. 
The game plays off you having a power suit that adds functions throughout the game, but honestly you‚Äôll find that you essentially only unlock three abilities and they are all pretty basic. You‚Äôll get the ability to jump higher, the ability to propel forward, and a grappling hook. You‚Äôll essentially be using the same abilities throughout the game to solve relatively similar puzzles. 

[b]Results:[/b]
I‚Äôd recommend A Story About My Uncle for anyone looking for a relatively casual, yet immersive experience. The gameplay is somewhat similar to mirrors edge in that you will be running and jumping, but focuses more on utilizing your power suits special abilities to propel yourself through puzzles and into unique places. I personally grabbed this game when it was 75% off, and would recommend doing the same; but, if you absolutely love platformer fps then this is the game for you and you might as well pay full price. 

Pros:
+Decent graphics and visuals
+Relaxing soundtrack
+Good story
+Platformer FPS with some puzzle elements
+Good check point distance (making dying less annoying)
+Decent length

Cons:
-Relatively repetitive gameplay style
-Repeating environments"

Recommend the game if you have cripling depression.GUD


EDIT:The story is genuely good and touching,you develop a feel for the characters and your play.Its a calm game where you won't cry maybe be a bit happy.Just a calm singleplayer game.Soothing to play once in a while"
10369,The only thing wrong with this game is that it's too short.
10370,It's fun and stuff
10371,Beautiful Game Amazing Ending LOVE IT
10372,"I honestly didn't expect much coming into this game. I thought it was just some crappy developer's attempt at a game that would be lacking in substance and depth. Boy was I wrong.

From the get-go the game was great to play. The story is a touching one told from a great perspective, with the characters and their stories really drawing you in. The mechanics of the game (grappelling from one place to another) is actually a lot more fun than you would expect. It really is a challenge at some points to keep yourself from falling down but that's what keeps you going. The young antagonist that follows you through part of the game is also a great inspiration and motivation to keep going forward. The game was great and was put together perfectly.

I'm pretty crap at writing reviews but this is definitely a game I would recommend.

Similar to: The Stanley Parable, Life Is Strange and The Beginner's Guide."
10373,This game is awesome.
10374,"Shallow gameplay, uninspired story.
Recommended? Not really."
10375,What started out as a lovely and simple puzzle game with a very sweet storyline soon turned into a frustrating mess of immensly difficult levels. I would love to finish this but I don't think my keyboard or mouse could survive another attempt. A shame because it was quite lovely.
10376,"If you're looking for a game with a good story
10/10 would recommend this to you."
10377,"Contrary to most of the reviews, I found that tough platforming and pinpoing FPS accuracy do not mix well. Plus the voice acting of the main narrator is really awkward to listen to, and you hear it a LOT. Buy on sale if you like falling into pits!"
10378,"A short and clearly an indie title, but it has a touching story and is good for a few hours of entertainment if you like physics based puzzles."
10379,"A real graphical first person adventure.
I enjoyed playing the game. [i]Sometimes[/i].

First Person Platforming can be abit off and I very often miss the final landing point in the long jump, then get sent [b]BACK[/b] to the starting point. Rinse & Repeat.
It seriously annoyed me and I was glad when the game finally ended.

But, I stayed for the interesting visuals and the storyline.

Should you buy it?
Not at full price, look out for it at least 33% off.
"
10380,"Pretty neat game with challenging levels and really beautyful environment.
Also it's really stress reliefing for me.
Definitelly worth trying when it's on sale."
10381,Extremely fun and addicting.
10382,"Beutiful, relaxing, atmospheric. Perfect to pick up and play over a weekend. It it a bit short ( from a storyline prespective ) but the visuals, the gameplay and the audio more than make up for it. Not to mention it looks like it's probably gonna be enjoyable replaying it some time later."
10383,"It should not be possilble to hate a game with grappling, high speed air platforming, rocket boots, and an interesting environment...  yet this game made me hate it.

The problem is that the controls do not feel precise.  You can't really tell where the ledge stops as well so you're taking it either as a blind guess or from muscle memory from a dozen times trying to make the jump.  Furthermore, even though the backgrounds may show fog for some of the levels it doesn't appear to have it.  This would have been a great feature because it is VERY difficult to tell if a platform is just big and far away or if it is small and nearby.  Do I need to sprint jump to reach it, or would a regular power jump work?  If you sprint jump, you cannot correct the angle near the end of your jump, so either you get it perfect from the start or you spend 5-10 seconds watching your character jump to his doom.  Again.  And again.  And again.

Thankfully I got this as part of a humble bundle which came with other games that I might consider fun.  I would be very upset with myself if I bought this separately."
10384,"A Story About My Uncle is a good game in general. It has a calm atmosphere and a nice concept, and a fairly decent storyline.

9/10 would swing from a lazer glove again"
10385,"This game is short and sweet, I really enjoyed the jumping puzzles and have got to say this was one of the most enjoyable experiences ive had with a video game, even though it was quite short."
10386,"As  much  as   I Do NOT like Platformers- I can say,  (even having played it for so little) that  THIS  product  is a high-quality story with solid gameplay mechanics -  sure,  it is not  as  ""automated""  as Batman Arkham  games  (in terms of grappling),  but on the plus side,  you have more Control   over speed, direction  and overall    movement.   
Overall,   I'd  score it  at least 7.5/10"
10387,"beat the game the first time in around 2 hours, then i played it again in around 1.5 hours, even though the game is short, its very fun :)"
10388,"Great and touching story for a simple game. Some jumps/grapple will reveal you some difficulties though (exceptionnally in Star Haven with the sky mills), and we would have loved to see Maddie again! Although don't expect a very long game."
10389,"6/10

Pros: 
1. It's beautiful! The surroundings are very detailed and the colours match the mood of each setting perfectly. 
2. Very interesting story. 
3. Good music

Cons:
1. The gameplay is repetitive. Though that should be expected from what is essentially a walking simulator, the method of moving doesn't change too much. Only add-ons are made to the suit from time to time to add certain abilities. 
2. The narration is discontinuous and only jumps in at very few points in the story"
10390,"I enjoyed playing through the game, but it only takes 2 hours to beat, if that. If you want to pick this game up, just wait until it goes on sale. Definitely not worth the $13."
10391,"Although perhaps a little pricey still a very fun game.
It is challenging to a point where it doesn't subtract from the story or the gameplay."
10392,"Awesome game, great graphics, great history, great atmosphere, great level design, interesting puzzles, interesting way to tell the history.
Nothing ground-breaking new, still, worth every hour played."
10393,"The first game that made me cry at the end since the portal.

99999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10"
10394,"If 4 to 6 hours of platforming and zipping around a pretty landscape of floating rocks with a grappling hook sounds fun to you,  check it out. If you're looking for a gripping narrative stay away. Writings bad gameplays good, and personally 4 hours is enough for me to ignore a bad story."
10395,Cannot recommend this game.
10396,"It was fun, definitely worth the money."
10397,"Great game, though it is a bit short."
10398,so freakin gooooood
10399,"ASAMU is a simple calm game, very good ""parkour"" mechanics.
The story mode for this game is interesting but not to indepth and short by most standards, but is a good story none the less. Also the time trial is something to keep people playing after but this is the only other feature ( unless you replay the story) but none the less we keep you interested for a while and that you can play at anytime s of the games calm nature. Overall for ¬£10 (or even lower in sales) is defently worth the purchase."
10400,"The story sounds like something out of an awful child's book, topped off with some really bad voice acting.

The gameplay is okay but highly repetitive: sprint, jump, grapple, grapple, rocket boots, grapple, repeat. Also fall to your death. A lot.  The jumping and grappling mechanics could have made for a great game, but the mechanics are vastly underutilized here.  Where is the variety!?  The game really needs some actual puzzles.  Nothing ever blocks your way. There are no obstacles to overcome.  You simply spend all your time just moving from point A to point B without ever actually having to solve anything.  The path to take is clearly marked so there is never any confusion about where to go next.

The best part about this game is the graphics.  No one can deny that the game looks amazing.  Sadly, the lack of an engaging story and the highly repetitive gameplay makes this a game I would not recommend."
10401,Short but beautiful and lovely.
10402,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game that might  have a deeper meaning than you think. This game is absolutely stunning in the graphics department. The soundtrack is not exactly terrible either, subtle enough so you can enjoy the game, without it sounding too quiet, or blowing out your speakers. The storyline, while it may seem generic and weak at first, had my eyes welling up with tears by the time the story was drawing to a close. as someone who likes to read into clues, and phrases that seem to have no ulterior meaning the story seems to have at least two different endings. The characters do seem to be a bit shallow at times, but the major ones have some character devolpment that feels organic, realistc, and natural. The game does have it`s slow moments, which fit just wonderfully wit the fast-paced ones. Overall, it`s a great game, with great graphics, soundtrack, and stoy."
10403,"#1. This game is awfully pretty.
#2. You are going to feel like a boss when you are grappling and boosting and grabbing more crystals to keep grappling. NEVER TOUCH THE GROUND. 
#3. You should buy this game for a fiver."
10404,"If you enjoy jumping long distances over the void for hours and hours and following a story invented in the last minute, THIS IS YOUR GAME, if not: run away! is really boring after a couple minutes, i opted for the walkthrough videos in the internet to see if the ""jumping forever"" was going to end and guess what ? it does not!, meh i wish i could give it for free to somebody"
10405,"A mix of thrill rides, with jumps and grapples, and a lot of beautiful sceneries, music and storytelling. Amazing for a quick play.
Absolutely a must-play!
Awesome"
10406,A Story About My Uncle is an incredibly beautiful short game and feels amazing to play. Sadly it has disappointing ending in my opinion but I still recommend this game for the whole gorgeous and immersive atmosphere.
10407,I love this game so much and i wish that there was more.
10408,Fantastic game with a great story. Simple but fun game mechanics. The game visuals are beautiful and very well done. The effect of falling and swinging from platform to platform really make you feel like you are flying through the air. The complex narrative undertones really add to the short story and the depth of the characters.
10409,"Graphics and idea is really nice and all - But the story and the length of the game is lacking.
Also, the voice acting is very VERY bad and cringeworthy.

I just wish there were more levels and puzzles - the idea fits a casual gamer SO well, but the game just doesn't deliver on that part."
10410,"One of the best games I ever played.
But unfortunately its quite small."
10411,"This game is much shorter than I expected, but it's still nice."
10412,"The game is very well done, the enviroment in beautiful and some of the jumps can be really challenging(i broke one xbox controller), the story is quite simple but the narrative is good, the only con is that the game is very short.
Totally worthed if you get cheap."
10413,"Boring. We played for a few hours and uninstalled it. We made a pact never to install again.

+ Suitable for younger players who enjoy cute blue monsters and repetitive level design.
+ Fairly original storyline. (Though I suspect they stole the story from Uncle Traveling Matt, Fraggle Rock.)

- Just another generic Unreal Engine game with a little swinging here and there.
- Out-dated and not that original in concept.
- We got very bored, very quickly.
- It doesn't have the wacky appeal of Goat Simulator.
- It isn't as good as the Sanctum games.
- All the levels I saw looked the same.
- Zzzz..."
10414,"Not portal, not by a long shot.  Still not a bad game.  The gameplay follows physics based puzzles cetered around a non-weapon. Those are all of the similarities to portal.  In this game it is a grappling glove, not a portal gun.  The acting is bad, and the jokes aren't funny. The gameplay is semi-solid and the redeeming factor for the game. Grapple, dash, jump, rocket boost, the grapple again.  Eventually it becomes less fun and more a test of mouse agility as you have to recharge your glove by firing your last grapple at a crystal mid swing. This is becomes a frustration platformer. Every miss step results in starting a sometimes large portion of the game over and over.  I'm still reccomending you check it out.  The grapple mechanic is really good.  It feels like it was a tech demo that had a game thrown up around it."
10415,"A great game. Feels like it could be the next portal. Graphics are great, and it runs extremely smooth. 

Decent ending, but definitely not as great as I thought. I went into it with certain expectations, due to reading some of the reviews here. But overall, I'd give this a 9/10. One of the better games I've played in a while."
10416,"In times when games want to hold you for as long as possible, A Story About My Uncle is criminally short. And yet, in the end, you'll WANT to remain there for a little longer.

Gameplaywise, it's simple. You have your high and long jumps, you have your wall grapple, a bit further into the game you also get a nice pair of rocket boots. With these you'll have to make it through a series of obstacles - and the game always has some fresh turns to not make it repetitive, from introducing new mechanics to giving you a challenge.

And then there's the scenery. It's beautiful, and I've often just stopped from moving further just to gaze on the pretty cavern walls or breathtaking skies. Flying through those views is quite an experience.

The story is a little straightforward, but heartwarming nonetheless. I'd rather like you to see for yourself and make your own verdict.

Overall, the game is not a very complex or ambitious project at all, and it doesn't even pretend to be one. It's just something to go through and remember for a very long time."
10417, Absolutley amazing game
10418,"Hate this game.
At first it was quite interesting with all the jumping ang grabbing abilities. But then it became really boring. The plot is not so good either. Jump and grab. Jump and grab. Thats about it. Also the edges of mountains are awful. You just fall down where you are meant to jump many times which is extremely annoying. After two hours it drove me up the wall. Grrr."
10419,"9/10 Rating

A very good but challenging short story game. 
Where a boy is set out to find his uncle in another world with a cool suit to help overcome obstacles.

A bit hard to get achievements of the bat if you just play. You'll have to play it a few times just to get some of the achievements.

Worth the time and money. To get the achievements you will have to spend a lot of time getting them. (Good luck)"
10420,"A Story About My Uncle is a great little game. Very interesting story line, intriguing sci-fi elements, and quick to get into. I think the frog-people were fun and I don't mind that it was a quick game. It kept me on the edge of my seat as I was hurdling through the air, wondering if I would make it to the next checkpoint. For the 3-4 dollars I paid, this was beyond expectations. 2 thumbs up (if only I could give it that on Steam)."
10421,"Amazing,


The scenery is breathtaking and the movement is satisfying.   I fell in love with the story as if the story was being told to me and not the girl, it's just plain out breathtaking and fun to play.  The ending makes you wish that there was more adventures in that big big world the devs have created. DEFINITELY worth a buy,

(TL:DR) Buy the dang game already."
10422,"You might call A Story About Mu Uncle a joy-of-movement simulator.  It's focused on jumping and grappling huge distances and the short-form resource conservation puzzles involved.  It's pretty simple--easy to learn, almost as easy to master--but also satisfying to play, pretty to look at, and over well before it's worn out its welcome.  

There's also a saccharine-sweet narrative delivered through some charmingly accent-stilted voice acting.  Both can definitely be rather awkward, but ASAMY's story has this comforting sense of earnestness, which helps overcome its stilted delivery and well-tread themes.  It feels entirely divorced from adult self-awareness, both for good and ill.

Definitely give this one a look.  It's a really enjoyable way to spend 2-3 hours.

"
10423,"Pretty fun, short  fps platformer. I really enjoy the grapple mechanics.  My only complaints are the voice acting gets weird at parts, like it was edited together poorly. And sadly to say, that I wish there was some kind of difficulty selection or something to help people get past difficult parts.  Its a game about a story, but if you really arent dedicated or amazing at platforming you wont ever see/hear it all. Still a good game, and if its on sale its worth it."
10424,"Amazing game, but a really short story. Not worth $13, but def buy if on sale."
10425,"I can not recommend this game enough. Gameplay is super fun, story is great, and a super pretty art style."
10426,"Well..... This was lovely and I really do hope more people play it, made the heart all warm. Oh and the gameplay is actually pretty fun."
10427,"honestly just alot of fun for a cheap indie game, would recommend getting it especially if its on sale"
10428,"Amazing game! A really unique take that feels peaceful and a relaxing game to play. Its an escape from blood and guns, even though I do have fun playing those types of games. It really is one of a kind"
10429,"This game sounded like it'd be right up my allley. It wasn't. In the end, only thing I was appreciative of was its short duration.

I'm kinda sad that a way to quickly respawn upon failure would've solved or at least lightened most of my gripes with the game. Instead, I spent way too long cussing as I fell to my ""death"", waiting for the moment I reached that always too far death threshhold so I could just go back and try again. 

I didn't have a good time with this game. I didn't have a terrible time, either, but I can't bring myself to recommend it.

PS: Story and writing weren't all that much either. Or maybe I was just too annoyed to care."
10430,"It wasn't great, but the jumping mechanics worked well in the game and it was just nice to fling myself around in huge environments. But then the game buggered up and didn't let me continue. Not a great loss, but still would've liked to finish it. 
So an okay game, with technical issues, cannot recommend."
10431,"I would recommend this game based upon its gameplay and visuals. The feel of rushing and swinging past open chasms remained breath taking all the way until the final swing. There isn't much of a story, however. It's simple and really only exists to justify the world around you.
If the game were an amusement park, the gameplay would be the roller coaster. The storyline would be the carousal.
"
10432,"Absolutely beautiful game! A great story game that will leave you with a warm feeling. I love games like this, as I call them movie-games. Not too long as to make it into somethink you will play over the course of months but not something that is jsut mindless. Great Game! The price is worth it! If you can, play through in one sitting."
10433,"Amazing game through and through.  One playthrough lasted 2 hours roughly, but every minute of that waas looking at beautiful landscapes, suns, caverns, and the occasional villages.  The story that is unveiled seems to be cover up a very symbolic meaning that is touching.  I would honestly rate this game a 9/10.  Only reason it is not perfect is because I felt like there was going to be more towards the end, but it came to an stop.  Without a doubt worth the $12.99.  (It's nearly the same price to go see a movie)"
10434,"A gemstone, a great one. That what I thought about the game.

The game visual sure is nice, espeacially under first-person point of view. The beautiful scenery, the cave filled with glittering lights, the sky open like forever... Hell, I can say anything else... It also fit perfectly with the soundtrack. Together, a mix of perfection.

The gameplay? It was unique. I mean, not like you can run, jump, fly by using a grappling hook in any other games, right?

But, one thing I feel the game deserved more, was a proper build in storyline. The opening was great, I must say, but the ending makes you feel like being rushed. Not a good way to end the story, and the game, right?

In conclusion, ASAMU deserves a try. Don't worry, you won't be disappointed (I think).

[i]""I don't know how to describe the feeling of bursting through the air, like a bullet. So fast that my eyes watered. And my belly was full of butterflies.

‚Äî  The main character, ASAMU."
10435,"Brilliant. Definetely worth the money, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere is perfect (allbeit the animation is quite clunky on the characters you rarely meet).

If you want a thrilling but relaxing story-driven game to play on a rainy Sunday afternoon, it's this one."
10436,"A Story About My Uncle is a 3D Platformer game that featuring a guy with a suit that has a grapple and can fire up leg boosters in an adventure to find his lost uncle.

Visually impressive, the graphics are so amazing and the environment is too beautiful. And the soundtracks are great too. However, it‚Äôs gets repetitive and boring after the first two levels. 

It‚Äôs the same formula over and over from the beginning to the end, you grab on floating objects to get into tiny rocks or islands then grabble on floating objects to get into other rocks/islands. Because of this, it‚Äôs too easy to get lost when no checkpoint is around, and sometimes the checkpoints get far from each other, this is not a problem until the game becomes difficult and frustrating with its mechanics. 

I don‚Äôt know why the grapple manage to hook up with something from a certain distance, but sometimes refuse on similar-distance objects and/or when they closer. Same story with the jump, every time you do a dash jump, the height of the jump and the trajectory differs, this made some parts very frustrating to be honest if you keep thinking you will get the same results.

Let‚Äôs go back to the story, the story is really generic, a guy goes on a journey searching for his uncle, finding a little girl in his way and both share some dialogues that doesn‚Äôt give the story any depth or details. After so many swinging and rage quitting, what‚Äôs the ending all about? Nothing at all, no twists, no surprises, no sad moments and no actual development, few sentences and the credits begin to roll up. Really disappointed by the ending and the story overall.

Besides, the voice acting of the main protagonist is really bad, it doesn't have character at all.
It feels awkward when he finally finds his uncle, his voice has no sense of joy or emotions, it's too dull.

A Story about my uncle has its good moments, it starts off as a promising game but unfortunately it‚Äôs only fun for a while and the story, which hook you up at first is totally nothing to look forward.
Give it a try, not a terrible game, but not a great one either.

5.5/10"
10437,"Awesome story!
"
10438,"It's short (3 or 4 hours); grab it when it's on sale.

While there are some moments that are very challenging, it has *lots* of checkpoints, so a single missed landing doesn't set you back too far."
10439,great soundtrack ... Great game
10440,"Fun game, i liked the narrating"
10441,Very Overpriced But Great Game
10442,"The graphics are just gorgeous, the platforming is both fun and challenging, the story is intriguing. With all this in mind I rate the game an 8/10. Depending on how good you are this game will last you anywhere from 2-3 hours. To prolong that time I suggest you explore the rich environment.


"
10443,"A Story About My Uncle is a 3D Platformer game set in a fantastical world of gaping chasms and floating islands, where you, the hero, are looking for your uncle who has gone missing.

Pros:
[list]
[*] the platforming is very well made, no movements feel cumbersome or unnatural (and the boots saved my ass from falling sooooo many times - not enough times though :( )
[*] the graphics are gorgeous; although the engine clearly struggles with characters, you don't see many of them and the game world is BEAUTIFUL (yes, it actually looks better in-game, especially when swinging with a laser grappling hook from a floating rock, high above the clouds)
[*] I can't speak for consoles, but on PC (mouse&keyboard) controls were on point
[*] the story, narated from the player's point of view, hooked me immediately and did not disappoint
[/list]
[*] Unlike other platformers, I did not reach the point where I had to quit the game to calm down (looking at you DeadCore). Each failure just made want to continue more and more.

Cons:
[list]
[*] The game is very short...
While I would argue that this can be a good thing, as to not bore players, the puzzles would have needed to become more and more complicated, to the point of becoming OSU! on otaku level of difficulty, it feels like A Story About My Uncle could have gone a bit further with both the game itself and the story.
[*] There is no multi-player or other means of extending the game (for example, a level designer that allowed you to share your levels would have been god-tier goodness). After finishing it once, the only option is to replay the game and go achievement-hunting.
[*] If you play it in the morning, it will make you late for school/work. :P
[/list]

All in all this is an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys platformers.. Although it pains me to say it, as it is, because of length and replay value issues, best would be to buy this game while it's on sale (thank you Humble Bundle for including this in your offer)

please make another that has multiplayer/level designer (preferably both) and we'll love you for ever"
10444,"I was very enthralled by the game, I got pulled into the story and I enjoyed it greatly, the game was beautiful and even though at times I was frustrated (mostly by maddie's challenge, but by god i got it!) I had fun. I got attached to the characters and was sad to see the end, both happy tears and sad tears."
10445,"A short, 2.5 hour narrated adventure. Really enjoyable game. The idea is to grapple your way through a puzzle-like world while being told a beautiful story. While it doesn't have the highest replayability (the game is very linear), I've certainly gone back for seconds, and thirds."
10446,"Fantastic platformer with really neat mechanics, simple but (to me) pleasant storyline, and *awesome* environments.

Over and over, you will look around you wide-eyed in wonder at the majestic scenery surrounding you above and below... while you are falling to your death. Over, and over.

Unless you ever get the chance to go paragliding on Pandora, you will never have so much fun testing the limits of your lack of fear of heights."
10447,Very very good game rate good out of good
10448,"I got it on sale for like $2.49. That being said, having played the game, I'd pay full price for it. It was really captivating, and a great break from my Rimworld binges. Maybe a little bit short, but definitely something I can play again and again."
10449,it was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! i loved it so much thank u coffee stain for such an awesome game
10450,Ok so bad stuff first. Character animation... not that great. Voice acting and dialogue... it's ok. But the gameplay!!! this has such fluid motion and is genuinely great fun once you learn the movement mechanics and know what your doing. Highly recommend for a fun playthrough even if its not that long. Well done to the team involved! I got this on sale but for ¬£9.99 this is an excellent game to pick up!
10451,"meh, it's good.  I highly recommend using a keyboard and mouse because you'll need extreme precision at times.  Is it worth $12.99?  yeah, maybe...but i would pick it up on sale.

Pros:  
atmosphere
solid controls

netural: 
the story...meh and short

cons:
it's one-trick pony that does wear thin at times"
10452,Such a great game and the best story line I have ever played in my opinion.
10453,"Absolutely phenomenal. Short-but-sweet (no, really- my first playthrough front-to-back was about 3 hours, without either trying to speedrun or dallying around to hunt for those obnoxious collectibles) first-person platformer, but you've got jump physics closer to Mario than your typical FPS- insanely high, floaty, and an impossible (but satisfying) amount of play control after you launch. Shortly along, you pick up a grappling hook, and from there it's just one fun, wind-whipping-in-your-ears wild ride. The story is cute and heartwarming; perhaps it does feel a bit shallow, or perhaps saccharine, but it's mostly superficial to the game anyways, so take it as you will.

There's a few points where you will quite likely die A LOT, but checkpoints are frequent and well-placed so you never lost more than 30 seonds' prograss, keeping even more frustrating segments from breaking the flow of the game.

Personally I would recommend playing this on a controller with the sensitivity on 1.5 because I found it to be a bit easier to manage the controls that way- there's not much to control, but the XInput mapping is simple and intuitive.

Overall A Story About My Uncle was a wonderful game- exactly as long as it should have been, a fun gameplay ""hook"", and fantastic execution in terms of technical performance and level design.

10455,"First time I've ever felt it worthwile to review a game, I would give this game a perfect score despite its short length, I have been looking for a game where movement actually feels good and this game executes on it perfectly.  The level design was also impeccable with good scaling of challenge while not feeling overwhelming,  solving a particularly difficult section is immensly gratifying. I would love to see a sequal or some sort of level expansion in the future. Probably my favorite platformer ive played in a long time."
10456,"Beautiful game was super fun to play. Recommended for sure.
Side comment from backseat player : Looks like PitFall!"
10457,"Beautiful environments, good storytelling, compelling characters that I cared about for such a short story. Highly recommend it if you are looking for a relaxing, but challenging platformer to complete in a sitting or two."
10458,"A game that features a refined gameplay with a mysterious, adventure themed narrative. 

[b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]
It is absolutely phenomenal. I was blown away by the graphics; it really goes to show that indie games are capable of displaying such visuals for limited budget they have. 

[b]Storyline: 10/10[/b]
You decided to find your uncle and whilst doing you discover a whole new world in what seems like it came out of a dream. You‚Äôll meet creatures, see amazing scenery and uncover the location of your uncle.  

[b]Sound: 9/10[/b]
Most of the soundtrack are sounds of the atmosphere and the rest are the voices of the characters. The soundtrack is really subtle and you don‚Äôt usually notice it until you stop and pause for second and enjoy the backdrop. Otherwise, it really fits the game, but I do wish they added more soundtracks as some parts of the game does get a little bit empty sometimes.

[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]
This is a first person platformer adventure with lots of jumping sequences. You are given special abilities that let you traverse through all the different terrains you will encounter. If you are easily frustrated by failing and re-doing certain jump parts, you can stay away from this game. It‚Äôs a fun experience otherwise. 

[b]Price: 7/10[/b]
The ¬£9.99 price-tag doesn‚Äôt sound too bad, but for a game that lasted me less than 5 hours, it‚Äôs not really worth it. Maybe a ¬£4.99 price-tag would be more appealing. I‚Äôd recommend getting this game on a sale.

10461,"Really unique and fun little platformer.  It isnt a long game, but I have fun throughout.  You should play this, for sure."
10462,"I wish this was on ps4, it's really good"
10463,"The story along with the gameplay was nice, good atmosphere, the gameplay would get a bit slow sometimes, quick thinking is definitely key to finishing this game, overall pretty satisfying though :) 8/10"
10464,"great game i really enjoyed playing and can see myself re-playing it.
if you get bored of re playing put in challenges for yourself"
10465,<3
10466,"Game is so short yet so nice. Sterytelling is bes part of it, worth of spending few hours and finishing it."
10467,A very short game but really worth it. The puzzles are challenging and the story is simple but good. Well done. The achievements are very challenging to get which is why I don't have any haha.
10468,"A very cute story and a challenging game. The swinging was a little weird, which is my only real negative. I'm glad it was short because it would have started to get repetative after a while. Overall I recomend checking this game out."
10469,very lovely genuine game
10470,"A very well-produced game. The mechanics and levels were clearly put together with a great deal of care. The atmosphere is excellent, and the levels are fun and challenging without being hard just for the sake of being hard. 

The game is relatively short, only 2-3 hours on a first play-through, but I honestly prefer that in games these days - when your days are long and you have little time for video games, it's nice to be able to finish one in just a few evenings! A Story About My Uncle doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't feel either dragged out or rushed. For people looking for more gameplay, there are quite a few collectibles to give it some replay value if you didn't catch them all the first time through.

Each of the different areas has its own distinct feel and its own mechanic - everything from glow-bushes in the pitch black to stalagtites that fall when you grapple from them. The different biomes are well-realized, with attention to detail. The windmill village, especially, is quite lovely. The mechanics all feel smooth and well-implemented. They aren't necessarily anything extraordinarily innovative, but they feel fresh within the context of the game. It's not just some stale re-hashing of old ideas; everything fits into the game nicely. 

The bedtime story vibe of the game is one that resonates with me. It keeps the tone light, even as a couple of the areas are rather foreboding. It moves the game along, keeps you engaged with the narrative, and generally provides an excellent backdrop to the gameplay.

There are a few things that I think could have been done better. The game could have benefited from some more attention to the soundtrack. I'm not saying that the soundtrack was *bad* by any stretch of the imagination, just... the ambient sounds were just that: extremely ambient without having any interesting melodies. I'm a huge sucker for games with a good soundtrack. Additionally, it would have been fun to be able to interact with and speak to the various NPCs. Just having some textual dialogue, even if it wasn't voice acted, would have been neat. It would have given the towns a bit more life. 

Overall, however, I definitely recommend this game! I'd certainly buy it again. I don't think I'd pay full price, but if you see it for around $5-7, I'd say you're going to be getting your money's worth."
10471,worth it
10472,gg ez
10473,"This is literally a bed time story.
Cute, short, extremely child friendly, and with a disappointing ending.
I got this for the parkour - which it [i]has[/i], but it thinks this is a racing game (time trials) or has ""trial run"" potential (race with these conditions).
Meanwhile it asks you to [i]find[/i] the plot:
-Learn this language.
-Go to ""challenge"" areas (that are difficult to go to, and don't count unless you make it back to the real path)."
10474,"A Story About My Uncle is a fun little first-person indie platformer. The core gameplay is built around a grappling hook that let's you grab onto most surfaces. This mechanic is well implemented and the controls are quite smooth too. The story is quite charming as well.

Unfortunately, the game is rather short. I would have been happy to play through a longer game that developed these ideas further.

I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, especially when it's on sale.

The good:
- Fun and enjoyable gameplay
- Well-implemented controls
- Grappling hook and rocket boots are a fun combination
- Sweet if predictable story
- Star Haven level is quite impressive visually

The bad:
- Rather short
- Physics can be bit wonky at times
- Checkpoint placement feels little bit off in some places

The ugly:
- It's fairly common to see through walls when you get too close to them"
10475,"Definitely worth ten bucks (or less).

The gameplay is unique enough to warrant the three hours (almost exactly, in my case) it takes to beat. This game is purely physics-puzzles. There's no combat, and the only way to die (with ONE exception) is to fall. The game never truly challenged me, but there were a few points where I died over and over again until I got it--challenging enough to casually engage me.

The story is silly, but cute. The narration and voice acting aren't bad, per se, but they're not good. However, I was never drawn out of the experience by the acting.

This game isn't technically beautiful. It looks like an average 360 game. However, the environments are beautiful. A bit cliche'd, at times, but still a treat to look at. The game paces it's environments well, too, so that none of the settings get tired. 

I know none of this sounds like high praise, but I mean it when I say this game is a great way to kill a few hours. If it's ever on sale, add it to your library and save it for a rainy day. I'd liken it to reading a short, rewarding little book. I'll never pick it back up, but I'm glad I played through once."
10476,Pretty good platforming game. Nice graphics. Its pretty short also. I think on sale is when to buy.
10477,"Definitely worth what I paid for it. The game itself is beautiful, very stylized with smooth graphics and whimsical characters (however archetypal). The game play can be a little frustrating at times, but no more than any indie game, and you feel accomplished afterwards. My only real complaint is that it was short, but it had a sweet story, and all in all it was a wonderful experience."
10478,"I just finished playing this game and WOW...  This  game...  This game is more then just a game.. It's a adventure. A journey into a whole new world. It's so beautiful, relaxed, atmospheric (...) and something you have never seen before. 12.99 is a very good price for a game like this. Play it until the end, it worth it."
10479,"I love it but this game is to short I'm almost done and its only been five hours. Maybe a multiplayer?
"
10480,"Wish for a neutral vote, but it have to do with a ""No""

Bugs and invisible walls hidden traps maybe."
10481,"This game is truly amazing the grapics are incredible, the story line is touching at the end,its challenging, and its just awesome! :)"
10482,"after a while, it gets boring and although the story is interesting and captivating, it could be developed to be richer and more interesting."
10483,"[h1]Masterpiece[/h1]
The game is short, just take about 2-4 hours to complete but the story could keep you stay entertained for hours. Recommend to pick it on a discount"
10484,Never thought a game could be this relaxing and challenging at the same time. The only thing i wised was there was some background music
10485,Cancer game
10486,"Pros:
Fantastic controls
Good optimization
Doesn't get boring

Cons:
I've found that I ""die"" quite often (the screen goes black) when I had a chance to save myself.
It seems like the creators wanted to make a really deep and enjoyable story, but it's not really interesting at all. I like the ideas, like that their village is made of garbage, but it's not enough to warrant a ""great plot"".
There are a few hidden pathways, but there are never multiple paths to the same spot. That'd be cool.
Voice acting isn't the best. It's pretty good, but not great."
10487,"Really fun, beautiful landscapes, atmosphere is well delivered. It's quite relaxing.
You will stop along the way to admire the scenery.
Some levels were pretty challenging to me, it took me longer than average to finish the game.
A lot of checkpoints along the way so you don't have to start all over again when you fall.
Controls are easy to use and feels natural.

The story is not rich, it's ok.. basic and discreet... You can't interact with objects or characters :(
Would have appreciated some humor and deeper relationships (those felt rushed).
The end was attempting to be touching but it didn't work on me.
Music is not memorable. Character design is not the sharpest.
Those achievements are impossible (would have liked some history/progress based achievements).

Overall it's a great game, I enjoyed it. 
Buy it if you wanna feel like a spider man in a fairytale. :)"
10488,"Beautiful looking game, the landscapes were pleasing to look at. Unfortunately, everything else falls short. 

The story was banal. Not terrible, not great.

The voice acting is really bad. I opted to mute the speech and just read the subtitles. There are tons of creatures in this game, but they're just decorative as you can't speak to them or interact with them in any way. Bummer.

The gameplay mechanics are interesting and fun at first, but once you progress through the game and it starts getting tougher, you realize they're clunky, making some parts really frustrating. In addition, it's easy to get lost as there's really no indication as to where you should go next. It's repetitive and adds additional mechanics a bit too late into the game.

I got this game on sale for ~$2 USD so I'm not too hurt. I was tempted to quit halfway through the game, because of these issues, but pulled through just for the sense of completion. It's pretty short at about 2-3 hours. I only pulled 2 achievements as they're quite hard to get, but I honestly can't be bothered to play it again. I'd be more upset if I paid full price."
10489,"Looking for a game you can enjoy for just the story? You're going to be frustrated by the difficulty (but it's not impossible).

Looking for a Challenge? You might find this game a tad easier than you're used too (even if the end is debatable on that aspect).

Looking for a game where all the elements make it enjoyable? Get this one. The story is great the voice acting is surprisingly decent and the enviornments are interesting. The attention to detail in some areas as well is amazing, and everything just looks cool.

I found the platforming to be difficult but this was my first time playing a first person platformer (though I have played other kinds of platformers). I don't recommend using a controller to play this game because of the quick reflexes you need to click on objects to swing yourself from place to place - that reflex is REQUIRED, ESPECIALLY for the last area - trying to whip your head around to nab at falling objects is harder then it sounds.

There are also collectibles to find, both of no story value (if you wanna find them all go ahead) and ones that give more story dialogue (which I recommend you find they're great). Looking around for them can be tedious, but that's only really because there's nothing else to look for besides all of those but if you just want to find the story ones for the extra information there is a guide where you can find em all if you don't feel like scouring the place for them.

Again I'm gonna say the platforming is difficult - I looked up videos after I completed the game and found there were quite a few people saying the game was too hard (which I don't believe myself) or was too irritating to finish (you have to be super precise with your grapple equipment - you can't waste charges unless you know you'll be landing on a platform) but if you think a bit more and try not to hit your head on all the floating boulders it's not that bad... Well for me it wasn't. I still have to agree that this game was frustrating but the pleasant music in some places and the story dialogue (and enviornments) eased my mind off of it for the most part.

If it helps they have been doing fixes to the game occasionally from what I can tell to make some parts that were a bit too punishing easier for players that didn't come just for the challenge.

I think this is when you beat the game only (I didn't honestly check) but there's a time trial where you can speedrun through the areas you previously did in the main game. If you really wanna practice with the platforming or you really liked the gameplay itself feel free to do those - you can also replay stages too, but I'm not 100% sure if you can reget the collectibles that way if you missed them.

..Also as a side note why was there a dead whale that was never brought up in story dialogue who is he why is he not in water where did he come from-


If the price tag concerns you for how long the game actually is (About 2 hours give or take depending on how long it takes you to clear some areas) it's definately a good grab when it's on sale. If it concerns you on anything else (that's price related) I'd still grab it when it's on sale - it's a great game."
10490,Very nice game. Loved it.
10491,i fucking love this game. great story telling excellent sound design an amazing grapple system i wish it was a longer game like dlcs or just more missions like volcanos or underwater leveles or space levels or some shit like that i totally recommend this game 90/10
10492,:)
10493,It is actually yhe most epic and satisfying game i have ever played in my life! I wish to play more games like this one!
10494,"Its a nice game with a nice story. Worth it buying, I find it as a game that you should own. Although the story and the graphics are great, some levels are too dark and too boring and thats what made me stop playing it. Stuck on a dark, hard level, which tires you more as you play it. Eh, i recommend it but i wont say its gonna be the best purchase of your life."
10495,"Great game, bought it while is was $2.59 but it's definetly worth the full price."
10496,"Not a very long game, worth it for sure if you get it on sale ! Enjoyed it thoroughly"
10497,"It's a great platforming/parkour game. The grappling is very responsive and smooth. Momentum is key here. The story is very short however, and mediocre at best, but that doesn't take away from the gameplay. 

Definitely a recommended buy even with the price tag right now."
10498,"A Story About My Uncle is a game that instantly popped out to me, when looking through the Steam Specials a couple of weeks ago. For $2 CDN, an adventure game with a cool gimmick? Why not?!

The game features a suit that allows you to ""swing"" around very open (and beautiful, I might add) environmenta, similar to Spiderman. More features come to the suit later, but I won't go in depth there. The features seem to work very well, even on a controller, where moving your cursor around isn't easy. I found that I was stuck on some parts of some levels, but only because my cursor didn't move fast enough to reach the object with my beam and continue swinging. I'd imagine that this would be at least a little easier with a keyboard and mouse.

While this game does have beautiful graphics, very good voice acting, and wonderful gimmicks to keep users playing through the adventure, there are some quirks in this game, which can be fixed:

I found that, with the energy crystals that are supposed to refill your beam energy, some of them just didn't work. At all. No matter how close or far I got from them, they would not refill my energy. The option didn't even come up. This lead me to reverse-engineering the game's physics, in lack of a better term, to advance through the game in a way that I'm sure the developers did not intend the game to be beaten.

The ability to reach certain objects with your beam from certain distances are also inconsistent. Some objects I can reach when I'm extremely far away from, while other objects, I can't reach when I'm only half as far. This also lead me to just guessing and misusing my abilities, making it harder for me to advance through the game.

The ending. No spoilers, but the ending leaves much to be desired. I wish the game would have gone further; really expanded on what was given to the player. I spent around 4 hours on the game, and the game feels unfinished; like it's just a demo. A $13 (but on sale for $2) demo. It really feels like there should have been more to the story part, to at least make the game FEEL longer. After putting through several, strenuous hours of gameplay, you get to your destination, and it's all over. No going back. The added epilogue was nice, but it still doesn't make the ending any better. It just draws out the feeling of ""Is this really it?"", which is very dissapointing.

The extras and unlockables are a nice touch to the game. Although I didn't even realize they were a thing until I unlocked the first one. I will most likely go back and scourge the levels again to find the collectibles to unlock the ones I haven't gotten yet.

Overall, the game was worth the money for me. A very good proof-of-concept that should have been expanded on at least a little bit more, but was still very fun to play in it's time. I would 100% recommend someone to get this game,, especially if it goes on sale."
10499,Very good game. Amazing storyline. I suggest this game to anybody!
10500,"Great game
Great story, but I kinda wish it were longer.
Still really fun to play; one should deff pick it up on sale"
10501,A beautiful and lovely game! Great storytelling. 9/10
10502,"It is a good game that many people obviously enjoy. And so did I for a while. I give the thumb down because a crucial feature of the game (rechargig crystals) stoppes working well at some point, what makes progressing some levels unnecesarily frustrating."
10503,"You need like 1 hour to compelte the whole story.
Well i have 200 hours on this game and everyone is asking me why.
I really love love this game its so awesome i cant descibe it really.
Best game ever <3"
10504,"A Story About My Uncle is a relatively short, but clever, game that focuses on flinging yourself through the air, grappling on to various targets and generally hopping about and traversing large, open areas. You'll fall to your death a lot, but as you get the hang of how the grapple system flows, you'll soon be racing through the air and having a ton of fun.

There are a few hiccups; while the story is well told (as simple as it is), the voice acting is mediocre. While I found the gameplay fun overall, there were certainly spots where there simply weren't enough environmental clues to point you in the direction you were supposed to be heading, making for some pointless deaths as you simply inch forwards and learn the path of the route your supposed to take.

These are minor gripes, though. Overall ASAMU is a fun little game with a clever and well-implemented gameplay mechanic."
10505,"[h1] A Story About My Uncle is a game with a simple story, appealing backgrounds, and absolutely stunning gameplay that carries this game forward. If swinging around with an energy beam is your thing, you will love this game. [/h1]

[b][i]GAMEPLAY[/i][/b]
The gameplay in this game is the most important start of it. It is what makes this game so amazing. The main premise is you are a player who has access to a suit which let's you swing back and forth between a variety of objects. The settings are interesting where you can explore an overwhelming cave, and mountain encassed in ice, and a city designed in floating rocks. This is the best part of the game, moving between platforms to make it to your destination, with a variety of suit upgrades as your progress. Along with the story mode, you are also given a time trial that is actually extremely difficult to get a gold medal, and this will be the main mode that gives this game a longer life span. This simple element of platforming gives the gameplay a 10/10!

[b][i]STORY[/i][/b]
The story is where I feel it is lacking. The story starts out with you doing a simple task: searching for your missing uncle who doubles as an adventurer. This is a unique concept as you are literally flung into a world you know nothing about. The only problem I have with the story is that it is lacking in so many places it makes it hard to follow. It leaves a lot of gaps open that don't explain enough to give your a proper sense, and it has a lackluster ending that is more disappointing then anything. I would give it a 6/10, since the little we are given is really fun.

[b][i]GRAPHICS[/i][/b]
The games graphics aren't too imporant, but they are nice. The backgrounds of the game are amazing and beautiful, and if you like taking screenshots of games like I do, then you are going to have fun here. The rest of the game is lackluster, however, is bland and I feel this is the only part of the game that I dislike. The player models and animations are very wonky, and it feels like this game could've pushed the graphics and a little further without performance. I would be them a 3/5, since they are bland and boring up close, but the background and looking from the top of a hill is stunning.

[h1]FINAL SCORE - 19/25 - C[/h1]

Thanks for reading! This is a really good game and is a nice one to have in your lobby simply for one playthrough and the trial mode. If you have a few hours to kill, pick this game up!"
10506,"Great game. almost better than the stories about MY uncle where we'd play ""Don't tell mom and dad what we did today"". Ah, memories..."
10507,"A very beautiful, very entertaining video game. The plot was amazing. The only downside is that it was waaayyy too short. It isn't worth it 12 bucks. Wait for the sale. If this game has a sequel, I want it to be at least 10 hours."
10508,"Enjoy grappling in Zelda? Want to do it the entire game? Yes? Get this game.

A peaceful game to play when you're trying to relax. Trying to get from point A to point B by grappling all over the place."
10509,Okay so the story has a few parts that make no sense at all.. I really enjoyed the gampley but im not so sure It was worth 13 dollars I believe? With the gaps in the story that completely contradicted alot of the important segments in the game it made it hard to enjoy it.
10510,nipples have never made more sense
10511,"ASAMU has the best first person platforming I've ever experienced. It's entirely physics-based and fluid, but a number of clever design decisions (speed lines indicating trajectory, glowing reticle when in grapple range, marks left on previous grapple points) make it as legible and tight as you'd expect from a side scroller. The world, atmosphere and narration are all quite charming, and the story is cute and engaging without being so intrusive as to slow down the pace. The post-credits scene adds an interesting layer to the story that I didn't expect."
10512,Fucking amazing
10513,I never had a chance on trying to pass this game but yeah.I like it as far as i made it.
10514,"Good game. It's not expersive but has a very good story, which makes me feel relaxed even i'm 18 years old."
10515,"Such a great game!! 1st off it has a GREAT story that draws you in from the very start and it continually gets more difficult. It will leave you cursing and upset one minute and then awed in the beauty of the landscape the next. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially fun with a controller!"
10516,"Short game, but amazing atmosphere and a great take on an old idea of grappling. Essentially you jump and tether through a variety of environments grabbing floating rocks and the like. Great auto save spots so if you do fall you don't have to start too far back. Fairly easy game, I beat it in 3 hours. Definitely pick it up it's around $7"
10517,"not really fun
story is weak"
10518,"Fun, original gameplay with parkour and grappling hook.
Great soundtrack.
A Story About Your Feels Getting Hit Just Right.

10/10 would grapple again"
10519,"Truly an atmospheric platformer, and a pretty one at that! Yes, the story is a bit short, but the gameplay during that short time is breath-taking! Now if this game included user-made maps, it would be hands down my favorite game!

I recommend everyone to buy this game. You wont regret it!"
10520,The only thing this game is missing now is a sequel.
10521,"A beautiful, short game. I used to have a terrible fear of heights in videogames. Now, maybe a little bit less so. We now have a running joke about frantically mashing our faces into things to get to safety. Definitely would recommend."
10522,"It's not bad, but it's not great, either.  On the one hand, jumping and grappling your way through caverns and across floating rocks is pretty challenging, and the environments are visually quite impressive for an indie game.  On the other hand, it's short and the voice-acting (in English, at least) is terrible.

I picked it up when it was on sale for about $3 -- if you're interested in it, I wouldn't recommend paying full price."
10523,"I love the graphics and the gameplay, its captivating and fun. It's complicated enough to keep me interested and easy enough not to turn me off from the game. I defintely recommend this game."
10524,"It's short, but that's about the only complaint I have. This is a beautiful game with great mechanics that never seem overwhelming or easy. The levels are well designed and don't rely on checkpoints to show you where to go. There's also a good story with memorable characters.

If you want a short, fun platformer, I would definitely recommend this."
10525,Havent played it that long but seems to have an intertesting story line.
10526,"Great game..
I love the gameplay, i love the puzzle, and i love the graphic..
I hope there is a sequel for this game..

Love it, very love.."
10527,Who tf is that? thats not my uncle. I have no Idea who this man is
10528,good
10529,"Beautiful, wonderfully atmospheric game. Very enjoyable and relaxing."
10530,"If you're someone who likes to whine about how long games are, don't get this game. It's only about 3 hours long, ok? But what you get is good. Not amazing, not the best thing ever, but good. The game looks nice, has a great art style with beautiful levels and great level design. The gameplay mechanic introduced is pretty unique and easy to pick up, but challenging to master. The game throws things at you that might take you 2 or 3 times to get right, but aren't annoyingly difficult. You can tell a lot of heart went into this game. It knows what it is, it isn't pretentious and it isn't overhyped. It's just fun. The story is fairly intriguing, but don't expect Bioshock Infiniate or something."
10531,"I yelled ""F***ING B***H"" like 100 times as I fell to my death. Occasionally greets you with difficult challenges you rarely see in games anymore. Had a real sense of accomplishment when I overcame the challenges.

10/10, would scream obscenities while falling again."
10532,"This game is absolutely amazing!
It has good gameplay but what made me feel like this game was awsome was the story, the visuals and the music. Those 3 elements add up to a pleasant and relaxing experience.
Can¬¥t recommend this game enough but would advise to buy on sale because the storyline is rather short.
Finished this game in under 2 hours, still not refunding it."
10533,"9,5/10. this is such a good title, i mean i have no words, i screamed and cursed and wanted to find the person responsible for THAT ONE SNOWY ARENA I GOT STUCK ON FOR A WEEK OR SO but it's so worth it. the story is super cute, all the references left by the authors made me chuckle a couple of times, the visuals are stunning (i must admit, i made so many screenshots i should feel ashamed). and DAMN the gameplay!!! it's interesting, it's intuitive and incredibly colorful!!
i bought the game thinking it's a simple independent little thing but the game was huge and well-done. its only problem? it's kinda short. the game was so fun to play, i literally got mad when it ended :')"
10534,"I don't like platformers in general so I decided I might try this as it has such great reviews. No, never again. I learned my lesson.

However, if you like platformers with shoddy controls and repeating things over and over again this might be your game. I stopped at the falling cubes section. What a waste of time to even get that far to be slapped in the face with that. I might break something if I try it again so it's better so call it quits. I don't like leaving games unfinished, but I'll just have to deal with it this time.

Visually the game is quite pleasing."
10535,"The game is fun, but it's verry short - about 3 hours - not worth the asking price of 12,99 Euro. Buy on sale or not at all."
10536,"Great game has a good story, fun mechanics. The only bad thing is it lacks content however I HIGHLY recommend buying this game if its on sale."
10537,"A great story, I have recommended it to many people. A great gem."
10538,"really good game to say the least but the storyline is a bit too short and after u complete the story all there is to do is time trials which is basically the same as the story but the best time. i would recommend this game to anyone

pros
great storyline
great voice acting
fun gameplay mechanics

cons
storyline too short
lack of content
price tag"

10540,"i was playing this game expecting it to bea joke game like goat sim since it wasmade by coffeestain. and with aname like ""story of my uncle"" i wasexpecting it to be about that onestereotypical uncle your not suppoed to be around. but NO it wasnt about that at all it was such a good game i had such ablast playing it! i highly recommend it!"
10541,"I really wanted to like this game. Everything looks amazing and gives you a sense of wonder as you explore the story. 

But after the first two hours, it became so frustrating that I lost all interest. All the various floating platforms you grapple to/from and their scenery look the same and due to the darkness it's difficult to tell where you are trying to go. The grappling hook mechanic is fun at first but quickly becomes frustrating trying to get the perfect shots so you don't restart at the checkpoint that's too far back and slow to load. The most annoying part about grappling is the awful collision detection so if your grapple makes it, but leaves you hanging off the side of some structure even just a little, then you'll inevitably fall. There's a type of flower that you can grapple (acts more like a gun in this case) to light up the area, but you need to have the perfect shot dead center - and if you miss, odds are it'll grapple something else which makes you fly to your death. Also, it often seems like some shots are definitely within range but you're forced to go through what seems like the intended route of obstactles. I really wanted to finsh it but, as soon as I'd reach a part where I'm just dying tens of times, I'd reconsider and eventually uninstalled.

UPDATE:
I ended up watching a youtube video of the ending since I still wanted to see what happens despite not wanting to finish the game myself. The beginning story had an interesting build-up that made me very curious to still see how it ends. And wow, thankfully I quit this game because it was the worst, most anti-climatic, explains-nothing ending I've ever seen in a game... it was absolutely horrible and it made me wish I didn't stick with it as long as I did before quitting."
10542,"This is one of of the best games I have ever bought on steam, the story of this game is one of the best things I have ever played, I would definatly buy this game."
10543,This is a nice game and fills out few hours of your time with a briliant adventure. the game play is well-designed and relaxed. it worth a night or two of your time and the story is not super long.
10544,"Normally the idea of a ""1st person platformer"" should fill most gamers with horror, but [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] manages to make it not as unpleasant as it sounds. But it's still not good.

The gameplay is simple: Think 1st Person Bionic Commando. You will Jump from platform to platform, using a grappling hook to swing or catapult your character onto various floating platforms to progress through the level. You are restricted to using the grapple once, twice, or thrice as you progress. And... that's it. You gain an ability to ‚Äî for lack of a better word ‚Äî ""double jump"" as well but it only adds just a little more to the experience.

This sort of mechanic can be fun, but not in the challenges they've constructed. This is the kind of thing I can see working well in an open world style game, like some of the older Spiderman games. But alone it gets repetitive. They try to keep things interesting by changing scenery, adding moving obstacles, but you're still just jumping from platform to platform. There are only rare moments where combining a series of swings and mid air jumps has that satisfying ""Nailed it!"" feeling.

It's not particularly challenging, and when it is challenging it does so in unfair ways. For example, some surfaces you can grapple, and some you can't. The graphical quality is so poor, and environments so dark you'll have a hard time guessing what you can latch on to and what you can't. Later in the game you'll be able to ""recharge"" your grapple mid air by clicking on Blue Crystals. But the hit box is so narrow you'll miss clicking it completely and plunge to your death as you accidentally use your last grapple charge on a piece of rock instead of the Blue Crystal.

One of the most frustrating parts is when your grapple is just out of range of your intended target and you will frantically click on the surface in question so you can just grab it before it falls away from you again, only to find you've quickly expended 2-3 charges on one surface. Understandably some of the above are 'skill based' problems. That maybe so, but it's also not very fun.

Graphically the game is something roughly equivalent to Xbox and Xbox 360 hardware. It's very dated with lots of polygons. Environments generally features lots of contrast, but are also too dark even on recommended brightness setting.

There is some kind of story here, but it's really all a McGuffin. The whole idea of the game is you're chasing after your Uncle. Why? It's not really explained. The narrator's blasse tone has all the suspense of an airport announcer. 

With 3 strikes in gameplay, story, and presentation I can't recommend this game."
10545,a short story game really fun and challenging achievements and gameplay worth your time
10546,"Has very nice visuals, and the story is quite interesting. The game play is around 2-3 hours depending on how fast you clear the obstacles. 

If you are just going to play this game once then maybe wait for a sale, but if you are the type that likes to do speed runs, this game might be worth the full price."
10547,Amaze
10548,"This is a beautiful well made game and I highly recomend you play this. emotional, fantastically sweet storyline as your playing throughout. Graphics are quitely nice as you can see for yourself above in demo. Mechanics are smooth. Don't want to spoil the storyline but at the games description gives you the basis.

The game is short but thats what I exspected when I read the reviews before I purchased. Some people may find it a flaw for it being short but I wouldn't give it a negative because of that. Steam has special deals from time to time and thats when I took the oppritunity to get this game."
10549,Short but intense.
10550,This game is very enjoyable and addicting but the story is too short. the ending is incredibly good its so beautiful and emotional
10551,Pretty good game. The ending is a bit of a let down tho.
10552,"A Story About My Uncle was a game recommended to me by a close friend, he claims I would NOT regret buying it. True to his words, I can say with certain that this game is among the best I've ever played.

The basic plot and concept was great, maintaining a great balance tempo - wise, and remained very engaging. Each section brought in new content, new objects to help you swing across the world without losing your interest. Each new setting brought in it's own solicitude and challenges, while at the same time, rewarding and satisfying at the conclusion of each. Each grapple, each swing elicits the euphoric of of excitement, feeling wild when moving platform to platform as you progress through the game - not to mention the beauty in balance of the ending. *wink wink*

Overall, this game is definitely worth your time and money, though I would recommend making the transaction during a sales event. The theme and mood is incomparable.

9/10, and I'd love to rename myself IGN for this."
10553,"A really good game.  Amazing graphics which were able to run even on my bad computer and a really cool story.  There are a few problems though.  The story is really short.  If you a preaty bad at the game and fail a lot it is still only about 5 hours of play time.  The only thing left is the time trials which is the same missions just rying to get a better time.  The contols are a bit wonky at first but you will get used to them.(i recommend turning down your sencitivity.  The levels are gorgious, difficult and very clever all at the same time.  If you are willing to spend the 12 dollars then this is an amzing gem that you should definatly get.  And even if you arnt willing to buy it for 12 dolloars it is such a short game with little to no replayablity that you could just refund it.

9/10 Would get lost in the ice cave again."
10554,"Wow, what an awesome little game. Finished it in around 3 hours getting stuck along the way at certain points. It's a fun, challenging and solid platformer. Story is intruiging that makes you want to go on and find out more. I can't flaw it."
10555,"What a little gem of a game. Its beautiful, fun and harmless (im sick to death of every game revolving around tearing the heads of as many zombies as possible). 

Voice acting is average, but it doesnt detract from the game, it has a real charm.

More please!

Ive read its only a few hours in length, so bear that in mind...."
10556,Really Good game for its price
10557,"Great game, the story is amazing and game graphic is beautiful. I really enjoyed the game."
10558,"There is nothing special in this game. The story is nah, game mechanics is common, grappling hook and Rocket Booster are nothing new.

BUT

The gameplay is fun and the control is smooth. I still highly recommend it. It is one of the most decent 1st person platform game that I've seen/played."
10559,Good game. Frustrating at times (for me at least). Get it on sale and you'll be set.
10560,"I was gifted this game forever ago and I saw my friend play it. I thought for sure it was just a dumb platformer you know cheap time killer. After I started this game I fell in love with the story, Although im dissapointed on how easy and short it was I loved the story the art the levels and the voice acting. Like others said prob not worth full price but deff a game worth buying. 10/10 game."
10561,"Bought it on sale. 

Short and sweet. 

Like a bar of chocolate."
10562,"So, I just got done playing this and I have to say, it's a fun little game. It's got OK graphics with some impressive views. Audio and voice-acting are not spectacular, but there's nothing to complain about either.

The story, sadly short as it may be, is quite charming in a minimalistic kind of way. There's no deep plot or lore, but it caught my interest anyway.

Overall, I spent a pleasant 2.8 hours on this. If the game is on sale, I recommend giving it a whirl. If not, it's a bit too short to justify spending 12,99‚Ç¨ on it."
10563,Looks nice
10564,"A very fun game with intresting mechanics, a bit short for my taste.
But i do recommend it!"
10565,Sad Ending
10566,"The best game ever . 10/10
Story is awesome . 
Everything is awesome .

I did cry at the end of game .. 
"
10567,"Short? Yes. But still it was a great experience playing this game. Somehow reminded me with Portal, I don't know why. And will I play this game again? Yep. There's still several unlockables I haven't got yet."
10568,shorter then leafy's popularity
10569,"The gameplay and visuals of this game are very nice. Grappling things and jumping around never got old, partly due to good map design that stayed interesting throughout the whole game. It helped that there were a lot of checkpoints in this game, so it never made you re-do things you had already done before.

However, while some others praise the voice acting, that was actually my least favorite thing about the game. While I didn't dislike the story, the voice acting was so annoying to me that I thought about simply turning it off. The only reason I didn't is because some things happen in the game where you need to hear him explain the situation to know what's going on. I honestly believe that the main voice actor doesn't know English as a first language, since native English speakers just don't talk like he does. It sounded like he was reading off of a piece of paper, without understanding how sentance structure works. Some of the lines even had blatant grammar errors that I honestly cannot believe the devs didn't catch. It didn't sound natural at all.

Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience with this game. This is an excellent platformer with fantastic visuals and a great original gameplay mechanic, and it runs really well even on medium/low end systems. I just wish the main voice actor spoke his lines better than he did, then this game would have been pretty much perfect."
10570,RIP Uncle Gregg
10571,"I had actually given up on it for about a year and just recently picked it back up and completed it. I really enjoyed this for what it was. The voice acting was superb. Graphics and design of levels were very amazing. Loved it! The mechanics were so much fun to play with as they evolved. 

Graphics 5/5
Level design 5/5
Sound 5/5
Gameplay 4/5 - it has some tough spots that are sort of glitchy.
Story 5/5

Overall 5/5. Great story. Fun gameplay mechanics. Looks great. Sounds AMAZING. For the $5 or less it is very worth it."
10572,"A stunningly intimate tale with engaging, addictive gameplay as its core focus. The adventure is what you are doing and not the story itself, but the narrative is beauitfully wound. The ending fits the story perfectly and there is real meaning in the relationships we develop throughout. They are organic and not forced. Even on low graphics settings the game looks beautiful and the soundtrack is subtle enough such as to match the aesthetics seamlessly. I want more from this team and I want it now!"
10573,"wow, just wow. The game is just amazing. when I finished the game i was so sad...

I totally recomend it"
10574,"Completed in it 2.5 hours, if I didnt idle that 45 minutes I could've refunded it. Why? The story is amazing, but really short, and after that there's just time trials, so nothing to do. With that said, buy it on sale, sale ONLY. 5/7."
10575,"Amazing game, really touching!"
10576,"A short but wonderfull journey into a beatifully rendered world. I wouldn't buy the game at full price though as it took me 2(ish) hours to complete. A maybe at full price, but a definite on sale (I got it for $2.75)"
10577,"Leafy's simple review - #14 (touching game!)

Love this game but felt it was a little under-polished with the animations. Yet the narrative in general is emotionally charged. The feeling of 'flying' through the sky is magnificent and for a moment, you really do feel alive in moments of isolation - play until the end...and figure out the damn message it's telling you!
"
10578,"AMAZING!!!! The only downside was the ending, manly because it was not impactful, there was no twist, no nothing. 0% memorable. The adventure is 100% amazing.

Perhaps for replaying value, they could have added a lopping ending, where the plantaform stays the same, but charathers and such a little older and the story could have progressed like that. Just my 2 cents. Perhaps an adventure witht he daughter on your back...."
10579,A very nice unique atmospheric game. Would like to see more games like this or maybe a sequel to the first! Definitely recommend getting this game.
10580,"HAHAHA AMAZING GAMEPLAY SO FUN! JUST GET IT! also. the memes are real!!! potential spoiler [spoiler]""With these new boots, the suit felt at lest 20 percent cooler!""[spoiler] hahaha great game! the most rage part so far is when potential spoiler [spoiler]maddie gives you a challenge to not use grapple (which is optional but gives you an achievment)[spoiler]"
10581,"Great Game, has a lot of challenges when your new to the game, your always wondering if your going the right way, I bought it while it was on sale, and im so glad i did. Such an amazing game."
10582,"This game is amazing, I love everything about it.
The story is great, the graphics are great, the music and the enviornment are great aswell. The storytelling is amazing too, I'm not playing it for long but it's amazing.

You need to play this game, it's a piece you need to have in your soul."
10583,"This is an amazing game! For a short game, it has a lot to offer. The music is enchanting, and made me wabt ton look at the atmosphere, while listening to it. The atmosphere is also amazing, it's bright, beautiful, and overall looks really well. The voice acting also sounds like it was from a triple A game. The puzzle are also unique and crazy in it's own way. They don't feel overused what so ever, and is a cool expirence. I would totally recommend this game!"
10584,"It is a fun game, but short. It went by too quickly and can probably be done in 3 hours or less, idk what the fastest time is. I would like to see more levels and maybe a free roam mode. Needs more gameplay to be worth the $12.99, in my opinion. Overall I recomend it, if you can get it on sale.

Pros: 
fun gameplay
nice looking maps
good challenges

Cons:
interesting physics. They seemed to change often. One minute I can hook onto something far away, next I can't. That sort of thing.
Short story with only time trials as extra ""gameplay"".
Only 4 (I think, I only looked once) extras that slightly change gameplay.

Neutral:
Bugs and glitches. I say neutral because I used them to my advantage and liked that. lol"
10585,The gameplay and the atmosphere of the game are in a perfect mix in my opinion and also the checkpoint-system is very great.
10586,"an amazing game full of mystery but it would be better with a longer story or multyplayer or steam workshop so if you can please add them
"
10587,"Very gripping story, unique gameplay.

All in all great game."
10588,"A very good game with a great story :o
"
10589,"pros:
amazing gameplay
amazing story
level select to replay your favorite parts
autosave
lovable characters
game looks amazing
low system requirements
con:
short story (i finished it in one night)
last level gets a little repetitive

wait for it to go on sale"
10590,Shoutout to leafyishere for helping me discover this game
10591,"I was gifted this game, but was about to buy it on the sale. This game would have been worth the full price. It's a great story and it's gorgeous. Also it has frog-people."
10592,"Truely a great game, especially for the cheap price. 10/10"
10593,"Parkour, but with grappling hooks, rockets, frogs-humans and more.
It's a very short game though, I encourage other to only buy it on sales."
10594,"I completed the game and its awesome (Beautiful Graphics,Amazing powers and good story) if you think to buy it or not im sure you need to buy it!"
10595,"Story is unbelieveably cool, but thegame ends quickly. You can have so much fun with the grapple hook and the suit, but justfor 5 hours of gameplay. If you found a deal for this game, don't think again, buy it!"
10596,"A nice little game - the perfect length, if it was any longer it would've gotten boring"
10597,"Immensely enjoyable game for the gameplay alone. Finished it in one sitting

The world is well designed and the platforming is super fun. The physics are quite easy to learn and only one level felt like a real chore to get through. You'll have a fun time exploring the world.

The only downside is that the story is not the most engaging. It was hard to feel any sort of a connection with the characters and had this been a 10+ hour game there is no way I would have finished it"
10598,"[h1]Best Screenshot-taking simulator![/h1]

10/10 GOTY, would F12 again"
10599,Yes
10600,"this game is absolutely awesome! the timetrials are superfun and the story isn't the worst either. i got this in a steam sale for 2.50.- wich is a great deal for this game. but play it, it's absolutely awesome."
10601,"My experience with ""A story about my uncle"" was a good one. It brought in new mechanics I personally have not seen in any other games or used in this fashion. This also fits well with the sweet but simple story line of the game. I would recommend it to others, But with a pinch of salt. If your wishing for replay ability there are achievements that you can go back for. Sadly the storyline's simplicity causes it to be one stop shop if the game does not fully hook you."
10602,"Good game, recommended to buy on 80% sale Like I did. I do not recommend to buy this on full price."
10603,I love it so much the game it is just wow.
10604,This was one of the best games i've ever played. I only found 1 glitch through the whole playthrough. Great short game
10605,"This game is almost like half life/portal. It was great back then and is still great now, I would 100% recommend this game to you if you want a simple parkour game with amazing graphics and a awesome story."
10606,Hey guys... Leafy here
10607,Simply 10/10 .
10608,I LOVED IT
10609,"Very nice, it is truly a fantastical story. Took 2+ hours to finish the story but with more to unlock."
10610,"+Beautiful graphics
+Outstaning voice acting
+Immersive story
+Grappling hook
-Short Story (~2hrs)

Wait for it to go on sale, I got it for 80% off."
10611,"Such an amazing game! Bought this on sale and had a blast, even though it has only about 2 hours of gameplay it is completely worth it as I plan on speedrunning it once I have some free time. A game with an amazing story and puzzles, I love the gameplay! 
I totally recommend you buying this game while it is on sale, for the full price I don't know."
10612,"The game is fun, I didn't really think the voice acting was as great as people say and the story/drama is a little forced, but it's worth it if you get it on sale :)"
10613,"This game is beautiful. Great voice acting, and fun gameplay. Don't buy for 10 bucks, wait for it to go on sale. I got it for 2.50, and definitely got my money's worth. gg would play again 10/10."
10614,"Great game
Though the main story is extremely short, it was still an amazing adventure, and a story you could get invested in. I would recomend this game to anyone that loves a good story and parkour games.
Great game devs, the character models looked great, good voice actors and beautiful level/map design.

I don't know if it's worth spending $10 on, but I got it for $2 which is worth it. Definitely buy if it is on sale!

Also I saw this game in a leafy video, just thought I should say where I found it."
10615,"Awesome game
pros:
-Voice acting
-Characters
-Environment
-Music

cons:
-Graphics (but hey, you can't beat the sale for $2.59)
-Just a few rare bugs (glitching in structures in far corner of maps)
-In my opinion, I liked the ending but it seemed fairly shallow
-Dang it, Fred

10/10 would rocket boots again
"
10616,Great story. I played it all through in one sitting and I wish there was more to play!
10617,Leafy brought me here
10618,"Breathtaking! Great views, voices, music, movement. Only drawback is it is short."
10619,Best game ever.
10620,"Woow, this game is great! only a little short though but the story is very very good!"
10621,"A charming little game, with decent graphics (although the character models are a tad sketchy), a nice story (with good naration), and well rounded gameplay. Although the game itself is good, there isn't much in the way of content, and to complete the story it only takes 2-3 hours, but you can replay the levels in time trial if you're into that (as you can see due to my hours on record, that's not really my thing). 

To round this off, I'd reccomend the game if you're looking for nice story to satisfy you for a few hours, and some mirror's edge-esk time trials, but I'd wait until it's on sale if you're not about the time trial modes simply due to how short it is."
10622,"gameplay - 8/10
graphics texture quality - 5/10
artwork - 9/10
immersive experience - 9.5/10 
feels - 11/10
[spoiler] Hallucination - 5/7 [/spoiler] 

on offer or not, get it."
10623,"I love this game so much, the only thing i wish they would add is extra stuff because after you beat the game (which i have) there is nothing left to do exept time trials and replay the story. 9.5/10"
10624,"Very nice open game , hotly recommend it every cent is worth it !"
10625,This game has a very good gameplay and the story is outof this world... This game is packed with cliffhangers and it is worth every penny
10626,This is a beautiful mind-bending game.
10627,A beautiful short game with captivating environments and short travesrsive fun puzzles
10628,This game is great i am writing it because i just finished it and I enyojed it very much i reccomendit to anyone. Also this game has a hreat story.
10629,"Looking through the store hungry for an indie game that would satisfy my needs. I came across this game and thought ""Might as well"".

Upon entering this game, I was fully immersed with the gameplay and reminded me that graphics arent everything to a game. The puzzles had, in my opinion, the perfect level of difficulty where you will fail but it doesnt off-put you and make you give up.

I was mildly disappointed by the ending; the ending all seemed a bit rushed. I hope that there would be a way to redeem themselves by maybe a sequel or DLC's that will keep me gripped to this amazing game."
10630,"One of my all-time favorite games ever. It's not something you would play over and over again, however everytime I think back about it, it makes me happy for some reason. The stellar gameplay and beautiful art-style makes up for kind of a simple, yet heart touching story."
10631,Amazing game and story! 11/10
10632,A fun game with a great soundtrack! not sure if it is worth full price but you should definately pick it up if it is on a sale.
10633,"So the game is really neet, bought it yesterday in the steam sale and sadly.. Already finished it. It's a short game but really enjoyable. I would definitely recomend it if you like platformers. Hope there will be a sequel once. So the pros and cons?

+ Astonishing art desing
+ Cute story
+ Satisfying af
+ Good controls and smooth movement (On keybord)
+ A quick short reference to Game of Thrones in the game 
+ You finish it so quickly that you mostlikely can refund it after ;)
+ There is a ''Time trial'' mode

- Really short
- Story ends a bit weird but i kinda liked it to be honest
- The full price may be a little bit too much for such a short game

Overal, if it's on sale: BUY IT. if it isn't: Still buy it and play through the story, you'll probably be done before the 4 hours refund mark.

8/10 - Trump Approves"
10634,Nice experience with decent replay value. Short and sweet.
10635,Really good game good story but its a very short game
10636,This game is amazing. The graphics are very good and the story is very well done. It is abit short but still very well done. The mechanics are well done and each level gives you a good challenge. I do not think it is really worth the full price due to the fact that it only has story mode and time trials. If the developers incorperated a way for users to create and share levels this game would be terrefic. Still 9/10
10637,hey thats pretty good
10638,"Nice game,discovered it watching Leafy.
I would give a 10 for Story
I would give a 8 for Gameplay,because you can rage a lot from failing lol
 Overall 9/10
"
10639,this game is legit fun as fuck
10640,"Really enjoyed this game! It had a great story to it, the only problem with this game is that it's too short but other than that it's a good game :)

8/10"
10641,es is very good game to relax from league that is cancer framkallande 10/10
10642,"First off, I would like to say this game has an amazing story. Easy to follow, understand and relate too but fun, interesting and tests your parkour skills. I would recommend this game and I am sure you will have a great time playing it!"
10643,This was such a good game!! Loved the story in it
10644,difficult game but i like the story to it
10645,"like csgo surf without guns and its also nothing like surfing


Honestly a great game though."
10646,This game is fantastic. It's an absolute thrill to play. Highly reccomend. Well worth the money.
10647,A very beautiful game! I love it
10648,great story good solid game play if you have a few hours to kill this game will do the job
10649,"Great game, short, but fun thanks to the cyberbully for showing me this game"
10650,"This was just an amazing game, I loved the gameplay from the start, it felt fast and clean...I did not care for the sotry at the begining but by the end i loved it, I would highly reccomend this game, Its short but sweet"
10651,"fun, gorgeous game. lovin the voice acting. almost better than prono commentaries"
10652,"Awesome game and amazing graphics.  Bought it for ¬£2 while on sale, would reccomend!
The only problem is that it gets incredibly difficult during the end and you will die 50-60 times on the last chapter."
10653,"This game is awesome, but unfortunately too short."
10654,This is an amazing game. Great for casual gamers who like adventure. Unique gameplay and good story. Difficult to get used to controls at first but after a while it becomes easier. I would recomend this game to any casual gamer for the laid back feel of the game or even competetive gamer for the time trial mode to challenge friends to beat your time. All in all it's an amazing game and definitely worth getting and putting time into.
10655,"Great experience. Good balance of gameplay - not always super obvious and easy, a few small challenges, but straightforward. 3 hour story, haven't looked at unlockables / time trials yet."
10656,"This game is amazing and definately worth it, even when paying full price.

The mechanics are simple to grasp, the controls are solid, the puzzles challenging but fair, the characters lovable, and the graphics and sounds are superb. I feel incredibly immersed in this game and have thoroughly enjoyed it.

It is a short game and there isn't much replay value, however, it was a great experience. I can feel that the developers have truely put a lot of heart and soul into it. It feels more like a labour of love, rather than a commercial game."
10657,"A good, short, and pretty good story game, the game lasts about 1 hour and 30 minutes."
10658,cool game i like it so much and its cost only 12$! amazing game
10659,"Very short story, played through it in 2 hours. Other than that it was an amazing game! I'm not usually one to care much for story but this one was very compelling. The gameplay is really fun and the game is very pretty."
10660,"A beautiful game with an amazing, sweet story.
Would highly recommend you play it."
10661,one of the best games i have ever played 10/10 needs a more gameplay maybe a dlc
10662,"I finished the game in about 3 hours, but it was totally worth it. The story is lacking, but the gameplay certainly makes up for it. Once you've finished the game, you can still do the time trials, which is my favorite thing to do."
10663,Grate Game!
10664,"+Beautiful
+Good voice
+Awesome story
-Gameplay is short
"
10665,for 2 dollars u cant go wrong
10666,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
A fantastic first-person plaformer. If you liked Mirror's Edge and Cloudbuilt, you'd love this game.

[h1]Jujitsu Simulator[/h1]
This game is essentially a jujitsu simulator cause it's all about grappling. This is a fantastic first-person platformer. Unlike most other platformer that emphasize, well, the platforms, A Story About My Uncle is a platformer that emphasizes aerial movement. Your character's primary method of getting around involves grappling onto floating and moving objects and getting swinging incredible distances.

And what really stands out about this game is the ability to play as you want. There aren't many artificial restrictions (invisible walls) and there are multiple ways to solve a challenge. If you want to try a crazy way to get over an obstacle, the game encourages it and doesn't punish you (infinite lives, checkpoints everywhere so you don't lose progress). Instead of feeling like you're following a line on the ground, it really makes you feel like you're exploring a world.

A bonus for this game is it's imersiveness. At one point, I fell off a location high up off the ground and I actually got cold sweats cause I felt like I was actually falling. I'd love to see this game in VR as it would be quite the experience.

[h1]Breakdown[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[olist]
    [*][b]Tight gameplay.[/b] The game introduces the mechanics early and sticks to it. No gimmicks here. The one upgrade you get (rocket boots) is incredibly impactful and absolutely required to pass the later levels.
    [*][b]Good world-building.[/b] Even though the game is only 4 levels, you get a really good sense of the world around you. The first time you walk out of the tight cramped caves and see Star Haven is quite the moment.
[/olist]
[b]Cons[/b]
[olist]
    [*][b]Unskippable cutscenes.[/b] Unfortunately, a bunch of the long cutscenes in the game are unskippable.
    [*][b]Unrewarding unlockables.[/b] Aside from the first unlockable, which allows you to change the color of your grapple, all the other unlockables actually make the game harder to play, so you don't really end up using them, ever. And considering how difficult it is to unlock everything, I really wished they were a bit more rewarding.
[/olist]
[b]Score[/b]: 9.2/10"
10667,This game was pretty good in my opinion..............I feel like it has enough room for a part 2! If it did I would definally buy it
10668,This game is very good but the depressing thing is that the story is very short which is sad because the game is great fun and great story too. I reccomend this game but all it needs is an update to make the game longer.
10669,"This game, from the perspective of a console gamer, is something truly meant for PC. The games dynamics shine throughout the entire game with the grappling mechanic. While I can't say there is much substance to the story and I feel like it could've been fleshed out to exceed a couple of hours, I feel as though the gameplay is able to make up for the lack of story. If the games was longer, I would say this game is nearly perfect, but sadly, it's a bit short. In the end, you probably shoud not buy this game for it's retail price; get it while it's on sale, because $15 dollars is not worth it in my opinion. Overall, this game exceeded my expectations with it's gorgeous visuals and gameplay, and it's well worth your time if you buy it on sale."
10670,"Excellent game art, good story.

The physics and the control makes me rage very often. Still not sure if I will ever be able to finish the game.

I can recommend it for people who are searching for this kind of challenge. 
I can't recommend it for people who rather want to have logic challenges or some kind of interactive story."
10671,I fucking loved it i'm sad that the story is a bit short but at least there is the time trial option which is nice i bought it for 2.79 in sale and i really recommend it!
10672,"It's pretty cute game , short but enjoyable."
10673,it has a really good story.
10674,"Simply beautiful.

As someone who wants to create games as a hobby this game is an inspiration to level design."
10675,Amazing
10676,"Epic game ! Great story and gameplay. Sadly its a little bit short. 
But i give 10/10 for this masterpiece. Totally recommended for you.

Steam Workshop would be cool. When people could create their own parcours."
10677,I bought it for 2.50. Easily worth $8 just for the quality of the short 3 hours.
10678,"+Story
+Voice Acting
+Atmosphere
+Soundtrack
+Feel
++Breaking Bad Sticky note

-Story length"
10679,"Amazing game, a very interesting story combined with an innovative and incredibly fun movement system / gameplay ! A must-play title !"
10680,"This is a short game with not the best story ever, but it's still great!"
10681,Buy this game if you love the challenge of jumping from one rock to another over and over again. Not my kinda game.
10682,"A nice game with a good difficulty curve, with the last few sequences being quite challenging. I haven't played many first person platformer games but in terms of gameplay this is definitely one of the better ones in my library. I also really liked the attention to detail in the environments and the variety of locations.

My only complaint would be that it was a bit on the short side (4 hours), although for the price and quality I would say it is value for money if you enjoy platformer games. There are time trials, hidden objects, achievement challenges etc. to extend it's replayability if you like that sort of thing, but personally I'm a one-playthrough kind of player.

8/10"
10683,Short but great!
10684,"Bought it when it was 80% off, loving this game, achievements may be hard but fun to try to complete. Its on sale quite often so better to wait for sale than to get for full price."
10685,"Amazing game,Though the ending dissapointed me and made me shed a few tears"
10686,"Wow... Just wow... This game may be short and have some areas that make you want to rip your hair out, but the story alone is well worth all of it... Just simply beautiful!!!"
10687,Extremly good story line well worth the 10 pounds
10688,The ending fucked me emotionally 10/10.
10689,This game is for you if you enjoy games such as Portal. This game requires lots of patience and critical thinking. Unfortunately I'm not a fan.
10690,I absolutely love this game. I purchased it on sale for ~$2 and I have never regretted it. High action and an amazing replay value I would love if they could make a 2nd installment. With this we go to the storyline. The story behind this game really compliments the game. With this said you can still play the game if you chose to ignore the story. Personally I bought this game because I liked the gameplay but I fell in love with the storyline so much show that I nearly cried at the end. I Highly recommend this to anybody who is interested.
10691,"I don't know how other people could complete this game within 2 or 3 hours at the first time, I took really a long time It was not untill chapter 4 that I changed from using my laptop's touchpad to a mouse. I had some problem with the windmill.The last 2 challenge in ice cave killed me.

Keypoint for control: If you find it seems impossible to reach the target, try press w while you're flying. It provides a litter bit extra power which is crucial."
10692,3/10 Freakin' brony meme reference
10693,9.51/10 Great game
10694,This game was great! I beat it in 96 minutes and then got a full refund for it because I beat it in under 2 hours!
10695,This game had a wonderfull story and you cant beat the price at 2.50
10696,Short game but still fun :D
10697,This game is like playing a movie. I was captivated from start till finish. Amazing game all around 10/10.
10698,Great game 10/10 for everything. Insane graphics and great story line. Definitely recommend
10699,"This is a very nice game to play, good voice acting. Suits the characters well. The level design is very good and visually the game is great! :D 
I got this for sale on ¬£2, for that price it is an absolute steal!!! At full price, I still feel it is definitely worth it !"
10700,Amazing game great design amazing landscape the best parkour game I have ever played and a amazing narrator
10701,"I received this game in a humble bundle. This game has amazing sound effects, voice acting, and amazing graphics, that overall leads to an amazing atmosphere. The story is quite short but the whole experience of the game is beautiful and you can spend some time looking for the collectibles and appreciating the atmosphere. Mechanics are smooth and it's not too easy of a game. Definitely recommend buying it when it is on sale since it is a very short game and doesn't feel like it's worth $13."
10702,"Great fun, would definitely recommend"
10703,Short little game with a nice story and fun yet challenging gameplay. Just sit down with a coke and play this for about an hour and a half. If your looking for a long game this is not for you
10704,"Great entertaining game, would recommend."
10705,"This is probably the best game I have ever played, it almost made me cry. If you want a game with a surreal but creative and amazing story, this is the game for you. 10/10, I simply just love it"
10706,"Excellent game. Took me about 2 hours to finish, but I still enjoyed it. The gameplay is very good, I really enjoyed the graplle. The story isn't perfect, but it's still very good. I got it on sale for $2. I don't think it's worth $15 though."
10707,"The game is a little to short (First time playing around 3 hours) but the game has alot of replay material.

You can speedrun it 
Complete time trails 
Or just enjoy the pretty view :)

Good game 8.5/10
"
10708,Amazing.
10709,"Hissssssssssss. Jk, leafy is a faggot."
10710,Really liked it.. It's such a shame that it is soo short.. You can play this game listening to the most relaxing music you like to hear... I do totally recommend it.. But if you don't like short games well.. This is one of those.. Of course you have the option to re play all the levels in a time attack game mode after you finish.. And there are also some cool unlockables
10711,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It takes a unique concept and completely kills it within 2-3 hours. It's a must buy on sale.
"
10712,"good story, really fun, sometimes hard to figure out where to go and short. its really good, if i had to give it a rating a rate 8/10 cause it took me 3 hours just to go through the game normally.i like the scenery because it just looks beautiful
"
10713,Its soo good. Found my uncle at the end. He diddled me :(
10714,makes me want to bully people on Youtube
10715,This is a fantastic game with a great story and beautiful visuals the only thing that could make it better would be an option to play fan made maps in a comunnity option allowing for limitless fun.
10716,"Platformer? Sounds alright.
Platformer involving a laser grappling hook? Sounds great!
All in all this game was very enjoyable though way too short. I picked it up on sale for $2.60 which is a bit less that I'd expect to pay for a game of this quality. That being said the normal price is $13 is a bit too much for a game this short and that's probably it's biggest downside. The story is fairly simple but still very cute and the voice acting is better than you'd expect. There were a few nice references but I have to dock points for the my little pony one. Even still it's definitely something you should pick up, just not at full price. I'd give it a solid 7/10, it's very high quality for an indie game. Some things that could be done to make it better though is maybe just add more content (not paid content) to justify the game's regular price. Maybe something like a return to frog land or the ability to create your own puzzles and share them."
10717,"This game is absolutely beautiful.
It has an heartwarming story, awesome level design, simple, yet perfectly fitting game mechanics, and is totally worth it, despite being only ~3 hours long on a standard playthrough."
10718,"I bought the game for ¬£1.99 on sale and I had great fun. The story was amazing and although it was short and silmple, I still loved it. The game took me under 3 hours to complete so if you're looking for a long game then this isnt for you. Is it worth ¬£1.99? definitely. But ¬£9.99? the game is far too short to be priced at that in my opinion. I would highly recommend this game but I would wait until its on sale as I dont believe that full price is worth it"
10719,"The game is really awesome for a platformer. It's a bit short tho.
The level design is good, the decors are wonderful.
The only cons is the story who could be better
I'ld rate this 7/10"
10720,"Game has an unfinished environment past the first few levels with npcs that literally aren't moving, but are positioned in ways that would indicate they are alive. I kept going because I thought it would be part of the storyline but it wasn't. The platforming mechanics are a little one dimensional. There is a game grumps episode where they showcase the game up to just before the unfinished part I mentioned, and that smells fishy to me."
10721,"Really Good Story 
Fun Game 
Beat The Game In 3 Hours Tho"
10722,"This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. The story wa great and very intriguing, but there were times where I was really bored. I would not reccomend playing this game in one sitting you will most likely get frustrated and bored. Overall the concept and gameplay are amazing. I would rate it 8/10, I probably woul;d only paly it again to find all of the collectables, but others this game is great."
10723,"...

the best $2 I've ever spent!

BUY THIS BEFORE IT GOES OFF SALE!!"
10724,"Its actuallly quite a good game, its a pretty cool 3-D platformer with around a 2 hour average storyline (nothing brilliant). 

However it is frequently on sale for $2.49 so if its on sale its always worth a try. Also you can play up to 2 hours before refunding so playing about an hour can give you an idea of whether you want to keep trying or not."
10725,"I have finsihed this game in around 2.4 hours and i loved it, i really recomend t for the story and the gameplay. but i wish it was longer. i recomdend it when its  on sale"
10726,"This game is just mindblowing. Gameplay is unique, very thrilling, and quite challenging. Level design is amazing, as is the general atmosphere within the game. The screenshots and trailers really don't do it justice. In my top-10 of all time. 10/10."
10727,Literally the best indie single player game i've ever played. amazing gameplay awesome story. amazing. The graphics are good and it doesnt even take that good of a pc to run it!
10728,"Absolutely amazing game, great story and a very fluid rope swing/parkour style of gameplay. Took me just over 3hours to complete and is definitely worth picking up while on sale!"
10729,"This game is absolutely stunning and is very atmospheric. It has a unique movement system and is an extremely enjoyable to play.
However I felt that the story was quite short and there is not much to do after completeing the game, other than a level select and time trials."
10730,Nice game .
10731,good game but not worth buying enless its super cheap. super shot game beat it in 2 hours.
10732,"Okay...after 16 minutes i already love this game and the mechanics the way you move around and get through the levels is amazing and unique 9/10 would recomend kek
"
10733,"Great game with unique and stunning graphics which runs surprisingly well on older and less powerful hardware. I can run the game perfectly and a 2 year old 650Ti which I can't say for most games. Although the story is very short, lasting only 2-3 hours, this lack of length is refelected in the low price tag. I would certainly reccommend this game, however do not go in expecting more than 2 or 3 hours of story gameplay."
10734,Amazing. One of the best games I EVER played and i played a lot games.
10735,"Amazing game, I recomend to evryone who like story and adventure games ^^ 10/10"
10736,"I've only played for an hour, but I can tell you this, the game is very very good and worth your money. I cannot tell you more, as it's more exciting for you to find out."
10737,"A short but sweet narrative, a handful of game mechanics that are polished to a sheen, and absolutely breathtaking environments, what's not to love?"
10738,"beautiful game, the gameplay is pretty fun to leap around all the sights. the only thing i hate is how the sprint jump works. you have 0 control of your character after you do it and its made certain things a ton more stressful. other than that the game is an amazing pickup, espically on sale for 80% off."
10739,"As others have said, the story is very short. I'm writing this review the same day I finished the game with 2.9 hours. I really do wish it had more levels because the gameplay is loads of fun. I feel like the mechanics have so much potential and the game only brushed the tip of the iceberg. The only qualms I had with some of the levels is that there are a couple ""leap of faith"" puzzles, where you don't know what you're supposed to do until you jump off a cliff amd die and see the solution on the way down. Overall, the gameplay is great, but it's just a little too short.

Not sure if it's worth the full price, but on sale this is a great buy and loads of fun."
10740,"I really enjoyed this game! It wasn't a difficult platformer, but it let itself be new and innovative with some unique gameplay. Probably my favorite map would be the ice caves, beacuse nothing can beat swignging around like spider-man for long periods of time. Overall, I found the game to be beautiful and calming, and a nice late night game.

Cons
- Short story
- Sub Par animations for the NPCs (but it didnt even matter tbh)
- Lack of replayablility"
10741,10/10 would fall off a cliff again
10742,Short but fun. There are some extremely pretty areas. ^^/
10743,"This is my first review, I can only say that this is a great game. Good gameplay and a awsome story. I recommend this to everyone, you'll love it."
10744,"i like the game. its a really fun and beautiful game. only noticed one problem, the game doesn't seem to save for me. besides that, i love the game and would highly recommend it to anyone who can afford and run it"
10745,"Well, the story was super short imo, beat it in 2 hours. But the story line and gameplay was so good I had to come give it a thumbs up, I don't know if I would shell out the 13 bucks for it, but since I payed $2.59, it was totally worth it. 

Get it while its on sale, you wont regret it."
10746,"9/10

Missing 1 point cause of the short storyline. Otherwise, awesome game! Played it twice."
10747,I purchased this game thinking it would be a good story heavy game instead i got infuriating controls and bad time. 44 minutes in and refunded
10748,Looking at Maddie for too long gives me anxiety.
10749,"It is everything i have hoped for and more, the story was great and the gameplay was fantastic. if you like a relax and fun game. look no further"
10750,This game is awesome. It combines an amazing story with great mechanics and beautiful graphics. I absolutely love it and it is for sure one of my favorite games now!
10751,"Hello Boys & Girls.

If you're wondering on buying this game, you're already one step ahead to your jouney. This is one of the games I will be recommending the highest out of all the games I've played so far. You know when either your mom or your dad tells you the bedtime story? well, this is where you get to experience the story yourself. The Scenery in this game is just beautiful, and you don't need a strong pc for this game! Go ahead and buy the game, you won't regret it!"
10752,"Amazing game! I love the graphics and its so peacfull but challenging at the same time, definitely worth your money ;)"
10753,"Even though I already completed the game in roughly 3 hours, the game still has so much more to explore, like finding the interactables, collectables and trying to complete the time trials and such. Good game, but I would wait until it's on sale."
10754,"Manly Tears 
10/10"
10755,"Amazing game. Beautiful, engaging, challenging, frustrating. Loved every minute."
10756,"Nearly 2hours of excellent story you been told while playing this.. The beauty in this game is just amazing! =)
I wish there was a second part of it, it was just incredible. <3"
10757,"I paid less than $3 for this on sale and it was definitely worth it. I'm not so sure it's worth it's full price tag of $13 based on its short length. 

Otherwise, beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable. I would recommend it, but would also recommend getting it on sale."
10758,If you're one of those people that like puzzle games then I would highly reccomend. It can get fustrating at times but once you get use to it it's really fun. This will keep you entertained for hours! As the game goes on it get's harder and harder which is understandable because most games are like that. The graphics ain't the best but the gameplay makes up for it and the storyline of course. Definetly worth the money!
10759,"i have no words for this amazing game, simple easy, and amazing. 10/10 would recommend this, loved it!"
10760,"10/10 Great story, beautiful game :-)"
10761,"+Unreal engine and optimized, can max out everything on my nvidia980
+great gravity gameplays are great fun
+tutorials are well made
-dated modeling and texture
-voice-over bass level mixing too high. very annoying. can't hear a thing."
10762,"I bought the game approxiametly for 1,5 dollar. And for that price or even for its normal price it's a quite excellent adventure-parkour game."
10763,AMAZING GAME! GET IT!! the price drops super low on sale too so get it while it's hot. I'm having so much fun with this
10764,"A great First person platformer/puzzle that comes along with a solid story. The only fault is that the game is pretty short for the price point, so I would most likely only get it if it's on sale."
10765,"Yes, I completed this in one play through.
Yes, it's a very short game.
No, it isn't much of a challenging game.
Is it worth the full price? Probably not.


However, with all of that said, I can highly recommend this game.
The story of it is very unique and has its own style of gameplay overall. 
The voice acting is actually pretty great (to my surprise).
The graphics are pretty neat, however could be greatly improved.


Upon game completion, you're also able to go back and redo the levels to get a ""best time"", which is a great feature to those who love to play the game. 

So yes, this game is pretty amazing. I suggest getting it either on G 2A or when it's at a discount, simply because of the short storyline. 
I highly recommend this."
10766,"This game is so sick. The climbing is tons of fun, and the places you explore are well designed and every aesthetically pleasing. The only issue I have with this game is that it is so short. Otherwise, the game is really beautiful, and it is loads of fun to play. Some of the jumps are tricky and some are easy, which adds demension to the gameplay. I really enjoy this game!"
10767,Got it on sale. Finished the game in just over 3 hours. Gameplay is good. Story (albeit short) and environment is also good. Definitely felt more than the P75 ($~1.5) I paid for it.
10768,Really good game but crashes sometimes. :P
10769,Very relaxing
10770,"Fun game, interesting mechanics and beautiful scenery.
Don't purchase at full price: ¬£10 for a game that I completed in 157 minutes (failing a lot along the way) is way too expensive.
There is a time trial mode which may interest those who want to play around more with the mechanics, however the actual main storyline is about 3 hours maximum.
I bought this at 80% off, and for ¬£2 this game is very much worth it.

9/10 not enough uncles."
10771,"It's a moderate game with moderate plot/system.
And the play time is too short. Even if you saw the ending, you still might be eligible for the steam refund haha...
But I've enjoyed the game well.

Plot 5/10
Replayability 2/10 There's only one ending and you can not change outcomes.
In-Game atmosphere 8/10"
10772,"Short but sweet.
Well worth the price."
10773,It's fun yes. meow.
10774,"What a waste of 1$ .. The game was more frustrating to me than fun. At times it is evident jumps are just scripted. For example, when I do a really good long jump, despite the length I am supposed to go, I fall short, because the game is heavily scripted in a way that you need to play it the way it was scripted to play. You need to use specific platforms to proceed, and no matter how good you are at exploiting the physics, the game will just kill you saying ""This game isn't meant to show off your skill, you can only proceed by taking these specific waypoints"".

For some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to put scripted jumps in a platformer game. It's not worth playing even if you get this one for free imo. They are fooling you with ""Oh look its suppsoed to be an emotional game with pretty graphics"". There are other good alternatives for those."
10775,IT WAS ALL WORTH IT
10776,leafy
10777,Hope you like falling.
10778,"i saw a youtuber play this and ive been looking for it ever since, found it today cause it happened to be on sale and ill say that was probably the best 3 dollars ive ever spent granted ive only put about 40 minutes into it so far but with a 3 hour story it should hold my attention til the end."
10779,This game is a blast! Definitely reccomend.
10780,"I thought it was fantastic. Beauitifully done, i enjoyed very minuite of it."
10781,10/10 Would fall in the pit of death again
10782,"Absolutely reccomend. Fairly quick play, but beautiful, great story line, and interesting mechanics."
10783,"It was a great game, 9/10 story, epic platforming, but it was really short. The ending also left me wanting more of this story, like maybe in freds POV, and also a free roam would be amazing.
all in all, great game, would recomand, buy please make a sequel, thanks for reading :D

-Pizza"
10784,"I really lovenjoyed this game, the gameplay alows for fastpaced platforming (I always loved grappling hook), the story is touching and the visuals are really good. It's a bit short and the levels can get a bit confusing, but still I would recommend this game any day."
10785,You need this game.
10786,"This game was really awesome, but im not sure its worth $12.99 :/ despite its short storyline which i completed within the same day i bought it, i still recommend it when its on sale. THERE HAAAAS to be an update in which players can create their own maps or download maps from the workshop, which wil definitley make this game worth while. Highly recommend this 8.5/10"
10787,"Great game, can kill alot of time in it and has nice fluid mechanics. Not much else I can really say."
10788,A Story About My Uncle: A Story About Gravity
10789,"An okay platforming game that unfortunately grows tiresome quickly.

Pros:

+ Some visually stunning enviroments make platforming exhilirating.
+ The way you progress with some of the features is pretty neat, gaining the ability to use your grappling hook more often and other abilities like boosting through the air.
+ There are some interesting challenges throughout the game, like making it past certain parts without using your grappling hook.

Cons:

- The platforming gets repetitive fairly easily.
- Some parts are made extraordinarily difficult due to infuriating placement of checkpoints, which sometimes can even make it confusing to tell how much progress you've made due to similar looking scenery in areas of different checkpoints.
- The story is pretty boring, made worse by the fact that the alien girl who tags along with you is incredibly annoying. The framing device used throughout the game is the protagonist narrating it as a bedtime story to his daughter. I hope it worked, because I would've fallen asleep if I were her.
- The writing and voice acting both suffer from the fact that seemingly neither the writer or the voice actors are native English speakers; the dialogue (which, in its own right, is pretty terrible, with plenty of unintentionally funny parts) is riddled with grammatical errors, and the mostly mediocre voice acting is more of an annoyance than something you'll actually be interested in hearing.
- While some parts of the game use interesting mechanics like a monster that will essentially kill you if it sees you moving, other parts serve to confuse you; there are some rooms with layouts that give barely any indication of where you're supposed to go, which is a huge problem when there are moving platforms that require you to think fast to navigate them.
- Though the environments of the game are generally visually appealing, the design of the alien race you interact with is strange, unintentionally creepy, and outdated; the aliens wouldn't look out of place in a PlayStation 2 game.

As I'm writing this, it's on sale for $2.59; at that price, I would get it, but when the sale ends, skip this."
10790,"[h1]I recommend this game for any player who loves parkour or speedruns.[/h1]

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] made me have a lot of fun and it deserves its price. Its honestly a game played to kill time but its really fun especially if you like platform games. The story is interesting but is not that long to which you can finish the story in 2-1 hours. 

The only problem I have with the game is the lack of levels, other than that I think the game is amazing.

8/10

"
10791,Great for commentaries.
10792,"My only complaint is that the graphics are shit. I finished the game in 3 hours but I kept playing in time trials because Its so much fun.

9/10 Right now

10/10 If they add workshop support."
10793,"Enjoyed every second of it!
Would reccomend 100%"
10794,I don't have an uncle.
10795,cewl
10796,8/8 leafy's
10797,I purchased this game after watching a youtuber play it and I have to say I was not disapointed. For me the movement was hard to get used to at first but I think that's good because it's unique. The game also does a good job of building up the mechanics and easing the player into it. The visuals area also stunning and I absolutely love the art style and scene design.
10798,"Story was surprisingly shallow. There is no real resolution or explanation in all the wrong ways. ~3 hours of frustrating gameplay did not make up for it. There should have been puzzles instead of the whole game JUST being tedious maneuvering and a few cutscenes. It became one of those games where half the checkpoints began to feel like a godsend. The grappling can be fun, but that cannot be the entire game, and if it's going to be centered around the ""story"". it should at least be a good story. A lot of development was missing that would have made this game a lot more engaging. I was pretty excited about this but I'm generally disappointed. Also doesn't help that all 15 of the achivements are extremely difficult except for one. No matter how you slice it, this game just left me unsatisfied."
10799,"Great game. I enjoyed every part of it, seemed simple at first but it got more challenging further along. Good storyline, never got bored. 

10/10 worth the price."
10800,"This game is just plain fun. Sure at times, it can be rage enducing when you fly off a cliff around 20 times in a row, but honestly most times, just swinging around, going from rock to rock is just plain fun. I love it!"
10801,"Where do i begin?

The way the game is narrated is unique and the voice acting was very good. It directs you as the player and serves as the narrative all in one.

The gameplay began simple enough, but became challenging. You will get frustrated at certain points (I did) but it never becomes impossible. If you are into puzzle/platformers this is a good game to play. Only cons were I could easily get to place i shouldnt, and a little frustrating as sometimes you dont know where you need to go. 

The graphics were good, I had no issues with it. The characters in the game look a little wonky but its a fantasy genre so I'm not picky about it. The game world itself was gorgeous, I never got tired of it, and at the beginning of every level, I was thrown into another beautiful land.  

The narrative itself was again, very well voiced, and well written. I have also noticed a metaphor for the entire narrative itself (NO SPOILERS). But if you are someone who enjoys looking for hidden meanings, this game is definitely for you. Definitely some feels in the narrative especially towards the end. 

My rating 8.5/10. Definitely worth playing through for the narrative and the beautiful world. I would give it a higher rating if it was longer, it took me 2hrs to finish it."
10802,"Awsome game. The story is verry different and uniqe. Its a blast to play but is a short game hentce the price. If you like portal its simular in its play style, if your the type of person that has to kill things for a game to be enjoyable then this game is not for you."
10803,9/10
10804,"A 1st person Platformer... that in itself should send any sane person running, but this game mechanics would really well and overall I enjoyed it very much. It's a little short, and the story is a little thin but there's clearly a  lot of love gone into this game and the little that is there works wonderfully. Definitely can recommend it."
10805,"I fully recomend this game. It's a beautiful game with the kind of game mechanics that entice you to master them. Keep in mind the game is very short, only reaching about 3 and a half hours, however it's the kind of game that is designed with speedruns in mind, so if you're up to practice for time then you can sqweeze a whole lot more out of this game.

Pros
+++Amazing visual style, really beautiful
+Mood-setting soundtrack, doesn't stand out, but it does it's job well
++Very calming, if you're stressed and need to relax after a day of work or school then this is perfect
++Time Trial mode is brilliant in this game
+++Mystery and sense of discovery ([i]I would explain what this is, but I won't for obvious reasons[/i])
++Probably the best 3d platformer I've ever expirienced
+Very cheap, sitting at just $12.99 


Cons (mostly minor)
-Charcters have good animations but bad models, so the clash looks goofy and breaks immersion (though you rarely have to look at them)
-Graphics options are limited so don't expect to play this on old hardware
--The ending is a bit underwhelming and feels a little rushed"
10806,Like Skyrim but with my uncle
10807,"I started playing this game with no expectations, and I was very pleasantly surpsrised. Although a very short game, it was fun while it lasted."
10808,"Interesting and unique story, challenging arcade, nice graphic and design. Good short game to dive into for one evening and to complete it feeling yourself renewed and a bit more happier. Can make you rage, if you're not good with 3D-platformers or if you'll skip some of pointers on how to advance forward :)"
10809,"I had a lot of fun with this game. It's short and sweet. Reminds me a bit of the 1st portal game. I beat the story in just under 3 hours. The story did interest me, but for such a short game it is hard to get invested in. There is some replayability because you can replay levels and try to beat your time. There's also some collectibles you could go after. The game has a very cool art style, fun/relaxing gameplay, and great voice acting but it's too short. 

Even though it's not a full priced game, wait for a steam sale. Definitely a must play IMO, however I would understand if you disagreed. I will be returning to this game in the future."
10810,"This game is pretty amazing. First off i'd like to say that the graphics are amazing for only $5. 

"
10811,"Perfect bedtime story, Voices are great, Gameplay is awesome, Puzzles are great overall GREAT GAME!"
10812,"Tonight I decided to sit down and play this game after purchasing it years ago during a sale.  The story captivated me, the puzzles were challenging at times, and the gameplay was smooth with a beautiful environment.  This game is short, but if you are looking for a relaxing (and stressful) afternoon game, I highly reccomend this title."
10813,"Great story, easy to learn contols. The main story is pretty easy, but the achievements are extremely hard. It is cool to have a puzzle game with the main tool being a grappling hook. I wouldn't buy it for full price, though."
10814,"It is a great story, with great voice acting, and full of little details that add immersion and makes you feel like it's all... possible... It's a 9.5/10 because i wanted more."
10815,"TBH, boring. If you really want to sleep, I will highly recommend you to play this game."
10816,"Very beautiful and exciting game, Fuh ... It will be exciting when you fly between the rocks. It's a shame that all the land which you see two o'clock. But in general, the game is really cool, buy, and you will understand me."
10817,"Amazing. The only think that I can say about it is that it's amazing. Graphics,story,gameplay. Just amazing."
10818,"-super origonal 
- havent seen a game like this in years 
- wish it was a little longer or there could be fan made levels"
10819,"A beautiful game, with just the right difficulty curve, challenging without being frustrating. Completed it in one sitting so don't expect anything long but it is more than worth the price tag. 8/10"
10820,"Great game. Very fun, interesting enough story. Definitely recommend on enjoyment alone, and that's the reason I'll give it a thumbs up here.

However, its the shortest game I've ever played in my life. I beat the thing in 2 hours, and there is zero reason to play it again unless you REALLY like repeating the same levels to beat your speed records.

Because of this, it is NOT worth the $13 price tag. Pick it up when its on sale sometime."
10821,Loved this game. Absolutely worth the money. I completed it once last year and I can't wait to start another playthrough soon.
10822,"[b]Great story, amazing graphics, very fun parkour. Would reccomend.[/b]

I did complete the game in around 3 hours, but there are many hidden objects on the journey that I missed or skipped over that would add to the playing time."
10823,took 2 hours to beat it but it was a fantastic 2hr its worth the money
10824,"A story about my uncle is, well. It's a nice game, it has a light-hearted nice storyline. There's not a lot of drama or sad storyline elements. It's a feel good game."
10825,"Well, the game is quiet short. Too bad. But it's nice for a platformer.

+Sound/music
+Good gameplay
-Short
-Price
?Story"
10826,"Very fun and exciting, be wary of trying to rush through. You should always stay slow. The only thing I have a bit of a problem with is the price, $13 for a game I played for 3 hours and beat doesn't do it for. Wait for it go on sale."
10827,I found this game to be a lot of fun and some of the jumps were a bit of a challenge. The game has just over 4 hours of content for 1 play through. I guess some people may not like such a short game. A very nice story albeit sad.
10828,"It's cool little platformer with nice artwork, but very short. If you like such games I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale."
10829,"It took my only 2 or 3 days of a couple hours of playing the game, if that. Though I'll say it's some of the best money I've ever spent. It's up to par with one of my other favorite games like Contrast. I think that with the amount of simplicity that the game has (You run, jump, grapple, etc.) It's absolutely amazingly intricate. The way the story is told, the voice actors themselves, everything was absolutely stellar. I don't write reviews for games often but at the end I was basically a tiny ball of tears, drool, and snot. Not a pretty sight. But to end this review, seriously. If you're looking for a fun, simplistic controlled game that has an amazing story, you've found your game. More than anything else I think something that took my breath away when I first loaded up the game, was the creativity. When you go into one of the first major places, it's so small compared to the game as a whole but it feels so full and full of life and joy."
10830,"Damn. Where should I begin.

This game is gorgeous to look at. The graphics are amazing and the enviroment is absolutely beautiful to look at. The concept of this game is great and the story is really good. Overall I really like how you progress and unlock more stuff to your suit. It's been hard but it's been fun as all hell.

Now on to a few negatives: I Completed the game in only 2 hours. These 2 hours have, however, been very well spent but I'd like to have it longer.

The ending... Don't get me started. I Was dissappointed, mildly spoken. However, last place/cutscene gave me goosebumps. But if you're very excited for the ending, don't be. It's really nothing special.

However I friggin' love this game and the stages. I Really recommend this game."
10831,Fell so many times
10832,"Really solid game, looks extremly pretty. I caught myself a couple times not paying attenion to the story and just looking around the area cause it just looked so damn pretty. And the story was pretty especially for the price."
10833,"It is a short game for $13, if you only do the story (which is quite a bit of fun btw). The gameplay is tight in that there are mechanics but they are used well. The only lacking part of this game is the models for certain characters."
10834,"Its a very good game, and definately worth the money, but it is very short"
10835,i beat the game its fun but once you beat it two or three times it gets old. It needs more content.
10836,"I bought this game on sale after my friend suggested it to me (I was looking for good story based games with fun gameplay).

My thoughts : 

This is an incredible game, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through this (in one sitting) and plan on 100% this game. The game has very very enjoyable mechanics and gameplay features. The grapple feature is LOADS of fun and really makes the game, especially the further on you get in the game. 

PROS : 
Very fun gameplay
Great features
Good story
Fun environments 
Good challenge
Fun interactions
Varying landscape

CONS : 
Graphics aren't up to date but aren't bad
Story isn't a high point


Overall this is an incredible game that I thoroughly enjoyed and can't wait to see what else comes from Coffee Stain."
10837,this game mixes great storytelling with an amazing story and awsome game mechanics. i highly recomend this game and its on my top 10 list of games.
10838,can we get a sequel plz???
10839,"Very fun game, although it is a little short. However, the graphics are good, the physics are great, and gameplay is good. I liked the story, and if it was longer, I would love it. Overall, great game."
10840,it's short and fantastic and totally worth of spending several hours on good game thanks devs
10841,"Amazing game with great story, music and visuals. A bit challenging, but not overly so and the constant change in scenery keeps it interesting. It¬¥s also pretty short, so it doesn¬¥t take up too much time, either. I can definitely say that I recommend this game.

9/10 grapples."
10842,This game is a must on sale.
10843,Great game for people that loves puzzles.
10844,"God this game made my balls tingle. They want to recede so badly. 









""Haha! Told you couldn't do it."" ~ Maddie 
[b]TRIGGERED[/b]

[h1]Edit[/h1]

I'm a casual player. I'm here more for the story than mechanics. That doesn't mean I don't like or want a game that runs smoothly and is consistent. If a game has a story and it's badly written one at that then the mechanics can't redeem it for me.


This game starts off with a father telling his daughter a bed time story. From the second it started I was engulfed its world. It kept me captivated with the lack of answers that I kept asking so many questions about wtf was going on. Until a little after I met maddie. I won't lie, the graphics where disappionting. The people and voice acting where laughable, but that was no where near enough to make me dislike or stop playing.

What kept me going was the anticepation of what would happen next. It was so easy to feel like there was going to be a surprise or a plot twist around the corner. I kept expecting something to happen to deepen the plot. Nothing did happen. That was truly the twist. Am I disappionted? For a second yes, but honestly no. The story went the direction I least expected it to because I kept expecting it not to. I love that.

The story in its self was a bit dull. The world around me really helped it out though. Plus the narrator and his conversation was really adorable and enjoyable. The game play was fantastic and the little unlockables were a really nice touch. Had a lot of fun with the one of them. The achievements for those who like doing them are challenging, tedious, and overall great. They are the only reasons to replay the game.

So, yes. Buy the game. Its worth it."
10845,"I loved this game, beautiful, enjoyable and a story I felt you could really connect with."
10846,"[h1] An awesome speedrunner [/h1]

When I started the game, I had no idea what to expect but what I got was a well handling platformer where you can fly like spiderman with interesting level design and a short but interesting story(kinda).
Would recommend to any player who's just looking to pass 3 hours and having some fun.

So the pros
[list]
    [*]It's colorful
    [*]well designed levels
    [*]Handles well
    [*]You can shoot ""webs"" like freaking spider-man!

The Cons

Here's a video I made summarising the whole game in 3 minutes.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=734306969"
10847,"A Story About My Uncle is a game made in 2014. It quickly grasped eager players and online gamers and held them tighter than a grappling hook shooting you 50 foot up above your designated area.

PROS:
Beautiful Graphics and Style. 
One of the best looking games I've played all year. I will defend this game for this aspect because of just how amazing it looks.

Unique Gaming Mechanics. 
I have not played another game with the same aspect of this. Seriously, look up ""Game with Grappling and Super Jump Mechanics"" and you probably won't get many results.

Smooth Gameplay. 
(Most of) the gameplay was amazing and very smooth. Maybe it's just my computer but, dammit, it looks so beautiful!



Yeah.. Those were the ros. Into the Cons!



CONS:
Uninterresting Storyline. 
I'm sorry if it's just me, but it's hard to get invested into the characters and general storyline of the game. I could not get invested into the story at all. On top of this, it's painful when you lose the ability to do everything for a little ""cutscene"" that takes a few minutes. What's the point of taking away our powers if we're only going to be talking for one minute?

TERRIBLE Window (Yes, this is very nit-picky). 
Jesus, it was a PAIN to actually be able to play with this window. One minute the bottom of the screen has a black line across it and the next, I'm sat there watching the window go from ""Fullscreen"" to ""Windowed"" every few seconds.

Bad Grappling Mechanics.
I don't mean the grappling itself, I mean certain parts with it. 
First off, the reach for some rocks are extremely far and others are extremely close. Why is this? It would be easier to have them all set to a certain point. 
Secondly, Jesus, it takes forever. It can't be just me who's having this issue where, one minute I'll be flying across the map and the next, I'll have my buzz killed because it takes FOREVER to reach where you're going with it.

Repeating Areas.
I don't mean the areas repeat themselves, but I've found that.. It all looks the same. I see little to no variety in the surroundings or areas I'm in. The beginning of the game had a house, houses on the rocks, moving rocks, a village, etc.
However, it pretty much becomes you jumping from rock to rock.



All in all, this wasn't a terrible game, however, if you ask me, I wouldn't really recommend it. 
4.5/10"
10848,"I was trying to give it a chance for the story to grab me, but I kept getting frustrated with the gameplay instead. It gets pretty hard to judge distances sometimes when the glowing symbols all over the place turn out to be completely arbitrary sizes and not consistent."
10849,The mechanics in this game are so simple and they feel just right. Soaring throught the air is breathtaking! I beat the game in 2 sittings of about an hour and a half each. well worth the 12 dollars! The time trials are great too with endless possiblities to shave seconds off of your time. I say this is a must have for people who loved the original mirrors edge and always wanted to feel like spider-man. The game is also optimized pretty well!
10850,"Well, This game was absoloutly amazing! Astonishing voice acting, exceptionally fun gameplay mechanics, And a really good story.

However, The story line is extremely short,  I completed it in around 3 hours, After that, there is nothing to do apart from Time trials, which is pretty much just recompleting the missions with your best time, Thats a complete downer. This game really needs a workshop where people can make, Play and share their maps with other people. Thats a complete bummer.

For the retail price of ¬£9.99, I'm not really sure it's worth it, However, I would highly reccommend this game when its next on sale, As it really is that good!

Pros - 
Great Storyline
Great voice acting
Fun Gameplay mechanics

Cons - 
Short Storyline
Lack of content
No Workshop
Price tag."
10851,Great game.
10852,A little short but I enjoyed it.
10853,"i think this game is really great! i personally love games with grabling-hooks and alot of fast movement, but for a 13‚Ç¨ game, i think it was wayyyyy to short. i didnt even think i had completed 1/4 of the game when it ended. + it only took me about an hour and a half to complete the game. but overall i think its a good game with a little sweet story.

i would also recomend buying this game from G2a.com it only cost 1.80‚Ç¨ instead of 13."
10854,"A story about my uncle is small but a very worth a while game. It has a beatufil design and looks amazing there are nigh no bugs or glitches and the gameplay is smooth. Story is interesting and simple yet compeling in a way. Also I found the voice acting great as well as the overall audio.

9/10"
10855,"One of the best games , has a great story!"
10856,Honestly I only bought this at first because it was on sale and I saw YTers using it in videos. But the unique platforming and art style made this game very enjoyable for the short amount of time it took to finish.
10857,Good game but very hard
10858,turned into leafy when playing would drink bleach again
10859,"Really cool movement based game with a short, but heartwarming story

get it on sale unless you are the type of person who wants to play this game to beat times on challenge maps. Otherwise, i do not think this game at $20 is a fair deal at all since the story is so short. 

i got it for $2 on sale."
10860,I play cuz this game is fun. You'll be called a leafy fanboy if u play tho
10861,Amazing storyline. Definitely worth playing.
10862,"Really wanted to like the game, but the platforming and grappling hook is just way too frustrating. It doesn't seem to follow it's own internal logic for when you can grapple to something and when you can't. After trying a platforming section with spinning windmills about 50 times, I still had no idea why I could grapple to the windmill about one out of every five tries. I wasn't doing anything different on each attempt, yet it would only grapple to the windmill 20% of the time. I was definitely close enough to grapple and the windmills even had the icon that indicates something you can grapple to, yet, it still only worked 20% of the time. 

When you have to grapple multiple objects in a row to get to the next platform, about half of my attempts would fail because the grapple would pull me too close to the object I am attached to and throw me off course or stop my momemtum entirely. I get that the grapple will pull you all the way to whatever you're connected to, but they really should have implememented a system so it would know when you are trying to swing from an object and when you are trying to land on an object.

There really should be a Super Meat Boy or Trials instant restart as well. The platforming is frustrating enough, but having to wait upwards of ten seconds for the game to reload every time you fail is just way too long. I lose interest and it would make me want to quit playing even more than I already did.

I really liked the art style and the story seemed at least somewhat interesting, but the frustrating, endless platforming is just too much for me to keep playing or recommend to anyone."
10863,"I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I got it from a Humble Bundle a while ago, and simply hadn't gotten around to playing it until now. The price that I paid was definitely worth it, but I think that even the full price here on Steam is reasonable.

The game was a delight. The NPC animations left a little to be desired, but the environments, narration, voices, and gameplay were great. There was just enough difficulty throughout to keep you challenged and learning new ways to traverse an environment. And despite being only a few hours long, this game has enough story to really tug on your heartstrings.

Part of me wishes that this game was longer, but sometimes it's really nice to be able to play a game that your can start and finish in one setting."
10864,"This game has Portal level story telling, but you're not mute."
10865,"[u]alpha reviews:[/u]

This game pleasantly surprised me. I bought it during summer sale because it was so cheap and looked interesting but it ended up being one of my best buys. 
It doesn't focus only on the story itself but it is still very interesting to hear all the dialog during the game. A Story About My Uncle is essentially a first person platforming adventure with a high sense of immersion. There is something special about going through an adventure with no violence, no guns, no screams, no negativity. This game was so fun, exciting and relaxing at the same time. It is challenging enough, it is long enough and it is rewarding enough.

10866,"I want to start by saying that I certainly didn't hate this game. It was really for an afternoon's session. The visuals are really impressive for an indie game like this,  the soundtrack is simple but works well, and there's tons of fun easter eggs hidden throughout the play. The travel and exploration mechanic is great too, but at the end of the day it just feels like a ""proof of concept"" game. 

The mechanics work, but I found myself falling/failing, more than progressing over the course of the 3-4 hour game. Some of the running and jumping controls work, some of them don't, and not being able to customize it for a keyboard feels like a bit of an oversight. The ability to grapple onto pretty much any surface was really impressive, and would have been a really good selling point for me if I wasn't getting stuck in-between rocks and being forced to fall back to the save point over and over. Plus the game is VERY liner, which is disappointing given the posiblilites to explore that you start to see after the first hour. 

There is a bit of story to the game, which being called ""A Story About My Uncle"" (a rather poor title if I may say so) but I was expecting a bit more depth to it. You get a bit of narration as you go, but if anything it seems very dry and unenthusiasitc. Story wise it just doesn't rope me in. There are tons of NPCs, but they don't do anything besides just sit or stand in one place. For that reason the world seems pretty empty. For a game with such strong visuals it's really ashame there wasn't more thought placed into the characters.

Again this is far from a bad game, but it just feels too short and too plain of a world to be worth it. Just when I was really starting to get into the game it ended, and I felt like a wasted my money (even if it was on sale). 

In the long run I think this game would be GREAT with VR, but as is...it's a ""proof of concept"" and not enough to call a good game."
10867,"A fun first-person platformer with fun parkour mechanics. Coupled with a quirky yet touching story and gorgeous visuals, 'A Story About my Uncle' makes for a short, but very pleasant and entertaining experience."
10868,"the game is very good, so buy it without think too much about it.

the only problems are:
1)it's very short
2)sometimes it's easy to get frustrated
3) IMPORTANT: DO NOT PLAY IT USING A CONTROLLER, you'll need extreme precision and speed. a controller does not provide that level of performance
4)the story looked amzing at the beginning, but just when things seemed to get interesting the games end :( a good epilogue fix that a bit"
10869,"This game makes me wish there was a neutral button.
As a gamer whose only prior Coffee Stains studio game was Goat Simulator, I didn't know what to expect. I was blown away. This game has sat in my library for a long time, I played it a while back and put it down, then came back. I like this game, I really like this game a lot. The first person grapple and leaping mechanics are amazing, and I had so much fun launching myself around the levels in the game. The experience itself was spectacular, for the time it lasted.
Which brings me to where I would make this neutral. For ¬£10, $15, or however much it is in your respective country, it is far too short. On a half-price sale, I would definitely recommend (I got my copy when it was only ¬£1, so perhaps I'm biased), but 2 and a half hours just doesn't seem like enough to me. Perhaps there's some secret level I've missed, but I was hoping for a bit more closure when I finally reached my goal other than a few lines of dialogue."
10870,"short lived, but every second was fun and refreshing, lovely environments, good solid gameplay, let me play at my own pace and do the maps whatever way i wanted (felt like a genious every time i skipped a section due to wicked stunts). an excelent game to play before bed to wind down from hardcore shoot em ups."
10871,[b]+Beautiful +Puzzle +Great voice acting +You will not get bored -pretty short story -Graphic settings are pretty limited 8/10[/b]
10872,This game is a masterpiece the art and story is magical
10873,"Nice looking, interesting gameplay that (for me) became extremely fustrating as the game progressed. With no real sense of direction to take, falling to my death [u]dozens[/u] of times trying to make it from point ""A"" to point ""B"" is NOT my idea of fun. With a few more save points here and there, this game would be 100% better."
10874,"mesmerizing gameplay, nice atmosphere and audio. short gameplay tho but worth it."
10875,"Beautiful scenery , and an interesting story and POV of the story , but it is only around 2 and a half hours of story and then there is time trials which are just repeat parts of the story. Not worth $12,99 , but you should pick it up on a sale , I got it for around $2,50 i believe and for that price its worth it."
10876,"After playing partway through this game, I came to a jump puzzle I could not solve. The game was basically blocked for me at that point. Very frustrating. I hate to give this game a bad review, but maybe it should see if someone's stuck and offer some guidance? I for one rarely get stuck in games so this is unusual. Avoid unless you like only seeing part of the game."
10877,thought this was porn smh.
10878,"best game would reccomend. it actually fucking sucks chode though because it was created, by eurotrash. and you can't own slaves. what kind of fucking game doesn't have an option to enslave negroids. the only people there are, are these salamander fish queers who are europoors, and make me want to vomit. the only good part about it is when it ends. this game was made by mongoloids who live with their mothers, and have to have their asses wiped every day. these niggerfaggios have to have an aid because they can't take care of theirselves. complete head-cases who shouldn't be designing games. Fuck this game and everyone who designed it."
10879,FInshed the game and I want to play it again! It was a great buy and I've been wanting it for a while. If you dont like the story you can still play with the fun and easy to learn mechanics of the grappiling device. Personally I wish there was more to the story but it's definately worth the buy!
10880,Very short but very good.
10881,this game is awesome it has a good story and where it lacks in replayability it has some unlockables and speedrun modes i recomend buying it on sale tho to get the most for your money
10882,A real gem of an indie game.  The experience sticks with you.  Great mechanics.
10883,"Really cool game, i recommend!
btw inspired by Leafy :) 

Peace out!"
10884,"First thing you need to know is that it is super short. You'll see I've only played 2.4 hours? I've already beaten the game.  I didn't do the Time Trials (which IMO are kind of a cheap way to try to make people play the game multiple times to get more play time out of the player) which would have likely boosted my time by maybe an hour, but I believe it's important that you know that this game will be between 1-4 hours without redoing everything.

I'll still give it a Thumbs up, because I spent most of the game really enjoying it. Sure clipping is an issue, and sometimes the physics engine makes puzzles way easier/harder than it should be, but it's beautiful, it's fast and doesn't have delays, and it's exactly what you'd expect from it."
10885,"The Best 3h I've spent among a long time!

A awessome short game, with a lot of puzzles and action, a game you will never forget.

10886,awsome game
10887,"""A story about my uncle"" is a fun and relaxing 3D platformer game. The controls might take a little bit of time before you get completely used to them. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the atmosphere keeps you in the game and relaxes you most of the time. The platformer elements were quite innovative and fun, althought whether it's easy or challenging will depend on your reaction time and skill.. and perhaps your dpi. A very important part in the game is the narrative, and I must say, that it was excellently performed. It was one of the things I enjoyed the most. Well, to be completely honest with you, the story sometimes makes you scratch your head, but it's not that bad.

All in all, I really reccomend you get this game, at least on a sale, if you're feeling hesitant, as it will definitely bring you ~6 hours of entertainment."
10888,"A fun 3D platformer game. Not too much to say about it. The environments are beautiful, the controls work great, and it's overall a fun experience. Despite the title of the game, A Story About My Uncle doesn't exactly have the greatest story. It's cute and simplistic, but it's still nothing to write home about. However, I still highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants a fun, chill, platformer game to play."
10889,"I really enjoyed playing this game.
Awesome story, Awesome mechanics, Awesome graphics.
10/10 Would recommend"
10890,"Fantastic game! 

The controls are tight and well thought out making it fun and exciting to play. In fact the controls are so good that when you fall, its not the games fault, its yours. This is nice because it provides a challenge without being brutally hard. I highly recommend this game, simply for the gameplay.

The story is good, nothing groundbreaking, but provides a means to an end.

The world itself is beautiful. The detail is immaculate and interesting. Although its a very linear game, there are times where you have to get from point A to B, but you can take different pathes finding a flow in gameplay that works for you. Some paths are more challenging while others are easier, therefore it gives you the option as to what route you want to take.

The only complaint I have is with the voice acting and character models. The voice acting is all over the place, sometimes I was enthralled by what the characters/narrator was saying, while other times I had to cringe at the long, drawn-out unneeded pauses. The character models really don't match the surrounding environment, which was kind of disappointing. The character models are bland and flat, with little detail and didn't necessarily feel like they fit the world.

All-in-all the character models and voice acting are relatively unimportant  for the game, I mean the voice acting provides the story, but other than that its all about the gameplay, which this game has perfected. Overall I was pleased with this game and would recommend it to anyone simply based on the world and the gameplay. 

8/10"
10891,"I enjoy platformer games and this was no exception. I just didn't like it enough to go through it again to get more achievements. If there was a 'meh' option for recommendations, I would choose it for this game."
10892,"I don't think I've cussed at a video game so much since Super Meat Boy. The difference being, in SMB the frustration came from the challenge and here, it comes from the wonky controls and bad level design. 

Although it's far from unplayable and has very nice atmosphere, looks and a cute story, the ""spider-man"" style traversal is dumb, broken and not fun to play around with. 

Get ready for falling endlessly into the pits and hating the grapple controls. I finished once and still haven't gotten comfortable with the controls. One of those games I thanked god when it was over because I felt my nerves couldn't take it any more. It's not about a lack of skills but about terrible controls and poor challenge/level design. 

The achievements are also dull dull dull. I'm not going anywhere near this game again.

The review from PC Gamer from the top of the page calls it ""some of the most tight and responsive first-person platforming"" and I call BULL****.

 It had potential though."
10893,Very Good Game very nice
10894,"Very nice game. It plays fluently and the story is nice. Grappling is so much fun! Would love a longer game with these mechanics, were you get more abilities and harder levels. But still, this game is great. 

Recommend!"
10895,This game is amazing! It feels like you really went to an adventure. Great game!
10896,"Short story but a hell of a lot of fun, Ive played the story about 3 times and it itself is good but the game feels like its missing something."
10897,"This game is awesome. It may be short but the story and the gameplay are amazing, and the replay value is upped because of the challenges you can do where you have to complete a certain zone using the grapple a certain amount of times and all the collectables, too. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes parkour and a great story."
10898,"Was wondering what game LeafyisHere was always playing and this popped up in my feed. Great game, freaky frog people. The game is increadably short but really fun and has replay value."
10899,A very good simple game just fun and a good passtime
10900,"A really great game, it have a breathtaking atmosphere and beautiful landscapes. It's very fun to play and absolutely different from any other game I've seen around. A must play of the indie category."
10901,"This game basically consists of levels where you have to grapple between points and not fall. The story is that you're looking for your uncle in a strange world he found, this world reminds me of the original Unreal.

I didn't particularly enjoy the game because there was quite a bit of trial and error, sometimes finding your next grapple point is difficult, but if you're up for a challenge then I'd recommend it. I acquired zero achievements because you actually have to work for them."
10902,"This game takes you on a journey. As for the protagonist, and as for myself, this was an adventure."
10903,"Alright, so I'm just going to be honest. I didn't like this game.

I can say I liked the core mechanic, swinging from rock to rock was nice , but it also really gets old after a while.
The swinging isn't used in any meaningful way like solving puzzles, it's extremely linear in that regard with only a few options to deviate from the track. The swinging is very annoying at times, and falling to your death is something you'll be well acquainted with.

The writing is sub-par, with simple grammatical mistakes somehow slipping through into the final product. None of the characters were endearing or likeable, with Maddie being the worst. The wonky animations and bad voice acting certainly didn't help either.

I can respect the game for wanting to be peaceful and non-violent, but there really needed to be something else in there to liven up the gameplay. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game, and I feel like the mechanic would have been better suited a puzzle game or something that requires thoughtfulness instead of just reflexes."
10904,is good :3
10905,"Great game, very beautiful graphics but it does not give you clear directions as to where to go. This game is also very hard and and can be frustrating."
10906,"nice game, but a little short."
10907,"Great game! Short one, but very interesting and very-very beautiful :). Good job, creators!"
10908,"Your uncle created a species of frog people that live on the floating rocks where he ejects his rubbish. The frog people live in his rubbish. A seperate group of frog people use crystals to make machines. Clearly, we should prepare for warfare against these frog people. You play as the nephew, hellbent on saving humanity. You've figured out that an effective method of fighting them is to get them to jump on your back and then falling to your death. Until a few seconds later when you both respawn... spawn... my god, you've become a frog person!"
10909,"The game is amazin but the only thing that is really fucked up is the gameplay, sometimes it so fucked up that u wanna break the monitor. peace"
10910,"Beautiful game, repetative in nature constantly swinging from platform to platform, but i didnt once feel bored. Kept me very entertained and the story progressed fluidly opening up a brilliant world which was a joy to explore (not openworld). I reccomend everyone to buy this game, its truly different, special, beautiful. 10/10"
10911,"This game is basically a 3d version of some free game you'd play on Newgrounds.  The story is paper-thin, and there's only little movement challenges.  The game is so bare-bones that it's hard to even describe.  The simple mechanics are simply fun, though they could be better.  The story is dumb and unnecessary, but it could have been good if they tried.  At a certain point, once you get the rocket boots, you can basically fudge your way through all but the last level.

Ps & Cs:
+ Good graphics
+ Fun gameplay
+ Simple mechanics
- No story

tl;dr: A short full little game worth getting if you find it on sale"
10912," A beautiful game, well-made and thought out. You can see every detail that went in to making this game, from the incredible views of floating islands, to ethereal-esque stalactites of the frozen caverns. 

 Although I haven't finished the game yet (Due to a slow computer), I've enjoyed every minute so far.
The storyline is rather great, albeit not perfect (But most games haven't perfected a storyline anyway), it has some great high-points, but the narrator is a little deadpan.

 I'd recommend this game to any Portal/Talos Principle fan, but be warned some of the stunts you have to do are quite difficult and not all that straight-forward.

 But there are some cons here, for starters, it's windows only. And another, (as with any game) there are some glitches that can be used to unfairly get past areas. But besides the few cons it has, it's a great game overall.

 For the price ($12.99 as of 7/15/16), it's a good deal. It'll last you a pretty long time, and it's rather hard to stop playing after awhile.

9/10"
10913,"Good graphics, big breathtaking sceneries, nice story, lots of little details like objects often refering to other games or products, talking froggy humanoids, bottomless caves and floating villages.

10/10 would find my uncle again."
10914,"You like Dark Souls? You like grappling and parkour-ing? Then this game is definitely for you.

(Not recommended to those who easily get dizziness during and after playing this game.)"
10915,"Just finished it, nice story , nice visuals , enjoyed it a lot so i reccomend it"
10916,"Saw Leafy playing it and decided to buy it.
Good platformer."
10917,loved the movement system and the art style of the game :)
10918,"This game is very very good if you like movement based games
But let me tell you a fuck
Let me say this
when that fucking lizard challenges you to not use the grapple, it will be the hardest thing in your life
she just says ""haha told ya"" and then you sit there reflecting on the fact that a fucking amphibian just shot you down

10920,"This is one of those games that leave you feeling empty after you finished it. One of the most beatiful stories i ever had the plasure to play with fun gameplay. First playthrough is a little more than two hours, but boy, what an emotional rollercoaster. After days I still think about this world, it's characters, the story. Because of the Time Trials the game has quite some replay value!"
10921,A little short on content so make sure to buy it during a sale.
10922,"A story about my uncle would you play this game for graphics and maxed out setting no 
but you play this game for the art style and the beautiful that is in it the game had me wanting more from it the story paints a picture of peacefulness  as you look around the world that you are playing in 
the music brings happyiness to the soul this is a game all by it self 
i thank the people who made this game"

If it was any longer i would have been too invested and it would have made me much sadder.

Fun Mechanics. 

The easter eggs were a little annoying, especially the 20% cooler one, i know what thats from you scummy twats."
10927,"Great game, I reccommend it at it's fullest... Even if the ending is not that good the gameplay is definately worth the money."
10928,fun short game. like it.
10929,Gr8 game!
10930,"The game is, great, well made, and well narrarated, the ""rope swinging"" sort of platforming gives you a similar experience to CS:GO surfing (in my opinion). The gameplay is smooth and the levels are well thought out, the game is relatively short however, only lasting about an hour and a half to 2 hours at most."
10931,"I really enjoyed this game! It is fun, fast paced and the story is not bad at all! I played through it and didn¬¥t want to stop! I can only recommend it!"
10932,"A beautiful game, a little in the short run, but it was worth the money.
You can also explore more of the world after the main story is finished by level select, and have as a goal to find all the readings your uncle left behind. Every fifth reading gives a special feature you can enable. 
truly a wonderful world and my god those colors!

I recommend it when it is on sale, but it is worth full prize too."
10933,"A nice and entertaining experience. The english dialects are somewhat drawing the attention from the great quality of the game and graphics, but still not enough to ruin the great experience. The story could have another ending though. All in all worth the money on sale."
10934,"Very good and fun game. A bit too short, but mechanics, even when a bit wonky at times, are marvelous and enjoyable. Amazing and touching environment and story.

A very good value for its price, very recommended."
10935,This game is better than therapy.
10936,"Normally I hate platform games, but this game was a lot of fun. Short but challenging, gameplay was solid."
10937,This is a great game with a good story. The collectibles will keep your inner perfectionist busy.
10938,"Pretty looking fun platforming game, can actually get a bit harder towards the end but has a fair learning curve.
The achievements are fairly challenging so you're in for a good time if that's your thing. 
I recommend the game if you're looking for some good platforming action, game clocks in at about 2-3 hours. I took longer because i fell off too many times. 

"
10939,"10/10 Story and Voice acting. This is classic oscar bait, all effort put into the beautiful story that will leave you breathless. Moments will excite you, bring tears to your eyes, and make you quake with fear. Alongside the action is the relationship between the Nephew and Maddie which is explored and developed flawlessly, on par with classics such as Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, or Romeo and Juliet. Last but not least is the underlying tale of colonial expansion and the need to protect the rights of native occupants. Even now, in a time lacking the imperial style of empires past, the lessons present in 'A Story About My Uncle' can relate to all of us, ringing true in the hearts of everyone who will pla this game. This truly is a masterpiece. I give it a 6/10."
10940,"Beautiful graphics, but otherwise a very linear platformer with no real story or exploration, and wonky controls that will see you repeating areas over and over until you get it just right.  No fun for me."
10941,"Beautiful graphics, fun story, involves some strategy.  One of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while."
10942,"Great game along with a great story. Grapple hook your way through this game hitting objects to make it to the end. Find small objects to unravel a small bit more of the story. Death is everywhere so be careful! Voice acting is spot on, like you're reading a book."
10943,"A really nice and creative game. Recommended to buy. The story of this game is so beautiful and passionate.

The creativity of this game is amazing!

Leafy brought me here. +1"
10944,Good game. Haven't played anything like that for a while.
10945,"Sweet story. Nice visuals. Decent gameplay.

A bit too short and way too easy, but I still recommend it, especially if on discount."
10946,"Oh man, what an adventure this was. The story is great, the gameplay is amazing and then there are simple puzzles where you can just turn off your mind and enjoy this masterpiece of the game. This is one of the best games I have every played and a must have for every gamer."
10947,"This game is about a boy who searches for his uncle in a different world full of adventure and different creatures. 
The adventuring and puzzle aspect of the game is well laid out and the graphics aren't so bad either.
Overall, it's a game I recommend."
10948,Wonderful game fun yet difficult platforming with awsome mechanics and great characters and story. i felt sad when it was done. wait to buy it on sale the main story only takes you about an 2 hours and a half but still worth it.
10949,"I‚Äôm not going to go into too much detail about this games story. The story was fine for what it was. This game clocks in at about 3 hours. So, the story was kept simple enough to fit that time. It didn‚Äôt make me really feel anything. It was a good story, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it just didn‚Äôt make me emotional and wasn‚Äôt something I really connected to. Now, with that being said, I really did enjoy the story. Simple, clean, and had a nice after credit scene to wrap everything up. Now, some pros and cons.

Pro:

- Artistically beautiful

- Amazing soundtrack

- Simple story

- Short game


Cons:

- Having to repeat the same puzzle over and over. This was one of the main issues I had with the game. I‚Äôd be stuck for 30 minutes on the same puzzle, not because I didn‚Äôt know how to solve it, but because if you were a centimeter off of your target, you would fail and have to start over again. Or, if you drifted too far away from your target, you‚Äôd fall and have to start over again, which really sucked.

- The character models looking really weird. They looked very angular (not in the good way), and was kind of off putting considering the environments. The environments looked 1000x better then the character models, and that threw me off while playing. Not enough to be a distraction, but enough to bug me a little.

- The main character height. This game is an FPS, and it looked like our guy was 2 feet tall. I understand that he‚Äôs supposed to be a child, but when it looks like my knees are in the ground, it‚Äôs a major issue. For example: Among The Sleep you play as a baby and it looks like the babies knees are not in the ground. When we play a character that‚Äôs about 9 (I‚Äôm guessing, they never say how old he is), he shouldn‚Äôt be 2 feet. Maybe 4‚Ä≤5‚Ä≥ or something, but not 2 feet.

- The transition between game play and cut scenes. The only issue I have with this is that you couldn‚Äôt run around. Which I understand why, but when my character goes from a run to a crawl, it really stops the flow of the game. The cut scene walking was also slower then our character actually walking.

Overview:

This isn‚Äôt a bad game. It‚Äôs a really cool idea that needs a little bit of fixing. Other then that, I have no problem with the game. I‚Äôm really impressed at how it turned out, considering I didn‚Äôt really have high expectations going into it. When I wasn‚Äôt wanting to murder my character for not grappling to things correctly, it was quite fun and adventurous. I‚Äôd recommend this to players 10-13ish. I find that that demographic would love this game more then I did. Was very enjoyable, but would get too frustrating.

7.8/10"
10950,"This game both had a iceberg of a story that is mare than it seems and had engaging, challenging, nonviolent gameplay."
10951,"Ok so I don't reccommend buying at full price.  It's an original indie game that I took 2.7 hours to beat playing casually.  Therfore, it is better to wait for it to go on sale - ideally in the $2-4 range.  It's a game for a lazy or a rainy day."
10952,I like this game a lot.  It was a very fresh take on 1st person platforming.  Although [SPOILER] the whole game is left up to your interpretation as a player.  Was it real?  Was it not?
10953,"The game is cool and fun to mess around on, but gets really boring... If you like getting stuck on levels, doing nothing, and having a weird frog ride on your back while you swing around a cave or something, this game is for you!"
10954,"Do you want to feel like Spiderman? Here's your chance!  In A Story About My Uncle you are settling down with your daughter to put her to bed for the night and she asks you to tell her a story.  So you recount your adventure to find your Uncle.  Your Uncle is a quirky inventor who created a terrific body suit that can grapple and swing from long distances.  He also created a teleport pad to a new and wondrous world, and this is where you went to find him.  

This intro gives the game a bit of a ""Princess Bride"" feel in that throughout the game you will hear conversations between you and your daughter as commentary on the story.  It's very cute, but I can imagine that the appeal of this cuteness is going to be more for adults than younger players.  

The game is played through three primary settings.  The first setting will introduce you to the primary mechanic of the game, as well as the population of the world your uncle is adventuring in.  The second setting will augment your primary grapple ability and force you to creatively 'swing' from point to point.  The final stage introduces a new rocket boot mechanic and significantly ramps up the difficulty.  Even with the higher degree of difficulty, save points are plentiful.  You may find a few sections that require multiple sequences of swings before saving, but in most cases you will be rewarded with a save point at each step of forward progress.  In some cases there are multiple ways to move ahead, and you may even find that you traverse some sections by accident.  

As I neared the conclusion of the game, I found that I alternated between frustration and joy.  Some maneuvers are truly difficult as you must master releasing the grapple at just the right moment to avoid flying directly into the object you have attached to.  In some case you cannot see the next grapple point until you have already committed to a jump.  The joy comes from the authentic feeling of flight and swinging, of completing a particularly difficult move.  I sometimes found myself, shoulders tensed, 'ducking' to avoid rocks and outcroppings.  

A common complaint is that the game is short.  In an age of $3 apps, it can be hard to justify spending over $10 on a game that you may finish in less time than a standard length movie.  Even so, I feel like the experience is worth recommending."
10955,"Fun, cool mechanics, cool and somewhat challenging story. Not much replay value but it was worth 8/10"
10956,"Pretty good game, fun mechanics.  At least at the beginning.  Near the end of the game, you just want to pull your hair out.  My completionist nature made me beat it though, and I'm glad I did. B+"

10958,bought during the summer sale and loved it although it is very fun it is also a short game. If you want to buy something that  is well worth the money you might want to look at other games.
10959,"The story is great, the graphics are great, the music is great, the levels are great, the game is great. Buy it NOW."
10960,"Written Version

A Story About My Uncle is a game that presented itself to me as quite promising with its amazing atmosphere which sucked me in from the beginning. I was later led to disappointment as I realized just how little story there actually is and that the game relies on using cliffhangers to keep the player going. I was fine with this until I completed the game and was left quite unsatisfied. The game made me very eager to see just what would happen next as I swung from stage to stage hoping that I'd get some dialogue. The ending left me quite disappointed as I saw the developer could've done much more with the game. A lot of players have trouble with this game (refer to the other reviews for this, mostly the negative). I find that this is what gives players their play time. The developer is asking $13 for a game that could take a player 1-3 hours to complete (depending on just how much they die).

-----------------------------------------------------

Pro/Con Version

Pros

- What little dialogue there is can drive your curiosuity enough to keep you playing.
- Amazing atmosphere.
- Fun gameplay.

Cons

- Very little dialogue.
- 1-3 hours of gameplay.
- Monotone narrator/unconvincing voice actors (don't let the narrator's beautiful voice fool you!)
- Massive price tag for how long the game is.


-----------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: I'd say get it on sale, it's a very fun game however its price tag is just quite demanding. For a story based game the story really isn't there; the atmosphere is. You could get something that'll get you more for your buck elsewhere."
10961,"Loved the game! Although the game was short (took me a total of 2 hours logged into the game, over the course of 2 days) I think it was the perfect length. It was explained as a bed time story, so it wasn't supposed to be long. I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, and for those who love a few challenges."
10962,"Bought this game during the summer sale and I have to say it is one of the most beautiful games I have played in a while.
If you like platformers this is a great one with a decent story and great places to explore"
10963,"Great and simple story, wonderful graphics and world elements, fantastic physics. This game is a wonderful rendition of someones idea and it is pretty light hearted as well. It has some replay value as there are collectables and pretty difficult achievements. The real only con of this game is the price, I got this on sale for 8$, and I think it was worth my money then. I do not think it is worth more than that due to the length of the game, which took me roughly 3 hours to complete the main story. There are time trials, but they don't make up for the short story, even if it great. I still recomend this game, but buy it [b] when it is on sale."
10964,"[h1]""A Story About My Uncle""[/h1]
(The combination of puzzle and arcade game where speed and precision is very important.)

Game that allows us to impersonate nephew of scientist, inventor, uncle Fred.

What is this game all about? 
Father puts daughter to bed, but she did not agree to sleep until she hear a bedtime story.. Dad goes to the memories of event in the past, when one day he came to Uncle Fred's home. But he did not find Uncle at home. Instead he met there an amazing suit and then accidentally moved to another world.

He turned out that the suit in the new world gives amazing abilities. 

The main part of the gameplay makes a great impression - [u]high jumping[/u], [u]flying in the air[/u] on a special beam of energy, snapping to objects and after unlocked [u]rocket boots[/u] - everything works really effective.

A Story About My Uncle chain us to a monitor with fairytale atmosphere. 
Like the entrace to the world of dreams - [u]lovely[/u] [u]landscape[/u] in pastel colors and all this highlighted by a [u]brilliant[/u] [u]soundtrack[/u].

10965,"Legit spiderman simulator 2069

FPS spiderman, 69/10, would spin web again"
10966,"A Story about my Uncle is very pleasent to the eyes and ears; with the the subtle background music and the art design. The game has a nice story presented in the way of a father telling his daughter his adventure. At times the game get difficult with the more abilites you gain, such as three grapples and the rocket boots. Overall Story about my Uncle has nice puzzle solving aspects and good story."
10967,"Pretty good, especially if you like platformer games. Landscape is like a mix of Tak 2, Rayman, and Jak and Daxter. It's a pretty short game, so you should probably get it on sale. Still, pretty fun; I think they should make a sequel or remaster it, with a much longer story/more realistic movement and world interaction (not that the movement isn't realistic already, but as in greater player model->world physics/detail)."
10968,short but sweet.
10969,fun game and very replayable but the main campaign is to short i beat it in 1 hour and 20 minutes.
10970,tis a very fun game with a gud story
10971,"This was probably one of the most beautiful and frustrating games I've ever played. I really don't know why I had to try some things for...I don't know.. 60 times before I made it, but nontheless it was an amazing journey through a beautiful designed world and it touched my heart more than I thought it would. 

Bought it in Summer Sale, it was really worth the money. 
"
10972,"Such a great game, the story is great, the gameplay is AWESOME, the graphics are amazing. What's not to love about it?"
10973,"Absolutely amazing game, would definetely recommend it. The story is very short but interesting and overall pretty good."
10974,"Short but impressive.
I lose myself when I play this game
The atmosphere is lovely and of course amazing story that not boring at all
Highly recomend it."
10975,"The story is interesting and the game is fun. The mechanics can be wonky at times but most would not mind.

An all aroung great game."
10976,"Only took a couple of hours to complete but it was a pleasant little game. Definately worth pick up during a sale.

It's quite pretty for what it is so it's certainly eay on the eyes, although some of the animations can look a little janky at times. Music is great too and the voice acting while nothing spectacular is alright... the narrator does a fairly decent job of portraying emotion and there's just the right amount. Every spoken line has a purpose and/or meaning and I actually enjoyed listening to it... which is more than can be said for most games I play.

Controls are normally quite responsive and simple get the the hang of. I did find myself dying on a few occassions in which my grapple would have a delya before displaying the beam resulting in my clicking again and using a charge which I would need before my next landing. Not being too concerned about perfecting the game however, this didn't really bother me.

I'm not sure if I'll pick the game up again and attempt to get some of the achievements. There's certainly that element of replayability to it, but I'm worried I might ruin my enjoyable initial playthrough by getting frustrated at not getting those :)"
10977,"To start this game has a great atmosphere. This is one of those games that are hard to come by these days that have a good short Story mixed in with great game mechanics/ gameplay. The story is short in the respect that to finish the story the story takes 2 -3 hours, but if you want to challage yourself there are achevements for going through each area perfictly. I'm a pennypincher and I bought this on sale for around 4$ and it was totally worth my time and money. If your into a good short story, good gameplay and game mechanics that are unique this is your game.
"
10978,"This is an excellent, short video game. You play as a person exploring a strange, alien world with a grapple, double jump glove. While clearly produced on a budget (shorter length and some slightly average voice acting), the gameplay is nevertheless fantastic and makes the whole experience very worthwhile. It is probably better played with mouse and keyboard than controller, as I found some of the constant, quick movements in the later game were exhausting with a controller but far more enjoyable with mouse and keyboard. Definitely worth playing."
10979,"An interesting stroy and visually impressive environments combine with fun and fast puzzle-based gaemplay to create a pretty awesome experience.  However, the grappling beam occasionally won't hook onto surfaces it should, which makes some of the puzzles borderline unsolvable until the system works through whatever kink is causing the problem.  With that caveat, if you enjoy light hearted story driven puzzle games with epic visuals, check this game out."
10980,"I full heartedly loved this game. It was amazing in every aspect. I would highly recommend this to my friends. This game is a 10/10. The graphics still look amazing on low settings. I wish that the game was a little longer, though. If you played it for a few hours straight, you could finish it in a day."
10981,"This is just an awesome game.  It looks gorgeous, is fun, and the story is really nice.  The voice acting is limited, but I found it oddly compelling.  It isn't overly challenging, but that actually made it better.  I really hope they make a sequel and don't change the basic gameplay.  For me, this game is easily an 8/10.

EDIT:  My opinion of this game has only grown more positive since I wrote my initial submission.  I definitely consider this game a 10/10.  I've gone back and replayed it a number of times and have unlocked the achievements.  Honestly, everything about this game is about perfect.  The mechanics are just really great.  The story is not what you think it is--there is a hidden story really buried that you probably would never notice.  Once you finish the game, go read the forums and get that info--it completely changes the tone of the entire game.  The graphics are art are just stunning although some might find fault with the character design (I don't).  The sound design & music are also superb.  

I've been playing computer games for the better part of 25 years, and this game--although short--is truly brilliant.  The team that made it are incredibly talented and I'm extremely disappointed that they've produced nothing of note since this was released a few years ago."
10982,good game should buy.
10983,"Bought it for $2.79 during the 2016 Summer Sale and that price justifies the amount of content in this game. Short game (2-4 hours, depending on how many times you die) with an OK narrative and fun grappling mechanics. Only problem I have with it is sometimes the grappling system doesn't register when the HUD's indicator lights up, leading you to fall to your death. Using a Mouse/Keyboard for this game is significantly better than using a controller, as you have more precise aiming for your grapples and rocket jumps."
10984,"Nice game. It's more like an experience. You won't find any challenges in this game.
But for 3 hours you will be captured by the nicely told story and the great gameplay.
After that, it's up to you if you want to get all the hidden objects and doing time trials.

I got the game for less than 3‚Ç¨ during sales times, but wouldn't recommend buying it for the full price(13‚Ç¨)."
10985,"great game 
it has a moving story great core gameplay and would recomend to anybody who likes games with an amazing story and spectaculor gameplay"
10986,"I am not a big gamer.

This game has the best graphic of all games I have played, Medium difficulty to me, those when the saving points are too far apart would give me some greif.
The story is OK, especially consider that this is a bed time story for a little girl to start with. 

It's almost worth ¬£10 in my oppnion, but I got it in steam sale so I feel really really luck.

The only thing that marked the price down is simply the game is a little bit short, and I can't criticise any other things."
10987,"Adventure games like this should exist more often, they really should make a second one. With the added time trials it is replayable but after awhile it gets really boring, the first time is really the best experience."
10988,"This game is more laid-back and is perfect for more relaxed gamers wishing to play a beautiful game with a good story. The game is what you make it to be. If you want to just focus on the parkour, then so be it, but if you want to find all the secrets and extra story-bits then the game becomes something entirely different. The different levels are all stunning and the backgrounds complete it."
10989,"Played and finished the game over the course of two days. What a whimisical game and experience. It was the perfect length and very entertaining, challenging at parts but never fustrating. This game has a ton of heart and is super fun to play and look at. I really recommend it."
10990,It has a beautiful story. Just buy this and hear the story...
10991,[spoiler]Cyberbully[/spoiler]
10992,"Thought this was a testimony to a molestation trial, was dissapointed.
0/10 thought I found a relatable game."
10993,Bit too short and a bit too easy but I enjoyed it. Get it if you want something fun and relaxing
10994,Beautiful and enjoyable.
10995,"It is a very good game, Very short though which is kinda bummer. But to be honest, i really enjoyed it. The Gameplay was cool and enjoyable, and the best part is that i didn't look up on youtube for ''Let's Play'' or ''Walkthrough'', and by that i mean that the game gave me suprises and emotions beyond my regular gameplay experience that i usually get when i play games. This game brings a lot of emotions, Fear, Happiness, Curious, Sadness. it has its flaws here and there but i didn't notice anything unusual in sight, and i must say that a game like this could bring a whole trilogy without a doubt and i look forward for an sequel(or maybe prequel) if there is any planned. Enough said, i would give this game a 9/10. 
my reasons for the rating:
-1: It was short, but i would love to see a DLC or something to extend the story/gameplay.

Overall, i recommend this game to those who are ''Story''-lovers or to those who just want to take a deep breath from all the ''Hardcore'' games and just relax and enjoy a free ride in this amazing story."
10996,This game is incerdible. It just flows so nicely and i have a shit PC and i experienced no issues in gameplay on full settings. I love the momentum factor and also the speed! Gotta love doing 50 meter long jumps between floating islands and rocks :D Anyway i love this game and would totally recomend it to anyone who loves a good story and fun gamplay mechanics.
10997,"Great game with incredible gameplay mechanics. IT IS NOT WORTH FULL PRICE THOUGH. Picked this up for 2 bucks. Worth it. 10 on the other hand, isn't."
10998,"One of best thing that ever happened to me.
The story is a little choppy in my opinion but the core element of the game by which I mean the Puzzles are fantastic.
Looking forward to the next iteration from it's developers"
10999,"A really enjoyable platformer with great artstyle and a cute, interesting story. The biggest problem is that it's rather short. I completed it in about 3 hours, but I didn't do any of the time trials or went out of my way to hunt for collectibles or achievements so there are probably a few more hours of content there. I'm not 100% sure it's worth the full price, but if you see it on sale don't hesitate to buy it."
11000,"So glad I tried this game. The gameplay is immensely atmospheric, thanks to the stunning visual. The way how the player proceeds through the levels is pretty enjoyable too, and - as somebody said - makes you feel free as you fly among rocks, ice and fluctuating villages. The storytelling is excellent, it really makes you feel part of the story. The only things I would have liked to see are two: firstly, it would have been interesting to have characters interact with you in a more engaging way, as only Maddie seems to create a real bond with the protagonist. This may have been made on purpose, though, so to have the player creating a special relationship with her. In a second instance, the ending would have been more enjoyable if letting the character a bit deeper into the reasons why the ending was to be like that. The ending itself could have been pretty different and more tricky for the player. It's fine and poetic as it is, but a longer and intenser engagement with what was to happen would have created a better climax and would have impacted the player and challenged him/her into reflecting about it. As it is, the ending is way too fast to leave a significant mark in the overall experience.

PS: It also runs smoothly on my laptop, which is 2.6GHz dualcore and 4GB Ram, so not too powerful"
11001,"Though it is extremely short, the controls are tight and reponsive, making the game fell worth while. 

Its a bit harsh at full price for the base gameplay, so pick it up on sale if your interested in a short and cool platformer."
11002,"PROS:
-Great Game
-Wonderful Story
-Innovative and Creative Mechanics

CONS:
-Very Short
-High Price (for length of game)

OVERALL: 7/10"
11003,Let's platform and not see our feet
11004,"This was a neat, short, first person platformer. There was a bit of story, but where it really shone was in the gameplay. Very responsive controls, controls that made sense. 

It wasn't too long, nor was it too short. It was just right. There were a few more challenging bits, with one section in particular. 

I highly recommend this game, to almost anyone. Great stuff."
11005,This game is really smooth and the game looks amazing it is great if you are stuck inside all day but the controls are kind of annoying at times like when try to leap but just do a jump but it really is a great game
11006,"I found the game beautiful and the story exciting, but the gameplay became repetitive and lackluster after an hour."
11007,"An amazing game, i do recommend it to every single one gamer out there! 100000/10 :D"
11008,It's a good game.
11009,"This was truly a great game. A good mix of narrative for the store driven player, and gameplay for the pure gamer. Once you finish the game, i highly recommend looking up interpretations of the game as a whole. Really makes you wonder."
11010,"What a nice and beautiful couple of hours of a game. Awesome controls, flying through the air feels right. Environments are breathtaking and reminiscent of Bioshock Infinite in that sense. Definitely recommend."
11011,Journey but better
11012,"Great, great game! I really enjoyed every second! Great gameplay, cute story, and best of all just straight up original."
11013,"A very neat game/experience about swinging around, looking at beautiful scenery and feeling the world is boundless.

Without spoiling the story, it is a dreamlike-esque setting about following a ''magic-techno'' uncle whom went in a God-knows-where sureal place and you, a little boy, feel like it is a reasonable idea to try to find him. A great story as it really goes well with the visual and gameplay and all of this makes a very great package. I also feel Maddie, I am somewhat like her.

The only ''bad'' thing about the game are the character model and animation. These are awful! But the rest is superbe and I highly recommend to any atmosphere connoisseur and puzzle platformer enthusiat."
11014,"I havent enjoyed a game like this in such a long time! 10/10 for me :D Get it while its on sale!

11015,"A Story about my uncle...where to begin 

The game has great visuals and makes you feel part of the world as you are flying thru the sky .The story telling ,voice acting , music was amazing bringing a tear to my eye at the end (don't worry no spoilers) . The obstacles difficulty provides fun while remaining a challenge  .So for the price , quality and length of the game I would definitely recommend this masterpiece (Hoping they release a follow up title or something very similar in the near future)"
11016,"Note: This is my first real review where I have actually put effort into it, so  bear with me. 

 A Story About My Uncle 

Pros:
- amazing gameplay, atmoshpheric. 
-  fun, and very cheap on the steam sale.
- easy to learn how to play, not a stressful game. 
- really nice story. 
- short, but for what I payed, worth it. 

Cons:
- too short, I find myself wanting to play more but the game is only 3 hours long.

11017,Best game 2k16 XD Best story ive ever come across 10/10 IGN
11018,"I really enjoyed playing this game. The whole point of this game is travelling through a mystical world, trying to find your uncle. It has a cute story and the graphics are great, aswell. Unfortunately, the game is rather short - I finished it in 3 hours. However, some jumps are not too easy so it doesn't get dull.

10/10 would play again, hoping for a sequel!"
11019,"So, I just finished the game and it was fun. I must say it was a short game (about 2-3 hours) but it has something that makes you want to play it. +It has great graphics and runs smoothly. 

Also i found some parts boring because you do the same thing over and over, but in general it was a fun game that it's worth spending time on it. Personally I bought it in summer sales for about 3 euros and i don't think it's worth for 12 because of its length. If you see the game on sale snatch it up!"
11020,"Although the game lacks in length the graphics, controls, and story are phenomenal! I finished the entire game in one sitting as the characters are compelling and the scenery is great (even for low end computers). Overall I'd buy this game on sale as the price is not worth the time played but still a great game!"
11021,"A Story About My Uncle... hands down my new favourite game and i finished it in 3 hours, now my old favourite game was csgo i have over 2000 hours on it. I can definitely tell you this game is worth the money and the time to play it, gorgeous and super interesting story line and gameplay. Please do your self a favour and get this game."
11022,"The game is amazing. Wonderful graphics, an amazing atmosphere and reall awesome music! I'd definetly recommend buying this one."
11023,"Verry buttifull game.
Not to difficult but possible.
10/10 would play again."
11024,"Very nice little game. Beautiful graphics and a nice and harmless story. Gameplay mechanics are good fun and can be quite challenging at times. 
Only downside: its a bit short. Depending on your playstyle you'll see the credits in about 2-3h. But in my optinion totally worth it."
11025,"One of the best games I have played in a while. 10/10

Cons: Absolutely None"
11026,"This game looks and plays great, it may be short but everything else makes up for it."
11027,"My friend called me a Jew so I bought this game.

I just like money









I have nothing against jews I swear"
11028,"Good game. Good mechanics. Not the best voice actors, like you can tell they were reading a script. Game is beautiful but very short. would enjoy it much more if it had a much more expansive story. but other than that game is good. 7/10"
11029,this game is awsome i recomend this game for all guys/girls who want fun
11030,"Brilliant 3-4 hour experience. Definitely wouldn't pay full price, but on a sale it's worth it. Beautiful graphics/style and a compelling story, not to mention fantastic controls."
11031,"a story of my uncle is a very intersting game but the some parts of the story was confusing dued to the fact on where to go next to continue the journey. Another thing i didnt like about the story line is dat is was very short it was only 2 hrs of gameplay.But besides it is such a fun game.
"
11032,"This game has a great story! And has great gameplay! It may be short, but it's quite enjoyable."
11033,"Really frustrating if you're using a controller. The grappler doesn't always ""grab"". Sometimes you hit an object at an angle and you are bounced through the map. 

I abandoned it before finishing the ""tutorial"" levels."
11034,good
11035,great game 10/10
11036,"Though the game is advertised as a story-based adventure game, it revolves mainly around the Portal-like platform puzzles. The plot starts off promising, but will dissapoint later in the game as the emphasis shifts to the jumping and grappling. Overall still worth the ‚Ç¨3.50."
11037,"Although a very short game it makes up for it, with beautiful visuals and a very touching storyline"
11038,"A Story About My Uncle.
Works great with all music and a lot of tricks involved. The creator must've been a genuis for this game. There are some games that come and go every year and some that come once in a lifetime.This is one that comes in only a lifetime.
9.5/10, noticed nothing but a few crashes."
11039,"While the gameplay mechanic is fun (grappling hook, etc.) and the art direction is lovely, ultimately this game is very frustrating. In the 2nd half of the game, the checkpoints get unevenly placed, often requiring you to re-do some frustrating platforming. 

What's more is that you have to be at a precise range for your grappling hook to be activated. I had a couple of occasions where I missed my intended point by just a few inches which made me plunge to my death. And since the checkpoint was a bit way back, I had to do some sections before I could get back to the frustrating part to retry. If I missed it, it was back to square one.

This could've been avoided if the checkpoints were placed right before the frustrating bits. But nope, it wasn't. And if I failed a certain point it took way too long for the game to restart from the previous checkpoint as you have to waste too much time seeing your character plunge to his death. Sometime you don't even know where to go and you end up just dying and have to watch the overly long plunging animation.. Just make the time before restarting from the previous checkpoint just a bit shorter and place the checkpoints immediately before frustrating parts and this would've been a gem.

The story is nothing to write about and ultimately this game could've done with a couple more play testing and refinements before release to minimize frustration. And it is a bit short for its full asking price. Ultimately, a game's ultimate objective is to make the player have fun and not leave the gamer with a frustrating experience."
11040,"great game, cute story, challenging at times but still fun. 10/10 should play"
11041,"I got this game from my friend and I absolutely love it!
It's a bedtime story that a father tells his daughter. 
What is the story about? It's kinda obvious from the name :P
Anyways, the music is really calming, just like the gameplay, except from the parts when you get lost or you struggle to jump on something or grapple on a flying rock or search for beeping machines... err...
Oh and maybe it's just me, but the cursor felt a bit slow, I mean the latency is high or something, not sure."
11042,Loved it
11043,"Short story but simple and enjoyable gameplay. Wouldn't have paid full price, worth it on sale."
11044,Love it.
11045,"Although the game is a little short (I finished in under three hours), it has a lot of replayability as the gameplay itself is really unique and interesting. I also really like the method of storytelling (the game does have dialogue, and an interesting story).
I did get the game in the summer sale for roughly $3.00 NZD, and it is DEFINITELY worth it! Possibly the game I'm the most glad I got in the summer sale, because otherwise I probably wouldn't have risked buying it."
11046,"I payed $3 on sale for this game and honestly it was one of the best $3 ive ever spent. Althought he games storyline is rather short the story, gameplay and the graphics make up for that. It is truely a great game but im not sure if i would pay the normal $15.99 price for this game because of how short the storyline is.

EDIT: AFter spending $3 on the witcher 2. I have to say that was the best $3 Ive ever spent."
11047,"It's alright - pretty graphics, solid grappling hook mechanics. Sometimes a bit frustrating. Short - was done in 3 hours or so. Makes for a good interactive bedtime story."
11048,kek
11049,Short game but the gameplay and story are awesome!!
11050,"This Game Has A Great Story With A Little Bit Of A Let Down Ending But All Together It Makes A Really Nice Game With A Great Story And Great Gameplay.

One Thing I Dont Like About This Game Is It Gets To Hard To Quickly."
11051,"Amazing.  Flying the the air, grappling off of the floating rocks is exhilarating.  The design and artwork of the game is beautiful.  The story keeps you interesting.  A game I will never forget playing.  Definitely worth a playthrough.  Fantastic game."
11052,"Decent game. Somewhat similar to portal but replaces the humour with a story. Only a few hours long, but worth the price on sale."
11053,"this is one of the best game I've ever played in my life, even though I finished it in 3 hours of playtime, I still like it a lot. The feeling about playing this game is just differently awesome for me.

11/10"
11054,"This is a very unique game with great mechanics, controls, narration, story and characters. When you play this game you feel as if you're actually gliding fom one place to another and it feels awesome. This game has an almost perfect learning curve for learning new mechanics. My only complaint is that the game is too short and is too expensive at normal price. I'd recommend you buy while it is on sale. 8.1/10"
11055,"This game its contain :
- Jumping (really high) 
- Run (and leaping) 
- laser grapling hook
- Breathtaking in every stage
- 'Im kinda that guy'  Story
- more jumping
- Floor is Lava (because the island is floating) 

Cons : Not recommended for gamers who phobia about high ground

Pros : Recommended for gamers who loves Jumping and Running game
"
11056,"Amazing game 
Great story 
So fun shame it was so short 
10/10 loved it !!!"
11057,This game is absolutely beautiful. I would rate 800/10 if I could. I do have to say there were maybe two parts where I failed 10+ times but otherwise I thought the game was awesome. It's amazing how you can play a full story in 2-5 hours and fully enjoy it. Buy this game if you have never played it.
11058,"This game is fun. the controls are fun. the game had no issues working, so that was nice. it has some replay in it for you if you enjoy that."
11059,"Amazing game and defintely worth the 2.59$ price tag during the summer sale. The story is overall pretty good, but the last mission ending was kind of weird. Graphics are amazing as they are running on Unreal Engine 4. This game would be more than worth it, and could also start up a great community if it were to add Steam Workshop capability. I would give this game a 8.5/10.


EDIT: I made sure to buy this game becuase I saw Leafy play it. Don't judge me."
11060,"Awesome Story, Great Graphics, Easy To Run. 8/10"
11061,"This is an incredible game. Definitely worth the purchase. There are a few frustrating moments which I had to play over countless times to get through. I was playing with a controller though, and I'm sure a keyboard and mouse would be much easier. This game has a great story and great mechanics. I recommend it highly."
11062,"Hey devs, I have an idea. I believe that to make this game even better, add a workshop feature where people can make their own maps and post them to the workshop. Thanks!"
11063,"I can't recommend this game enough. 
I don't think I have done any serious reviews ever, but this game deserves one.

The world got me so into everything, really making me feel the impact as I slammed against the ground, and it never got boring. It's a shame the game is short. I got about 1 1/2 hours out of it, but considering I bought it for 80% off I regret absolutely nothing. The story is cute, and you got attached to Maddie really quick. Not gonna lie, I spent a good 20 minutes on the part where she challenged me. Wonder what the challenge is? Buy the bloody game!
Gah, I just want to spoil everything! But I can't recommend you to get this enough!

Just gonna put some quick pros and cons in here.

Pros:
- Beautiful world, really immersive.
- Truly great animations.
- A cute story to go with it all.
- A REALLY good platforming game. Being challenging but at the same time not making it too hard (if you know what I mean, but maybe I just suck xD).
- You don't need a beast computer to run it, even with the fantastic graphics! I know cause my computer is not that great.

Cons:
- I didn't really go into the game expecting alot of action, but I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't more hostile creatures in the world, it was really exciting when the first one showed up, atleast had my heart beating a bit.
- I had a problem with sound, where as if I was facing a character while they were talking it would be very quiet so I had to turn to the side to hear them properly. Maybe this was just me but it was a little bit annoying.

- The ending was good, but left me with a good amount of questions. Maybe that is on purpose though, makes you want to go back into the world and play around with it even more. Didn't know where to put this on the pros and cons list so it got its own section! :D

I am new to the whole review thing, so be nice pl0x!

9,5/10 just because the sound thing and the shortness of the game. I WANT MORE!"
11064,"such a great platformer. one of the best ones ive played. Very atmospheric and the graphics are good. Good storyline. Anyone who likes challenging platformers and fast paced games, this is a game for you. Buy it now its on sale."
11065,It is a great game but it is too short. I wouldn't say that it is worth buying the game with its full price
11066,"This game has a wonderful sense of adventure and the gameplay is fun.

Pros- 
Sense of adventure makes you feel like a kid again.
soundtrack is nice.
mechanics are solid
Speedrunners would love this game.
Frog girl waifu.

Cons-
The death scenes are a little long, sometimes in a difficult section this makes it a little repetitive.
Its a little short.

Over all I think its a fantastic game, but I probably wouldnt spend $12.99 for it.  at the current $2.59 sale though IT'S A STEAL!
"
11067,"I enjoyed the game a lot! The story isn't pushed right in your face, you have to watch out for details while playing. The art and the story are beautifully crafted. However there are a few frustrating parts (SPOILER indicating the name of a future level:[spoiler]ice cave[/spoiler]) which made me take a few breaks and the story is a bit short. If you're not sure whether to buy it during the current summer sale or on future discounts, I say give it a go! If you're not sure whether to buy it at full price, don't do it, you might get dissapointed.

Tech wise: the game runs fine under Win 10 and slower GPUs/CPUs still should be able to handle it. Controls are responsive and well layed out."
11068,"I originally bought this game on a whim without giving much thought to it, I just needed another game. Then one day afterwards I was bored so I took the time and actually downloaded it. I was expecting some cheap, poorly designed game which was graphically cancer, but what I got was so much more. This game really was fun to play, sometimes after repeatedly dying it got annoying, but my perserverance to finish this game honestly made it all the more better. If you're bored and want a great game to play, definitely spend the time and money to purchase this game and see it to the end."
11069,"really good, great gameplay great ending, just wish there was more of it"
11070,"This game is confusing to me. On one hand, I like the game play, I like it a lot. Or actually, I like the idea of the game play. Yes the game is a first person platforming game with a grappling hook mechanic and thats the reason why I even got the game in the first place, that sounds awesome, right? Well while the game does offer this, it feels slow for some reason, especially early game. I was also disippointed by the level design, it was very basic and linear, which from a game where you swing from floating rocks I was hoping it would be more expansive to make and chose my own paths. That being said the game play is fine for the games short play time (2 hrs) and is at least some what enjoyable.

Now where the game really faltures is its story. Its terrible, boring, and most of all unengaging. The base is a father telling his daughter a story about trying to find his uncle in an underground world. Now this is a good set up, endless possiblities here, but they just settle on the most basic one. No twist or turns, no surprises, no nothing. Just you and this ugly as fuck frog person going through the world looking for you uncle. If you think thats cool, you're wrong, mainly because none of the characters have anything intersting to say. And the voice acting is pretty sub-par (except for the main character, his voice was kinda sexy)

All in all this game is a disappointment, I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect it to be this eh."
11071,"Lovely little two hour game! easily dooable in a sitting! was a nice simple taste of story and fun smooth gameplay!
Would recomend especialy on the sale for ¬£3!!! 

8/10"
11072,"Fuuucckk this game
That graphics are nice i guess but fuck that I wanted a good story tbh but what I got was a less than 2 hour crap with shitty fucking voice acting and an annoying ass frog bitch
The gameplay was decent at best but gets boring after awhile
I would only recommend the game when on sale (which it is currently) but surely not for $13

And now time for a rating because you care about what a random person on steam thinks about a game
3/10 wouldn't carry stupid frog bitch again"
11073,The gameplay isnt that long only about 3 hours worth but its an amzing game it has lots of challenges and the story is pretty good. 11/10
11074,its very good but short
11075,"I was actually able to beat this game, and refund it.

This game is a lot of fun, would 10/10 recommend if you like platformers."
11076,What an amazing game. I just picked it up because it was on sale and it's noe 6 AM and I just finished it after 3.5 good hours. You just have to get to the end I love it! The scenery and the music are so relaxing and captivating.
11077,Very nice platformer with a great story!!!!!
11078,"First, i bought this game from summer sale 2016, and i can honestly say it was worth it. Game was at 80 % discount, i could not ask for more.

Personally, i wanted to play this game from its gameplay which looked quite fun but the price was too much for me to pay. 

This review is coming from a guy who plays mostly AAA titles and does not look into games like this.

Coming to game, the gameplay is absolutely fun. Grapplling all the way, running fast, jumping and finding ways with absolutely epic scenery, who could ask for anything more from a game like this.

Story is fair, i wouldnt call it good neither i will call it bad. Its average, ending is what i expected it to be. But i really enjoyed this game. Too bad this game was finished in just 3.2 hours. though i didnt search much for collectables. You can of course go beyond average level and find collectables.


Game is pretty great but i wont recommend paying a full price for it. Buy it in sales, it is worth it in the discount. Very satisfied. Good job devs."
11079,"The game takes about 2 hours to finish if you are decent with the mechanics. Also, there are a lot of save points so even if you do mess up you are not punished for it. Overall a good game. I would not pay full price for it but for $2.50 it was very much worth it."
11080,"Great game, good story, fluid gameplay. Game is somewhat short depending on how fast you go through it, but very good regardless. Definetly a good buy."
11081,"Beautiful game, a work of art. The gameplay is fun enough for people to not care about the art style,story,characters but as a whole this game is truly beautiful. Amazing job Gone North.  

Small critique; 
The village and decorations although beautiful are lacking in textures, looks outdated, this is true for the characters as well"
11082,"a fun game while it lasted would'nt pay full price but, getting it on sale is worth it.
7.5/10"
11083,"I have replaying this game about 3 times.. It's flawless.  It takes you through a series of adventures involving parkour and strategy, while still having the ""fun aspect."" One of my favorite games of all time."
11084,"For a game that announces itself as a ""story"" about an uncle, the narrative of this game is lacking. Mechanically and visually this game is stunning though, and by game's end I don't feel as if my time was wasted, so I'd recommend it. Maybe wait for a sale."
11085,"The graphics amd atmosphere were amazing which tie into solid gameplay. It was a journey, however brief. Overall, I would reccomend this if you love first person platforming and a mezmorizing exerience. Just dont expect much replay value unless you want to go for absurd achievements."
11086,"I finished this game for 3h. It was interesting, but it was short."
11087,"A Story About My Uncle is a narrative about the last time the narrator met his adventurous uncle, in a strange world of  floating rock formations large enough to hold small towns. The gameplay is that of a platformer with an energy grappling hook to help you traverse the large gaps of empty space.

If the game is on sale, there is [b]absolutely[/b] no reason not to buy it."
11088,"I bought this game on the steam summer sale for $2.59. There are a couple things that you have to know about this game before you buy it.
1) The story is very short. I was able to complete the game in a little over two hours.
2) The character animation (other than your hand's) is very basic. not horrible by any means, but when you see an npc running towards or away from something, you can easilly see that they're ""slipping"" on the ground they're running on.
3) At times the narrator can seem bleak, and toneless (the daughter was great in my opinion).

4) The gameplay was fun as shit! i dont think i've ever played a game where i had this much fun with the movement. being able to charge up your suit and jump really high/really far, then use the grapple hand thing (which is also totally awesome) to grab onto a floating rock only to fling yourself higher is just amazing!
5) The story (short as it was) was very enjoyable to me. it gave you just enough to keep you interested in what was being said, but not too much that you contemplate turning your speakers off.
6) i don't know if it was because they're wasn't that much happening on the screen at one time or what, but the game not only looks great, but ran at a smooth 60fps the entire time (it's not a huge game so you would expect that, but i've seen simpler game's get worse framerates).

Overall this was (in my opinion) an amazing game. the story was a little short, and the character models/animation could use a little more work, but the amazing graphics, decent story, and unbelievably fun gameplay make up for the imperfections that this game has. I had a hell of a lot more fun than I thought I would playing this game. I really hope the developers take the hint, and make this into something huge. knowing how much i would enjoy the game, I would have gladly bought it at full price."
11089,"Best 2.59$ that I've spent in my life.

Pros:
+Good puzzles
+Fun gameplay
+Emotional story
+Decent graphics
+Great atmosphere

Cons:
- Too short ( It took me 3 hours to complete the game)

9/10"
11090,"What can I possibly say about this game to some it up, nothing to be perfectly honest. I bought this game on sale as a time waster and didnt expect much from a ¬£2 down from ¬£12 game. I was expecting a shoddy game without much of a story line and something I would play for half an hour, get bored, and then never play it again. 
This changed as soon as i loaded it up, i could already tell from the music, the simplicity of the main menu, it was my type of game. I got in and was amazed by the beautiful scenery, the dialog made me feel as if i were living the game myself, and i was happily surprised. I wont say what the game is about other then that it really is an adventure, it made me feel wholesome inside once completing and although it was only a couple hours play time at most it left me feeling fulfilled and perfectly happy with the way it ended. The short time i played this game was just enough for me to really feel how the character felt and i genuinly felt the emotions of the character (or what i thought them to be).
 I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves short but effective games like this one. I cannot say how much i enjoyed the experience of this game."
11091,it is so much fun
11092,"There is a lot that is good about the game.  Style, atmosphere, overall concept.  At first it is very engaging and fun.  Then it gets challenging and there are some easter eggs.  Then suddenly it gets nearly impossible.  The minor glitches in the mechanics become crippling, and the game becomes repetitive and frustrating.  When you spend 10 minutes trying to make the same series of ""jumps"" 40 times before you make it, that's just not fun to me.  The fact that there is an auto save after every single one of these is a clear indication the devs knew how insanely hard it was, so once you got lucky enough to make it you didn't want to have to try again.  Now if that type of game is fun for you, this game is fantastic.  Personally it burned me out real fast.  What you see in the trailer is the best it has to offer, and those moments are great.  Unfortunately for every one of those there are 5 that make you lose you mind.  By comparison Mirror's Edge and Portal 2 that had similar ""die a few times to figure it out challenges"" and a similar game feel were great games.  This falls just short of that, and as a result falls into the abyss like you do so many times playing it."
11093,"This game was very well made, fun, cheap, full of adventure. while I was playing it got challenging at times. I blew through this game in around five hours; every second of it was great. The voice acting was very clean, and the graphics are exseptional. I would recomend this game to anyone. On a 1 to 10 scale i would give it and solid 8."
11094,10/10 would grapple again
11095,"If you are able to get it n sale for 3 bucks... DO IT! THis gae is really fun but it only last around 3 hours to beat, if it were longer I would say its worth the 10 dollars off sale but as is I would wait to get it on sale."
11096,"This game is fantastic. The only thing you can cry about is that it might be to short. The story in the game is beautiful and the gameplay is easy to learn. Hope they consider making ""part 2"" or adding some new lvl, maybe get some more lore into the game like the creatures, what are they and the ""Eye"". Also my favorit lvl was the last one, the decription from the narrator was very accurate and I have spend sometime looking around finding ""eastereggs"" and details that make the game just amazing!"
11097,"Very fun game, shame it's so short but still good none the less!"
11098,great but too short
11099,"From the little bit I have played, It is good. Fun sense of momentum, interesting storyline, would like to play more."
11100,"Its dope af but not much to do after the game over, they gotta make a level creator or somethin cause that would be dope"
11101,"It's a rather short game, but it's all worth it.

Pros:
+Good use of lighting
+The game's world is colorful and alive
+Grappling hooks and Rocket Boots!

Cons:
-The character models, it could use some work
-Maddie has quite the awkward walking animation cycle...
-It can be very easy to lose track of where you're going

I recommend that you should try this game."
11102,I just wish I got to spend more time with my uncle...
11103,"It was a fairly short game, but it was beautiful and the physics were great.  My only complaint would be how long it took to stop sometimes after landing, but if tha't all I have to say on the subject then the rest must be pretty good."
11104,"4 Hours, start to end. Worth the money when on sale. If you like surfing/kZ/parkour games, this is a really fun game."
11105,"Absolutely beautiful, its one of those story driven games where the atmosphere get you almost crying. 
10/10"
11106,"The graphics are lovely, the story is cute, but the gameplay is fucking frustrating. There is no way of telling whether you're close enough to the next rock to grapple it, whereas whether you will be able to grapple the canvas of a floating windmill is decided purely by chance. And once you grab it, the glove lets go as soon as you touch it, making you fall to your death. Yes, I got stuck and angry."
11107,Just buy it. For full price.
11108,Got it cheap thanks to the sale and liked it so far. Cute story. Grab it while it's cheap AF.
11109,"Amazing game. Beautiful visuals and soundtrack, fun grapple/rocket boots mechanic through numerous levels, all connected by a heart warming story."
11110,hisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
11111,"Great casual platformer with a funny story.
Challenging but not too hard.
The only negative I have is that it is a bit short. (about 2.5 hours)"
11112,This game is really fun and addicting. I even use this as gameplay for my yt cahnnel
11113,Bought it. Love everything about it so far. So I bought it again and gifted it to my brother. This game is a steal at $2.50.
11114,Great game. Great buy when it was on sale.
11115,"The only word to describle this game is, ""Beautiful."""
11116,"This is one of the most simple, yet immersive games I have ever played. Controls are easy, obstables are challengening but not the point where you're ripping your hair out! I recommend this game to anyone, the story line is great and you to tend to have a bond with the characters. Thanks for making such an awesome game!"
11117,"Short, but good for the price on sale. Pleasing visuals, enjoyable gameplay. I liked the story, but it might not be for everyone. I however got very immersed, I recommend playing it in one playthrough, you won't regret it."
11118,"A Story About My Uncle is a 3D platformer in a fantastic galaxy. The story is not the best but the gem of this game is the platforming. The graphics aren't the best, but sometimes looks just amazing, and always good views! There will be a little few easy puzzles to make you more focused, but after completing a level you'll get that good feeling about it.

For its price it is just an amazing adventure-platformer that every type of adventure gamer should play.

"
11119,"It is good game for its money especially with the discaout. It has a very good story but with not a good end.

RECOMMEND IT 8/10"
11120,"Its a good game, sure, but its only about 2-3 hours long. its got some replayability, but I never usually replay a game.
If you're looking for a fun time waster, this game is for you. If you're looking for a deep story about a boy searching for his uncle for about 8 hours, this is not for you."
11121,"This game reminds me a lot of surfing in Counter Strike. If you enjoyed chilling and surfing, grab this game ASAP.

Really smooth controls make the gameplay fun, but challenging at the same time. The story is cute and it does do a good job of sucking you in.

This game is SHORT. If you just want to play through it once, I wouldn't bother. However at the current sale price of 2.49 I think it's a decent value.

If you like a challenge however, the achievements are mostly about finding the most efficient ways through the few levels. And there are timed runs as well (much like CS Surfing)."
11122,"Awesome game. Even though it is a short game, it was very entertaining. Fantastic story, good gameplay, nice graphics."
11123,"What a delightful game to play.
Excellent storyline and smooth platformer gameplay.
Finished in about 3-4hours

Definitley pick this game up while its still on sale!"
11124,spiderman simulator :)
11125,"looked cool but the lame voice acting and the downright cringey My Little Pony reference kinda destroyed the immersion for me

after that I couldn't take it seriously and the story didn't interest me"
11126,"Amazing narrative, amazing gameplay, beautiful visuals. Only complaint is that it wasn't longer. SEQUAL PLS"
11127,Very fun and well made
11128,"short but fun. 
quite original idea and interesting gameplay:)"
11129,"Every once in a while amide the many hundreds of games out there I will get a chance to try a new unique game and if I am lucky they touch my heart as this game did.

Play this at least once and you will most likely love it.

Its also on sale for under $3 so totally worth it"
11130,"The story is really short, but the game and the idea is great.
What I really hate about it there isn't much to do, everything is staright forward and the plot is really  bad. story rating (3/10).

If they had ""Mehh"" recommendation would've defiinatly choose it.

-If there's a sequal to it would I buy it ?
HELL NO, probably the story will really suck since he found(stop reading if you don't want to get the stroy spoiled on you) [spoiler]""Fred"" and they were both were cool about it as if he haven't been searching for him. The worst part is Fred tells him off and he freaking leaves like "" yeah I just risked my life to find you""  -.-.[/spoiler]

Honest Rating: 6.5/10 
since it surpassed 5 I'll give it a thumbs up, yet I doubt my rating."
11131,"Really this is one of the dumbest games ever. Dont buy it. Not even for 2,59 in SummerSale like I did. I will refund it. The story is if there is any story to be mentioned boring. But the worst is the gameplay. You will fall down so often and it will make you aggressive. I couldnt stand the last 10min before the end and closed the game. watched the end on youtube and I didnt miss anything. Glad I stopped before. Dont buy."
11132,"If he could do it, I could do it too. 
Nice bedtime story ;)"
11133,I dont even know what to say. BLUE ALIENS? just to find your uncle ( Õ°¬∞ ŸÑÕü Õ°¬∞ )
11134,Fun game and really cool story
11135,awesome game and would recommend to anyone that loves adventures
11136,2 - 3 hr. to clear this game. It's very spectacular !! Nice Graphic Nice Story :)
11137,"Honestly, I didn't expect much from this game. Looked kinda groovy with the lasers and all,  but after playing it for real I thought it was absolutely brilliant. Excellent story, great mechanics and (personally) my favourite game of 2016 so far."
11138,"this game is so much fun, i love it :3"
11139,I found it a little repeatitive... And Madi is annoying as shit.
11140,Really great game. Wish it was longer so I could play more!
11141,"Fun game and definetly worh the money,grab it now on summer sale. The game is practically free and is very fun"
11142,"I enjoyed it. Back in 2013 when I still play TF2, I always play on linear surf servers back then. And I always spend almost a day just playing surf servers. Even until now I still play it, but I'm playing that game mode with CS:GO now. I also played the Attack on Titan Tribute Game (AOTTG), which I played it because of the swinging and also liked to kill huge titans.

I think that's the reason why I enjoyed this game. It's worth it if you ask me and fun too."
11143,"Floating island parkour with jet boots and a magic grapple. Not as easy as it sounds! The world is quite beautifully realized, the characters... more or less resemble the things they're meant to, the level design is quite good, and there are time trials and number-of-grapple challenges. The voice acting is incredibly stilted in a bizarre sort of way, but it doesn't feel too out of place with the general otherworldliness of the game. On top of everything else, there are some [b]very[/b] diabolically situated hidden collectibles that you might enjoy hunting down.

Don't know that I'd recommend it for full price, but it was pleasant to burn through it in an evening on discount."
11144,its a good game. i can recommend it
11145,"A well made parkour game with nice graphics, the story is kinda short and ended weirdly, after all; It was worth tge little bit of money."
11146,"-Was having fun playing this game

-still played
-got nowhere

-got past 2 more checkpoints before death

-exited game
-never looked back"
11147,"While very short (does not take more than a couple of hours, but have a some extra fun challenges) it is so beautiful, and a real sweet story. I think it would work great as a short movie. 

It's a very straight forward grapple hook game where you need to get from A to B. I think you'd like it if you like portal, although it is not as long a game, and have less thinking puzzle, more be slightly quick.

It's pretty easy, and kid friendly I think."
11148,"Wouldn't recommending buying at full price the game is min 4 hours long i finished the in one afternoon.
"
11149,"This game is hella great but you know whats better? This outstanding pie recipe.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
11150,"What A Great Little Game.

The Mechanics are great and fluid, Dispite a few bugs here or there but nothing gamebreaking. the idea is cool and the game itself is just all around well done.

Definetly worth a playthrough."
11151,This game is great on LSD.
11152,Well ƒ± lƒ±ke mystorƒ±es and the atmosphere was okay ƒ± gues but ƒ± am not a fan of that much fantasy soo ƒ± gues ƒ± have to say no.
11153,Now I don't have to kill people.
11154,This is easily one of my best games that i have played. The story and the voice acting is amazing. An easy 10/10 and is a must have. Since its on sale it has gone down to ¬£1.99 which is an amazing price for such a beautiful game. Buy Now!
11155,"This game is fantastic.  It's short, but fantastic.  The player models and voice acting need some work but other than that there's nothing I can complain about.  The movement is fluid and the ending is amazing.  Get it"
11156,"I play this game while making a video insulting other videos on the internet.

9/11 IGN"
11157,Pissed me off and looked good doing it.
11158,"This game is very, very good. The graphics are amazing and the story is charming. Two main things however are that

1. The story is very short, about 2.5 hours.

2. No workshop support, this is something we need. PLEASE"
11159,The game gets crazy tough towards the end. I almost quit. It does have an interesting story though and is worth the play if you don't mind difficult games.
11160,This is for people who are looking for a laid-back type of game.
11161,One of the funnest and fast paced indie games i have played.
11162,"This is a fun and somewhat challenging platformer. The game is rather short, but there is some replay value in time trials and unlockables. Recommended!"
11163,"A nice indie game with a relaxing, warm story and plenty of platform puzzles. I enjoyed this game! Worth the 3 bucks I spent on it for sure. If you're looking for a beautiful, thoughtful, first person puzzle game that was made with love, then pick this one up."

11165,Still trying to do one part where i try not to use the grapple hook
11166,"A fantastic, beautiful and heartfelt story of exploration and adventure. 
Coupled with a gorgeous art style, soundtrack and some of the best movement mechanics I've ever seen, this is a game I could probably argue for at retail price, let alone the unbelievable sale I price I paid for it.

Do yourself a favour: pick up ""A Story About My Uncle"", turn off the lights, and go on an adventure."
11167,i thought this was a horror game.
11168,nice
11169,The best 3 hours I've spent on a game in a long time! The graphics are really captivating and the story is well done. Gameplay is very unique; nothing like I've experienced before. I really hope that future versions will be made.
11170,Beautiful and entertaining! Totaly worth the money.
11171,"I really like this game. Even though it's really short, it's super athmospheric, and with the soothing music playing in the background, you can just select a level, listen to the music and just enjoy the aesthetics. 
It was kind of open world, kind of. I just really adore this game. And the ending, well, it's kind of sad, really. I don't know why. But it just hit a bit of a emotional part in me. Beautiful..

I think you should get it. It's really short though, so maybe get it on a sale or something. But I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys to swing around with a crystal fueled electric grapling hook while puzzling! :3 <3"
11172,"Gorgeous, but short."
11173,"[h1] Another sale game	[/h1]

Looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous. 
Gameplay is decent and kind of fun.

Here comes the big but:
Wasn't always sure where I had to go (I guess that's my incapability not the game's fault really)
Story is meh. I couldn't relate to any of the characters.

"
11174,Short story but good play
11175,"Done in 3 hours, but 3 awesome hours !
Good Fun. Good Story. Good Game."
11176,"Played this game throughout one day. It's very enjoyable, challenging but not too hard. The storly line is quite basic but still entertaining enough. The mechanics are quite enjoyable and fun. They should add a random mode where there is an infinite spawn of blocks to jump onto with the different backgrounds. Graphics are quite cool the backgrounds are aweosme especially with the sound complimenting it. For under $3 this was TOTALLY worth it."
11177,"alright it was an amazing game the puzzles and platforming was great but there were a few issues like a short story, bugs (but only small ones) and the lip sync.

but apart from all that i loved the game and if you haven't brought it i would highly reccomend it"
11178,"Another of those games that doesn't see the need to artificially stretch gameplay time with unnecessary tangents buildt to make the player feel they'd miss something out if they don't collect XYZ items. Which is nice. Consequently this game is a short but fulfilling story that I'd compare to Papo&Yo, except there's no deep issue lying underneath, no message to tell, but a simple story of a journey. That's good enough for me."
11179,"Awesome, GG! 10/10. Worth The Buy!"
11180,"Great Gameplay
Great Graphics
Great Story"
11181,"Awesome, some of the loveliest visuals. Although the game was short  gameplay and adventuring was amazing."
11182,"A really fun short puzzle game with great mechanics. I highly recommend it, but wait for it to go on sale."
11183,"Grabbed this on sale and do not regret it at all.  As others have said, it is quite short.  I would guess the average player will probably finish the game in around 3 hours.  That said it is very unique and a lot of fun.

Pros:
Unique experience
beautiful environments
tight controls
interesting story

Cons:
Short
slightly inconsistent difficulty curve"
11184,"Simply put, it is a very good game overall. Not a great one though: the story is cheesy and dialogues uselessly long, therefore boring (although I find the epilogue a very nice touch), the character design could definitely have been better, and navigation in these dark levels is sometimes unclear.
But the mechanics and corollary feelings are very pleasant, and besides the aformentioned flaw levels are finely designed and never on the hard core side; plus, most of them are gorgeous.
I believe the game deserves more praise for its gameplay and visuals than its story, hence the title is misleading and might prevent potential customers who would love its gameplay, to even watch the trailer."
11185,"Downloaded this game then played it through non-stop, it is not a long game at all; however, that doesn't matter after this playing this game i feel completely satisfied and content with everything about it"
11186,"A beautifully rendered work of art, complete with a captivating yet minimalistic storyline and fluid game mechanics, all honed to perfection."
11187,"There is no other game right now that I don't daydream of playing while with someone special. This game is more like an experience, like peering into someone else's imagination, than an actual game. It's also very casual, relaxing and the ending leaves you satisfied. So it isn't emotionally deep or controversial or dark like the ""story games"" I typically prefer. Instead It harkens back to that childhood innocence and wonder we all had before all of our lives got really complicated, back to a time where each of us could so clearly envision imaginary civilizations and worlds. And perhaps since I never had someone special to explore such otherworldly worlds when I was young I now yearn to find a lover to re-experience this game and its frogs with. 

EDIT:  daydream fulfilled (*^3^)/~‚òÜ"
11188,"A fun little game with great gameplay and a good story. The best feature of this game obviously is the fact that as a first person platformer, it feels very fluid. All the movement options are presented relatively early, giving you time to get used to it before the real tricky stuff comes into play. It ends rather abruptly; I wish there was more content. However, for what it is, it does a very good job. I hope they make a sequel.
"
11189,"This is a really well presented simple ""platformer"". The environments, the immersion and the fluidity as well as the ""puzzle"" design make this well worth a purchase.

The fact that there are achievements for exploring is also an added bonus for longevity, however, I had fun trying to speed through each level as fast as possible.

There are a few places where you can glitch about on rocks you shouldn't be able to get to, but this adds to the feel of zipping around trying to get to hard to reach places.

The game isn't ""story rich"" with long scenes that you can't escape, but what story is there is excellent.

Great fun. Lovely story. Definitely worth picking up."
11190,"Great game, solid mechanics, easy to grasp, but a little on the short side. This is a good one if you can pick it up on sale."
11191,"Amazing game!!
10/10

MOLEST ME DADDI KEEMERRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZ
RUB MY HEAD IN TO THE NEWS.. UR MOIST UNCLE SWEATY MEATBALLS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
11192,"Awesome game, pretty diffucult at times but whenever you die its your fault, not the games. Nice story and great graphics"
11193,"A decent platforming game that provides an interesting back story. Some of the levels seem fairly challenging or maybe I'm just terrible at platformers. Be prepared to die atleast a couple times during your first playthrought. 

I rate it 7/10. I would recommend to pick it up when it's discounted."
11194,"""Hey, let's play a game! I bet that you can't get through this part without using the grapple device!""

After 2 seconds I fell into a pit and died with a child on my back.
I'm the best person ever.

10/10 would play a game with an humanoid female frog again"
11195,The game is very good and the story just made it great!
11196,"Could be called A Story About Me Jumping Like A Maniac.
Short, but enjoyable. ‚ô•"
11197,"I just finished this game and I must say it's a fantastic game really recommend it I bought it while it was on sale 
fantastic story was absolutely amazing no regrets :D beautiful graphics to. BUY THE GAME! xD
sorry for my grammar I'm bad at that 

10/10"
11198,"Beautiful game with a fun mechanic! Really enjoyable with a controller but more percise with a mouse. I guess I mean you feel more engaged with the swing/grapple movement with a controller. Abosolutely loved it :D
Story telling is well done and the gameplay isn't lacking. Lots to come back to with time trials, unlockables, hidden pieces of content, and achieves :D"
11199,"This game has a captivating story that I personally enjoyed It is original and full of ideas, even reflecting on past human generations and it's development. I am looking forward to new titles from this company.

The gameplay is smooth and has really satisfying physics and movement mechanics. An inovative idea that, unlike in many cases, is really well put together and sucessfully developed. I personally have not met any bugs during my gameplay, so congrats to the development team.

That said, there is a problem with this game: the gameplay is too short, therefore the story can feel rushed. The Dev team should really consider expanding this series, if it's going to turn into a series, or expand the game and create a more meaningful story with many more challenges based on the same main gameplay idea.

To wrap it up, I definitely recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a good time experiencing a great adventure accompanied by a great gameplay"
11200,If Leafy plays it... I play it.
11201,"Wow - great story and nice gameplay.
Absolutely great speakers letting the background story get alive.
Partially very hard and challenging, but satisfying in the same way.

Short but very good."
11202,nice game. it'll be one of my favorite game. amazing game with a great gameplay
11203,"Nice platformer with awesome graphics, good story and interesting but repetitive gameplay.
+ The story is really cool, at least I liked it alot - the real feel of adventure wich is not so common these days.
+ The look is just great! Very beautiful atmospheric fantastic worlds with flying islands. The concept is not new, but it's very well made here
 - Gameplay. Interesting concept of grappling, but it becomes repetitive and boring pretty fast. And it's very frustrating at the end! Prepare to replay some parts for 20+ times, cause sometimes you need perfect accuracy and timing. Or maybe it's just too hard for me. Sometimes it reminds Portal 2, but much, MUCH harder!
- Tha game is very short. I beat it in 5 hours with all my endless fails and replays. 

I can say, the story is pretty simple, but it really holds the game together. It's that aspect that holded me till the end and prevented from rage quit. 
Take it on sale and you will not be dissappointed."
11204,"It's full of great ideas but fails in execution. Mechanics are glitcy, story is poor, characters looks terrible, and overall it is very short. You will die a lot from glitches. This looked like a fast paced game to me but it fails to keep its momentum. I applaud the makers of the game because it's a great idea but it just isn't polished enough. Get it on sale if you must have it."
11205,"Amazing game. i wish it where longer though...

11207,Amazing!
11208,is the uncle a lie tho?
11209,"Awesome story. if you're looking for a Relaxing/Challanging game, this would be great for you! The only Down side to this game it only has 2-3 hours of gameplay. Played with a Controller and loved the movement!"
11210,"What a fantastic little game. The mechanics are tight, the story is fun and well told, and the art style is quite charming. It is a little on the short side, but I'm 100% okay with that and I do plan on going back in for achievements."
11211,"Overall probably one of the best games I've ever played. Voice acting is great, story is great, and theres enough action to keep anyone satisfied."
11212,"Great graphs, interesting and catchy story.

The game is about a story that you, as a father, tell to your daughter at night. The story is about you following/searching your uncle, who was an adventure/science men. You start the game in a normal house and then you're teleported to an unknown (beautifully designed) place. There you start the game by following your uncle steps to find him.

The soundtrack is really nice as well as the game mechanics. 

It didn't made my heart explode of love, but enough to like and recommend it ;)"
11213,This was so relaxing to play. The story was very nice and the gameplay was 10/10.
11214,I almost resorted to watching a markiplier video in order to get past a stage
11215,very fun game but short i finished it in 3 hours the graphics are great and its sometimes hard but its so fun that im starting over for my third time.
11216,AWESOME AWESOME AND AWESOME SICK GAME AND SICK STORY 10/10 WOULD RECCOMEND IM SRSLY BRO EXCUSE MY GRAMMER CUS IM JUST REVIEWING AN AWESOME GAME
11217,"This is an absolutely outstanding game with super fun gameplay, interesting, mechanics and puzzles. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platforming games."

A Story About My Uncle simply didn't live up to it's potential. The gameplay is fantastic; however, it is paired with a forced, simple story and atrocious voice acting. The story took me about two hours to complete, and with the ammount of content the developers tried to add, it was just not long enough for character development and a building of a story. The animaitons are awful, and immediatly pull you out of the game as soon as you see a character walking. Take all of this and add an abundance of glitches, and you have A Story About My Uncle. A Story About My Uncle gets a 5/10."
11219,"beautiful game, its worth the price and has a big replay value, the story is charming and relaxing, when you're playing it you feel great and you dont want it to end"
11220,"A Story About My Uncle is a great game and is basically Spider Man without the dead uncle and crime-fighting. 

Mechanics are great, Voice acting could use some work, and the story is short/sweet. 

[spoiler] So the game starts out with a man telling stories to his daughter. When asked for something new, your character decides to tell her about an adventure he had as a kid, looking for his uncle who had gone missing. After finding a specially-made suit tailored to him and the pad his uncle used to dispose of ""trash"" that was used to build houses and such for these bipedal, frog-like creatures. 

You get on this pad and get launched into the sky, soon finding yourself in some sort of cave. 

You go through this new world and meet a few people, all leading you closer to, you guessed it, your uncle. 
[/spoiler]

Now, there are some downsides.

-The voice acting is good, but with the thick accents, it kind of messes up the flow of things.

-Only one section, which is in part of the Ice Cave is actually frustrating, but it stilltakes entirely too much to cross the gap. 

-There are a few minor bugs, but nothing too bad, so only .5 of a con. 

-The ending was too short. You only see the person who is the focus of the game for about a minute before never seeing him again. I know they say ""It's not about the desination, it's about the journey."" But this was f---ing insane. 

-He's your uncle and refers to you as his nephew the entire time you see him, but as you launch away from the crystal pad, he says ""Good luck, son!"" or something along those lines. Just a minor continuity error. Could have said ""My boy"" or ""Nephew"", or anything like that, but there was a bit more emphasis on ""Son"", so I was confused by it. 

Overall, it's a great game with only minor problems, and I would love to see more of this. Not like people jumping on a bandwagon, but just Coffee Stain doing a longer, better-voiced game like ASAMU. I'd recommend it."
11221,I have a  story about jakes uncles. Go to por nhub to watch the video
11222,"I finished the game, but don't know why I didn't like it. 
Maybe it was the bland story with as much depth as a kiddy pool. I just wasn't into it. It was supposed to be this epic adventure, but all you do is jump from one point to the next. Not very difficult either. It has nice visuals, but nothing that hasn't been done before.

5/10, too much leapfrog."
11223,The grapple suit and low gravity in this game combine to make unique and fun physics and gameplay. It could do with more levels though.
11224,"This game is an extremely interesting and intriguing game.

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
+ Awesome storyline
+ Beautiful graphics and scenery (very nice screenshots)
+ Engaging gameplay
+ Learning curve isn't steep
+ You get well used to the mechanics of the game before they chuck more at you to learn and use 
+ Overall, well thought out 'save' zones
+ Engaging characters
+ You can choose the map/level you want to play to get all the collectables
+ Nice music/sound effects
+ Different and contrasting environments
+ Very touching ending which I highly approve of

[h1]Negatives:[/h1]
- There are quite a few bugs (the most annoying ones are the ones that cause you to get stuck)
- Some maps are hard and frustrating
- Voice acting was lacking (not the best)
- Gameplay is short
- No real replayable factor (unless you want to explore the environment which you can't really do much of)
- Somewhat unfinished ending (explained below)


[h1]Notes:[/h1]
I felt like some of the things in this game was meant to be a big part of it but it lacked depth and it seemed more like a passing feature. This game is really about your grapple and parkour - moving around the map to reach your destination. With the voice acting, I felt that the narrator lacked emotion and depth but it wasn't too bad - the rest of the main characters sounded good. I'll reiterate... The graphics/environment/sound effects/music are all so, so, [i]so[/i] beautiful. This game has come a long way from 2012, and it has progressed wonderfully, however I'm not sure if it's an oversight but at the end Uncle Fred is seen with the old grapple device. I'm not sure if it's done on purpose to show the evolution of the suit/grapple device but it wouldn't make sense if it is because you go after your Uncle quite quickly and arrive in a span of a day... The character design is quite outdated but the main focus isn't really on the character's appearance.

Okay, so the point of this game is to go after your Uncle, Fred. [spoiler]You do find him eventually but after that you never actually see him again. It annoys me that you never actually see him, talk to him etc. ever again, yet this adds to the game which frustrates me but makes me admire the devs.[/spoiler] The ending was touching, [i]extremely[/i] touching however feels slightly unfinished (especially with Maddie and the Maddie and Uncle Fred interactions, we never see what happens etc. and I really want to know...).

Whether or not this game is worth the full price really depends on how much you like these types of games.

Score: 8/10"
11225,"Maan this is lit i got shitty pc and the graphics were actually good, havent done the story tho, but still actually good."
11226,great game worth a buy
11227,Your Uncle dies in the end
11228,Amazing game. 10/10 would recommend. Beautiful story and a heartwarming adventure.
11229,can i have a refund
11230,Just beat it. its too short needs more content but overall it is truly a masterpiece
11231,"Wow, this game has to be one of the best and most pleasurable games I have ever played/experienced. Everything about is amazing, the story, game play, and scenery. It is hard to pick what is best about the game because everything about it is just amazing. You feel connected with all the characters and feel like you are the main character. The game play is so much fun, it is not too hard but still gives you a challange and it is so much fun to go over a big jump, make a sick hook, or just barely get to the next point. The scenery is just amazing, around every corner you will be faced with a breath taking view that is screen shot worthy. I think that the price for the game is good, however you will only get about three hours of game play. Overall I would recommend this to anyone, someone just starting to game, or someone who is more hardcore but is looking for a few hours of a relaxing experience. 5 stars, Great job"
11232,"This game was short but deep, the gameplay was exciting as well as the story. Very Emotional.
8/10"
11233,"Graphic is on very high level, playable and very nice game...highly recommend"
11234,"This game was amazing! My only regret was that I finished it in three hours. I really hope they make a follow up game with the same kind of gameplay, as this is the first time I've seen a platformer like this. The story made me shed a tear and some of the graphics were truly beautiful. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
11235,"This game looks great and has a extraordinary story. Though it is very short, it makes up for it with the likeable characters and the fun gameplay."
11236,"I could not get into this game. I encountered so many glitches and bugs while playing, and was rather bored through my time  playing. At first I was enjoying the game, but it just became more and more dull over time. The story was preety great though."
11237,nah.
11238,Best. Played it through twice just because it's so damn fun. Highly reccomend playing with someone else so you can trade when you get frustrated.
11239,"Really good game with nice graphics, good story line and is not too easy! Fun parcour-story game!"
11240,"Interesting story, fun gameplay, and 10/10 soundtrack.

I recommend getting this :)"
11241,"If normal games are novels, this is a short story. A decent and fun short story.

GAMEPLAY
Fun and intuitive movement around beautiful environments. The game takes about two hours to play through from start to finish.

STORY
The story is good (not great and not bad) and you should be entertained."
11242,"Why to buy:

- It is so cheap right now in sales (-80%)
- Gameplay is enjoyable overall
- The mechanics are pretty individual
- The art style is cool
- And finally, the story is really nice and has a lovely end... But I'll leave that for you to find out :)"
11243,"Fun gameplay and interesting story, although too short with a lackluster ending"
11244,"Short game, but beautiful graphics and super fun to play"
11245,"Interesting narration and story mode all about exploring in a fairly straight line. Worth buying on a sale if your looking for interesting visuals, story and short game time."
11246,"A fun little game.  Short, but I don't feel like I didn't get my money's worth."
11247,"very good game
for leafyishere fans"
11248,"This game is SO awesome! Please buy it, it's worth it! The end made me sad and i will play it again to collect everything and get every archievement :3"
11249,"Game had a great story was like watching a nice movie where you play along. The only negative is that i went through it in 3 hours without even rushing it, i wish the gameplay was longer. still totaly worth the 2 euroes. would recomend."
11250,"The overall game is relatively short (less than 4 hours) but neveretheless enjoyable. Mostly involving parkour,the game centers around the search for Fred and the exploration of a huge open world environment. The game runs very smoothly and the visuals are phenomenal. I encourage anyone thinking about buying this game to go for it, you won't regret it."
11251,"Great Game.

Good heartwarming story, challenging and fun gameplay, and little side challenges too (unlockables)

Its a very balenced game in all aspects, short story but still a good one.

Would play again"
11252,"I'd love to leave a review, but I couldn't get the game to run.  Seems others in the community had this same problem.

Got my refund, although if I could get it to work, I'd be happy to buy it again."
11253,Fun game. Get a exo suit and enter some machine and jump around on rocks with a grapple. I like the atmosphere and overall is a good game.
11254,"The story wasn't the best, and the ending was very dissapionting. And don't even get me started on how long the game is.
But it's a short and sweet game, the gameplay was fun (even if i got stuck every now and again) and the time trails are a fun little extra to play."
11255,"For a short 4 hour story, it was great. I was so excited for the full game, and here it is. This game was emotional at some parts, because of it's story line. The player models looked creepy at times, but were charming and fun to be around. When i first started playing i couldn't stop, and played till i beat it without stopping. I was so hooked! It was a charming and fun game to play, and i hope a sequal will be released. This game was worth the $10.00 and shall not be forgotten at the bottom of my games list. This is a game to remember. 10/10 A Story About My Uncle"
11256,All I need to do is record myself making some cancerous content.
11257,"It is a short, beautiful masterpiece. A Story About My Uncle is a very unique game, in the sense that it's a parkour platformer where you have to grapple in order to survive and advance. Heard of anything else like this? Neither have I."
11258,"Well, the game is rather short for its price but I still recommend it.

Also, you'd better check Gemini: Heroes Reborn, if you're looking for some ""portal-like"" experience."
11259,"+ bunch of ""puzzles"" that you can just run through because the grapple is so OP
+ gets all emotional in the last 5 minutes of the game
+ makes you fap to garbage plasteline figures

10/10 would play again"
11260,i liked this gave despite the name it's a fun game to play.
11261,This game is apsolutely beautifull :3
11262,*SIgh* time to watch some frog porn *ziiip*
11263,So good
11264,"Really good story and nice game play. 

We begin as a father telling our experiance and adventure story to the daughter.

Has 5 levels. 
Each level with different climate xD settings.  Always someting new and challenging to look forward to.

Has collectible items to unlock character items.

Would have been better if there was a option to skip the cut scenes, its really a pain in the xxx to watch them over and over again while completing the achivements. 

The achivemets are a real tough cookie. 

Enjoy the game ."
11265,Such a beautiful game! I loved it.
11266,Very good game and a great experience. It's short but it's almost like playing a movie if that makes any sense. It's replayable and very entertaining =^)
11267,"Loving this game so far. The story and narrative is really nice and makes this game a pleasure to play, along with the graphics and well thought out scenery. Definitley a game to try out"
11268,"First, the pros of this game: the graphics are honestly beautiful (there were moments when I paused simply to enjoy the scenery), the story is sweet and enjoyable (you get pieces of the story as you advance, and you are just as interested as the in-game audience), and the general atmosphere of the game is pleasant (no violence, and any strange-looking characters don't stay around long).

The cons of this game: the mechanics can be wonky; if you overshoot your jump or mistime a grapple, you may be repeating a section over and over and over; the death/fall scenes are pretty lengthy and cannot be skipped; the checkpoints are not always close together, so you may have to start rather far back (multiple times).

If you are not good at these types of parkour and/or physics-based games that involve timing your jumps/grapples very well, or if you get frustrated having to repeat decently long sections multiple times if you fail, then you will not like this game. All the positive reviews led me to believe it would be a simple, enjoyable game, but it was so frustrating at times that I did not actually enjoy it."
11269,"Kawaii game just buy it when it's on sale bc it's relatively short (around 2h to finish story). I didn't try the ""time trial mode"" and unlock all the bonus yet. If you want more challenge you can speed run this game ;D
Otherwise it's a good game."
11270,"I dont usually post reviews, but I feel obligated to leave a review for this game.
This game is short, I finished it in about 2 days. Maybe playing a few hours each day. 
It's absolutely stunning, albeit the characters are a little frightening but you hardly see them for more than a few minutes. 
The story is small but it's great, I honestly wish there was more.
I love that you have to be smart and quick about where to shoot your grapple, and theres a few challenging areas but i'm not one to turn down a challenge. 
Lastly, the achievements look crazy hard to complete and may be a bit time consuming but I plan on getting a few done eventually. 

I recommend this game, and firmly believe the metacritic score should be higher than 73/100.
Given that it's such a short game and you'd be paying $13 for it... I suggest maybe saving it till it goes on sale if you're indecisive."
11271,This is by far one of the most beutiful games i have ever played.
11272,great game. havent really got much to sa about it. its a fun game to play if you wanna pass time.
11273,Great game
11274,"Like a great book, you pick it up once every few years to reread and can never put it down."
11275,Really good game but honestly only got it because it was on sale!
11276,"Well after beating the game in 2 hours. I will have to say that this is one of the best short story games I have ever played. Frist off is that the scenery and the whole mood of the game is great. You feel like you are one with the story and you are actually there experiencing it with him. Second is that is just not a short story boring game. They add a challenge into it plus while giving amazing back story to it. I will have to say that the story they have given was amazing


100% buy this game if you have the money. It is amazing and you wont regret but that is only if you up to a little challenge but great gameplay and scenery."
11277,"First off, note that the game basically only has 3 hours of content. 

Fun game. Easy to play. About midway through it is a bit harder as the ""red-thread"" of where to go becomes slightly hard to see. 

Unfortunately the ending was a but sudden and felt very empty. Filled with story but I felt the ""only one time use"" excuze on the teleportation pad was a little too clich√©."
11278,short but loved it. great plot
11279,"I am only half way into the game and i already do not care that it is a short game. I love it!

Question: Does the game match the price tag?
Answer: A quote by iDubbbzTV ""it worth it""."
11280,"I Like this game,good story"
11281,"This game is a really innovative experience and is extremly fun. I didn't get board with this game once. My only cons are that the campaign is kinda short and I don't feel it should be priced at $12.99 when little content it has. I'd wait for a sale on this one but when it does come, I REALLY SUGGEST YOU BUY IT. I hope to see more content in the future."
11282,Good game.
11283,"This game damn, I loved it. I recently found it because of Leafy but it is very enjoyable with a great story. I just wish it was longer. Game mechanics are very easy to learn and the world of ""A story about my uncle"" is very beautiful.To the people that have played the game FUCK UNCLE FRED !! jk"
11284,what a great game totally recomend it hope it was longer tho but anyways 10/10
11285,A Story About My Uncle was incredible and gave me goosebumps. An incredibly creative platformer that also allows for an intriguing plot line and character development.
11286,"Very amazing game, but a bit short.

10/10 visually. Each level is stunning and you are pretty much expected to stop and just look around for a few minutes.

great gameplay. very fluid and hard enough to stay interesting.

soundtrack was great.

Voice acting was a bit lacking.

Storyline was pretty good too.

"
11287,Good game
11288,This game is great as far as platformers go it has great mechanics and it's visuals are stunning but as far it's story line goes there isn't anything else to do but replay old levels once you've gotten through all in all if you're looking to kill a few hours this game is perfect all in all 8/10
11289,"Do you like the level design of Xen in Half Life? Do you like to travel around using the grappling hook in Just Cause? Do you like the eerie atmosphere of Blackreach in Skyrim? If your answer to these questions are yes, this game might be for you."
11290,Wonderful experience
11291,awsome game. it reminds me of Surf on csgo. well worth a bash.
11292,"Beautifully made, along with a short story that is optionally expanded upon by merely exploring the scenery.

The sheer size of the environment and freedom of movemt given to the player lulls you into a false sense that this game is an open world one.

*spoiler alert*
Maybe it was because I didn't look around enough, but I really wish I could learn more about world. The froglings, the eyeball monster, the crystals, it's hard to understand how they all tie together.

I actually felt sad about leaving Maddie behind. Normally in a game as short as this when you gain a companion you gain them for life. Leaving Maddie behind felt like leaving your daughter, even if it was the right choice it was sad. Manly tears were almost shed.

Reaching Fred was kind of anticlimactic to be honest. You spent all this time finding him and you almost immediately get sent home, with only about 2 minutes worth of dialoge. The game could have done more for an ending, especially since it's story driven, but like everything else it was kept simple."
11293,"This is one of the best games i have played in a long time, definitely recommend this to any one."
11294,"very nice game whit a unique story.
only a small game"
11295,"An Amazingly great game. For the price this game is phenominal (sorry if i spelt it wrong) for the price! I strongly recommend this game if you are thinking to buy this game. Amazing story, looks amazing and awesome and awesome flying parkour-ish type game! But its a short game (goes for a about 4 hours). But still its great and amzing!"
11296,Amazing story. I even got a little teary-eyed at the end. Beautiful game with very pleasing music and sound effects. A little shorter than I would have liked but I have not found all of the secrets and unlockables yet. I love this game and would recomend it to anyone.
11297,SPODERMEN.
11298,Why not a story about my aunt? Misogynist garbage.
11299,"This is an amazing game for the price. The graphics are gorgeous and the zones you travel through are nothing short of stunning. The people you meet along the way are simplistic, but the storyline and minimal interactions makes them endearing and fun to be around. This game is both fun and frustrating throughout.

Pros: 
Fun gameplay.
Simple to learn the controls.
Gorgeous world.
Interesting storyline.
Relaxing music, with immersive audio narration.
No blood, gore, profanity, nudity, etc.

Cons:
Much too short! 
Couple areas could have used tiny hints.

Overall, I would recommend this game to others even though it's an older release... and I will definitely be replaying it often, as well as trying the unlockable games and time trials. Wish I would have known about it sooner! 
"
11300,"Super interesting game.  First person platforming that surprisingly works fairly well.  Can be fustrating at times, but the level of challenge isn't too crazy or anything.  It's also just about the perfect length.  It does not overstay it's welcome.  I'm glad I played it."
11301,"Absolutely beautiful game, breathtaking. The story was short but enjoyable and leaves you with a warm heart. The music is very calming and the game in general is just relaxing. Definitely worth the buy."
11302,"This game is really frustrating. Couldn't play more than 50min of it.
At first, the graphics amazed me. I thought having ""iron man's gloves"" to do the superjumps would be really cool! But then, the playability showed to be really difficult and frustating. Soon I realized there was not much to do and I didn't like the map at all (basically floating rocks you have to reach and end up falling a lot)."
11303,"Absolutely love this game! I got it on sale and quite frankly I would pay full price. It has a nice story and concept and the scenery is really unique and cool. I love the blue tones especially since I like blue heheh. The one thing though is it's a little hard to figure out where to go, but that could be because I just don't play many games like this and I'm dumb. Either way, definitely recommended :D"
11304,"[b]This is an Indie game which really rocks![/b]
The graphic is fantastic, the sound effects are atmospheric, the voice acting is great and even if the game is hard sometimes, it makes fun anyway!

 I give it 10/10

P.S. I never thought the guys who made goat simulator could make something like this ;P"
11305,Amazing.Responsive.Beautiful
11306,"Bought this game on inpulse on sale, -75% I think. And It probably has to be one of the best deals I've ever made. 
It's a great game yet alone an amazing experince! The overall story and atmosphere of the game is really immersive. When you grapple around and soar through the skies throughout the levels, it really feels like you are there doing it, and it feels amazing!
The only negative I to say about the game is that its kinda short, I finished it in about 4 hours. And that's a real shame, cause I loved this game and I would've wanted it to be longer. 
I give it 9/10 potatoes."
11307,"I would recommend getting this game ONLY if it is on sale. For the base price point, I believe it's a little too much. The game will maybe get you 3 hours of gameplay if you take your time. There is almost no replayability value as it is the same story and obstacles. The mechanics are cool and the story is good. I wouldn't recommend buying it at it's current price point, however."
11308,Fun and beautiful short game. Buy it whenever it goes on sale.
11309,"I bought this game while on sale and finished it within a few hours (one sitting)

Pros: 
Nice, fluid game play
Beautiful graphics 
Excellent storyline
Unlockables! (number 2 had me laughing so hard)
Time trial content 

Cons:
A little repetitive
Can be annoying at times when you just miss a grapple and plummet to your death 

Overall, I really enjoyed the game, it was just long enough to give the story good focus while not being so long that the repetitiveness of the levels becomes annoying.

Good wee find, espeically on sale"
11310,"Oh boy , what a game ! 
It is very short (2 hours ) but it is also very beautiful.Fun and challenging gameplay,remarkable artwork and great narration-what more do you need ? Just buy it ,don't even think about it (even for the full price).
10/10"
11311,"I picked it up on sale, don't remember exactly how much but think it was 75%, taking that into account the game felt like it was worth it, the story is around 2 hours of gameplay, which kinda sucked. It allows you to play specific segments of the story, just to run through the obsticle courses again, however I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for it and I hope you wont either. 
If you really wanna play it, try to pick it up on sale, otherwise you'd be wasting your money because there's to few courses to run and they felt far to easy. For some reason I didn't get any achievements so perhaps I missed out on some important things. Other than that, it felt overall great to play, few bugs, couple of exploits like landing on the windmill to replenish your powers or on the side of walls."
11312,"This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Really.
The story (even if short) is stunningly immersive, touching and well-made; the gameplay is amazing, I loved getting through the various levels swinging around just as I enjoyed the story itself, even though I wish it was a little longer so I could play this game even more; graphics are good indeed thanks to the Unreal Engine, level design is great aswell.

I don't know what for other people, but I would love to see a sequel of some sort, maybe a little longer. 
To me, it's a 10/10. Definitely worth the money you spend for it."
11313,Great game if it is on sale get it i think that is was a little short graphics are Great in all i think you should get the game
11314,"A wonderful adventure, when I got this game I did not expect what I received. But in the case of this game, that was a wonderful and amazing thing. This game actually did what it's genre is meant to, it made me feel something, I grew attached to its characters and actually felt sad at the end. For the fact that the game was over, but also because of the amazing story telling and that there wouldn't be anymore. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone, even if you don't play it for the story, the games mechanics and abilities will still give you an amazing and enriching experience!"
11315,"This game, from the beggining, just.. wow,
spent two hours already on this game, and it is amazing!!!,
The story is so nice.
i find this game very fun and exciting,
can't wait to finish the whole game!
totally worth it."
11316,"This game is super fun, story is neat and mechanics are fantastic, 100% reccomend you check it out."
11317,"A Story About My Uncle takes you along on fun but short story. You relive a story you¬¥re telling your daughter about how you went out and searched for your Uncle. The game has amazing graphics and a great atmosphere. And while grappling yourself trough the world it¬¥s really tempting to just stop and watch the scenery for a moment. The world is interesting and keeps you guessing what it really is from time to time, but sadly never really explains it. The mechanics of the game are fun and exist mainly out of your grappling hook and your jumping boots. The game doesn¬¥t really have much replay value unless you are going for all the achievements which can be hard to get, after completing the game i still have 0 achievements.

Overall, i can highly recommend this game to those who are looking for a short and interesting game."
11318,Such a beautiful game and a beautiful journey.
11319,"REally good game,Would recomend 10/10. Its got a great story to it."
11320,"HISSSSSS, yes leafy brought me here, but let's be honest, this game is incredible! Worth every penny. 10/10"
11321,"Pros:
-Great voice Acting
-Great story line
-Rich enviroment with gorgeous landscapes
-Fun gameplay
-You feel like you are the main character
-You feel drawn to the story line
-Wonderful to play with children
Cons:
-Short story line finisshed within 3hrs gameplay and did played around a lot.
-Once you finish the game there's not much to do besides a ''against the clock'' run.
-Levels become repetitive once you past half the game

But mainly this game is great, and i would recomend you to buy it when it's on sale or else i dont think it worth it that much money, unless they added a multiplayer mode or something new mode to play with friends and such wich would make the game a lot better."
11322,"Fun game. Clean, challenging, relaxing yet frustratingly complex. Short leaving you wishing there were more."
11323,good game
11324,"Definitely worth a buy at a great sale price! It was short, but really well done. This is a first person platforming game. A surprising amount of fun. I really enjoyed this game."
11325,"I'd like to address the fact that the physics in this game are fucking broken and need to be ajusted in order to complete an achievement (maddies challenge). You as the player have the ability to control your own momentum whilst falling (or so you are thought to be able to), when ever you sprint-power jump you have FUCKING ZERO CONROL over your landing or momentum for that matter. once you let go of that power button you life is no longer in your hands and are at the mercy of this blatently unfinished game with its bianary based bullshit physics

Game Devs you owe me an achievement because I've spent the last 1.5 hours of my life trying to get this god forsaken achievement and its not possable once you even manage to get to that second to last fucking rock (if I power jump, I fall short, if I powerjump-sprint I completely over shoot the target because its impossible to deccelerate after you springt-powerjump)

nice looking game/retarded movment physics"
11326,"9/10
Should of had a british narrator."
11327,good
11328,"Cute story and fun game.

Can't play it without being called Leafy or a Cyberbully though."
11329,"10/10 would get motion sickness

fun game tho"
11330,"I picked up this game on sale for $2.50 in exchange I recieved an incredibly pleasant way to spend a afternoon. It has some of the issues you may expect from and Indie game in that it is not very polished and the voice acting is only okay, but this is certainly not a bad game. To me it falls into a similar catagory as Journey, I recommend picking it up if its on sale."
11331,"Though the games seems repetitive at times, and certainly irritating, it has a masterful narrative and a profoundly heartfelt story. I highly recommend this game!"
11332,"So nice and atmospheric. A little too short, but for the price, it's more than worth playing it. VERY VERY WELL DONE DEVELOPERS!"
11333,"Both recently got this game and the steam controller, I have played all 5.5hrs using the steam controller. 

I feel like this game would be much easier with keyboard/mouse or a dual joysticked controller (xbox style), it is definately challenging using the right ""touch pad"" as camera controls and I have not found a good way to really speed it up seeing as you have to aim while flying through the air.

Pro's: 
Beautiful World
Quick load back to last check point even after 100 falls to your death
Story Telling aspect, reminds me something of Bastion or Two Brothers since it doesn't interfere by using a cutscene

Con's:
Short I guess it what everyone says, maybe they should try with a steam controller?
A bit repeatative
Too dark in some areas to see where to grapple (Ice cave stalagtic part)

Was already on wishlist, simply bumped to the top due to sale, would have paid full price.
"
11334,This was a great game overall! although I do not agree with the price 12$ for two hours but I bought mine on sale but great game very fun!
11335,"Recommended! good graphics with awesome physics and great voice actor worth it, its all good except NPC animation movement kinda rough"
11336,"A well developed platformer, in a setting that will leave you breathless."
11337,Challenging game the only bad is the ending its so sad :(¬†I fell in love with the game and it ended so quickly.
11338,"Looks nice, but that's really all it has going for it.  It's nothing more than a frustrating game that revolves entirely around swinging from platform to platform with virtually nothing else to it, and even that part is poorly done.  If you like doing the same thing repeatedly and dying over and over and over again, then you'll love this game, otherwise it will just be an excercise in frustration and boredom."
11339,"Good and challenging game ,great graphics and interesting story ,I enjoyed every minute and I when i want to do something short and fun I play it a while and sometimes starts it all over again because it's not so long, I would recommend to anyone who likes adventure games you will not be disappointed"
11340,"Incredibly fun, but a pretty short story."
11341,"Very good game. Gets a little repetitive but definetly worth the $3.00 its on sale for. Takes about 3-4 hours to beat it, so more than $5.00 and its theres just not enough content. Overall, very good story line. Kind of makes you feel like a kid again in some respects. Stay safe Maddy."
11342,"This was a very fun game, with unique concepts. There were points in the game however, that were too difficult or needed an extra checkpoint. The story was better than I expected from an indie game, which was awesome when combined with the game mechanics. I wish that there were more levels and I would rate this game an 8/10."
11343,"great game! 
Pro's:
-Nice graphics
-cheap
-fun game
-its a really addictive game 
-I finished it in 3 hours but money well spend :)

Cons:
-A lot of places where you can get stuck
-No dlc's

Really great game and definitly worth 15 euro (2,60 euro on sale)!
I rate this game 8/10"
11344,"PROS:
-fun movement mechanic
-great story
-nice graphics
-nice alternative game

CONS:
-finished the game in only 4 hours
-sometimes you fall alot wich can make certain places kinda repetitive/frustrating

SUMMARY:
This game gives you a few hours of fun and a nice story, bought it on a sale so it was worth it"
11345,"For a game that's all about its movement dynamic, this game has a terrible movement dynamic."
11346,"A great indie game! It's really fun and has a great story!
The main game macanics are awesome! Just takes a little white to get the hang of it but the ""tutorial"" levels are great for explocre your abilities and the games secrets!

While playing the game the one thing I was always asking my self was:  ""Can I get there?"" the whole point of an adventure game like this!!!

"
11347,"Short but sweet. Engaging gameplay, a decent story that isn't at all boring and I love the setting and design of the game too. If it goes on sale, pick it up. ¬£1.99 is definitely worth it."
11348,This game is amazing. The gameplay is perfect and there is not too many things you can do so you have to think sometimes for a path and everything. Love it. I recommand it.
11349,"Great Game. Short and simple story, but still fun. Unique in a few ways, just wish they could expand more on the ideas instead of every map being a cave(or floating islands). 
Bought it during the sale, definately worth it for less than $3"
11350,good
11351,"Awesome game. I finished it for 3 hours, and that was definitely not bad 3 hours of my life. Its better than warcraft movie=)
Story is simple, but nice. Music and voices are good. Graphics is fairy and catchy. Gameplay - it was very good at the flat screen, and imagine that in VR! Thumbs up for developers"
11352,"Absolutely wonderful adventure told in a brilliant narrative, I recommend to all looking for a short but astounding game."
11353,"Lovely short game, got it on sale for 2,59‚Ç¨. Would've paid 5‚Ç¨ for it.

I recommend to treat eat like a movie, play it in one sitting."
11354,"A small, but beautiful game! A no-brainer on sale!"
11355,"The game took me 3 hours to complete. I was hoping for more levels and such but to produce such a large world with this level is detail must be really painstakingly difficult.

I got the product on sale for ¬£2, it was definitely worth the price. :)"
11356,"Really fun game with interesting story, had great times playing it and is so addicting ;D"
11357,"Beautiful. Pick up this game, you won't regret it. 10/10"
11358,"This is a short but very enjoyable game. The story is nice and simple. Controls are easy to learn and use. The atmospheric mood makes the experience incredible. I finished it in one playthrough. I only wished that it was longer.

It is a must buy when on sale."
11359,Very pretty visuals and fun parkour grappling gameplay.  It can be frustrating in some parts but the atmospher and story more than make up for that.
11360,"Best shortest game on steam.. I really enjoied this game a lot!
thumbs up and ill be waiting for a sequel

+I love the storytelling"

11362,<3
11363,Fun but short
11364,"I've wanted this game for a long time, but it always seemed to slip my mind when I actually had money. Well, I saw it on sell for less than $3, and grabbed it in a heart beat. I do have to say, the game is short, but it's a great game. The visuals are pleasing, the music goes with the setting very well, and the whole parkour aspect is done beautifully. This game will leave you wanting more, so I defintely recomend it."
11365,"this game is the best game ever cuz i feel relax & chill
"
11366,"Extremely short, but Extremely excellent.

 The game mechanics seem rather dull at first, but then with the progression of abilities and your own experience, it quickly becomes a fast and engaging game. The story is extremely simple yet charming in the regard that; the characters are fleshed out just enough to fit into the classic simplistic role of story book characters, but it's mixed with a beautiful world and hints of historical mystery, compelling you to not only complete the game, but explore it."
11367,"Great game, when it came on sale for only $2.59, but Not worth the Normal $12.99, as it will only last you a max of 2 hours.  
----------------------------------
Good points of the game-
* Cool Story, and beautiful Scenery.
* Challenging parkour at times.
--------------------------------
Bad points of the game-
* Very Short game.
* Some Parkour Area's are very tough, and can make you very fustrated untill you notice you can land on spots that you're not supposed to, then it's easy.
* Voice actor's are not the greatest, but it's passable.
* Not much of an Adventure, Mostly just a Role playing game.  You Play a role as a Father telling a story, and are bound to tell that story.  You can not Explore or adventure around as much as you may like, or think you will be able to, as there is only one direction you can go in the game.
* Lastly, There was not enough Interactable content in the game to really Peak my interest, as The only thing's you could interact with was the story's Main protagonists, and the collectibles.  This is kind of sad as an adventure game goes.  It would have been nice to see more of a side story displayed in items, journals, citizens, etc...  Sadly the only 2 places that had this was the Village at the beginning and His workshop, After that it was just a Story that you were forced to follow that had no, ""Adventuring"", as it may claim.
----------------------------
Over all, This game is pretty decent at the Cost of $2.59.  It would be a complete rip off at $12.99.

Is Ridiculously short, has no Adventuring, parkour can be annoying at times, and overall is Decent.  Would Rate it a 7.5/10 for graphics, 3/10 for animations of characters.  1/10 for length of game.  and 6/10 for story.  

For an average rating of 4.3/10."
11368,"Disclaimer:  I only played this game for about an hour.
Disclaimer:  I got it on sale.
I LOVE IT.  
It's like, I've never smoked weed.  But I doubt it could get me this high(literally) and mellow me out this much(also literally).
The game is truly amazing to me, because it's so different, and it, so far, doesn't have a lot of violence or action.  Maybe things will get more... ""interesting""... later on... but I like it just the way it is. 
If you can get it on sale, the feeling is worth the cash, especially when [spoiler] you get to the village [/spoiler]."
11369,Great game. Sometimes annoying though
11370,"It's too short to justify $12.99, but if you can get it for cheap it's worth buying.

It's portal-esque in playstyle, though not in storyline. The storyline is great too, and the end has some feels if you're into that.

Failing a level is also very fluid and easy to deal with. There are check points periodically though each level and after failing you respawn in 0 seconds at the last check point and you can try again. It's not too easy, and the punishment for failure is not too hard.

Great game, 8.5/10"
11371,"Absolutely breathtaking visual. Super fun platforming game jumping from platform to platform, grappling from one to another. It's basically Mirrors Edge 2.0! The only thing I'd change is to have the narritives a bit more fluid. Other than that this is a beautiful game! :D"
11372,"Short game... amazing story.
9/10"
11373,Game is great but sadly short but for $2.59 on sale it is worth it
11374,This game is amazing! My only complaint is that the NPCs look terrible.
11375,"Pro's: Fun little game, cool mechanics (between booster rocket shoes and basically the bionic command arm redone).

Con's: A bit short, unimpressive storyline. No real replay value.

I think I payed about 3 euro's (sale)
And I considered that well worth it, but even for full price (i think about 8 or 9  euro's) I'd not consider it a los for a  day of fun gaming.
"
11376,"fucking amazing, wish it'd be longer though
"
11377,"Short, sweet and simple, like this review. 

Well worth the pretty pennies I spent on it."
11378,I would recomend you to dowlaod this game GREAT story line and fun challenges to do when you beat it although the story isnt that long the challenges make up for it and i hope they will make a second one where hes nephews daughter and his nephew go visit him again and its all different lvls and we get to see maddie again!
11379,Short 'n sweet :-)
11380,"The game looks absolutely beautiful and the grappling mechanic was super fun to play. I spent at least 20 minutes just looking around taking screenshots on some parts. There isn't much to say for a story for a the first part of the game, but by the end it actually became pretty emotional and was extremely satisfying. A bit buggy, but nothing too noticeable. Would definitely recommend, I had a lot of fun."
11381,This game is fucking incredible!
11382,"""I enjoy this game. i got on sale buy now if its still on sale u guis""    -Billy"
11383,Too short of a game. I beated the game in 2 hours.
11384,So nice and so poetic game. I really enjoyed playing this game. It's short but worth playing.
11385,"Just amazing. Buy it.
"
11386,Awesome first person adventures platformed game. The map are beautiful. A lot of unique mechanic. I really enjoy it. Good game!
11387,"This game's graphics look amazing, besides some of the character models which I think look a little PS1(ish), the parkour aspect is awesome, rocket boots, grapple hook, long jumps, and it flows so well. The voice acting could be better, but it's not so bad that it makes you cringe or just straight up dislike it, it's decent voice acting, but not the best. The story and concept, is AMAZING. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it's got a great story, with many elements over the game that have pleasantly suprised me, and I'm sure will continue to pleasantly suprise people every time someone newly plays it. There are some levels and parts of levels that are easy, some that are in between, and then there's also hard stages, the game provides a good balance in difficulty, but when there is a hard stage, be prepared, it WILL be hard, the difficult stages of this game are actually suprisingly difficult, but not so mind numbingly difficult that you want to smash your head into the keyboard, just the right amount of difficulty.

Overall, this game is a great game and I extremely recommend it to anyone who's thinking about playing it."
11388,"A fantastic little indie game, beautiful visuals, stunning soundtrack, superb gameplay. A very hypnotic experience. For players who enjoyed 'Everybodys gone to the rapture', 'Journey' you're sure to enjoy this !!!"
11389,You can run backwards.
11390,"Dad tells daughter 3 hour bedtime story about a guy travelling a world to find another guy who just sends him straight back home. 9/10 
"
11391,i've just beaten the game and it was amazing you have to buy it.
11392,13/10
11393,One of the best storys i have ever played and some of the best sights in a game i have ever seen
11394,"A Story About My Uncle,A game of beauty and ideas mashed softly into one astonishing game.Its physics work great and it was a story to remember.The Storyline was wonderful,the game also gives beautiful views although its pretty small size.Its a  pretty short game although some parts may need more patience or skil.The Soundtrack was a bit dull or even off in sometimes but i consider it to make it more tense as the soundtrack dies off in the harder parts.During its calm states,the game made me confused on where to go.I was  playing and it said go to the windmill although the real objective isnt in the windmill(bug or mistake)

Pros:
Beautiful Views
Great Game Physics
Gameplay is good 
Futuristic Parkour
Really Amazing Storyline
Played by Leafy

Cons:
Soundtrack dies off(silent)sometimes
Confusing objectives and maps sometimes.
Short Game.
Lacks mod(e)s to make game more creative than only a 'one shot and leave' game
Maps is somtimes unclear on where to go.

My Review says this game gets a: 8.5/10
Although the game was nicely done,the lack of content after finishing the story is quite annoying.This game has much potential,maybe racing or fighting.Maybe let community do something.thats what's missing.I got this in a discount for  2 dollars so it was worth it for me but for those who payed full price?they must want more.That's all this game needs,more content after finishing the game.
Thanks for Reading!
If you'd like to know what i personally think of a certain game and I haven't review it.Go ahead and add me on steam."
11395,"So. I just finished this game in about 2 and a half hours. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is one of the most thrilling, relaxing, just visceral game I have played in quite some time.

The game might seem a little short, but it's beautiful. It's an amazingly written work of art and I never got bored. Not even once. Every corner, every room, every single hallway you traverse through is different. Not once did I feel like I was doing the same thing repeatedly. 

The voice acting is spot on, some minor interaction with more of the villagers would have been nice just to make everything seem more lively but because they all have their own little piece of the world it never felt like it was empty. Not even once. I should add that there are replayability features like a dedicated time trials mode, level selection, and hidden collectibles which unlock special features in the menus for you to use at your own discretion! (I could only find about 1/4 of them on my first playthrough)

I love little titles like this because they truly show what indie studios are capable of. I would definitely recommend picking up this game if you would like an immersive story that is both gripping and enigmatic at parts. 

I should note that this game might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy parkour you should definitely check this title out because it has a wonderful parkour / swing mechanic and then some other little treats as well!"
11396,"The graphics are stunning, and something about the ending, and near-beginning, made me feel as though it were real life, and the puzzles were challenging but fun. Basically, everything about this game was amazing 10/10."
11397,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Once I started playing it, I could not stop until the very end. Great game!"
11398,Short yet fulfilling. The game that meets the point in which you would want more but are still satisfied with what you get.
11399,"A Story About My Uncle is an ok game, and has a good story. I'd reccomend making a second game. Still, this game has this really awesome suit and i really want one for myself. 6/10"
11400,Thank you leafy for introducing me to this beautiful game ;D!
11401,Such fun platformer mechanics & puzzles wrapped in a touching story.
11402,Beautiful and fun 10/10 HIIIISSSSSSSS
11403,"This game is woderful. I would recomend it to nearly anyone who has the hardware to run it. Luckily, compared to many games coming out these days, this games has a very lax minimal and recomended system requirements. Even if your computer can't run a newer tripple A game without it turning into a slide show, you should still be able to run this.

Here is an overall list of what I thought about the game:
+ = positve aspects
N = neuteral (May be positive or negative depending on the person, but overall neuteral)
- = negative aspects

+ The art and soundtrack of this game is beautiful. It is a great example of graphics serving asthetic, instead of graphics for graphics sake (for you aspiring games designers).
+ The story is awsome, and one of the greatest selling points of the game. Without spoilers, the story is sort of like a science fantasy bedtime story.
+Great use of non-combat mechanics. This game is something that one could use to calm down after being spawncamped for a hour and a half in Planetside 2, or something fun to play with children.
+The main mechanic if the game, the grapple hook, is fun to mess around with. The puzzles one must solve with it are challenging, but fair. At it's best, I felt like Tarzan swinging from rock to rock with my grapple hook.
+ The puzzles are fair. While it may take a few tries to get one or two of them right, they still feel satisfying to complete. When you fail, the game puts you at a recent point you were at, that's not rage inducing. Usualy, you never have to redo more than 30 seconds of progress on failure (though some times checkpoints are a bit more sparse). The game ramps up in difficulty as you progress, but it never felt impossible.
+ The game runs at 15fps on a nearly five year old Radeon HD 5450. The game is playable at this framerate

N There was both a subttle My Little Pony and a Game of Thrones refrence in the dialoge. They weren't distracting, but they put a little smile on my face.
N There isn't any real way to turn up or down the graphics settings outside of V-sync, motion blur, and resolution.
N When you hit a pice of geometry oddly, you will get launched. Sometimes, it feels awesome as you use it to help you solve a puzzle, other times it is rage inducing when you get launched off cource right before a checkpoint. This isn't a game breaking bug, just a little quirk that you'll encounter a few times.

- It is hard to judge distance in this game. The lighting cues can mess with the brain at times. Often times, I would find out that I could grip a rock that seemed out of distance, or I was out of range of a rock that I deffinantly thought I could reach. This is esspecialy noticable in later levels.

In conclusion, A Story About My Uncle is a great game that everyone should get around to playing at some point. I would say that it is worth the normal sale price, and one would be a fool if they passed up the oppertunity to get is while it is on sale. The developers did a great job on this game.
"
11404,I decided to play this because I saw Markiplier play it and I must say that it is really well made and fun.
11405,"Its beautiful. the story was great. introduction was bringing my attention and kept me hype just playing the game, but i notice this game only got very positive. sure it is hard to play and the platform seem like you can't reach it but you will get use to it. the voice actors we're great just put some more beautiful music to it. I love the game for its packour and the aspect of the surroundings sure its seems to be a couple of hours to complete and you wish for me but that leaves you wanting for more of it, just like a book leaving hiding things why did the this protagonist want this and that. There should be a part two to this to get people to want the game more. If their is a part two to this I would love to play it"
11406,"I just bought this game from sale and I already loving it. It's calm and fun, kinda challenging but not too much. You explore and see awesome views. 

With %80 percent discount it's a [b] steal. [/b]
Even without discount it's definitely worth it. 
<3"
11407,Looks absolutely awesome! Sweet story! Can't go wrong with it
11408,"Ive never been a huge fan of first person platforming (FPP), but A Story About My Uncle makes FPP enjoyable. Propelling yourself through the air and running through the levels is a lot fun while it lasts. The story, while simple is engaging and it has a satisfying and moving ending with a sutble message behind it. Its not perfect though. The grappling can be unresponsive at times and the game seems to change the rules of grappling occasionally. Sometimes you can grapple rocks and walls from far away. Other times you have to be close in order to grapple. the voice acting in the game is not at all great. Its pretty bad at points. The game is also VERY short. You can beat it in one sitting, and after you do there isnt much reason to return. There are time trials, but its of the same levels from the main game and do not really add anything. Especially since there is no online leader boards to see other peoples times. Overall, the game is good. I like it, but im no where near loving it. 

BEST ASPECT: THE PLATFORMING 
WORST ASPECT: THE LENGTH
FINAL VERDICT: 6/10"
11409,"I bought this game for sale of $2.59, I'm the type of person that a game is worth a dollar an hour, If I can get at least 2 hours out of this game, having paid $2 for it then it is worth the money spent on it. I can definately say it is worth more then that, The 2 hours I have currently spent on it is partially through the game and I definately plan on finishing the game! It is really fun controls and story!"
11410,10/10 Geat story and great gameplay
11411,"Well worth the money! Replayable as heck and a nice storyline, if a little anticlimatic. But that's the way stories should be sometimes."
11412,"I think this game is relaxing, beautiful and peaceful. Not only that, but it also has a great story. 


The only drawback on this game is that it's pretty short. The game can be completed in less than 2 hours."
11413,"i was expecting  shooting some alien but what i got is ezreal use arcane shift multiple time 
9/10"
11414,Very short but worth every second. Very nice to play a game where you know the developers put their heart and souls into it.
11415,One of the most beautiful games I've played
11416,"Though the first playthrough is pretty entertaining, there's just not that much content"
11417,"HISSSSSSS

Says everybody

I am here because it looked good. Not because of LeafyIsHere."
11418,Maddie's Challange. That is all I'm gonna say.
11419,"What a beautifully made game! I admit it didn't take me long to finish, but that in no way drew away from the charm of the game, from the beautiful level design to the simple but touching story, this was a lovely experience from start to finish. I will definitely be re-playing this for a while, worth the small amount it costs."
11420,"Great game had so much fun, but it only took my 2 hours to finish."
11421,"Beautiful game, nice mechanix and very enjoyable.

10/10

Make a sequel please!"
11422,One of the most beautiful games i have played.
11423,Better than Mirrors Edge Catalyst
11424,"I bought this game for $2.59 while it was on an 80% sale. I have seen LeafyIsHere use this game as background footage for gis videos so i thought i would enjoy this game BUT. I didnt know that it was a pretty short game. 

I loved this game! 9.5/10 in my eyes. Would be a 10/10 if it was a longer game. I absolutley loved the story behind this, AND THE NARRORATING WAS FANTASTIC!!! I zoned out a little while playing and sort of felt like i was in the game because of how the story was told. The way the story told you what you were saying in response to characters ingame and made it sound like a bedtime story was phanominal.

Now lets talk about the graphics.. I have a pretty ok computer i76600 16gbRAM gtx 970 2 tb and i was getting 60fps on highest settings BUT i dont think i turned off a frame cap. The game looked like the sexiest thing in the world. It enhanced the experience by a million. 

So you can get a couple, maybe a few hours of gameplay in before you beat the game. I managed to beat the game in under 2 hours and i returned it so i could get my $2.59 back and buy something else. This does not mean that the game was bad though. I dont like redoing things. Like watching the same movie twice or playing the same thing over and over. Alot of things get instantly repetitive to me. But thats just me. 

If you are someone who likes to replay things over and over so you can ""relive"" the experience i HIGHLY reccomend this game to you! If you are someone who doesnt (like me). I would try to beat this game in under 2 hours and refund it.

Once again this game is a 9.5/10 for me and i highly reccomend it for everyone."
11425,The best platformer i have played so far even though it is very short so could do with community map's definitely worth the ¬£1.99 sale price
11426,"> Beautiful atmosphere.
> Simple but working story.
> Slightly emotional.

< Short.

Defiantly reccomend."
11427,comment on this review if you love benis
11428,"Great game, but it was very short."
11429,"This game is a good bit of challenge mixed with a neat story. Some good old platforming for those who like that sort of thing. Granted it's a short game, especially if you just play to finish and could be beaten in only a couple hours. That being said, it was well worth the time I DID spend playing it."
11430,"A beautiful story with beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay.
10/10"
11431,"I had to punch a wall to feel manly again. This game is so touching, beautiful and amazing to play. It's a short game but if this game ever came out with a new story(Perhaps following the daughter) I would willingly spend 100$ easy just to experience some more of this amazing work."
11432,Excellent gameplay with a great story
11433,"A novel and fun 3D puzzle-platformer, the game hints at mysteries and histories that it never fully explores - but it makes for a rich, full world that was a pleasure to explore."
11434,"A nice, fun little game. Not too difficult but still a wee bit of a challenge. None violent, and rather relaxing :)"
11435,I really enjoy this game it is very fun to play and has a great story
11436,"Story telling, art, gameplay/mechanics, difficulty all phenomenal...only downside is how short it is. I could stay in this game for a long time. I hope to see more games like this."
11437,"I have enjoyed this game very much, the story is very intriguing. The game is at the ""just right"" challenging point.
I HIGHLY recommend this game to others."
11438,amazing game. great story. buy it.
11439,"Just an incredible game. Not too long, but still worth every second of it. The whole world is beautiful and the movement is both challegning and fun, and you can feel yourself getting better. Seriously a great game overall."
11440,"very nice game but too small i hope they will make version II or an expant took me 3 hours to complete it 
now if i will suggest that game yes but only if u find it in dicount  is a good relaxing game worth spending some 
hours in it"
11441,10/10 Yoda on Luke Skywalker's back simulator
11442,"good story





reminds me of my uncle"
11443,the game is pretty
11444,"Very short game I beat in in 2 hours but other than that it is a very fun and intriguing.
Gameplay 10/10
"
11445,A few problems with launching but it was worth the trouble
11446,"Eventhough it's short, I really liked it and I'd appreciate seeing more games like this."
11447,"This game is really fun. I'd honestly pay more for this game if I had to, its just that good. The story is great, the environments are beautiful, and the mechanics are fantastic.
If you've ever wanted to be Spider-Man, while flying around in environments that have a Bioshock vibe, then this the game for you."
11448,"Overall, this game is totally worth a buy. It has a little over 3 hours of the STORYLINE gameplay, but also has time trials to do after you complete the story. Although the storyline is okay, and the voice acting isn't great, I'd say the gameplay is phenomenal. If it goes on sale(it is at the time of writing this), DEFINITELY buy. If not, still worth the $12 or so.

Little side note for the devs: 
If you end up making a sequel(which I'm pretty sure everyone wants), please do some of the following:
-Add multiplayer for friends to be able to make/play maps together
-Make the singleplayer story longer"
11449,Very fun for only less than 3 hours of gameplay. I'd only buy it if it's on sale personally.
11450,"After finishing the game in almost 4 hours, I must say, this game is [strike]good[/strike] [b]AMAZING[/b]. 

I recommend it to anyone that wants an amazing story that will immerse you into the game, and make you feel like you're actually in it yourself. The gameplay is amazing, and so are the graphics. 

Once I finished the game I couldn't stop thinking about it for some time. Buy it now.

Btw,[spoiler]tell Fred I said hi.[/spoiler]"
11451,"Amzing game, one of the most lovely stories.
Though one thing that could be improved is the length of the storyline, atm it's very short. Took me about 1,5h too complete. 
But I highly suggest buying the game!"
11452,Cool little game.
11453,"One of the best indie games I have ever played. Great story, a bit sad, but still very good."
11454,"The game is nice and the whole gameplay is very fun. The only problem i found with it was the story. I mean it was kind of predictable, but if you want a game to play for a couple hours with some fun gameplay then give it a shot."
11455,Best story-driven game i have played in a really long time. The parkour aspect in cobination with the narrating really makes it feel like you're playing something that somebody is telling to someone else. absolutely LOVE this game!!!
11456,THE GAME IS VERY FUTURISTIC!
11457,"i love this game, i sat down and played it for 1 and a half hours, it is the type of game that is challenging but at the same time amazing. it is the type af game you can sit down and play without having to rage 9.725/10"
11458,"This game is quite short, only about 2 hours for the main story, but it was really enjoyable and I can see myself replaying it again, eventaully. This is one of those games that just makes you feel cool, swinging through the air from floating rock to floating rock just feels cool. If you enjoy movement based fps games I would defintely recommend but, only if you can find it on sale because I can't see this being worth the $12 asking price, however if you can pick it up for $5 or under I would buy it in a heartbeat."
11459,"It's a good game. The controls work well and the gameplay can be pretty challenging sometimes. 
As others have stated, it's a pretty short game. I played it through in 2 hours. I would not pay full price for this game. Snatch it while it's on sale!"
11460,"Great game, great adventure."
11461,"Really fun game. Unfortunately the story is rather short, but it is totally worth the money. Buy it."
11462,"This game's pretty cool.

[h1] CONS [/h1]
During the game, there's a lot of interesting things that are said that make you ask yourself questions and most of these are never really awnsered when you reach the end of the game. Also, the voice acting is just sort of weird in some parts. It isn't terrible, but it just wasn't really natural sounding either.
____
Overall, this game was well worth it if you're thinking about picking it up on sale"
11463,The level design wrote a check that the physics engine couldn't cash. Gameplay is just way too janky and clunky. I feel like half my deaths were because of weird bugs instead of mistakes that I made.
11464,"Truly a magnificient, mind boggoling game. The graphics are pretty amazing untill you see the npc's, but they are unique and you find yourself getting used to them. I love the story. I's catchy and i would reccomend  it to anyone wanting a challange along with a emotional story.

Pros:
Great story
Challanging
likeable graphics

Cons:
Checkpoints could be closer together
Sometimes you can get confused on where to go"
11465,It's short but great and a beautiful game. I hope thay make some sort of sequel to this game and make it a little bit longer.=]
11466,"Best story adventure game i have ever played. Im so glad i actually spent my money on it! I reccomend you should too!

Please devs [spoiler] there is room for a sequel with the little girl! [/spoiler]

[spoiler] Did anyone else spend most of their time on Mddies Challenge xD! [/spoiler]"
11467,"Really good story line and very fun gameplay. But way too short.

finished it in 2 hours"
11468,"Good story, good graphics, and lots of fun! If you like games with parkour and adventure this is the game for you. Story only takes around 4-5 hours to beat, which is worth the $2 I spent on the game."
11469,really fun game a lil on the short side but had a good story with interesting characters (other than the main character who doesnt even have his name mentioned lol)
11470,"TL;DR- If this game is on sale for less than $5, you should get it. 
At least for the sale price of $2.49 I got it for, this game was worth it. It's only about 3 hours long (I would assume around 4 or five if you get all the collectibles and do time trials) and replayability here is very low. But don't get me wrong- it's not bad because of that. It does have flaws, like having great checkpoints in the first 2 hours and in the end they think it adds more of a ""challenge"" to have bad checkpoints. The core FPPlatforming has 2 solid mechanics and an iffy 3rd one, with an element in the last section of the game (recharging spots on the walls for your grapple) but the hit detection made the ending challenge one of the most infuriating things I've ever played. 
Other than that, the story is cute with a heartfelt ending, the art direction is great (except for character models that are rough at best.) That's pretty much the whole game!"
11471,"Do not buy this game full price.

I just bought it today, 80% off so it wa 2.59$, and finished it, as you can see, it took a huge 2 hours to complete the game. And I even died quite a few times. I didn't get all the collectables, but it's still really short.

The game is beautiful, amazing artwork, incredible atmosphere, it makes you feel like you're a platforming GOD (even though you know you are dying over and over again). And is quite tricky at some parts. Very very enjoyable game. And I would reccomend it to anyone who likes platforming. However, it feels a bit overpriced at 12.99$, 2 hours is not very much, at all. I could spend more time trying out time trial modes and trying to find all the collectables but I'm not a completionist. I finished the campaign and that's good enough for me."
11472,"I bought this game on sale for $3(USD), and completed it within 2 hours, but I'm also fairly newish to gaming on a mouse. Even for a short as it is though, i absolutely loved it for the price I paid, for full price I still would have enjoyed it but possibly not as much."
11473,"A game i can actually play start to finish ~
10/10 Adventure"
11474,"A short and fun little first-person platformer. Whimsical narrative and visuals create the window dressing for what's basically a first person spiderman game.

The only (very minor) complaint I'd have is the redundcy of the A button. You have a button to jump and a seperate button that you hold to super jump. Superflous controls are my pet peeve.

I'd definetely recommend picking this one up."
11475,"Not sure if I would recommend at full price, but on sale, you need to pick this up! Great visuals, great platforming, great story, great atmosphere. It's everything you would ever want in a game. For a price of $2.59 currently on sale, theres no where you can really go wrong. What are you doing wasting your time reading this review? BUY THIS GAME!"
11476,Game can be beaten so fast you could probably return it if you beat it fast enough.
11477,Great game
11478,amazing game!!!
11479,"The game is definetly fun because of its mechanics but it has no replay value, simple things like a level creator could prolong immensly this game's life spand and not being able to skip the story made this game extremly annoying"
11480,"Some of the best parkour Ive ever done.

Helpful hint: raise your mouse sensetivity :)"
11481,"It's a really fun game, that includes many complicated challenges, with a very simple goal. To find Fred. This game can be very reflex and timing based, but it's overall a great game! Sometimes you will have no clue what to do, but you'll find your way out of it."
11482,"The game is really short, it only lasts around 2 hours. The graphics are nice and so is the grappling hook. The story really isn't that compelling imo and I didn't really get a chance to care much about any of the characters. I don't think the game is really worth $13, I got it on sale for $2.60. Get it if you want to swing on from a grappling hook in a nice looking game and are ok with a somewhat decent story"
11483,this game is awesome its a short story but highly recomned it so much fun :D
11484,"This game was absolutely beautiful. The scenery and graphics were so well done and it was just flat out cool. Alot of you who watch the youtuber Leafyishere probably recognised this game from his gameplay. Even though i wish that it was a little bit longer, i really enjoyed this game and highly recommened playing it."
11485,Very nice game!! good graphics
11486,Leafy
11487,A beautiful game that i would recommend to everyone.
11488,swinging from floating rock to floating rock with a cristal powerd grapeling hook is just awesome !
11489,"Short game, but really fun mechanics."
11490,perfect game very interesting parkours using grapple is so cool finished in 2 hours
11491,"Game has a good story, worth the $2.60"
11492,amazing game and leafy brought me here
11493,"Great game
Short game but amazing.
Good story
Fun movement feeling
I rate 10/10 
if you have nothing better to do this game is even better."
11494,"A very enjoyable although quite short platformer with great art and decent storytelling. Narrator's voice acting is a bit off as he is clearly not a native English speaker while everyone else is but otherwise good voice acting. 

Main concern is with level design as the game is about smooth, fast movement thoughout the level combining jumping, running and grappling but every now and then you come to a dead halt for about 2 minutes trying to work out where you have to go next. 

Next to no load times which is a big plus given how often you will fall. 

I picked this up heavily discounted paying under $4 but I don't feel it's worth the full asking price."
11495,"Beautiful scenery, fun mechanics and amazing storyline. 10/10 Best $2.60 I've spent"
11496,"One of the best games I have ever played, it is short, sweet and emotional. It is 100% worth the full price of 13 dollars even though it took me 3 hours to finish."
11497,"Really, really fun, just really really short. Took me less than three hours to finish."
11498,really great story
11499,"The game is as fun to play as it is beautifully made.
I decided to 'start' the game just before I took off to bed to get the initial story... those few minutes quickly turned into an hour or so and I had to drag myself away from delving deeper into this game.
Looking forward to playing it more..

Great game, world and music score all go well together and it has a neat story(what I know of it thus far) definitely worth a try!"
11500,This game is amazing you feel like you're actually in the world as you immerse yourself swinging around like spiderman as you run through caves and jump on floating rocks on the search for your uncle.
11501,Fun little quick thinking puzzle game. Sad it only took me 2 and a half hours to beat. Worth the $2.59.
11502,This was great i loved it. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite casula games to just pick up and play for a little bit.

Personal: Remind me of Hunter x Hunter anime, trying to find his Dad.
Equipment: Xbox One controller (Windows 10)[/code]
Wow. This is better than I expected! It felt short imo. I plan on replaying it just to unlock some of the features that the game have to offer- and I also missed some of the story telling parts <grr>. I also need to play more to unlock the rest of the cards drop (1 dropped after 2.5 hours of game play). It a fun game but I honestly do not believe it worth $13 dollars. $6 dollars is probably the most I'd think it goes for but that is just my opinion. I love the story telling and the scenery a lot. :) Thanks."
11504,"The graphics in this game are GORGEOUS. Whether it's an ice cave or airships and floating islands, every scene is detailed and breath-taking. The movement in the game is also quite unique; closest to anything I've ever played similar to it would be web-slinging with Spider-Man.

That said, there's little sense of free exploration: most caverns or spans appear to have only one way to cross them. Occasionally, when I would find (what SEEMED to be) alternate ways to get across a tricky expanse by landing solidly on an unconventional spot, my grapple and rockets wouldn't recharge because apparently that wasn't the way the developers intended for me to solve that particular problem.

Voice acting (at least for English) is subpar. The narrator is telling a bedtime story to his daughter, and nearly put ME to sleep with his monotonous drone. Also, that was his daughter?! Until he said so near the end, I thought the whiny little quasi-British schoolboy was, well, a BOY. And as beautiful as the music on the menu page is, I was expecting similar scores throughout the game; unfortunately, most of the game was without soundtrack.

But the real frustration with this game is the checkpoint system, as though it's a throwback to early 90s gaming. There's no saving your progress when YOU want to save the game: there are only scattered checkpoints which also serve as somewhat-helpful directional markers. Some sections require crossing two or three tricky spans before reaching the next waypoint, and if you fail, you'll have to go back to the checkpoint and do them all again. And again. And AGAIN. 

I tend to try to get all the achievements I can in games, but when I finished my playthrough (less than 8 hours of total gameplay; my ""hours played"" is artificially inflated by having left the game on pause overnight and through work the next day) and checked the available Achievements, I LOL'd at the thought of counting how many times I used the grapple tool through an entire segment to try to stay under par, then restarting the whole thing again if I went over...

No. Just... no.

Bottom line: Meh. I paid less than $3 for it, so I don't feel cheated, but I'm definitely not going to waste any more time on it."
11505,"short game but very appealing gameplay will make you wish it never ended, the price tag is a bit over the top given it's duration (2/3 hours) but on sale it's worth it, grapple and leap your way to your long lost uncle in a violence free adventure, an interesting and diferent take on the 1st person genre that's always overflowing with mindless shooters"
11506,"i beat this game in two hours, although simplistic its a fun game with a good naritive. you play as a father telling your daughter a story about your uncle, and an adventure you had when you were younger looking for him. flying through the air is extremely fun and relaxing. it runs very well, 180 fps at 1440p. this is a must buy when its on sale, and a solid buy when its not. i enjoyed the game very much. im not going to spoil anything, but really think about the ending."
11507,"Absolutley beautiful and stunning, this games enviroment is breathe taking as you soar and maneavur your way through the world. The movement is easy to use and is easy to understand with puzzles and tricks to keep you moving and thinking. That being said I did have minor issues. It is awfully short at about 2-3 hours worth if you just go through the story, looking for everything and doing the chievs may tack on an extra 2-3 hours but is really short for a orginal costing 13 doller game. The enviroment has some problems either getting stuck in a really odd place, being stuck in the falling animation with no way out, getting stuck on an invisible ledge, going through some of the world etc. And some work with the models on the characters would be appreciated as I took the frog people as monkey people by their feet looking way hairyer than they were, and if Maddy was suppose to appear 'cute', she came off as terrifying. The voice acting between the nephew and daughter was pretty decent, but the dialogue between maddie and some of the characters were slightly awkward and rather forced. Other than that amazing game"
11508,"I think the end could been better but over all the game was very nice, nice graphics, nice game play you go through some emotions. I would recommend."
11509,"Just finished the game and it is absolutely amazing. It's really worth it. The ending was very sad though :'c 
Other than that, the game itself looks beautiful. I enjoyed the whole game. There is one part in the game that's terrifying but I still enjoyed this game!

10/10"
11510,"Hey i-i'm just wondering if I could have a book of this, cause this...is such a touching story.9/10 would play all over again!"
11511,"It's ¬£1.99 and it's great.

Simple."
11512,"Absolutely beautiful game. Only took me 2 hours to beat, but it was still a really great game. The gameplay was awesome, the visuals were just gorgeous, and the story was amazing. I would highly reccomend this game for someone who is in need of a good game, or to anyone who loves indie games. 9/10"
11513,"I picked this game up on sale because it was 80% off. I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much due to the price tag and that I had never heard of it before but oh boy was I wrong. Visually this game is stunning, the levels all have a tonne of detail and are very well designed. The backgrounds of each level in particular are breath-taking. In the 4th level I found myself dying just to have a look around! Not to mention that the soundtrack compliments this game perfectly, and you find yourself soaring around without a care in the world because of the atmosphere created by this game.

Moving onto the gameplay - it's fun! I've never been a big fan of platfromers, especially 3D platformers, but this game got me hooked and I found myself playing it start to finish from the minute i picked it up. The jumping physics allow you to truly feel free in the air, and the grapelling hook gives you a fine degree of control as you soar from platform to platform.  Certain parts can be frustrating as it is very easy to overshoot a platform or just fall short, but with a little bit of perserverence you should find a way through pretty quickly. I found the waypoint system reasurring and extremely helpful as it can be very easy to lose yourself in the surrounding enviroments. 

The voice acting in this game isn't great, and neither are the character models, but then if you pick up this game, chances are you won't be playing it for that. The plot itself is rather simple, esentially just being a hunt. However, the way that the story is told is rather charming and I found myself rather enjoying the narrators commentary as the game progressed. 

My only other gripe is that the game is rather short, but then when you consider how much you're spending, then it shouldn't suprise you. What matters is the quality of this game, not the quantity and in that respect I believe it shines. 

Definately worth picking up and having a go!"
11514,Very good game but its very short
11515,"Good, but Short. I tried to explore where I could and got just under 4 hours. With that being said, I'm really bad at platforming and didn't do any challenges. It has a great story and the visuals are very nice.

If you like platforming and are a perfectionist then get it, it is really good.

If you are only here for the story, and it is an amazing story, than I'd still say get it at full price, but be aware that it isn't long. If 4 hours isn't enough to justify $15 then buy it for $10."
11516,"I LOVE this game it is fantastic the looks, the mechanics, only thing is a that the story is kind of lazy but done in a good way i really recommend it"
11517,Its A Good Game its got nice graphics cool gameplay mechanics and the story is decent... and for me the game was worth the price because i got it on sale for 2.49 and i think thats all its worth because its good but waste your money on a more in depth game
11518,"Very awesome game, great atmosphere, great platforming, very few minor bugs (nothing game breaking) overall a good purchase, thanks guys!"
11519,"Absolutely brilliant, very nice graphics, the game is quite easy and fun to play. Pretty relaxing, will play again, and I definitely recommend."
11520,"Easily one of my favourite games of all times. An experience actually, rather than a game - a [u]great[/u] experience. I've never played anything like it, something about this game is so charming and hypnotising. And it's not just the graphics (which are by the way flippin' great) but the overall atmosphere and story, it keeps you wanting to come back. Love it!"
11521,"I cried :c. Fred, Maddie. See ya"
11522,Good games to listen to some vaporwave and jsut chill.
11523,"Really good game, even though some levels are frustrating.
Completed it in 2 hours and only found 3 out of 25 collectibles"
11524,Sometimes it's really annoying. But the type of annoying that will want you to keep playing till you finish and unlock 'Time Trials'.
11525,"This game is very pleasing to my eyes and ears 

10/10"
11526,"This is a short game, it took me about 2 hours to complete it in one sitting (and I failed quite often). 

The game itself looks beautiful. The huge open areas alone are worth playing the game, they really inspire a sense of awe. The storytelling is decent. In the first few minutes, you learn the story is told [spoiler] as a bedtime story to the protagonist's daughter.[/spoiler] 
Lastely, the gameplay (by which I mean the movement) feels great. It is a lot of fun to swing around the impressive set pieces and it is certainly what kept me playing.

However, the game isn't perfect. The animations in general are pretty simple and lack complexity. This doesn't ruin the game by any stretch, but I did notice it fairly quickly. The finally, the story itself is a bit lacking in my opinion. I wasn't quite sure what the message was and I was surprised when it ended (I felt like there was more to be told). 

In any case, it is worth it! Especially for the sale it is on currently with 80% off!"
11527,"This game is wonderful. I beat it in 2 hours but it's and wonderful 2 hours. I would not recommend spending $13 on this game, cause of how short it is. Maybe but it on sale like I did. I hope for a sequel soon cause this game is breathtaking."
11528,"if youre looking for a fun game where you can grapple and shit, just cause 2 is what youre looking for"
11529,"Very nice, I like."
11530,ITS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11531,Great game lots of fun worth the money!
11532,"its a fantastic game, great graphics and an amazing story.

proble is that i finnished the game in 2,5 hours, so thats not a lot of playtime.

i would only recommend this game while it's in the sale. dont buy it at full prize."
11533,It is so fun and clever
11534,"Really worth the ¬£1.99 (it was on sale). Some say the audio is terrible, liek the dialogue but I think it's still great. Great game, would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to burn time on a simplistic game - yet quite entertaining too."
11535,"Pretty much everything you need for an awesome parkour game!!

the graphics are not tops, but boy, the art style is amazing!
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!






lol"
11536,"I can say that this is one of the best games i've played. A story that flows trough you veins while you jump from platform to platform. You'll never get bored between levels and the atmosfera that surrounds you, will make you to enjoy the game even more. 

I really have no words to describe what this game made me felt and i recomend it. It's totally worth."
11537,Just the best adventure game I've ever played. I recommend it! It has a great story line and a lot of action/parkour xDD
11538,"This game was seriously fun and had a great storytelling atmosphere. Also some really cool sequences and a feeling of scale within the caves and other environments. For the current sale price of $2.59 there's pretty much no way to be disappointed if you like any of the elements I just described!

This is a rare game that actually left me with a lingering feeling after it was done. I would like for it to have been longer just because it was enjoyable not because it was an unfair price for what you get. Like I say, enjoyable!"
11539,"What a pleasant surprise this game is...  The gameplay is fluid and the atmosphere is beautifully crafted.  Quite a gem, I highly recommend it if you're looking for a semi-casual fantasy tale.

Hope there's a sequel!"
11540,"This is a story about a boy who wanted an uncle.

No- not this game. But the review. The boy wanted an uncle- the only one he knew had gone away a long time ago. People said he was in jail. And so the boy grew up, never knowing extended family. And yet, by some stroke of luck, his best friend- who he had known since first grade- knew this. And bought him this game.

For the first time, the boy could go look for his uncle- lose himself in the fantasy and imagine he was REALLY looking for his uncle. Through echoing caves, windy skies, frozen paths- he kept searching, and searching, and searching for his uncle. 

And when the time came that he found him, the boy was happy.

He had found his uncle at long last."
11541,"This is an amazing game, good stuff"
11542,Super simple mechanics yet unique and very fun.  Storytelling is superb as well.
11543,Great game with a beautiful story and world (y)
11544,"So I just beat this game, it's a very short ride but worth it for cheap.

If you want an engaging story, fantastic characters and great voice acting then just keep moving. The voice acting and story of this game are so bad it makes me physically ill.

HOWEVER

If you looked at the trailer, looked at the screenshots, thought about it and thought ""man that sounds really fucking fun"" then you're right. 100% right.

It is so amazingly fun to zip around this beautifully rendered world and hop across the rocks that honestly I think my biggest complaint is that there isn't more of it.

The ending is good, it wraps everything up and even managed to make me feel a little sad and a little happy. All in all I would recommend this game.

I got it for $2, I'd go as far as $8 maybe $10."
11545,"Very relaxing and beautiful game.
Short but touching story. 
Highly recommended for the price!"

11547,"This game is soo good that it deserves some DLC.

Some innovative First Person platforming with some other clever features, good visuals and a cute story."
11548,This is a very unique game with a great story. It is not my cup of tea as I am not generally into story/puzzle games but I must give this one a thumb up because it is certainly one of the better story/puzzle games I have encountered.
11549,This remains one of my favorite indie games of all time
11550,I really liked that game but it was driving me nuts because its so complicated. The Story isnt really important and you forget it most of the time because you get so annoyed that the jumping puzzles are so difficult. But it was a lot of fun to play it
11551,"Short game. It's really pretty and the core mechanic is fun, but wears a bit thin by the end of the two hour playthrough. There are a lot of clipping bugs that often cause you to get stuck, especially if you're not following the correct path. Thankfully there are a lot of checkpoints, and death has no penalty.

6/10 would humble bundle again."
11552,"I bought this game expecting an innovative platformer with an endearing, well-written story.  I got a poorly executed mess with what may be one of the worst stories I've ever experienced. 

The good:
- The core concept is pretty interesting.  You jump from landing ground to landing ground by propelling yourself through grappling.  You also get a pair of rocket boots for an extra boost.
-  Some of the environments are pretty.
- It's short, so you don't have to endure it for long.

The Bad:
-The level design later in the game is pretty awful.  I frequently found myself alternating between baby's-first-platformer and obtuse sections where I had no idea where I was supposed to go.
-The core mechanic is poorly executed.  It's difficult to gauge how far the rocket boots will take you, or how far a gapple will propel you.  I found myself very frustrated as I had to replay sections over and over again.
-The voice acting is lackluster.  It ranges from ""Meh"" for the protagonist and his daughter, to ear-grating for the character Maddie.  I think her voice actress was trying to hide an accent.

The Ugly:
-One of the worst stories in any game I've ever played.  You're never given any reason to care about this uncle, who ***SPOILER WARNING*** [spoiler]only shows up at the very end for about a minute.  I was expecting some grand reveal, or an epiphany on the part of the narrator, or SOMETHING TO MAKE ME FEEL ANYTHING FOR ANY OF THESE PEOPLE, but you just walk up to him, chilling in the middle of nowhere for no reason, and he's like ""What's up, I'm staying here , you're going home.  Peace, dude.""  AND THAT'S THE GAME'S GRAND CLIMAX!!![/spoiler] ***END SPOILER***.  The game still tries to go full-on camp by also including a very boring subplot revolving around Maddie.  Seriously, the game didn't make me feel anything for any of the characters.
-The writing frequently read like something written in Swedish and thrown into Google translator.  The phrase ""for disposal of garbage"" stands out to me.

I'll gladly overlook bland gameplay for an enthralling and well-written narrative.  The reverse isn't true.  This game, while short, still isn't worth your time."
11553,lags mui hard
11554,Underrated game and worth playing if you like platformers
11555,"I loved this game. Although it was difficult at times and made me somewhat angry, I loved the story, the graphics, and the game mechanics."
11556,"It's a really nice, short game. I recommend it to players who wants to relax a bit. You can beat this game in 2-4 hours, but getting all achievements is a bit time-consuming and you will need more hours to do that.
The story is okay, but not really involving. Graphics are sometimes really great, some level designs are very nice and you can admire it for some time. Gameplay is good but can become a bit boring.
The story could be more involving, but I don't mind it that much. Also some hard levels could be more harder, but it's still nice game, good for relaxing and having a break in a nice, fantasy world.

"
11557,"So, until your daugther didn't ask you for a bedtime story, you never tell her about your Tony Stark wannabe uncle and his super suit with which he discovered a race of humanoid frogs that live up in the sky.

Fair enough out of 10"
11558,A story about my uncle is a great game. I would recommend it if you are a casual gamer and are into games with a basic storyline to follow. This is one of the best platforming games I have played.
11559,"A really nice platformer, but i felt that the story was a bit sad. It gets hard at the end. Worth every penny. Has a moderate replay value. Frogs are not bad people."
11560,"I would recommend this game for small children.
The gameplay is okay but gets boring quickly.

The voice acting isnt terrible, but is distractingly bad. The trite dialogue is unskippable.

The environment is beautiful, but is sadly wasted on a bad engine. The lighting is gamma-incorrect, which is not fixable with postprocess gamma.

The most horrifyingly awful character animation I've ever seen."
11561,"Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!

You are playing as a character with a power suit. With the power suit you are able to jump high, reach cetrain areas with the grappling hook and exploring around. There are blue icons on the ground, Those are checkpoints. It's a story that you will tell your kid about before going to sleep. During your game and progress, You will unlock more of the story and power ups.  The game doesn't really have any enemies, It's more jumping and platforming around with a nice atmosphere.

Controls are good.
Scenery are nice.
Graphical (animation)  is a bit meh.
Nice atmoshpere.
Game is short
Okay story.
Collectables :(
A bit repetitive.
Game is frustating.

[h1]Other things.[/h1]

Game has suicidal Frogs, Jumps into the Dark deep pit.
The Male voice announcer is talking without any expression. Just monotone.
Grapple is sometimes glitched, even if ur in range, the indicator doesn't show up.

-------------------

I Give this game a 6/10"
11562,Solid game. Fun running and jumping and grappling. Didn't overstay its welcome.
11563,swing around like spiderman for a while and run by some smurfs preaty much sums it up
11564,"Pretty good game, it wasn't incredible good, but it was good enough and also this is one of the most original games I ever played. Not only the game mechanics are very fresh and polished, but also the world feels very original, with unique creatures and places instead of the typical ones of most pop media.
If you are looking for something different and at the same time something good, this is your choice.
"
11565,es gud
11566,The visuals are great.  You really get a frightened feeling when falling/flying far distances.  The controls and platforming/puzzle mechanics are solid.  This game gives the original portal a run for it's money in the FPS platforming/puzzle genre.
11567,"A very unique and fun game that brings challenges to its gameplay. 
Or at least for me, I'm still getting the hang of things.
But it's one of my favorites 10/10"
11568,Short but absolutely fantastic game. Waiting for second one?
11569,"Fantastic game with beautifull scenery and music and interesting story.

In my opinion THE BEST GAME EVER!!!"
11570,Though this game is short i enjoyed my time soaring through the beatiful skies of a mysterious land filled with strange little creatures. Would definitely reccomend this game to a friend.
11571,"It's a fun and overall great gabe, but some of the times it is just so unfair. It changes rules almost all the time, a gap similar to a previous gap you could do without jumping is impossible to do without it. It's so frustrating. But nitpicks aside it's great."
11572,"It's not a game but an ill-conceived story. The protagonist is telling a story to his daughter/niece about his uncle, Fred. You start at your uncle's home, you put on a special energy suit and teleport to a strange realm with a garbage transporter. In this realm, all your uncle's tadpoles have mysteriously evolved into frog men. They form a society in the caves. You meet one of the odd ones called Maddie. Maddie travels with you in search of Fred. During your travels, you start off with meeting giant one-eyed monster that scream at you if you move, but the game quickly devolves into lacklustre spelunking and aerial swininging once you reach the Strays.

PROS
1. Cheap Game
Got it on Bundlestars for less than a $1.

2. One-Eyed Monster
I hope this wasn't some thinly veiled sexual reference. The tadpoles don't allude to something promising though.

CONS
1. Jumping and Swinging 
Just more jumping and swinging. Where is the game?

2. Really Short
It's over like in a few hours. I did mine in 3 hours.

3. Story is Really Bad
At the end, you meet Fred and then you get teleported home. The End. WTF?"

11574,Very gud i recomend u to try this is worth the money
11575,This game is fantastic the animations and storyline were well thought and executed 11/10
11576,"I just finished this game and I must say, while it is a short game and you would not have a problem finishing it in one sitting, I believe it deserved at least a 80 on metacritic and they where a little harsh on this game for it to receive 73. The graphics are stunning which goes great with the intersting and unique movement system and plot line. Overall I think you will be very well satisfied spending $12 on this game. And to the devs, you all did great on this game and I think I speak for the magority who have played this game, PLEASE make some sort of sequel to this game and if you do, please make it a little bit longer. But still, great game."
11577,"The graphics are really stunning esp. the art style! The controls are quite good and the game runs pretty dang great !

The story is amazing however short!

Pros: amazing graphics/art, Really good story, Controls

not good or bad: very repitive at times.  =====> keep in mind its a physics based game thats hinged around story and parkour

Cons: the game should be a bit longer but if you see the game on sale snatch it up

overall great game thats held back by the overall game legnth more then anything and somewhat lack of exploration!"
11578,"I short game, you can beat it like in 4 hours but if you looking for all achievements and all the extras maybe it goes for 6 hours maybe.
The graphics are cool, their arent like next-gen or something but the game looks good.
The soundtrack is nothing special, the story its about finding your uncle and for that you need to pass some obstacles, the gameplay is solid, fun and responsive, the paths arent so difficult, sometimes you will repeat the same path because you miss the jump or havent seen that stone, but you will be able to manage it.
In the end is a good game, nice story, nice gameplay.
Recommended."
11579,"I have played this game for only 45 mins but I'm already in love with it. The grappling hook mechanics, the physics, the tranquillity they all make up a perfect atmosphere. Buy.It.Now.!"
11580,"8/10
Amazing game,
but too short :(
I honestly would have rated it 10/10 if it was longer."
11581,"this is a beautiful game, well developed, and a ton of time put into not only the story but, also the graphics, and game mechanics, if your new to the game, and you are probably new to these game mechanics, it teaches you how to play which is totally necessary when introducing new mechanics like this,

although I absolutely love this game, it can be a little difficult if your computer isn't the best, I own a run of the mill toshiba laptop, with 8 gig's of ram, and it runs the game beutifully, although it is dificult to hit some of the targets sometimes, 
another issue I have with the game is a small glitch that happens when you get to the first stray village, it's not very big, in fact it's only a graphical glitch, but when looking around you will notice that sometimes you will look past something and the image will get stuck, sort of, you can see past the stuck image, but it sort of becomes a new layer on top of the real world, like I said, it's not that bad, but it's mildly annoying and distracting,

still this is a beutifully developed game, and I absolutly am obsessed with it, 9.9 / 10, like I said the graphical glitch isn't that bad, just mildy annoying."
11582,"I want to start by saying I do not believe that Fred got as far as he did without ever dying!
Maybe I'm not skilled enough but I found it really frustrating to play on controller - I'd have given up by the third part if the game didn't look as incredible as it does. The visuals are gorgeous and the sound is great, but meeting Fred was anticlimactic and I felt like they could have spent more time on that part. 
I thought some of the tags were placed badly, and there's some hitbox weirdness which can send you flying in the wrong direction even if you grapple onto the tag. Sometimes you will grapple onto a platform, but if you're not quite above the platform you'll get stuck just below it - I don't think it would have hurt to just move the player above the platform.
The story and message is quite sweet as well, and there are loads of easter eggs and collectibles that I will look for when my hands recover and I play through it again. If you like the idea of swinging through the air, and you're not a fan of Spiderman, you'll love this."
11583,"gr8 game

U fly like spooderman and who doesn't wanna be spooderman?!

I r8 it 9/11 terrorist bombs"
11584,"I absolutely loved this game if your looking for an awesome game to play i recommend this. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fun, and its only $12.  10/10 would recommend !!!"
11585,"Just under 3 hours of game play, but very satisfying and fun."
11586,One of the Best Games ever Period. has a blend of what I love most
11587,"I bought this game because i saw leafy play it :D

10/10 leafy approved"
11588,Too dark
11589,Amazing game. Challenging and fun. just get it
11590,"This is a bedtime story, so this one is really short, only about 2.5 hrs. But it is just enough - you rush through the game in one breath so it does not become boring, although you achieve some upgrades.
Very magnificent visualisation, simple and entertaining gameplay, really good plot. What else is needed?
P.S. A Story About My Uncle gave me this flying feeling, though we all know this is not the first air-game. Really, i felt [i] this[/i] during my playtime. 
Recommended for sure."
11591,"Amazing game with an beautiful atmosphere and wonderful graphics. Story is short and sweet, nothing exciting but good enough to give some goosebumps at the end. Mechanics feel surprisingly good, like i really wasnt expecting them to feel that good. i see a lot of people complaining about unclear passages and pathways. i was never stuck for more than 30 secs trying to find my next jump and those moments were few and far between. (if you really get stuck try looking up and down, there will pretty much always be a little glowing marker on the places you supposed to go). i just finished my second run a couple months after i did it the first time, and found it equally enjoyable. well worth paying full price for and a cant miss if its on a sale"
11592,"And guys who made this game can you patch this ,I dont understand wher I need to go!
add some kind hints!"
11593,"What you get from this game:
- About 4h of story content
- 5 easy to complete, tough to master levels
- Beautiful environments
- Odd voice acting
- actually hard achievements

Buy it if you\'re not a pro but still want to enjoy some parkour, or don\'t mind running the same terrain over and over to reach perfection.
Don\'t buy if you\'re looking for a rich story experience."
11594,Very GOOD GAME!!!
11595,"Now, I won't say much, but this game is fantastic - it's a beautifully animated, cute game that isn't all too hard, but really captivates when you play. It's a game to play at night, I feel, so you can get lost in this imaginary world; a world that took me straight back to my childhood.

The gamplay is simple, albeit the difficulty follows; it didn't take long to complete nor was it particularly frustrating to complete, but it was just right for a relaxing and gentle game.

If you like a challenge, or fast-paced games, this may not be for you. But if you're like me and you just want something to fully immerse with then I'd say you ought to go and get it."
11596,Very fun.
11597,"I honestly really enjoyed playing this game. It was quite a touching story. The graphics are really amazing and it tests your limits. I really wish the storyline was longer though. Perhaps when his uncle passes away, he can go back and see the development. This game is super relaxing and I totally recommend it."
11598," This is a very solid,very short first person platformer. I wouldn't say it's quite as good as Mirror's Edge but the running,jumping,grappling mechanics are pretty well developed all the same. The environment's are gorgeous and the story is actually fairly touching. Over all a worthwhile couple of hours (bare in mind I didn't search much for the unlockables). An intimate and entertaining game. Garb it on sale for sure."
11599,"Ok not gonna put it lightly, it only had about 2 hours worth of gameplay. Which was dissappointing. NOW after saying that I will say this is one of those games that you complain about it being to short because you want more of it. This game gave me the feeling of Dear Esther with the mechanics of Mirrors Edge. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The gameplay itself is very fluid and nice. The only con is, is myself wanting more from a game that is already perfect. Great game, will play through again multiple times."
11600,"Man this game......this game is amazing. Yeah the controls are crazy fun and flying around is one of the best things ever, but the themes man. The THEMES. I have about 7 hours on record, and i've thoroughly enjoyed ever second of this game. But once you get into it, once you REALLY get into all the hidden places and secrets, it's.....it's a whole other experience. I went through this game, finding hidden messages around the maps. Eventually, once translated, i figured out that this isn't about a crazy adventure. It's about [spoiler] death . And the nephew's inability to cope with his uncle's death[/spoiler]. The two messages in particular that i found were [spoiler] ANGER and ACCEPTANCE, two of the five stages of grief. Anger, in the second stage, and Acceptance just before being launched back to earth. Paired with the pictures at the end on the map in Fred's office, it's obvious that Fred didn't have an awesome adventure. And neither did his nephew. His nephew grieved for a long time over his uncle's death. [/spoiler]. What i've discovered in this game was that psychology affects people in so many different ways, and how we react to things is what makes us human. What we dream of, what we would die for, and what we love. This is definitely a game i will never forget."
11601,"Great game. Cute story, nice parkor, casual game you can play and follow along bit by bit: extremely fun in the end."
11602,"Increadible game, only spent 11 hours on it yet it seemed like this game was better than anyother long games ive ever played. Its creative stories and sceneries got me the most.
11/10 would play again and fall in love with it again and play it till the end."
11603,This game freaking epic. I love everything about this game.
11604,"Fun gameplay, cute."
11605,"I know the game is a few years old so I know im late to the show but, I heavily recommend this game. Especially if you love games with beautiful design and simple physics, However the main feature of this game to me is its simplicity, Jump, Swing,Boost and Glide your way around a well designed world while following a well written story. Its a really relaxing game also so put on some nice music and you have a great way to pass time. 

So in conclusion, This is a great game and i wwould heavily recommend this game for anyone who likes nice games."
11606,"Enjoyable game I remember fondly.  I appreciated the story and the sentiment, as well as the ending that left just enough ambiguity to leave some to interpretation if you decide it so.  The game had levels that were rather challenging, and I failed a few times at the later ones myself.  Definately worth the money for the adventure this story took me on."
11607,"This story depicts a young boys adventure about his uncle being retold to his daughter. The character goes off in a quest to find his uncle in a mystical land, aided with a energetic grappling device and rocket boots,

My uncle lived in my dads shed and played Age of Mythology and watched Star Trek at 1pm

10/10 for relatability"
11608,"I really enjoyed this game. It has a distinct world and art style, and a simple yet moving story that balances the lighthearted innocence of a child's imaginative explorations with deeper, more serious themes at deeper inspection. The end result is a grand adventure with a bit of of sci-fi elements and just a hint of surrealism.

The gameplay is 3D platforming with a heavy emphasis on using a grappling-hook like glove. To me, it evokes parallels to game mechanics like the old classic Bionic Commando, Spider Man games, and more recently, Windlands. But this game fully owns that grappling mechanic and does some very fun things with it. It is deeply satisfying to go flying through the air with enormous leaps, locking on with your energy beam, then flinging yourself up into the sky. It is an action adventure game without any violence or combat. It is a game about acrobatic spacial puzzles that ask you in a hundred ways, ""How on earth are you going to get over there?""

The first 90% of the game is not very punishing. Checkpoints are frequent. However, in the last level, the difficulty does spike considerably as you will often be flying blind with little chance to plan your jumps and grapples. But it is doable with dedicated effort. I beat the game in about 8 hours, which felt about right to me.

This is one of the more memorable games I've played in a while, and I highly recommend it. It is charming, imaginitive, fun, and surpassed my expectations in just about every way."
11609,*weeb and furry approved*
11610,"About 2.5-3 hours long, but well worth it, especially if you get it on sale. The game mechanics are fun and the story is just precious! 10/10 would play again."

11622,"I was pleasantly surprised with this game, in all honesty. It kept it short and sweet, had a nice little plot to follow, looked pretty nice, and had some good challenging sequences. I rather enjoyed the game, even though I was expecting it to be pretty poor. So besides some clunky animation, and a few awkward pieces of dialouge, the game is quite good."
11623,"The mood, the graphics and the fluidity are magical. An awesome plateform game!"
11624,"TLDR: Worth a play. Wait for a sale.

This is a pretty game and interesting. I'm not done with it yet, but I've played enough to get the hang of it and give a fair review before I finish, I think. The game mechanic (just one, really.) is fun and clever, but a bit clumsy. You run/jump/grapple to swing and shoot through platform levels. The problem is that the game can be a bit picky about what you grapple and what you don't. 

Theoretically, you can grapple anywhere, but the game seems to prioritize the technically ""correct"" way through by letting you grab from further away. I can be well within range of a windmill arm and attempt a grapple and nothing happens, but be twice as far out and shoot for the one (out of four) windmill arms that has the mark on it, signifying I'm supposed to grab that one, and it will connect no problem. Other times, the grapple will refuse to connect if I have been clever and shot past where the game expects me to grapple first, seeming to only connect if I've already hit the previous contact point first. A bit annoying and makes for more deaths than necessary and can be a bit immersion-breaking.

It's also not always clear what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go. I'm not saying it needs a map or arrows or breadcrumbs or HUD, but some tweaking would help to make sure I'm going the right general direction in a level, particularly after a death. Sometimes I respawn facing a totally different direction. Maybe that means I was going the wrong way. Maybe the game just spawned me the wrong way. Who knows. I suck.

 Still, it's worth a play and if you can get it under 5 bucks, I'd say go for it."
11625,pretty good game keep all
11626,Very fun game to play story was short but ending was a little sad.
11627,"The gameplay isnt bad, the narrative of the MC isnt bad, but everything else doesnt hold it together well at all.

-forgettable world
-poor achievements, played through the entire game and only have 1 achievement, which was annoying AND optional
-the title is A Story About My Uncle

pick it up if youre bored and like swinging around with a grappling hook, flying around the map with a unique form of bunnyhopping and using rocketboots"
11628,"7/10

Pros
+Enviroment looks amazing.
+Fun first person platforming.
+Music is good.
+Voice Acting is decent.
+Lighting is used nicely.
+Decent Story.

Cons
-Managed to get stuck often and had to restart from checkpoint.
-Grappling hook distance use felt like it varied in enviroments.
-Some distances looked as if I could easily make them but as I closed in I would lose momentum and fall short.
-Very Short. (2 Hours)"
11629,"Great gameplay and beautiful artwork. My only complaint is the lack of content. Still, totlly worh the price. 
Also, found some game of thrones and breaking bad easter eggs."
11630,"Simple story, great music at times, and best of all insanely fun third-person platforming. I wish there was more of the game just so I could go through an area like the sky-village again."
11631,"+ Great Graphics and Atmosphere
+ Thrilling Gameplay
+ Epic Story and narration"
11632,"10/10 Best falling simulator.

Nothing like falling into a endless abyss every time you miss your jump/catch/whatever just to teleport to one of the blue arrow checkpoints.



For real though, the game is really fun if you like platformers and games like 'windlands'. The art style is good, the storyline is interesting, the game is hard enough it keeps you on your toes, but not so ridiculous that your left scratching your head for hours tying to fathom what to do. Getting the secrets is a worthwhile thing for the unlockables (i.e. changing the colour of the grapple). And of course (how quite a few of the people that got this game/ planning to get this game) Leafyishere plays it reguarly during his commentaries.

All in all, I would suggest the game if you like atmospheric games with strategy and platforming."
11633,great game
11634,"It's a great game. Beautiful graphics, especially for a game that you could call old, however it's very short. I would just pick it up on sale if I were you."
11635,"This game is endless fun, I enjoyed it. Obviously, there are a few ""bugs"" in the game, counting from Grappling into rocks to that glitch where it thinks you let go of Left Mouse Button, and fall to your demise. But, overall, this game made me play for a long time. I've gotten mad a few times, due to me just being terrible at the game, yet find it unique and just a relaxing game. It has great visuals, even on the lowest graphic setting. Yet, I just wish they'd remove the Flare aspect, it lags my game too much in the Ice Cave. But, thank you Gone North and Coffee Stains, because this game is an obvious 10/10."
11636,"A truly beautiful game. The scenery and artistic style is gorgeous to look at, the game mechanics perfectly balanced and the story altough short, quite compelling. The only thing I have as criticism is the short play time. I played through this in a bit more than 2 hours. Defintely worth picking up when its on sale. What could have made this game great would have been a ""map making"" system. If players could design their own map and levels and make it available to the community, that would have been awesome and I bet it would compell a lot of players to spend more time in this game, even after the story had ended. Definetly a great game and I'd heartily welcome a sequel of this or any chance to fly through the air once again."
11637,"Very Good, you get a little emotion through out the game, and thats what i love. The reason i like this game is because its calm!"
11638,"Easily one of the best parkour like game i played so far. Amazing graphics and gameplay, only abit dissapointed with the short but well thought story line. I would love to pay extra for more DLC content or even add a free free-run mode. I really do hope the developers continue to provide more content for the game and i would highly recommend you try the game out for your self."
11639,"I think this may be the first game to truly touch my heart with a story since The Last of Us. It's so well made, it looks fantastic, and it plays very smoothly. I can't believe I've only now found this game. I want so much more from the story, but at the same time I am completely content with where it lets off. And God damn it if that ending doesn't clutch your heart even a little you have serious issues. Long live Fred and Maddie, GG."
11640,AMAZING! JUST ASTONASHING! This game is pretty short actually (for the story) but it is very well done. There is replay ability also. I recommend you buy this right now and play it! 10/10
11641,"The premise of this game suggested a focus on travel, which I suppose it delivers, but don't expect any freedom to come with that. [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a physics platformer that will have you jumping and swinging from rock to platform over the course of its 3-hour length. However, swinging isn't actually what you'll be doing, despite the game's thumbnail art - rather than tethering to a point, you'll pull yourself directly towards it, hopefully catapaulting yourself to the next platform.

Unfortunately, instead of giving you a sense of freedom, the overwhelming feeling here is restriction. Air control [i](particularly for the high-jump)[/i] lasts only a few seconds before you plummet vertically downwards, likely hitting the side of the ledge you were aiming for and sliding off.  The long-jump on the other hand is completely uncontrollable, launching you directly forward with no option to stop or turn, more likely than not throwing you into the abyss. But why jump when you can fly, right? [i](aside from the section you're challenged to do without the grapple, which took roughly 30 deaths due to the aforementioned controls)[/i] Well, grappling is a frustrating art to learn - too close and you'll smack into the rock you grappled to, dropping vertically; too far and you won't have enough momentum to reach the next grapple-point. This gets increasingly frustrating as the game progresses, giving you more and more sucessive 'swings' between platforms. The route you need to take is usually pretty obvious, but with the vast majority of acheivements being 'never fall in a level' and 'use fewer grapples than ___', every failure is a punishment. If you don't care about acheivements, that's fine, but you'll have quickly swung your way through the game without much to show for it.

In typical Coffee Stain form, the human(oids) are ugly and the animations are absolutely terrible. When the characters are not looping a short idle pose with their dead, expressionless eyes, they're sliding across the floor at an angle as they run. There is almost no head-tracking, making cutscenes feel staged and impersonal, with NPCs staring straight forward while you can move around freely. They remain on good form with the environments, though.

The mechanics are singular, and frankly I was bored of them within the first half an hour. The standard platforming at the beginning is quite fun, with a good sense of movement, and adding the first grapple to that is fine, but you feel less in control. From this point of the game [i](level 1)[/i], you've seen everything it has to offer. You'll be 'swinging' from floating rock to floating platform over and over, getting up to three changes for your grapple, meaning more rocks between platforms. Later on you get a rocket upgrade, but this is only a mid-air long-jump, and will make you feel even more powerless when you miss your target by an inch.

Frankly the game does not stand up on mechanics alone, despite its short playtime. The story is enough to explain progression and told though the compelling, if unoriginal, method of narration via story-telling. However, with ugly characters, stilted voice acting [i](though the primary narrator is fine)[/i], boring and repetative mechanics, short length, and acheivements that are almost exclusively ""don't fail once or start again"", this game falls very short of the price they are asking.

If a short game about catapulting yourself from rock to rock sounds fun, then you won't be dissapointed. I, unfortunately, was."

if you are going to buy it remember that it is really story driven (and the story is good) which makes it feel like the parkour was like a way to make time pass while you where following the story.

I can honestly say that I did not expect it to be so heartbreakingly short, but still a perfect bedtime story for a little kid.

And the custom made runic alphabet got me giddy, I'm a big fan of ways to write non other than the normal letters.
I even deciphered ever sentence or word I came across, even though it was translated to me by Mady.

The grapplinghook and booster boots was an amazing touch to the game. And the easter eggs too. Especially the Swedish chart for the fusebox!"
11645,"This was a really short game. I beat the game in roughly two and a half hours so if you are expecting a game that will last a long time, this isn't the game for you. It was fun and the grappling mechanic made for a different‚Äîand to me new‚Äîsort of platformer, but as fun as the gameplay was it wasn't long enough to justify paying the full price for the game. I got it as part of the Humble Bundle which I think was a great deal. The story is a little weird, but this is not a game to play for the story, this is again all about the gameplay."

Other than the grappling gameplay though, the rest of the game sucks. The voice actors have lisps and sound like they're chewing on rocks as they speak, the character models are from 2000, the animation is from 1996, and the story is just fucking garbage with multiple spots of un skippable ""playable cutscenes"".

11650,"I love this game. It's gorgeous, that's the first thing that makes it a real must-have. Secondly, it's hard. Not impossible-hard. Just difficult enough that you'll have to stop sometimes because you get a little too frustrated to keep trying. Which to me, is a good thing. Where's the fun in a game that is too easy?

There is a cute story, but most of the game is platforming and swinging around with your grapple. The grapple is so much fun, even if at times it can be incredibly frustrating... 

+ There is also a cheat system in the game, so if you really get stuck (or if a younger child/sibling wants to play) you can get infinite grapples. Google is your friend here, it might take some work to get the cheatscreen to open."
11651,It's good
11652,"So i sat down and tried the game, a new game, an unknown game. 
It is beautiful made with a good story. gameplay reminds me of the time we played playstation games before online became viral on anything else than PC. 

Positive sides :
 - Good story
 - Nice gameplay and well made scenary
 - There are ""unlockable"" attachments you can get by finding secret routes and gathering stuff (optinoal).
 - It has it's challenging parts where you need good mechanics in you're hands (prefere controller ps4, xbox etc.)

Negative sides:
 - Game is soooo short! took me 3 hours to finish.

All calculated together, I rate the game 7/10 where i drag away 2 for the game being short."
11653,"Nice new twist on a platformer, beautiful story, too short. I lacks the ""You died"" from Dark Souls though.

As most people seem to agree this game has all of the above. You are telling your daughter a bedtime story. This story is about an adventure you had in your teens. 

The whole game is about reaching the next platform somehow, you get rocket boots, grappling hooks and super jump for that. All followed a simple given path, no surprises here.

I encountered nobugs or glitches or anything and I only managed to get one achievement, since everything is a challange there.

Completion time about 3 hours after many many deaths."
11654,"Pretty sweet game, it reminded me to Half Life in a Boishock-ish way, awesome gameplay, good story, but too short. Menus are glitchy.

Is worth it if you pay -5 dollars for it. Just cos is such a shame it last so little time, being an adventure game, with a perfect engine and such creative gameplay."
11655,"Good game. The story is wonderful and heart warming. To be completely honest, the end made me want to shed a couple of tears, but I didn't. I would love to see more games like this."
11656,"Where do I begin with a game that is so adventurious yet repetitive. First off let's start with what most people come to see for the first time with this game, the graphics.

[h1] The Graphics[/h1]

This game is nothing short of beautiful, for it to have been made over two years ago (as of the time this review is being made). The game has aged very well, some triple-a titles can't even look this wonderful, from the gorgeous lighting and shadows to the smooth physics and motion that you receive while grappling, but I'll talk more about the way the game works shortly. This is singlehandedly one of the prettiest indie games I've played and well worth the $5 that my friend spent on it in order to give it to me as a gift (Thank you Ryan c:). Even the landscapes and models are well detailed, from pieces of paper and bottles that you'll find laying around, to the beautiful skybox that inhabits the world, this is a masterpiece of an adventure. The only downfall is the character models, the (lizard?) people that you encounter seem to look a lil cartoonish and have strange ways of walking, it seems like the developers kinda skimped on them entirely, but not on the scenery, which I guess I can forgive since they made such a pretty game.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]

Now this is one of the best parts of the game, in my opinion. The parkour elements and skills that you need in order to dodge and seemelssly jump from platform to platform, from ice spikes to landing pads, it's wonderful, really! The way that you run and grapple onto platforms isn't clunky or too difficult, the right amount of timing and luck will get you through the levels in no time at all. Overall the gameplay itself has a unique feel, if I could change anything I'd make the height of your character just a tad taller, you seem to be a lil too close to the ground when you're freerunning through caves.

[h1] Story[/h1]

[u] Okay this is the bread and butter for this game and there will be spoilers ahead so if you haven't beaten it yourself, stop here.[/u]

This game starts off so spooky and strange, the atmosphere is dark and omniscent and hell I'd even say it looked like a horror game if it had some depth of field, but it doesn't. You play as a man, telling his daughter a story of his Uncle and the adventure that he undertook in order to find him, and then return back home. During the story of this game you come along a girl by the name of Maddie, she rides on your back for a majority of the time that you'll actually be playing, and she helps you along the way by giving you hints and decoding the texts on the wall in order to reveal where you are and where you're going. The parkour elements that I discussed earlier really do set the stage for the adventurious feeling that this game gives off, you actually get immersed within this short story. As for the ending of the game, well the way that you find your uncle and then leave him within meer seconds of seeing him kinda disappointed me because you only said a few words to him, and then left. He didn't even thank you for finding him, he just left you on your marry way and he stayed behind in the chasm to live out his adventure. After the credits there is an epilogue and you find yourself walking through your uncle's abandoned home, explaining how the adventure you undertook meant a lot to you and your daughter and you are proud you could undertake such a journey in order to find your uncle and bring your soul serenity and peace from the worry of wondering what might have happened to your uncle if you never went after him. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up when you let go of the note/picture of you and your daughter and it flies up into the night sky, as you say thank you to your uncle for making all of this happen. 

[h1] Summary[/h1]

This story is wonderful, although short and sweet. If a game can make me cry, laugh, smile, and feel angry within a playthrough, I'll give it a solid review. And this game, well it did all of those including the first one, which is rare. Overall I'd say this game is a solid 10/10 and you should pick it up if you have the chance, you can find it on sale here and there or cheaper on some third party sites, but it's well worth it. It took me a little over 2 hours to complete the story, and it's a story I'd play again if given the chance."
11657,"Way too short, not a good story, but somewhat fun mechanics even if it's frustrating because it's something you know how to do and are good at it, but it just takes a few tries to get lucky.

BTW most of my hours were from IdleMaster, I leave it running all the time."
11658,"A Story About My Uncle is a great indie game with an amazing story. The story is not very long, but there is plenty of extra content on the side that makes this game worth the $10 price tag."
11659,"A fairly short, story driven game.  Occasionally wonky.  Occasionally frustrating.  Overall a fun time.  If you're easily frustrated, probably not the best game to play.  Narration was good."
11660,"Cost

One of the issues surrounding this game is the cost compared to the game hours. ¬£3.33 an hour.
However the cost compared to the graphics and storyline is AMAZING.

Graphics

Not much can be fault with these Graphics 10/10

Gameplay

Quite difficult and can be quite frustrating

Storyline

You basically are searching for your uncle in a diffrent world. You find him then he sends you back home.

Is it worth it.

meh.

11661,"PROS
Awesome levels
Makes you feel awesome

CONS
Trash story (its a platformer what can you expect)
Too short not enough
Will last at most 3 hours to finish

For 13 dollars its a great game, although it is really short. Snag it on sale if you are on a tight budget!"
11662,"A Story About My Uncle is amazing a amazing platformer, the story line is well done and for me it deserves a 10/10"
11663,"First person Spider-Man!
I normally have a lot harder time getting into the headspace of a fantasy game than a scifi game, and I'm sure there's a lot of players out there who fall on either side of that fence as far as preferences go.  I snapped it up first sale after it was on my wishlist from just a couple clips of gameplay, not knowing there was a little bit of fantastical nature to the game.  I happened upon A Story About My Uncle after playing Coffee Stain Studios' Goat Simulator and was curious about what else was in their catalog.  Turns out they had published this game for Gone North Games, and now I'm in love with both of these developers.  
The majority of the fantasy elements in the story are/are not explained away by the mysteriousness of the world you visit.  What's happened in this land might just be scientific, and your method of travel and equipment are certainly scientific in nature.  So what Gone North Games have done here is successfully blur the lines between a scifi and fantasy aesthetic without making it look like a Thor movie, and I applaud them for that.  This is all made even more enjoyable by just how pretty this game looks on high graphical settings.
For the gameplay side of things, I have not felt such fluid progress in a game since the early levels of Portal or first few tracks of Audiosurf I played.  There is a learning curve as your suit grants and removes abilities throughout the campaign, but I can only think of one actual instance where I got stuck and couldn't figure out what I needed to do immediately.  Even still, there is a difficulty to the game, in that you're running and grappling from platform to platform in the sky like Spider-man, except with a energy lasso instead.  Later in the game there are clear paths for how you should traverse the level, but in several spots there were less obvious paths I was able to successfully traverse, and I appreciate the non-linearity of it all.  ASAMU is not a first person puzzle game or ""walking simulator"", it is a game highly geared around movement and staying mobile.  The thrill of flying through the level and the close calls of almost missing the timing on some jumps could sell the game alone for some.  The only downside is the length (~3 hours), though I feel the game puts you through its paces just fine before you reach the end.  If you're looking for a fresh experience of flying around like a web slinger be sure to give this a look."
11664,"Awesome great-looking little adventure!

Short, not that easy and breathtaking views!

-Fun gameplay
-Good graphfics
-Nice story

Cons

11667,"I really like the smooth gameplay and the story behind it, although it was shorter than i thought (2 hours for new players), the storyline,music and gameplay hit me hard in the chest. 10/10 will buy it again!"
11668,"[b]In short: If you want a nice looking platformer with very cool movement mechanics and a sweet little story, then the only thing you have to decide, is, whether whatever you have to pay for this game is worth the about 4 hours of gameplay.[/b]

Got this for around 4 euros. I would say for that price, it is okay. 
Don't know if I would regret buying this for more, since it only is around 4 hours and I would say that I really spend my time on this game (or messed up parts multiple times ^^).
Graphic is not over the top of course, but still beautiful for such a 'small' game, with an incredible view of field and some epic environments, altough nothing isn't really gonna blow your mind. The graphic really lives from its beautiful lightning, and it has some great details that often make  you want to jump on some more of those floating islands and see what nice little building they made there. Unfortunately, there are also many island that just look the same. Character design is nice as well, but besides the two main characters, they mostly jsut sit somewhere and do noting and react to nothing.
Performance was excellent the entire time, never dropped below of 60 fps for me.
The mechanics are very easy to learn and make this game a lot of fun. You will soon feel like a boss flying through the air and with time goes by, there even will be more useful and unique additional ones.
In the levels, it is not always excactly clear where you have to go, but you mostly find out easely. This could be intentionally, since you can use different  movement methods for most of the level parts which will slightly vary your ways.  However, even when you have quit some freedom on what of the devices you want to use, there is basically always only one path, since you mostly just jump on different rocks or islands. Nonetheless, the level design is great and this way you never wonder for too long where you have to go.
The story is nice and simple, but again, nothing that will flash you away. The game knows how to set up a very friendly atmospehre in the villages and even has quiet a  few parts where some horror feeling comes up. But the villagers are quiet static as I have said before, and also in the spookier parts, you never really get soaked into these emotions. I what I want to say is that the story and atmosphere is nice and with some cool details, but overall, it just does not have much depth.
E.g. you spend the whole game searching for your uncle and don't know what the hell happened to him. But that alreay is all the drama in this game and spoiler alert, at the end he never wasn't in any real trouble. Not that this is such a big deal, but this game could have so much more great tension with just a little bit more dramatic story. There was one single part in the whole game, where you had to get past some scary worm monster thing wihtout it seeing you. But when you made it, that basically is all the game had to offer for a conflict or 'boss fight' as well.

[b]In conclusion:[/b]
Nice graphics, sweet story and good level desgin. But all in all, the atmosphere/ the story could have been so much better and the game is quiet short. After all, the great movement mechanics are what make this game really fun for some hours.
P.S.: Costum maps could significantly lengthen the hours of fun."
11669,"This game was the first (actual) PC game that I played and I got to play it on a friends computer. Though after I finished it, I thought it was amazing and so I got it on my own computer. This is one of my favorite games and I just finished it for the second time. The different areas and scenery that they have are so amazing. I feel like I could spend hours just grappling around looking at everything. The story is also a huge plus. The plot is great and it really feels like you are on an adventure. Would recommend to everyone. This is definately going to be my go-to game when I just want to get lost for a few hours."
11670,"I received this game as a gift, but I don't think that should detract from my opinion of it.
First off, I wanted to like this game, I really did.  The premise of the game appealed to me.  It seemed like it should be fun.
Wrong.
The graphics look great (well, in most areas, in the cave areas it's dark as f*** so it's like playing Doom 3 with the monitor off).  The other characters however, looked weird and half-baked. Not that you get to interact with them in any way.  You just pass by them without even registering their attention.  I felt as if I was a ghost travelling through their villages.  All you get in the way of interaction are a few cutscenes at a few places throughout the game.
This could be a blessing though, because the voice acting sounds as if they grabbed people off the street and were only allowed one take while trying to read cue cards from across the room.  Okay, I get the developers are from Sweden, so English might not be their first language, but seriously, try harder next time).
And who tagged this game as story-rich?  It's trite and the ending sucks.
The ambient music is soothing, which is good because you'll need something to calm you down given how many times you'll die.  Oh, that's right.  You will die.  A lot.  And then some more.  I can't tell you how many times I fell to my death.
It doesn't help that the terrain everywhere tries its best to defeat your every attempt at advancement.  Even when jumping straight up to try to get at a higher platform I have been sent flying off sideways because I hit the lip at the edge above, deflecting me to my death.  Jumps I made successfully one time I miss completely because I under or overshoot, even though I did exactly the same thing as before, but I have to keep redoing over and over because the checkpoints are painfully far apart in most places.
Oh yes, checkpoints.  The artificial difficulty enhancer tool that devs throw in to slow you down in order to cover up for the fact their game is so short.  Not being able to save the game anywhere on a PC is inexcusable and lazy.  Sorry devs, if I wanted checkpoints I'd play it on a console.
And I don't mind short games either, if the quality is good.
I've read other reviews saying they only took 3 or 4 hours to finish the game.  Well holy ****, they must be better players than I am!  Steam says I played for a total of 7 hours, and I only did the one playthrough (that's about all I could take).  Honestly it felt like twice that.  If this game was any longer I doubt I'd have the patience to finish it.
All in all, I gave this game a negative review because the frustration involved in getting through the game was just too much.  Others who gave positive reivews have compared this game to Portal, but I will counter with the argument that Portal was incredibly well-balanced, both in game mechanics and difficulty.  Movement in Portal always 'felt' the same.  I never got deflected to my death by seemingly wonky physics or missed a jump because the destination platform was only 2 square feet.  Oh, and there was a quick-save key in Portal too.
At the end of the day, all this frustration just makes this game not FUN. And that's really what makes a game good or bad, isn't it?
Final verdict:  Only for twitch hardcore platformers.  I guess i do not count as one.
On the plus side, never have I seen flailing hands and fatal death plunge speed lines rendered so beautifully.
5/10 Would not flail again."
11671,"This game is a very good artistic piece. It's story is deeper than a lot of people seem to be giving it credit for, and I think it's a very touching story [spoiler] about grief and dealing with loss as a child [/spoiler] 

8/10"
11672,"A Story About My Uncle is definitely a game worth the money; very interesting concept, storyline is easy to follow, and it makes for enjoyable gameplay. The story is fairly short, but the game can be replayed and restarted from any point in the story, giving this game extra hours of enjoyment. Good stuff, 10/10 - IGN."
11673,"Incredibly well done for an indie game. The platforming was intricate and evolved well with the flow of the game/difficulty. I (personally) didn't like the narrator's voice that much, but besides that, this is just a fantastic game."
11674,"Story 3.5/5

The story's not very original in itself, but it was beautifully told.

Gameplay  4.5/5

The  game has an 'intended' solution/path, but you can sometimes create your own with your different abilities (they're just that versatile) without any disadvantage. The quick-restart is a great feature, especially because sometimes you know you'll die 5 to 20 second before respawning (especially mid-game). Late-game is somewhat frustrating, because it needs more precision than your abilities give you, but I played it with a controller so KB+M players might disagree.  

Only loading times I saw was loading a game, and transition between levels (maybe 4-5 time). They're really short too (3-4 seconds max). I encountered no gameplay or critical bugs during my playthrough, but YMMV.

Graphics 3/5

Overall, it's good. They do a good job of showing you how alien this world is. Texture quality's not that great but it isn't bad either, and there's no incoherence. Except the NPC.

Oh god, the NPC design/animation is a throwback to mid PS2-era games. Thanksfully, story-important NPC are better developped.

There's a little bug where the camera can clip into the environment when you stand in corners but I'd rather have that     than a blocked camera.


Music 3/5

Fits the game, but there's no 'memorable' track. 

Overall 4/5

A fun first-person platformer with tight mechanics, good story and acceptable graphic and music. Short, but that keeps it from becoming dull. 

Its price tag's not that high if you enjoy first-person platformers, else I'd wait for a sale."

Basically in this game you're Spiderman looking for your Uncle the Hermit in [practically] zero-gravity places! From the beginning you're equipped with some sort of a robotic suit that allows to do long jumps, power jumps and hanging. A bit difficult at some points, it's like the game Deadcore with some kind of a story. If you're not into challenging-platformers you might get frustrated and lose focus on the story.

11696,"Honestly, the only issue I saw with this game was that it was too short for the amount of fun I was having. The story was simple and yet beautifully told, the environment was visually engaging and wonderful to witness and explore , the gameplay was addicting as well as challenging and the characters really hit home for me. Overall, an incredibly fun (and unfortunately short) gem to play on Steam."
11697,"This game is short, sweet, and touching.  The grapping hook feels good, and once you get into the rhythm of the traversal it's quite exhilarating.  There is one very difficult sequence where I can imagine many players getting stuck, but overall a balanced and interesting title."
11698,"A Story About My Uncle is a game worth a quick buck.

With an average storyline, decent graphics, and surprisngly excellent voice acting, A Story About My Uncle is worth the short time you'll take to complete the game. For a company's first release ever, Gone North Games has done exceptionally well and I hope to see more of their projects in the near future.

If you find the game on sale and have nothing better to do, go ahead and buy it. Soaring through the sky with a clich√© grappling device and rocket boots is actually pretty fun!"
11699,"Seriously, i would love to play this game again as if i was playing it for the first time. 

[list]
    [*]Nice atmosphere
    [*]Narrative script written from the heart
    [*]Cool unlockables (well, i cant imagine someone seriously playing with some of them, but i was laughing my ass off)
    [*]Swingiiiiiing, seriously it is addictive, if you manage to do a good run, [spoiler] you feel like the coolest kid in the universe :)[/spoiler]
[/list]

The only thing that bothered me (nothing major) was that I couldnt figure out some routes in one particular level. It was try and fail and try again. Still wasnt that frustrating that it would kick me out of atmosphere. 

Happy grappling kids :)"
11700,Awesome game with wonderfull atmosphere and interesting story! Totally worth the prize and i hope i will see a sequel in the future!
11701,"This game is great, but the story is so, so, so short... it desperatly needed 3 or 4 more levels, or at least a DLC with the same amount of levels, which I'd gladly buy, because the gamepley is really on point."
11702,Cool game.
11703,"Great platformer, 5/7 would play again"
11704,Longest game ever 11/10
11705,Awesome Platforming game! 10/10
11706,"Wow. This delightful game filled me with pleasure.
In all seriousness though, this game is amazing and i recommend it to everyone.

10/10 Rats Asses"
11707,"Really fun, but ok graphics. An amazing storyline and mechanics,"
11708,"Nice game but it is Only parkour and really REALLY short
"
11709,"This is a great game, it has really good gameplay and it has one of the best stories I've ever played (No Spoilers inclided) But so much hapens in the story there are twists and more I definetly recommend this!"
11710,"Great short indie game.. I really liked the story how it evolves threw the game. The control is something unique I need a sequel with enriched material for sure. 

Pros
-Great enviroment
-Great control

Cons
-The charactrer design sometimes looks like 2002.."
11711,"Makes you feel like Spiderman!

Purchased on sale for like a dollar, and it was a great game!

Tedious? Yes, flinging rock to rock with hardly any directions can be annoying (and timing them ""correctly"") but that's what makes this game great!

I wish the game took longer than 4 hours but for a $1, there's legit nothing to complain about. I wish I could have purchased it for the full $13 as I think that's even a bargain!"
11712,"The Good: 
-Great, unique idea
-Nice on the eyes
-Reasonably interesting plot
-The devs passion shines through
-Swinging and jumping around is more fun than any Spinderman game I've ever played

The Bad:
-The hit detection seems sketchy. Sometimes, something in-range would not register despite the glove having power--this include trying to recharge it with crystals. I often found myself staring at my target while bashing my mouse and plummeting to my death.
-Not enough checkpoints for how much trial-and-error/attempts are required to progress.
-*spoiler* The Rocket Boots key-binding on the space bar (normal jump) is the worst idea...I must have launched myself off of things by mistake 80 times. Really frustrating considering how much the game ALREADY makes you do things over and over.

TIL: It's a well-made game and I'm glad I endured all the tedium and what I interpreted as troll-padding, but the cons took away too much from the pros for me. 
7/10,"
11713,"HOLY F. That was so great, had so much going for it. The things that are obvisiously wronge with it can be seen due to budget. BUT THIS NEEDS A SEQUEL,  with maddie and her efforts to get to earth, even have an open world element. Honestly given  enough time and money and this is a portal killer. Good job"
11714,"A short, sweet, 2 hour experience. If you think you'll enjoy it, you probably will."
11715,"This is still recommended - it does so much right. World building and core mechanics are really really solid. However, it kind of feels like it goes on for about half an hour too long - the end of the game gets much more difficult, and much more bland in comparison to everything up to that point. Still a fun experience with great music and a really fun sense of movement."
11716,"LEAFYISHERE 

He played it^

So must I"
11717,"This game is absolutely [b]amazing[/b] when it comes to gameplay mechanics and story! Graphics is a visual slap in the face, [u]looks so good[/u] in some scenes (won't spoil)! The dificulty gets harder as you progress and I've cleared it twice. The only downside is that it was too short - would love to see a second installment, or an expansionpack."
11718,"A Story About My Uncle - 
Not a name you'd expect.
This game certainly takes my award for best indie game.
Worth buying!"
11719,"As heartwarming, breathtaking, and wonderful as this game is, I feel that it's too short of a game to be worth the price. Everything about this game was wonderful. The mechanics, the art style, the story, and the feeling of flying around. I just can't bring myself to recommend this, as of how short the story was."
11720,Short story but it was fun and immersive.
11721,mehh
11722,This game is so awesome!
11723,really good game if I would rate it I think 7 / 10 because the game is about 2 hours long and I think that's a bit short for a 13 ‚Ç¨ game. the atmosfear is relly good and nice artstyle you really get into the story and the grapling is really fun. there is no jumpscares I got a bit scared but it is nothing to worry about.
11724,"Its an AMAZING game, I enjoyed it very much while it lasted and i recommend it but i think the steam price of the game is too high, in my opinion , for its length. BUT STILL ITS A FREAKING MASTER PIECE. NO REGRETS :D"
11725,"A Story About My Uncle is a wonderful 3D platformer by indie developer Gone North Games whose main attractions are the mechanics and the visuals. 
The main mechanic in this game is based on your electric grapple gun powered by an HEV-like super suit. You have to launch yourself across deep chasms by hooking on to floating rocks and platforms and, my god, is it fun. While the aesthetic and story give off a casual feel, the gameplay itself feels fast and exciting and it never gets old.
While playing the game, it's impossible to note the beauty and astounding level of detail brought into each map. It is absolutely breathtaking. There is a variety of different worlds that you have to explore to find your uncle, ranging from bright ice mountains to dark caves lit only by bioluminescent plants, and they all look amazing. The screenshots provided on this game's Store page are actual screenshots that can merely hint at the beauty to come. Look at the community screenshots to see for yourself. You won't be disappointed.

As I said before, the story itself is pretty casual. I actually found myself only half paying attention to it, as I was too busy enjoying myself and my surroundings. 

My verdict: Play this game. It's a wonderful, beautiful little world that will have you... hooked."
11726,Really fun to do while you are bored.
11727,"A fairly short but wildly fun and engaging game. My only complaint is that it wasn't very long having taken me about two-and-a-half hours to beat. Speedrunners, completionists, and such will find lots of replay value here."
11728,"This game is fantastick!
it has an awesome storry with intresting characters!
The puzzel part is chalanging but not too hard so you cant enjoy the story,

Some times the voiceacting isnt the best.
However its never bad.
And i wish the game was a bit longer!

But for you who is looking for a awesome game wich you can beat and enjoy in an after noon then i stongly r4ecomend this game for you!"
11729,"I mostly had a lot of fun with this game, and I say ""mostly"" because there are definitely some aspects of the game that weren't very enjoyable.  For the more positive aspects of the game, the parkour was fun to play around with, the controls were (mostly) responsive, and the environments were varied and interesting to move about in.  For less enjoyable aspects of the game, the story was really basic, sometimes the controls felt a bit floaty when trying to do more complicated maneuvers, and there were some spikes in difficulty in a few levels that were really frustrating as a player.  Also, it should be noted for achievement hunters that the achievements are really tough to earn in this game.

Overall, if you like parkour-based platformers, you should give this game a shot.  It is, ultimately, a pretty fun adventure that will take you a few hours to get through."
11730,great game worth the buy
11731,"Graphics are very good, and in-game mechanics are intersting, but the story is lack-luster, the writing and voice acting are horrible, and it's just too short."
11732,Very good game but takes a while to get used to.  Most of the time to complete a part you need to die a few times to figure out where to grapple :P
11733,"Great game, greater movement..."
11734,Very cool game with a very heart-touching ending. This Game made me Cry at the end and at least it tooked me only about 150 minutes to complete. Big games havent made it what ive wanted them to made. 9/10 Because the animations are not that clean.
11735,"Jumped off a cliff like a hundred times before I realized that you can hook onto some crazy rock hidden in the bottom of the bottomless cavern.

10/10 would do it again just to piss themselves off."
11736,"Beautiful, extremely well designed first person platformer with a touching story."
11737,Leafy sent me :) Anyways this is a great game recommended to anyone that like to do parkour and the feeling of flying through the air :)
11738,OMG LIKE IF YOU CAME FROM LEAFY!!!!!!!!!!!!! jk game is good
11739,–•—É–∫
11740,"I first saw this game at LeafyIsHere on youtube i knew i would like the game so when i got my money i bought it 
10/10 will hissssssssssss"
11741,A great story with a great game mechanic. Lovely experience. Great for casual players and relaxing for experienced players.
11742,"Fantastic game, Great way to enjoy an evening of fun and for a good price"
11743,"Fantastic ! 
Great fun , beautiful art and scenery .
Story is good , it's not the last of us , but it's there .
Easy to run on even my fairly old gpu max settings . 
The mechanics are really solidly implemented and great fun to use .
For the price you can't get much better .
Highly recommend ."
11744,I'm done after 3 hours.
11745,"Short, sweet, and beautifully made. The suit is a tad awkward but still pretty neat, and I really appreciate the way it introduces new power-ups and features while still requiring the use of previous ones. My only real gripe would be that certain jumps require an insane degree of precision (I was admittedly very frustrated by repeated failures at some points). It took me awhile to get over how close the ground seems when walking, but it's somewhat fitting, what with the player character being so young.

I found myself reluctant to complete some levels because this game is so vast and there are so many different things to discover that encourage further exploration; I suppose that indicates how successful it is at putting you in the shoes of a little kid. And finally, the cherry on top: the ending smacking me in the face. 9/10"
11746,MY EYES ORGASM WHENEVER I PLAY THIS
11747,"This game is extremely phenominal and one of the most feelsey games ever the end made you happy and sad but throught all the puzzles you always wanted to be an adventurer like fred (sniffle,sniffle)"
11748,"Incredibly Fun and responsive game, story is beatuiful and very worth the price"
11749,"Awesome platformer, but there isn't a lot of gameplay. After you finish the story line which is about 2 hours long you can do time trials to try and better your times. Which is fun, but it could get boring after a while. Either way I think it's fun to explore the game and try to better my times."
11750,Challenging and fun
11751,"Bionic Commando the PG-13 Pixar feature starring Trashman, rocks, crystals and Nicolas Cage. Coming Soon."
11752,"leafy always plays great games

10/10 would lick again"
11753,"great little first person platformer, lot of heart. 
for a story-driven romp, the movement +physics feels great.

a lot of fun to just fly through the levels- great title, pretty visuals, lot of fun.

"
11754,Let's be honest. Everybody will buy it because leafy plays it .
11755,Boner was made :D Dank/Memes
11756,"A bit artsy for my taste, but still great."
11757,"gud game



leafy sent me


9/11 could have had a longer story line

gg"
11758,"short, interesting"
11759,"If this game was a fork, it would be a great fork"
11760,"I'll keep this concise. The story isn't great, it's pretty simple. Nothing to really write home about. But the platforming is a blast, even if the levels feel kind of samey with the floating boulders being a constant. However it's still solid in gameplay. The best thing I can say is that this game looks absolutely beautiful. The ""people"" you meet aren't pretty, but the environments and the skyboxes are just breathtaking, especially in the Stray's Village. I want to get lost in this world. I wish there was a sequel or something, because I would definitely be down for it.
8/10 for great gameplay and art."
11761,"Great game, but really short. Needs some more missions and maybe even some community made levels!"
11762,"A pretty well made game, good storyline. A bit short but its fun.
8/10"
11763,"There's an easy but little-known way to tell whether you're playing a good game. Does the game make it fun to just...move around?

For ""A Story About My Uncle"", the answer is most definitely yes.

What makes this game truly amazing is its balanced sense of scale. The developers had to juggle size, linearity, and the player's mobility. It would have been easy to end up with something too easy or too straightforward, but the devs did a bang-up job. 

You'll learn to grapple and glide through a massive and hauntingly beautiful world. There's a story, but it's far less interesting than slingshotting yourself across chasms. 

If you're up for a first-person platformer, definitely play ""A Story About My Uncle"" for its epic proportions and tight controls."
11764,"Beautiful game with fun mechanics, it just feels great. A bit short though, took me 3 hours to finish and I wasn't rushing at all. Still a great game."
11765,Short but sweet. This game is an absolutely beutiful game that brings some beutiful fantasy enviroments to life. 110% worth it. 10/10 would play again
11766,"This is a really good puzzle game. Its really slow at first but it picks up really quick. The story is alright. Its seems to serve more as an excused for the player to want to continue, but it fits nicely.The story is voiced over by the charactor as you are playing, so there aren't any cuts scenes to sit through. If you like Portal and Mirrors Edge in terms of the gameplay, then you will like this game. There are wide gaps in the game where there is no narration, and I found myself  puting on a video in the backround to listen to while I played. When you play this game, and you have all of the grapples, play the Attack on Titan theme in the backround. It gets really intense."
11767,"A Story About My Uncle is a cute and charming first-person puzzle platformer where you run and jump around to traverse the environments while the story is told through narration. It looks great, it's fun to play, and it was challenging without being too difficult. I enjoyed this game a lot, but after beating the game in around only 2.6 hours, I was left wanting to see more and to know more about the world that the game took place in."
11768,"It's a fun game to play, but it is pretty easy to beat. I thought it was going to be challenging, but beat it with a relatively small amount of playtime. I don't think it is worth the $12, but it is fun if you're bored and want a game to play."
11769,I would recomend this game do play it! :)
11770,"I'll just list my pros and cons

PROS
 - Great story line
 - Amazing graphics
 - Fairly challenging lairs to get through/ figure out (at first run through)
 - Lots of collectables scattered around  the entire map (that are pretty difficult to find  IMO)
 - Huge areas for exploration

CONS (generally trivial but still..)
 - Some voice acting is a little weird, or ""unfitting"", I suppose, for some characters
 - Only 2 hours  of gammeplay
   - Anticlimactic ending IMO

OVERALL: Quite an exceptional game and well worth the cost. Even though the game is so short, it still beckons you to come back and collect all the easter eggs hidden throughout each area."
11771,"this game is amazing, I wish there was more to it but overall it was great. the controls and parkour were some of the best I've used in a while. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who like action or parkour games."
11772,"First of all i saw this on a video form leafyishere and i was like holy **** that game looks awsome
than i got to steam and i saw it was on sale so i bought it

i had a lot of fun playing it and i still do for the people who want to buy other games i will come back in a sec 
but there is one thing about this game when ur done every thing is the same so if i could talk to the makers of the game i would tell the to make it like people can make own maps and stuff cuz that would be crazy amazing or make some other storys u could do with this sute 
but every at all i like this game i would give it a 5 star rating 
if u can do this quick and good (like a friend of mine ) u can play this game in 2 hours can get ur money back as wel
9/10"
11773,"A fantastic platforming game with great grapple mechanics. The art style is lovely, and the characters are very likeable. I really enjoyed this game, and found the epilogue quite moving. Quite a short story, however, there are collectibles to work towards, which unlock special modes, and a time trial mode, which I haven't touched yet."
11774,"Basically in this game you're Spiderman looking for your Uncle the Hermit in [practically] zero-gravity places! From the beginning you're equipped with some sort of a robotic suit that allows to do long jumps, power jumps and hanging. A bit difficult at some points, it's like the game Deadcore with some kind of a story. If you're not into challenging-platformers you might get frustrated and lose focus on the story.

11775,HISSSSSSSSSSSS
11776,"For the price I paid, this was a cute little indie game. Only took me a few hours to beat it, though, so unless you like doing challenges, there isn't much replay value. Overall, I give it a 7/10."
11777,"This game is something everyone should experience. It is truly a work of art. The scenery is beautiful, the levels are diverse and challenging, yet simple at the same time. You never have time to get bored because the scenery changes so much, and you always have a new challenge. If nothing else, buy the game and try if for an hour, if you're not hooked by then, refund it...but just a warning, you won't want to ;)



P.S. THE MADDIE'S CHALLENGE ACHIEVEMENT IS NOT WORTH IT. The anger during that level almost made me refund the game xD"
11778,This game is great I enjoyed it all the way through even the rough parts. If you like jumping puzzles with a little twist you'll love this game. The puzzle in this game aren't to hard but I bet one or two with frustrate you. Now the story it isn't Shakespeare but still it make doing puzzle a lot more fun. I recommend it to anyone look for a nice story and jumping puzzle. Also this reminds me of all those stories of that kid who has the coolest uncle ever.
11779,"One of the best examples of story telling in a video game I have ever come across. It completely immerses you in the story. It reminded me a lot of ""journey"" in the emotions that it makes you experience. You can't put a price tag on an adventure such as this one, trust me, buy it."
11780,"Fantastic game, got really into it in almost no time at all, a friend bought me this and im really glad he did, it's easy to get attached to the characters you meet almost straight away. A short and sweet game, highly recommended!"
11781,So here is the story of how I almost broke my computer was almost done with the game and I kept dying it took me 4 motnhs to complete anyways I was going back on like normal to try and get past the part and I kept dying after watching tutorial and i litterally flipped my table keep in mind my table weights like fucking 200 pounds so I was pissed I ended up almost killing my computer along with the moniter and me. So that's my story uhh..heads up take a break if your getting heavy headed. As always peace peace! :sticky:
11782,Its time to grab stuff :D 9/10
11783,A very fun FPS platformer adventure. The Unreal graphics are great and the gameplay is very smooth. I highly recommend this little gem.
11784,"A very cool game with good platforming mechanics and a decent story.

Pros:
[list]
[*]You feel very mobile
[*]Grappling is quite fun
[*]World is very creative and interesting
[*]Pretty visuals
[*]Sweet little story
[*]Easter eggs abound - I wish more games had little easter eggs like this
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Character animation can be poor at times and immersion breaking
[*]Game is short, be warned
[/list]
Overall a good little story adventure and certainly worth the price."
11785,"This game is super fun, it makes you feel like Spider-man more than any Spider-man game ever will. There's a story to it, something about an uncle but to be blantly honest, all I wanted was to swing from rock to rock and defy the meanings of gravity. I cannot recommend this enough though fair warning, the achievements are really hard to get, at least with my experience. I played through the main game once and got 0 achievements but there is definitely replayability with time trials and such so there's that if you're interested. Just get it when you can. You won't regret it.

8/10"
11786,"A Story About My Uncle is a short game that made it feel like I had played for far to long. The story feels like it's barely there before it's gone. The puzzles are easy but you'll have to get used to failing before you get it right. There are moments swinging around where you just won't be able to predict what they want you to do. The voice acting is decent. There are mistakes but nothing major. And the music is there. The game is not as intense as some might think. I came into it after watching some youtubers talk it up on their channels. They over sold it.

TLDR: A little above average over all. Buy it on sale. 6/10"
11787,"A beautfiful and heartfelt game. Whimsical to the very end. The mechanics, similar to Portal, keep the game moving while you experience the story in small fragments. I could not recomend this enough."
11788,Such a good game. The atmosphere was amazing. I just loved the vibes this game gave off. If you enjoy parkour based games you will like.
11789,"I cannot stand seeing mediocre games having 92% positve reviews, so here is a downvote.
It has some positive things going for it, the atmosphere is nice and the unreal engine was utilized pretty well. The story starts intriguing and the core mechnanic of the game, grappling, is quite fun at first.
Too bad it gets boring and repetitive 2/3 through the game. The frogpeople you meet are cringeworthy stereotypes and you can't even interact with them. The worst part though, is the cliche ending combined  with the short playtime.
In conclusion I can only say: mediocre at best, do not buy it at full price, you will regret it."
11790,"A Story About my Uncle is a great and fun game, and it has some pretty visuals.
The only bad thing about this game is that it is short"
11791,"Nice story
Nice game
10/10 would play again!"
11792,veri gud game i liek it iz fun
11793,"It's one of the best game I ever played, music ... control .. atmosphere .. story ... 11/10
strongly recommend this one. :)"
11794,"Not many games pull me in the way A Story About My Uncle did. I played from start to finish, another unusual thing for me. But it's just that good. The atmosphere in each area is wonderful. One thing I will advise, if you get vertigo easily, or have an extreme fear of heights, this game may not be for you. I'm not the least bit afraid of heights, been skydiving a few times, but I had a few tense moments here and there. I felt a relationship with the characters, and by the end, I didn't want this story to end. I did a pretty straightforward playthrough, and only found a fraction of the more tucked away story elements, and finished in almost three hours. I'd say this game has a moderate amount of replayability, considering the multiple ways you could handle each area, and the hidden (occasionally very well hidden) collectibles. I'll give this game a 10/10. Get this game, it's worth well more than $12.99."
11795,Wonderful game. The few hours the game takes were a very enjoyable one sit experience.
11796,"I would recommend this game if it is on sale.  The game is pretty short, but it is very unique and worth a try.  The story isn't amazing and some of the puzzles can be frustrating, but the environment can be beautiful.  In the overall I am glad to have played this game."
11797,I regret refunding this.
11798,"A Story About My Uncle is one of the non-violent puzzle games I have played, and it was incredible! I've been itching to play more games like this (indie, adventure, puzzle). For some reason ASAMU caught my attention and I was able to pick it up during a sale. It sat in my library for a decent amount of time until I finally decided to try it one day. I am working with an old laptop and this game still looked amazing, the scenery is just beautiful! The challenges are fairly tough, but still very do-able. The stroy of the game is well done and has that good feel to it. The only problem I had with this game is that it was a bit short. Overall I would give it a 9.5/10, and would totally recommend it highly. It is a nice short, yet extremly fun game. If you are thinking about getting it, just do it. Very much worth it."
11799,"Good game, but needs more cotent!"
11800,"Really fun, multiple replays.
Would love to see a sequal."
11801,"Game play is 2 hours max and the replay value is very low. The speed run portions are huge maps which can get frustrating and are not even main features. They are hidden away under ""Extras"". Overall, the story was fine, and it looks like it could go places, but overall, wasn't that difficult. It was more about just completing the story. Overall, 3/10"
11802,"I tried my best to not have feelings for this game because I knew in the end it would have some bittersweet ending, I was both wrong and right. I never thought I would have so much feeling for a game I only played for about 3 hours, this game goes beyond just a Adventure game, it gets into your thoughts. There was so much emotion put into this game and I could really feel it. Amazing game, highly recommend."
11803,great story wish it had a sequel!!!!
11804,I played the main story and it was a bit short (only took me about two hours). But I am still replaying the levels the try and get all the steam achievements which adds on to the game. Also I noticed a feature that times you in all the levels and you can always try to beat your highest score. Overall the main story line was good just a bit short but enjoyable and totally worth picking up!
11805,"A Story About my Uncle offers fun platformer style gameplay with great graphics. Although it's primarily Plot Driven and Linear, it  offers collectibles and a Time Trial mode to give it that extra REplay value.

10/10 would recommend to a friend!"
11806,Very Short; but the story is alright; although the narration is somewhat odd. I would have loved to expererience more gameplay from the story.
11807,"Okay this is a great game. It is original and the story is intriguing. When I started to play the game I couldnt stop. The thing is that the game only lasted up to 3 hours. This was not meant to be a long game but the time I played it I had fun. Worth buying if wanting to play a quick but fun game. Also if you get this game cheap, Its WELL WORTH THE BUY."
11808,"This game has an interesting premise, decent visuals, and some fun mechanics.  However, there were so many negative aspects that I found myself annoyed more often than not.  This game is a platformer which requires you to be extremely accurate, but often places you in very dark places or has jumps that are frustratingly too large.  And every time you mess up in the slightest, you have to start again from the last checkpoint.  The lack of a quick reset button makes it really annoying to watch the falling animation over and over again.
Even though it promotes itself as a puzzle game, there are no puzzles.  There's simply one right way to move through each section.  At one point, you literally have to turn around and go back through what you just did, only with greater difficulty.  While the store page says ""Explore the World"", you don't actually get to do any exploring.  You just have to jump from platform to platform over and over again, and it gets quite repetetive.
The story was very short, almost nonexistent, and with an anticlimactic ending.  You only really meet one character.  A few others have speaking parts, but don't really contribute much to the story.  The store page says ""Emphasis on Story"", but the amount of time the story is actually presented is about 15 minutes.
All in all, I would say that this game is rather mediocre.  It has some interesting mechanics, but the poor story and gameplay make it fall flat on its face.  I would not recommend purchasing this at full price.  There are 15 achievements to get, but they are all so difficult, I didn't even get one during my playthrough."
11809,"I hate everything about this game.  It's set up as a puzzle game, but there's only a single linear path to follow with no allowance for experimentation. You're only allowed so many grapples per jump, so you have to follow the given path.  Most of the time there's only a single floating rock you can use as an anchor, so you haven't got a choice - it even shows you exactly where you have to shoot (the glowing symbols on the rocks), and if you try anything different you fall and die.  Mostly I've been attempting the same, boring jumps over and over, or just running from place to place.

The dialogue is uninspired and the voice acting toneless, unforgivable in a story driven game.  I'm uninstalling and asking for a refund."
11810,"Very short and light on story, but fun platforming and with attractive level art that has a grand sense of scale.

Warning to controller users: there are several segments that require more quick, precise aiming than is really reasonable for a typical controller; I gave up and used a mouse for two of the final segments and I should have done so sooner for two earlier ones."
11811,I'm on windows 10 and i can't seem to save or continue. help???
11812,"AMAZING, for gameplay, the story lacked something for me that other games like Skyrim gave me."
11813,This shit is harder than dark souls and makes you wana break your computer but yet youll end up loving this game still
11814,"amazing, fun, very great story line."
11815,~
11816,"One of the funnest indie games i'v ever played. A great story line, scenery, and gameplay. A thrilling but fun adventure game. A little short but its worth buying it."
11817,"Short, But fun! This adventure game has a lot to offer, more then just the main quest. Take your time and look around its a great game!"
11818,"Amazing game, has a beautiful art style and really good voice acting. Physics is realistic and intuitive, and you can replay the game forever.
If you're thinking of getting it, buy it right now."
11819,"First of all, this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. Propelling yourself through the ""obstacles"" has a soothing touch to it. This, in addition to the narrator's voice and the beautiful landscape, makes the game stunning. It's without no doubt a 10/10 game, would recommend. I immediately fell in love with it as soon as I launched it. 

To be on the critical, or informative, side; the game isn't really challenging. It's more like porn for your eyes whilst your brain is in a kind of passive mode. I wouldn't buy the game in hopes for it to be challenging, 'cause it's not, but it's eyecandy for sure."
11820,"Probably one of the best games I have EVER played. While the game was short, the graphics and the depth of the story made up for it a million times over. Overall, just an amazing game."
11821,this game i loved. while yes it may be short the visuals and the whole concept made up for it. loved this game and would recomend it for everyone :D
11822,"Although pretty short i would definitley recommend this great platformer! It has a good story line with pretty good voice acting IMO.

Score: 8.5/10

"
11823,"Amazing story, amazing gameplay, Playtime to short, is it worth ‚Ç¨13? No is it worth ‚Ç¨2 on g2a or kinguin? Yes.
If you like to play a story game, Then it's fine but just toooooo short"
11824,"Playing Dark Souls with a Racing Wheel and no screen  is easier than Maddies ""no grapple"" Challenge.
"
11825,"The epitome of ""meh"". One good gameplay mechanic does not a good game make. You grapple onto things in order to find your uncle with the ""help"" of a frog girl and occasionally just walk, that is it. I only made it to a point where it's dark and I have no idea where to go and not one aspect of the game is even remotely encouraging me to keep going. It's just boring now.

Edit: I made it past that bit, I just found myself in a dark corner that serves no purpose but still contains a checkpoint. Oh, and it turns out the big scary eye monster in the trailer is just a bit where you have to stand still for a few seconds til it decides to go back to sleep in order to flesh out the playtime a little bit.

I imagine this game will go one of two ways, either you'll suck at it in which case it'll just be constant trial and error or you'll be good at it and it'll be over in a couple of hours.

I wouldn't go as far as to call this game bad or even not recommend it but once again Steam leave me no choice. Well, a very limited one. Get it on sale but be aware that the game is not nearly as dramatic and frantic as the trailer makes it seem."
11826,"LOVE THIS GAME! 
Short( took me 3.2hours to beat ) but soo soo sweet ([spoiler]bitter-sweet ending[/spoiler]). The storytelling and gameplay was outstanding. I loved each level more then the next. For such a short game I can't believe I got that invested in the characters I got. The level design was beautiful and had great music. The gameplay was super fun; each level I found myself holding my breath, heart racing and smashing my face into the screen wondering if I'd make the jump. I dont know much about VR tech but I wish I had a headset to replay this game, although that may cause a panic attack... but would be so much fun.  Think Portal gameplay but outside with an actual story. I felt like this is what the grappling hook from Zelda should be like

BUY THIS GAME."
11827,"Boring and repetitive and has basically no story, and all the gameplay is really moving from point A to point B using the same boring mechanic and without adding any special obstacles/enemies/mechanics during your progression. Just save your money and buy something better."
11828,The time trials are better than the story because you don't have to look at the ugly characters.
11829,Takes the real world and future and combines it into a clusterfunk of amazingness.
11830,"A fantastic, yet simple, platformer with a beautiful story and breath-taking scenes. The developers did fantastic in everyway, from gameplay being smooth and enjoyable to the storyline being emmersive and creative. A 10/10 game which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys games close to this."
11831,"This game is a very 
beautiful !!!
Be worth !!!"
11832,Play it because I said so and not because you want to.
11833,Cheaper and much better than a movie.
11834,nice little game =) was a lot of fun playing through
11835,"This game was EXTREMELY dissapointing. Usually a game buy has, like, at least a few redeemable qualities but this does not have much on offer at all.
Pros:
1. Gameplay concept is interesting and mildly fun at times

Cons: 
1. Story is BEYOND lame, a child being told a bedtime story COULD be interesting but it just isn't the way it was done.
2. Voice acting sucks. Most of the time I can ignore it but the little frog girl's voice will make you scream.
3. Visuals and overall aesthetic design is pretty lame, looks a lot like a PS2 game, not a good one. The opening room looked OK though.
4. Gameplay is still dissapointing. Repetitive and frustratingly done, the core concept is good but not done any justice.

My verdict:
Do NOT buy this. Even on sale. I wasted money on this and got nothing out of it. At all. One of the few games ever where I've really felt that way."
11836,dank
11837,"A fairly short game (completed it in about 90 minutes, without achievements), but a decent one. Story is pretty basic, not overly compelling and probably could've been okay even without it. A bit simple at times, but interesting mechanics and worth buying on a sale if for nothing other than the mechanics and the visuals."
11838,Quite possibly one of the most unique games on the Steam Store. Great playthrough value and amazing story. 10/10 Just beat it for the 3rd time.
11839,"This game is great for what it is, but it is not my taste.
9/10"
11840,great game
11841,"beautiful game, with very neat gameplay and challenges not to be trifled with"
11842,"This more of a piece of art with a game thrown in. Everything about it is amazing.

First game to bring a tear to my eye. The ending is just so emotional."
11843,"Great game, money well spent.  100/10!  I would consider getting this game if I didn't have it."
11844,"This game is just amazing. It isnt obviously a triple a title, but it still feels as if the story was well thought out. I love that this game has such a sentimental meaning to it and honestly even though it is so short, it still amazed me. I highly recommend this game for fun for a few hours. Heck for the price just buy it now. Absolutely loved it! Hope to see more from this studio!"
11845,This is the best first person platformer I ever played!
11846,"A game with amazing visuals, a unique twist to an old gameplay mechanic and an interesting storyline!

Definitely a must play."
11847,"I managed to beat the game in one session, its short story mode is the one bad thing about the game really and the story itself is good if only there was more of it. I wasnt a huge fan of the ending because it made the rest of the game seem pointless, also the game has a little bit of extra content so you can do a little more after the main game. I would really like this game to have a story expansion where maybe you can play as the uncle."
11848,"Solid gameplay; really fun.  Just tricky enough for me, although that probably means that some might find it too easy.  I enjoyed the art as well as the overall visual layout."
11849,Amazing game! absolutely love it! It just has to be longer. 5/5
11850,"Fantastic game to just relax with, would recomend to everyone."
11851,good game
11852,"Amazing game. Beautiful art, interesting gameplay. I just wish it were a little longer. Honestly just a good game."
11853,"I love this game 

plz make some dlc :DD"
11854,"A game centered around platforming with inconsistent grapple and jumping mechanics. Story is almost non existant, with only ""finding my uncle"" being the driving force behind my character's motivation. Interesting enough but ultimately forgettable."
11855,"Incredibly fun 3D platforming game. Only takes about 2 hours to complete first time, so it's kind of short. 

Story line is lackluster, but the reason to play this game is for the platforming / speedruns."
11856,"I highly recommend this game!

- Great story
- Great graphics (it's also well optimized)
- Leafy
- Great Gameplay!

Cons:
- Only thing i didn't like is ending, it's ok but i expected more,
anyway i don't want to spoil anything and if i don't like it it doesn't mean
that you wont like it 

9/10 :)"
11857,"I recommend this game but just barely. Overall I'd give it a 5 or a 6.

The idea is simple enough but sometimes the mechanics just don't work how you think they should and this can lead to a lot of frustation. You will grapple and hit a rock directly and fall, this will happen dozens of time during your short playthrough of this game. Voice acting is kind of strange (I think the developers are foreign?) but at the same time this can occasionally add to the games charm.

Story not great, but it's okay.

Pick this game up only on sale (under $3) and skip the final section of the game.
Trust me you aren't missing much."
11858,"I think this is an amazing game. It has a good story that is quite sad at some points. I played it for around an hour, but got angry, I only recently started playing it again and i loved it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game game with a short story thats not too hard (All the time)."
11859,"I thought it will be a bit close to miror's edge gameplay, but its only platforming between jumping and grabbing. No runnig from or running after something. that's it.
Nothing interesting about the story, so silly and stupid end.
I know its so cheap but its not worth your time, it's really boring"
11860,Lovely game to have your chills time just about right! dont forget to bring your pizzas while playing this game too!
11861,"This game is absolutly awsome.

I got it for my daughter she saw one of her fav youtubers play it so wanted to as well.
As I allways do is play game before to make sure it is approriate and well it was.
some jumps are hard some are easy you can also choose a easy path or go the real hard way.
time trial is fun and a chalange.

all in all this is a great game visually amazing story was nice too i recommend this to anyone"
11862,"The first I saw of this game, I believe was Markiplier playing it, or at least the demo of it. It had me intrigued at first glance.

For those who don't know, this is a puzzle/platformer that takes place in an alternate dimension, or another planet. You play as a father telling his daughter a story, about his uncle (Who would have thunk it)

In the story, you are looking for said uncle, who has been gone for several months. You go to his house, explore it, find a neat suit that let's you jump high, grapple distant objects and basically be awesome. I will not reveal more of the story, as this should be experienced first-hand. Go buy, play, smile, sniffle, enjoy.

And after playing through the whole game, I got 1 of 15 achivements... Dang.

10/10

EDIT: Still not gotten more than one achievement... I think I suck at it."
11863,A story about His uncle not yours
11864,fun
11865,"This is a game where you go fest
10/10
Tis good tether sim
Plus Froges"
11866,"Genre - Adventure
Gameplay - Jumping/Soaring/Grapple Hook get from point A to B (almost like Portal)
Time to Beat - 3 hours
Graphics - pretty, the worlds/levels reminded me of the weird off-beat worlds in Zeno Clash
Played on - 3570k i5 and gtx670, game ran great. I imagine lower end hardware wouldn't have any troubles and it would still look pretty.
Story - just about right for a 3 hour game. Feels like a good bedtime story, which is how it is presented."
11867,"A great first person grappling game. If you ever liked the grappling hook in Worms, or want to feel like Iron Man, this game is for you. Gorgeous graphics, nice story telling, satisfying feeling when you land that tricky jump."
11868,"This is an interesting platformer with a decent story. Is it worth 12:99? maybe if it was longer and had more ""bosses"". However on sale this game is $5 or less and it is definitely worth that price. This game is about a father telling his daughter a story about his uncle (hence the title). It's a nice game to pass the time and though i wish it was longer and had more of an eventful ending to the main story this game did end on a nice note. The only downside of this game is that it can be buggy at times and for a game that involves telling a story it didnt have a very interesting story (though i guess as a bedtime story to a young girl it makes sense)."
11869,"Spoiler alert:



It's about the main character's uncle"
11870,"love the game best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
:)"
11871,"This was possibly the shortest and the most exciting game I ever played!
The hole movement aspect and 3D platformer just made me loose it! I loved every single moment of it.
The game itself is very beutiful however I was surprised at how short the game was, the story line is clear but not
perfect, but I would reccomend this to anyone who liked mirror's edge, or games that require thinking.

:)"
11872,"The game is more than just a beautifully presented walking simulator, the 3D platform and adventure elements really tie it together nicely.  Main story line took me around 4 hours or so, a new element pops up along the way to keep the gameplay fresh and interesting.  Perfect length game, will come back to do some of the time trials another time perhaps, once I play through more of the backlog.

I would recommend as a solid experience that was engaging, curious and had some really clever uses of lighting and desing to make something a bit special."
11873,"An enchanting, charming, and magical little story from start to finish.
Tight and responsive platforming, a nice soundtrack, an incredible aesthetic, and a mystery- Pick this one up. It's short, but it is worth every penny."
11874,"I love this game, but too long distance between checkpoints makes this game suuuuuucks. That's it."
11875,"Pros :
-Very interesting gameplay
-Nice little story
-Beautiful design
-Good level design
-Nice references (I got Breaking Bad, Twilight and Game of Thrones)

Cons :
-Fucking short (You can make it in two hours and a half)
-Fucking expensive, then

Buy it during sales and enjoy this little masterpiece.

"
11876,"To be honest I bought this on a whim and thought I‚Äôd add it to my groaning ‚ÄòPile of Shame‚Äô. Equally unexpectedly I installed it and started to play.
Never written a review and with 500 plus games in my inventory, that may say something. What a wonderful, unexpected gem. Looks good, such brisk, fluid gameplay and a gentle but involving science fiction story. I sat there shocked and surprised. This game really should have got more attention.
If you are on the fence, jump off, there will be nothing to regret here.
"
11877,"Despite the relatively short story (compared to AAA games out there), ASAMU was a simple yet wonderful experience.

The plot is very straightforward, but at the end you'll be pleasantly satisfied. The gameplay was both engaging and, at times, brain-wrecking. 
The only qualm i have about this game is that it doesnt really show you where to go next, so it's quite easy to find yourself going in circles. But this can be remedied with a bit of patience and effort.

Overall, it was a fun and lighthearted experience."
11878,Not recommended for those prone to rage quitting and bad at jumping puzzles.
11879,"Absolutely marvelous. Relaxing, not too long, and just the right amount of challenging. perfect game to wind down to. Highly recommend to everyone!"
11880,they should change the title to A Story About How I Spent A 100 Hours Playing Over And Over This Game (ASAHIAHHPOAOTG)
11881,Great game! Fun adventure! Could use a little story work near the end - but check out my full review here https://youtu.be/K7uEK0QVTv8
11882,"A Story About My Uncle has a very beautiful game world, and fairly innovative gameplay. The game looked promising at first, but started to lose its charm after the fifth or sixth time I fell (for an unnecessarily long time) to my death. Most of the platforming is easy and repetitive; the parts that weren't easy were downright frustrating. The game makes no attempt to help you when you are stuck - there are a couple of sporadic hints that may pop up (usually immediately after upgrading the suit), but for the most part, you're completely on your own. Puzzles do not get any easier or offer simpler solutions if you have failed them too many times; if you are interested in this game for the story, be ready for this. Additionally, I had problems with glitches in the menu UI elements (in particular, when I initially configured the game, the mouse sensitivity slider became ""stuck"" and would adjust itself according to ANY horizontal mouse movement in a menu, even while not in the controls section, and even after closing and re-opening the menu); the game also frequently fails to save your graphics settings and starts up with the defaults on next launch.

TL;DR: Visually stunning, but gameplay comes up short. Wouldn't buy unless you're getting a good sale."
11883,"Oh dude! i don't know where to start. i don't want to talk about the technical stuff too much but i can tell you that the game mechanics and ""The feeling of a dream"" is pretty good. I was so emotional at the end. Only one thing that i wish was different. They should extend the story so the game time. All in all, highly recommended!"
11884,"Game was really amazing i just wish it had a longer story or a cheaper price to compensate for the short gameplay. One of the greater and more beautiful games i've ever experienced here on Steam. :D
"
11885,"This game was quite fun and at points challenging, wish it was longer ;)"
11886,"Good game with great ""parkour"". Very short with an okay story. Pick it up on sale."
11887,"Many people complain about this game being to short. I believe that this game is a nice length for the type of story it is. This platformer in my eyes, is just as good, if not better than Portal. This game had me balling my eyes out over losing my frog/human girlfriend. I played through this game twice and will play again. 


                                                       10/10 would cry over my reptillian girlfriend again!


     Plus the story is very heartwarming."
11888,This game has over 3 hours of gameplay and is always fun to replay. It has a great story and has nice graphics. Its really fun to play this game and explore all the parts of the underground world. This game is definitly a 8/10 for me.
11889,"It's a great game full of suprises. I was sad that it had to end. Perhaps a sequel? Or something like that. The soundtracks in this game were beautiful. Anyway, 10/10. People can say: It's a short game, dont't buy it. To those people: A game doesn't have to be long to be a good game. This game was a great composition and I'd like to see more of it! :)"
11890,"I love this game, very cool!"
11891,"I bought it when it was on sale for $1. was worth it, but $13.... idk.. i finished the game in a few hours but luckily it is fun enough to play over and over, and there are these unlockable bonus thingys which r kinda like cheat codes except u unlock them, and those add some fun to the game as well. 12/2 ign would buy for $1 again"
11892,Beautiful graphics and great immersive story. Everyone needs to give this a go!
11893,"Review

-Smooth gameplay

-great story

-feel good ending

-levels not to difficult but not to easy

-great game all around, cant say much bad about it

Exelent game, definately would recomend."
11894,"I was really impressed about this game, it is so simple, so beautyful, ordinarlly complex that I was amazed by it, worth every single penny.The story is simple, straightforward and thats the beauty of it! It takes you to a new world, some answers are not given during the gameplay but i really think that this is something good about it, the game gives freedom to the player about what is happening and some other stuff that I do not want to spoil here, a lovely game, for the final sentence BUY IT AND ENJOY AN AMAZING ADVENTURE! 10/10"
11895,"Beautiful game, pity is too short, I finished the game in about 2 hours.
I hope in the future to play a longer and more challenging version -> Perhaps  ""A story about my uncle 2"""
11896,a cute game with a sweet but short story. It was awesome.
11897,wish it was longer :(
11898,A very short but beautiful and exciting game. I would recommend anyone to play it!
11899,"This game is soooo frustrating but you just keep on playing! So annoying.. 

I love it."
11900,"I got this game in a bundle, and I really like it!
The gameplay is really fun and also very challenging.

The story so far is also nice."
11901,"A very good and short game, about 3-4 hours for my first playthrough. I'd describe it as a sort of mix between Portal (the FPS elements), Myst (exploration of strange worlds), and general puzzle games. It was a game that I really enjoyed playing!"
11902,"Super fun game great content fun mechanics interesting concept

Recommendations: 

- A second story (like maybe he went back to look for fred and he didn't want to tell his daughter)  or maybe you can play as fred
- A button you press that tells you where to go like in bioshock"
11903,"The story is not bad but gameplay is quite boring and repetitive. 
Also quite annoying that you can use your hook only 3 times at one time."
11904,"The graphics and mechanics are great,
But the story was too short.
Overall 7/10.

I will recommend you to buy this during a sale."
11905,for a game that cheap. the history and the gameplay are so worth it. 11/10 must try
11906,"After completing this game after about 2 and a half hours of playtime or so, there isnt much for me to say. It has a decent story backround, the game is just beautiful, and the puzzles and secrets are fun and hard to find. The only thing this game lacks is a longer story. I highly reccomend playing this game, if only for a filler between a larger purchase. Its a great game to pick up while its on sale!"
11907,"Gameplay is good. Obstancles are fun. 
I paid $2 for this game. I would not pay more for it than that. 
Voice acting is meh. 
Character design is meh. 
Story is ...meh.
Game length is shooorrrrttttt. Beat the game in under 3 hours.
The only time I would replay this game was if I was consumed by the desire to get all achievements. 
Overall, I would reccomend this game for the obstancles. Everything else is just not my style. Which is not a bad thing. This game earned its 90+ score. But, the majority of what takes place in this game is just average to lukewarm. 
"
11908,was alittle shorter than i expected but for the price was definetly worth it and kept me entertained.
11909,"A Story About My Uncle is a beautiful looking game, with three big areas to explore and a friend that travels with you most of the time. The story however was disappointing, I expected something a little better and the ending was very predictable. The game may seem easy at first, but it has a lot challenges later on. I can recommend this game, but don't expect a fantastic plot."
11910,"""With this addition, the suit felt at least 20 percent cooler.""

420/69 would feel cooler again.

IGN."
11911,Good game but too ez
11912,"great story, details, and gameplay
you should definitely give it a shot"
11913,"This game is gorgeous, thrilling, and I'm shit at it. That said, I highly recommend it for anyone who likes this particular genre--it's a perfect specimen of its kind."
11914,This is a beautiful game. A must play
11915,"It was nice. Fun and well implemented mechanics, and a simple, yet nice story.

Also the spiderman like challenges are kinda fun."
11916,"A short (took me about six hours but I always take my time to explore and take in the sights), visually and emotionally beautiful game. Excellent gameplay. Wonderful little story. Extremely merciful with the checkpoints, too."
11917,"First of all, I really don't think the game deserves the ''very positive'' rating it has on steam right now.

The game itself is very short, and therefore I never found myself really engaged in the main story. The fantastic world that's there to discover is bland as there is hardly anything for you to interact with. 

The graphics are ok and the fantasy world looks decent, but the animations, on the other hand, feel outdated.

The gameplay is the game's strong part, but even its uniqueness eventually wears off and it starts to feel repetitive around halfway through. I also encountered a few glitches where I found myself stuck between rocks and stuff. Sometimes I managed to pull myself out, sometimes I didn't and had to restart.

Would not recommend it unless it is on sale."
11918,It's a nice little indie game. It has a good story but the puzzles could get really hard sometimes so don't expect to play this without raging once.
11919,"Has really fun game mechanics and misc challenges for unlimited content but all in all it delivered a suprisingly enjoyable nice story. Nothing amazing, nothing crazy enough to earn any major award but all in all a fun experience. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this game but it's a fun game to play! Uploading a video for this on my youtube at Youtube.com/HypoLeague"
11920,"Wonderful story, although it is short. Great game overall."
11921,"5/10. Mostly enjoyable, would not play again.

[*] The movement is infuriating when it doesn't work. At one point I got sick of the slow death animations, but thankfully there is a quick restart button. Remap it to Q or 1 because you'll be pressing it a lot.
[*] The companion story line really doesn't hold up. At one point I thought is was a parody of cheesy friendship stories, but I think the developers were sincere.
[*] The difficulty curve is all over the place. I, literally, breezed through some parts, while others kept me restarting again and again. Sometimes it even felt like the game was responsible for my death. (Mostly when grappling onto islands).
[*] The story parts completely broke the flow of gameplay. It even changes the controls so you can‚Äôt even entertain yourself while the forgettable companion desperately tries to hide away her nordic accent.
[/list]

Overall the game felt like it could have used a few more months of polishing. As is stands the flaws don‚Äôt make up for its charms."
11922,"This is a first person puzzle-platformer. The main mechanic is that your character has a glove that can remotely grapple surfaces, and pull him towards them.

The main feature of the game is in my opinion the fact that the puzzles are all interesting, and only in one occasion I was truly frustrated with the game. Often the game gives you two or three paths that you can follow for a particular sequence, too.

This is not a hard game. I wouldn't pin it as ""easy"" necessarily, but It's definitely not hard. In my opinion one puzzle in the last are was significantly harder that the rest of the game was on average, which was unexpected. There are achievements for finishing an area without dying and finishing an area without using more than X grapples (X depends on the area), and those looking for a harder challenge can maybe look into that.

The environments in this game definitely look pretty, especially in the first couple areas. The last area looked a little more bland, but still pretty good.

I finished the whole thing in 4 hours, obtaining a grand total of zero achievements. All in all, I liked the game fine, it didn't blow my mind but it was fun for sure."
11923,"I expected this to be much longer than it initially was. I am a bit dissapointed that it was so short, but I was satisfied with it in the end. 
I recommend that if you just want a short story to play through, then go ahead and pick up this game. Just don't expect for it to last too long. 
I smell a sequel, or at least a spiritual successor on the horizon."
11924,"I really liked this game. :) The storyline was cute and the gameplay was very fun! A couple parts were challenging and took several attempts, but all in all, very fun!"
11925,"dont buy it bud 
story is trash (PLS TAKE OFF STORY RICH TAG)
gameplay really isn't that special or innovative like everyone says
voice actors are prettty bad (IM TALKING ABOUT YOU MADDIE YOU SOUND LIKE AN EFFING KINDERGARTEN TEACHER WITH YOUR BS PRONUNCIATION)
seriously fuck maddie for the short time she's in there (she's absolutely unecessary)
there really isnt much unique about this game
this doesnt deserve the hype at all"
11926,shiiiit
11927,"I'm only recommending this because of the mechanics. The rest is below average.

[b]Story:[/b]
You are a dude who is recounting the story of finding his inventor uncle who created a distant world with frog people. The entire story is pretty much you trying to find your uncle and overall, it‚Äôs not very engaging. I didn‚Äôt care about the uncle because he never shows up and simply is just the goal. I never cared about the narrator because he literally has no characteristic other than ‚ÄúI want to see my uncle‚Äù. Maddie, a person you meet on the way can literally be described by the words ‚Äúrebellious teenager‚Äù and drops out half way through. The sad thing is that there was potential there for great lore. At a certain point, you walk around the village and see how it‚Äôs been constructed through garbage. These parts seemed interesting and I wanted to know more about the people but everything is just so static and lifeless. A real disappointment

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
This is where the game shines. It‚Äôs a first person puzzle platformer where you get around by super-jumping, grappling/lassoing, and rocket boosting. The main mechanic is the ability to tether surfaces and be attracted to them. You go from one platform to another to get to the exit. This combined with the super jump and rocket boots allow you to really soar through the sky and let you build up a lot of speed. The peak is the wide open areas where you can just triple lasso into a rocket boost and land like a superhero. It‚Äôs great. I wish so much of the game wasn‚Äôt in caves and restrictive channels but the open areas are fun. However, the checkpoints are pretty spread out and they feel very annoying. 

[b]Graphics/Performance: [/b](with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)
Ran above 60 all the time and (THANKFULLY) has a FOV slider. The game isn‚Äôt much of a great looker and has a distinctive cartoonish style. However, the models seem very‚Ä¶ modely? They look like a doll rather than having life and moving around naturally.

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]
Overall, the game isn‚Äôt bad but the story really lets it down. The parts where you are just flying through the sky are fun but the caves at the end are more annoying than anything. Get it on sale and try it out."
11928,JUST YES
11929,thanks for a wonderfull afternoon!!!! Although its a bit expensive i thought it was worth it
11930,level design is rubbish
11931,Simple but fun. A challenge I hadn't expected. I loved the story. Definitely did not get choked up at the end. Nope... not at all... not one bit.
11932,"This game has the absolute most entertaining, thrilling gameplay. First person flying through the air whilst surrounded by gorgeous scenery has been the most fun hours of hard gameplay I'd experienced. And with an absorbing story as well, this game is quite the package."
11933,Recommended
11934,"Don't let the trailer's lack of action decieve you. This game is full of adventure and extremely challenging parkour. If you haven't realized it already, your main gameplay consists of grappling from one object to another to make it to an objective. You'll have to fly through beautiful fantasy lands and breathtaking visuals and swing your way into finding your uncle, who's been missing for almost half a year, trapped in this strange world. But the catch is that your grappling hook only has up to 3 uses while you're airborne, making every tether, swing, and inertia count. You'll also be able to super-jump, either if there's a high object or if there's an platform a ways away from you. As well, you'll eventually aquire rocket boots, which only gives more of a challenge to a puzzle. There are 5 collectables per level that are hidden in really hard to reach places, and some that are merely blind to the focused eye required for the game's parkour, which becomes extremely difficult as you progress. However the difficulty doesn't swing from peaceful to intense like some other games, so you'll be wearly of what may lie ahead of a challenge. Some parts of the game had me boiled from rage, and some parts were easy to accomplish as it focused more on the jaw-dropping scenery.

However there is only one factor that I feel to seem that lots of players will dislike about this game. As you probably already saw, my time for playing this game is only 4.3 hours. Minus .3 hours for control setup, and you've got yourself a 4 hour game. This game is very short, and seems like the developers rushed the ending, and I was surprised that the ending of the game was just where I thought its falling-action would seem to start to kick in. Immediately after an agonizingly difficult parkour session, you're thrown into the game's ending and credits roll. That's the only concern you should have before purchasing this game, and it is a big one for most consumers.

All in all, I feel like most players will see that this game isn't worth its price for its very small amount of gameplay, but I believe that the game's visuals, scenery and landscape, parkour, challenge, and small story will all make up for the player's demand for more. But if you don't mind short stories and gameplay, then this game is definitely for you."
11935,"First off, thank you for this game. It was easily one of the best games I have ever played. It flawlessly combines a creative movement system and beautiful scenery, to create a very fun and atmospheric adventure with interesting characters and a cool story. I bought this game today and played it for almost 3 hours straight just so I could finish the story and get to the end. After I beat the game I immediatly wrote this review just to encourage others to play and experience it for themselves, and afterwards I will spend even more time in the time trials and replaying the story.

The only problem I have is that the story is a little short but at least it is very replayable.

11936,"Fun, short, not without its problems, an interesting first-person platformer with some mild puzzle influence.

Pros:
Good sense of movement and weight.
A fair bit of freedom to tackle many challenges how you would like.
Good looking world design.
Most textures are superb.
Lots of fun hidden things to find.
No combat keeps the pace on track.

Cons:
Dollar bin voice acting. Almost feels like non-native speaker's parody of English.
Writing is super inconsistent.
Glitchy, often getting stuck in the environment.

Meh:
Story is cute but doesn't go anywhere.
End is blah.
Music's OK.
Your NPC companion's model and animation are both really janky.
Most achievements aren't worth the huge effort.
Some parts are trial and error/blind jumps, but not usually to the point of unfairness.

The game fits right in a snug spot between FPS speedrun games like various Counter Strike modes or Dead Core and walking simulators such as Gone Home or Dear Esther (which is referenced.) Don't play for an amazing story, play for a fun swing through neat looking locations and I believe you'd enjoy it.

Overall: 7/10"
11937,"[h1]A Story About My Uncle[/h1] is a visually stunning first person, swing-type platformer where you as the protagonist must journey through an unknown world to find your uncle. This strange world is inhabited by these equally as strange anthopromorphic frog people, but only like four of them talk and only one is actually important. 

Now before you read the rest of the review, keep in mind that I really liked this game, it's just much easier for me to critisize than praise. Also ****Warning: There's going to be SPOILERS, especially near the end of the review.****

So first things first, this game is absolutely beautiful. The bright starry skies and glowing crystals and floating islands in general make this game very appealing to look at as you travel from place to place. The atmosphere that each location portays is pretty spot on, with the warm, bright yellows in the village and the dark, cold blues in the caves. I never got used to the scenery, every place I went I was astounded by the colors and expansiveness of the world, even in the ice caves where all the walls and platforms mixed in blues and blacks, the glowing crystals just made everything so alive.

Second, the frog people. They're not inceredibly appealing to look at, but it's to be expected, since, you know, they're frogs. I wish there could have been a lot more interaction with them, because it would have be really cool to hear their accounts of their lives in the caves or maybe how they came to know your uncle, to give him a little more characterization, but I suppose they weren't really the main point of the story. The first person you meet in a young frog girl named Madeline, though people always call her ""Mad Maddie"" (I actually have no idea why that is, even after finishing the game), who seems to be very close to your uncle, saying she's ""known him all her life"" even though he's only been gone for a couple of months. She's your generic 'I don't wanna stay in my hometown cause it's boring but no one will let me explore cause it's dangerous' character. I hated her, mostly cause she was annoying to me and follows you around for the half the game, but she's not actually that bad. Just a little underdeveloped, like a lot of other things.

Now, ASAMU is supposed to be praised for it's story, but I honestly see it more for the puzzles and visuals.; the story is actually pretty lackluster. And the ending, wow, I did not like the ending. So you fly and fall your way all the way through the crazy, difficult-to-navigate, challenging world, dying about 300 times, just for your uncle to tell you he's staying there and he's going to send you home. Honestly, it's so plain and badly planned, I would compare it to the ending of Firewatch. But, unlike Firewatch, this ending more or less to be expected, since nothing was ever built up throughout the game. You just travelled from place to place to find out that your uncle had gone somewhere else. 

There's a lot of mysteries and questions that go unanswered in this game. Like, what's the point of the weird symbol language? And what was with that weird fish monster thing? And why was there a dead whale on the floor of the ice caves?!? The game left off on a weird note, with the cliche ""and you never saw him again, "" and it kind of makes you question why you played it in the first place.

Again, this is not supposed to be a bad review, but it's ending up like that, sorry.

So, to wrap this up I'll say, wait for it to go on sale. The game itself is only about 3 hours long, and there isn't much to explore beyond the striaght path so the most you could end up with is proably 4-4.5 hours. If you don't like challenging, limited-range platformers with easy stories, then don't get the game. It's no Tale of Two Brothers, or, hell, Firewatch proabably had a more extensive story, so if your expecting that, then wait for a really really good sale, or just don't get it.

But, if you like difficult platforming with amazing graphics and a plot that's only there to give you a reason for your journey, then this game is what you want.

10/10, 100/100 best game, best game.

No but really though get it on a sale cause it's not really worth the full price since it's too short. Took me 1 hour to beat the game and the challenge."
11939,"^_^
A good way to spend some hours.

It's a 3D Platfom without a really story."
11940,"DId not meet my expectition. To boring. Lack of content, story, and frustation in landing stupid hooks"
11941,"This game is short‚Äîas in, really short, but it's a good game. The story is small but endearing, and the platforming provides a decent challenge, and I found myself frustrated on more than one occasion because the game became really challenging. It's quite vistually appealing; the modeling on the characters is a bit clunky, but their overall design fits in very well with the world. The music fits in very well with the environment, and attributes to the overall relaxing atmosphere of the game. Though there are some very challenging moments, for the most part, the game is very laid-back, and I can see myself going back to replay levels in the future. The game took me around two hours and ten minutes to beat, and that may certainly (and understandably) not be a time with which most people are spend over $10, but I still think it's at least worth grabbing on a sale if so. The game is charming and worth playing at least once through."
11942,"Sequal, Now."
11943,"Amazing game. It could be longer since once you really start getting along with moving, the game is over x) Still amazing and unpreceded gameplay!!!"
11944,"ASAMU Is a very well made game and has a good story. However, because of how short the game is I was very disappointed. The price for this game I believe is overpriced because it was like I said, too short. Glad I was lucky enough to get it for $2. 


In conclusion, I love this game, I just wish it was 
priced lower, and it was longer."
11945,"This game was amazing. The gameplay is quick and responsive and the story is cute and fun. But I did encounter many glitches. Most glitches were grapical or texture based, as in most glitches did not hinder gameplay, but there was a bit of lagging and drops in the fps every once and a while that really messed with the gameplay. But regardless of this, this is a short game that will make sure you enjoy every second of playing it."
11946,Great game . Great story.
11947,"Great game! Wonderful gmaeplay, specatacular scenery, and a great story!"
11948,"absolutely everyone should play this game

magical fun times"
11949,"First of all, I'd like to say hello;

If you're looking for a game which has fast raceway but also you don't like riddles like me, I can literally say this game is just what you're looking for !

+++ This game has better views than other similar games
+ Amusing dialogues
+ Quick performance
+ Simple and easy to accustom its mechanics
+ Well and simple story
+ Meet different and a good race

-Doing the same things in progress of time
-It has some parts of racecourse that gives you a cancer

I don't say finish it cuz i don't finish yet but if you have time to play and love kinda this games, I'd say buy & play. You won't regret it."
11950,The save points in the ice level are broken. I've found several other glitches as well. Fuck this game.
11951,"The voice acting and the story aren't that brilliant, but the gameplay is TO DIE FOR! This was probably the first time in years a game has made me squeal from delight just by playing it, swinging and jumping around are mechanics that seem simple, but are used in the game to make for an extremely fun game. It was a little short, but it seemed like a natural end, I felt like the game had shown me all it had to offer, and I was fine with it. If this game is on sale, definitely pick it up, you won't regret it."
11952,Unsatisifying ending to what was otherwise a good story. Otherwise I would highly reccomend on the gameplay alone.
11953,Game overall is great I just really wished there was more to it. The game has a nice concept but is short and gets you hooked to easily for it to be that short :(
11954,"Trial and Error Simulator 2014.

This game is fun overall, and I'd recommend it a discounted price, but just be prepared to die A LOT and to possibly get extremely frustrated if not-so-great designed/slightly unintuitive puzzle platformers irritate you. The checkpoint system forces you to repeat the same sections over, and over, and over, AND OVER. That's the worst part. I personally hate repeating the same sections in games, which this is keen on. Buyer beware."
11955,you jump a lot in this one
11956,"I really liked the storyline of this game and the parkour was amazing as well! 

‚úî Would recommend"
11957,A very solid puzzle platformer game that is short but sweet. The level of difficulty scales well with the player as you are tasked to reach the level end using only your grappling hook and rocket boots. The grapple mechanic is more gravity pull and less swinging rope but its fun for what it does.
11958,"I really enjoyed this title ""A Story about my uncle"". A positive first person adventure. The controls are easy to learn. The narritor is very calm and relaxing, in a sometimes challenging but always fun game. Clean language and amazing visuals make it a good game to play with my Kids. The only downside is, I think the game is too short. We need a sequel!"
11959,Playes only 4 hours and i love it. Definetly try this game!
11960,"""I could imagine how Maddie longed all her life to meet them, and now, here they were,"" Falls off of cliff with Maddie on back, dies.
 -10/10 would ruin dreams again"
11961,"Bought this game on sale without even looking at the page for it because it almost exactly fit the amount i had left in my steam wallet, and i have to say im so glad i did.

Pros

The story is simple but interesting but what really makes this game are the solid controls and the amazing enviroments.
Once you get a hang of the controls and how different movements interact, it feels awesome to chain a bunch of them and swiftly move through the level feeling like some sort of parkour master.

Cons
There is one point in the game (roughly halfway through) where you move into a new enviroment and on max settings i went from getting 40+fps to 20 , admittedly im running a lower end system but thankfully changing the settings to low gave me a solid 50fps and didnt affect the enviroment all to much 

The character models are, well, not great. the first one i came across (~20min in) shocked me  because it wasnt up to the standard of the rest of the world, but its not so bad that you dont get used to it and the majority of the game is you alone so all in all not too bad.
"
11962,"I am totally enjoying this game, only about 25% through. Havent had this much fun since portal 2. First person puzzler with a cool little story line."
11963,Great game!
11964,"Beautiful artwork and movement. The story is less but still enjoyable. I also found other character movement/emotions great.
All in all a great game and I definetly reccomend it.

8/10"
11965,"Everything in this game is perfect!!!
 Sometimes it was difficult for me but GREATEST music were calming me down.
 Good Graphics - loved it. Backgrounds are the best part of this game.
 Nice Voice actors (Narrator is the best one).
 BUT
 Story is a little bit  too short, maybe 1 or 2 levels more would be great :)


10 Maggies outta 10"
11966,I like cats
11967,A good indie game. Immersive story-line and good graphics. Game-play is also good. Would recommend buying it during Sale. I rate it 9/10.
11968,Such a great game with an amazing story. 10/10 would play again
11969,Would definately recommend this game. This idea of the special suit and hook is so brilliant and the game is very atmospheric. If there will be a sequel to this game I would buy it for sure.
11970,Excellent game! Loved the visuals and it had a relaxing vibe. Great music as well!
11971,"A story about my uncle is really good for many reasons.
1. Leafy plays it.
2. The grappling hook is so much fun to use.
3. It's a little short, but the game is great overall. 
4. There's an ending that you sort of expected but didn't at the same time. 
5. It's a bedtime story.
6. So many areas to explore.
7. If it goes on sale, it's pretty cheap.
8. Fun to speedrun in, and just mess around.
9. Buy it."
11972,"Pros:

Fun at the begining (can't spell sorry).
Can refund in time of rage quitting.

Cons:
Will rage quit.
Repetitive.

Conclusion: Only get this game if you can refund it when you get pissed off with it (like I did); if you plan to keep it get it on sale its not worth the money."
11973,"Beautiful game. The artwork and detail was incredible.
The only problem I have with the game is that it was EXTREMELY short. It took me only about 2 hours to beat the entire game. It seems a bit overpriced for only 2 hours of gameplay.

The achievements are also extremely difficult. Most players will complete the game without earning a single achievement.

Otherwise, it's a beautiful game."
11974,"very unique, wish there was more challenging content though."
11975,"A Story About My Uncle is a great puzzle, platforming game about a father telling his daughter about an adventure that he had when he was trying to find his uncle as a boy. You play in the flashback that the father has and you get equipped with a suit that can let you jump high and grapple onto some surfaces. I wont say anymore about the story because spoilers and  stuff, but the gameplay is incredible. My laptop isn't the best, but I never had any major lag or anything. The grapple mechanic is tight and responsive. It's honestly one of the best games I've played this year, and even though I've got all the collectibles, I keep returning to the game, just because of the level design. I seriously reccomend picking it up. You wont regret it."
11976,"This game is a really good platformer with great levels, a good story and great music.

I'd reccommend it to anyone.

7/10"
11977,One of the best games I have in my library. The game is about 3 hours and the graphics and scenery is amazing.
11978,"Very short game, but I loved the platforming."
11979,"The entire time of playing this game I thought there was going to be a huge fuckin plot twist that'd be either messed up (like the whole time his uncle was dead) or shocking (oh what the player IS the uncle?!?!) but yet after playing through this game, I had only come to realize this game is a short sweet beautiful game with nothing but a great amount of feels 

Gameplay is great
Commentary was great
Plot was great
The game I admit could have been way longer but it's alright.

huh. . guess i should stop anticipating the a shocking plot twist in every game."
11980,I got this for less than a CS:GO key.
11981,The story is really short but it's a fun play through and has a lot of replayability due to the type of game it is.
11982,Pretty good game for a short story line in my opinion. Some parts can be frustrating. :P
11983,"Its truly amazing, if you like games wher you can take it slow and calm down, insted of playing all of the MMO's RPG's and FPS's, this game is defently something you will enjoy. MY personal score on this game is a 10/10 i abseloutely love this game, its all i have ever asked for a gmae to be, cool graphics, good story, nice lenght, the story is one of the things that i like about this game and ther is allso the aspect of you just being able to explore, all you want and ther is something that I would really wish more gamse had more of that single aspect."
11984,"Fun but short game.  Also the landing sound after falling from a great height is one of the most satisfying sounds I've ever heard.  

"
11985,"I had fun grappling around and jumping until I suddenly realized I had acrophobia. I realized it when I missed my first swing. I started screaming as my character fell towards their temporary death. 11/10, It would be very good systematic desensitization tool for behavioural psychologist."
11986,Heeeey thats pretty goood
11987,the end will kill you of sadnes
11988,"This is a great little game. Excellent storytelling, great mechanics, and overall great gameplay. If you are on the fence, definitely pick this game up."
11989,Don't normally review games but this game is amazing. It also has a lot of easter eggs and references so keep an eye out.
11990,Nice small filler game....Grab it on a sale and you won't regret it.
11991,"was 3/4 plus thru, got stuck, went to youtube to find a way out, ended up watching the rest of the game and so glad i did.  the you tube reply is: thanks for convincing me not to finish this lame game. all that trouble, learn nothing, spend 2 minutes with uncle and go home? not a enjoyable adventure, just tedious and annoying,   this was part of a humble for like a $1 but $15? LMAO! if you want to keep your kid busy, dont buy this game, there are so many more fun and better experiences out there.  lame story teller, i mean L A M E !  i had to mute a lot of the game.  since there is no ""MEH"" selection when in doubt, do not recommend."
11992,"i wish the game could be longer, and had a lil more to it 
but for $13 its not bad"
11993,"I saw one of my best friends, Zoerith, purchase this game... And that got me to check it out, saw that it was on a pretty wicked sale, and decided to pick it up, as she has a really good taste on platforming games. And you know what? I don't regret it. Now as usual, I will start my review on the negative parts of the game. Granted, I didn't find many stuff to talk about...

...But the biggest downside to the game is how short it is. I barely reached two hours on it. (EDIT: 2,7 hours to be precise) Sure, I will come back and probably try to get all the achievements and hidden stuff on it, but it's sad that a game with such potential decides to just last two hours. Infact, when I reached the ending and saw the credits roll in I was shocked and dissapointed, as I expected it to keep going. It's a 13‚Ç¨ game without sales. I do NOT think a game that lasts 2 hours is worth that. At all.

The other complains I have about it are rather minor stuff:

-When doing a Sprint-jump, you can't steer yourself in the air. You can steer in ALL other jumps except that one, and it feels more like they forgot about it.

-There are plenty of areas where you can sort of cheat through a section. If you manage to land somewhere, your hooks and rockets recharge, but I found plenty of areas where I was NOT supposed to land, keeping me away from falling to my death and cheating the area entirely. You can also clip through some rocks and walls in weird ways, for similar effects.

-The voice-acting and music is good... But the main character and narrator of the story sounds bored. I don't know, it's almost like he doesn't care at all at times. There are moments when he says stuff like ""This is awesome"" while sounding extremely bored and that's just anti-climatic.

-The hookshot range seems to be a bit random at times.

*EDIT*-The animations on other characters are really weird at times. Maybe those needed some extra polish, as they usually feel unfinished.

That being said, is the game good? Yeah, I do.

The story is good enough, and it gets the job done. It would do better if it was longer, but you know...

The sound design is really good, and if the main character didn't sound so bored, it would be even more amazing. The soundtrack is also really great, fits perfectly with the relaxed gameplay.

Where this game trully shines however, has to be n the levels. It's rare to see games push the engines on making levels this big and with so much detail. And it also doesn't run badly at all, it's really well optimized. The loading times are also nearly non-existent, which is great.

Gameplay, as I said, is really relaxing and simple. You can jump, you can use your suit to jump really far, you can use a weird laser-hookshot and later on even get something extra. There were a few areas where the gameplay conflicts with those weird bugs I mentioned above, but it was fresh throughout the entire game.

There are also unlockables and collectables. I didn't really mind them much, but found most of them on my first run. I will say that it's cool to change the color of the laser... But why the hell did the game need a Goat Simulator reference on them, I have no idea. The achievements are also REAL achievements and not like most other games, being harder to unlock. I only got two out of 15 or so on my first playthrough, and that gives me prupose to get back to it at some point.

So, in the end... Is it good? Yeah. However, I do NOT recommend it at the current price. I got it for like, 2‚Ç¨ or so. That's a really great deal, but I'd say more than 5‚Ç¨ could be too much. Bellow that, it's a garanteed must buy.

TL:DR edition: Good platforming game but with a really high price. Wait for a sale, then enjoy it."
11994,Good one! Wish my uncle can build this fly machine instead of asked me to touched his magical stick...
11995,Very enjoyable casual game.
11996,"VERY nice game, beautiful map creation and beautiful physics. very good game, worth buying in my opinion."
11997,"Short and sweet game. Good graphics, sound, and simple but nice story."
11998,"I really, really wanted to love this game. I was left feeling more frustrated than enamored in the end. It takes a good while to get used to the physics of the game, since the grapple is more like a tether than a rope. In the first 2 stages, there was a strange momentum that would push me off of the sides of the platforms even when standing still. I was expecting endless parkour-style manuverability through the levels with ease, but instead even the simpliest of routes could be challenging. The story was actually very basic and was not detailed nor long enough to really ""pull"" you in (haha, puns), however, it is told as a bedtime story for a little girl.

Overall, the environment and stage design is really neat, although I did not care much at all for the character models. It was a basic concept with a basic story and the game physics offset my experience of the game."
11999,"I'd like to start off by saying... GET THIS GAME.
This game is one of the most beautiful and artistic games i've ever played.
The story litterally sucks you right and you're addicted. 
I played until i beat it just because of how amazing it was.
LOVE IT!"
12000,I have a potatoe for a computer. This game is optimized for playing on potatoes. Except for a run in the Ice Caves. It might make you want to cook your potatoe. Fiddle with configuration settings if flares start to talk to you.
12001,Solid with awesome visuals and tight controls.
12002,"I didn't expect much from this game when I first bought it. I got it on sale and it was just amazing. From the very beginning, the story and the narrator just entraps you into this enviroment and atmosphere that just seems so real. For less than two dollars I was astounded. This feeling you get while playing is one that is similar to when a game or a movie creates a world so real and engrossing, you feel like you are the character you are playing. I eagerly look forward to more games such as this one from the developer."
12003,"Spoiler Possibly? This game is utterly phenomenal. The visuals from this alternate world that you get immersed in is just jaw dropping and beautiful. I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to try something new. It was a great surpise, I snagged this game for under $5, not knowing or ever heard of this game. I bought it on a hunch, thinking ""Hey, it's under $5, I can play this whenever I'm bored or want something to do."" But honestly, I couldn't put quit this game. I've been playing this game non-stop since I bought it, which was about 2 days ago, and I've already beat it. Rather than being sad about beating it, the closing of the game was an awesome closing. It gives you a sense of relation to the character that you play as, you let something that you love and adore, you let it go, but on great terms. Yes you won't have it, but you know it's for the best. Overall, an amazing game. Get it"
12004,would be perfect if not for the occasional meme references in the script
12005,"Really good story game for night time before bed. But its not worthy 13E, like you will complete it under 5h even less when you are not failing like me. :D Second thing is that story isnt that much great, dont get me wrong its good idea but its really simple. Nothing too much interesting, you start,you get suit,you progress 3-4 locations and its over. It would be really amazing game if it has more stories,locations or better story.If you want it i recommend to buy it in sales,seriously dont buy it for full price you will be probably disapointed.
In the end as i said on start, its really good story telling game with nice graphics,controls and stuff but its too short and simple for 13E.

Things I like:
Story telling
atmosphere
graphic
voice actors
controls
idea

Things I dont like:
Short story
Only one story, which is sad bcs it would be really great if it has more stories
story is pretty simple, i dont know if its really bad thing but i would expect more for that money

7/10
""It would be really good game if it would cost something around 2-3E, or it has more stories/updates with stories."""
12006,"I actually liked it to a degree, especially for the cut price it was. While some parts were boring and others made me rage quit I found the story to be quite adorable as a whole. I kind of thought that the character Maddie would be like the uncles lover or even the nephews lover but even if she wasn't it was neat. 

 I would recommend it more and to get it when the price drops again from $13, unless you have that kind of money to spend."
12007,I really loved the gameplay. I must admit though that the voice acting was pretty bad. Overall though I would still easily give this game a an 8/10 the mechanics were very fun!
12008,"This game is just wonderfull.
The scenery is beautiful and creates a nice atmosphere.
At the begin the game intruduces you slowly in its mechanics and your abilities. But the difficulty never raises too fast.
The further you go the harder it gets and at the last bit its quit challenging (at least for me ^-^).
One little thing bothered me a little bit. The people and thier faces weren't really detailed and expressive.

But overall this game is a great journey. Its fun too explore this world and reveal the whole story.
"
12009,"I played the demo and liked it very much, and the full version is even better, so I loved it. The story, the fluid controls, (the easter eggs). It's just a wonderful game."
12010,"Loved the game, but it's too short. 
6/10"
12011,"I am not a fan of indie and logic games, but this game is just amazing. Beautiful graphics and areas, logic puzzles that are not very hard, they¬¥re actually enjoyable. I bought it because I needed a pause from shooter games (at least for the 2 days until I finished it), and I wasn¬¥t dissappointed. The only bad thing about this game was soundtrack, it was very quiet, and adventure like this deserves better vibes and songs in the background.

9/10"
12012,"1st Review #dontjudge 
Pros:
Awesome Story
Good Graphics
Fun 
Challenging
Great Replayability
Cool Physics

Cons:
Very Short Story
When You Exit and Save it sends you pretty far back.

I Recommend Getting this on Special!
11/10 would do the course backwards accidentally again."
12013,Fun Game but i wish it was longer!  stll a great mechanic and great fun
12014,A short but brilliant game
12015,A fun game that truly never met its full potential. Frustrating at times but worth 10 bucks.
12016,"Didn't finish it, kind of interesting but ultimately not interesting enough.  C"
12017,"Pros: A really fun platformer/puzzle type game.

Cons: MLP reference"
12018,"decent story line and graphics, pretty fun. took me 4 hours to complete."
12019,was really short only around 4 hours long.... but it was still good for the short amount of gameplay time
12020,Fucking beautiful
12021,"Enjoyable first-person platforming with some pretty shoddy voice acting. It's a fairly short game, in the 2-4 hour range. Recommend picking it up on sale."
12022,"Leafy brought me here
"
12023,Great game would love a sequel.
12024,"A Story About My Uncle is just that, a neat little fantasy story about the wondrous adventures of the protagonist's uncle. It's not long, a bit longer than an average feature length film (although a lot longer if you decide to go back and speedrun everything), but I think that's okay. The story and characters are endearing for its short length, the core gameplay is entertaining; easy enough to get the hang of given the short length, but difficult enough to still provide the challenge needed for the game to stay engaging, and finally the aesthetic charm of both the environments, music and artstyle all contribute to produce a fantastic overall experience. 

If that all sounds awesome to you, I encourage you to buy this game! If that sounds like it may or may not appeal to you, then wait for the game to go on sale and then pick it up (as I chose to do as a reluctant buyer). However, in the end I'd have been willing to pay full price for the experience the developers provided if I'd known what I'd be getting beforehand. If you're willing to drop 12$ to see a movie, then spending about the same for an interactive experience of the equal if not better quality should be a no-brainer."
12025,"It's ok.

A fairly easy game with a mild and relaxing theme. The story only has a few levels and most should complete the game in under 4hrs, not including acheivments.

If playing with a steam controller I would recommend a kb+mouse setup with gyro (always on).

Rating this 5/10 Schizophrenic Frogs, pick this one up on sale."
12026,"Two different games with about an hour to them each, I call them Crystal Spiderman and Walking Sim feat. MC Annoying Frog Thing.

The first is great, and really reminds me of playing Portal for the first time. Immensely enjoyable. But that just makes it all the worse when they stick you into Walking Sim feat. MC Annoying Frog Thing, because you're stuck spending the whole time just sitting there, listening to some frog beast talk about acceptance or crystal magic or whatever, thinking about how much more fun the parts that are actually a game are.

In total you get about an amazing hour and about an hour of tedium. Absolutely worth the three bucks I paid on sale but maybe not worth it at full price."
12027,"pretty game, fun mechanics, worth it..."
12028,This game is retarded lmao
12029,Do you want a Adventure game with Parkour? This is that game.
12030,"I've been wondering what would've happened if I were to move while the ""eye"" was opened, but I never tried because It was scary. But thanks to the trailer, I think I know what to expect. :3

This game was extremely fun and addicting, finding many ways to move around to get places and the scenic view as well. Although I wish the game was longer, with either a longer story or extra levels. But overall I had a great time playing the game.
Oh and btw, most of your hours are going to be put in finding those seismograph looking things if you don't want to look them up."
12031,"This game is not long at all. About 4 hours.
HOWEVER, it is an extradinary game with a lot of content, great story, and fun gameplay. 
I can reccomend this game because I got it on sale, but I would not reccomend at full price though, due to the small amount of gameplay, but if you don't care about things like game length, then you should consider buying this."
12032,this game is amazing
12033,"This is a beautiful world, with fun and interesting mechanics, but at times the puzzles are so frustrating they end up sapping all the fun out of the game.  I feel like I only got about a third of the way through the game before I realized that I hadn't been enjoying the game for the past hour.

With some tweaks of either the physics or the platforms to make the puzzles even the slightest bit more forgiving, this would be an outstanding game.  As it is, I am unable to recommend it."
12034,Its a great game but it only takes about two hours to finish and unless you like time trials it may not be for you if you're a one and done kind of person.
12035,"Here's a fun little game. Someone reccomended I buy it because it was on special, I'm glad I listened. (And I wouldn't mind having payed the full price for it either, it's not expensive and it's worth it. 

--------

So... what is this? It's a game about the adventure a young boy goes on while searching for his uncle. It's got some pretty decent writing and a really nicely constructed world. There are all sorts of little easter eggs and optional items you can interact with to learn more of the back story if you can find them.

It's got some really fun puzzle mechanics; a grapple hook and a super-jump that can be used as a super-dash as well. Basically, it's a whole bunch of jumping puzzles with a story that gives some sense as to why a human would be in a world that allows for such jumping puzzles to exist.

The only real downside to this is the voice acting, it's less than stellar, quite dissapointing. But if you can press on through that and appreciate the other elements, you'll find a game well worth your time. It's a little short, that caught me off guard, but it kind of works within the context of the story.

I for one am sitting here hoping there is a sequel so that we might get some more of those puzzles and a chance to explore the world a little more. I'm a sucker for games that make me want to explore the world they are set in, this one does that... fantastically. And just because I'm harping on about the worldbuilding, doesn't mean the gameplay is disregarded, I really liked the puzzle mechanics. Spiderman-ing through dark chasms and ice caves is great fun and the fact that there are usually multiple paths you can take makes it even better since you can try play it as a grapple challenge or jumping puzzle or a mix of both. 

--------

Anyway, I'll make a list of pros and cons, because that's always the part of the reviews I skip to if I'm in a rush, so... here goes:

Pros:
+Great Worldbuilding and Visual Storytelling
+Mutliple fun puzzle-platoforming game mechanics
+Achievement challenges make replayability actually kinda fun
+Hidden objects/secret areas with bonus story content/backstory information also add to replayability if you miss them on your first play through
+Great story and characters, leaves you wishing to come back to that world to find out more about them.

Cons:
-Dissapointing Voice Acting
-Sloppy animations for the lesser characters at times
-short, about 3 hours of gameplay (maybe 4 or 5 if you get stuck or are pushing for achievements) per playthough.

-------

Overall Impression (7/10)

It's not the best game I've ever played, but it's definately fun, definately one I'd replay once or twice, definately one I'd buy the sequel to. If you like puzzle platformers, jumping puzzles, games that reward exploration and/or stories that can be called cute, mysterious and science fictiony, then you'll probably enjoy this game.
"
12036,"This game is short and sweet. The grappling and platforming is fun and responsive. I never missed a jump thinking it was the game's fault.  Out of the few first person platformers I've played, this definitely feels the best.

The story is basic, the voice acting is pretty bad, but you don't play a platformer for either of those things. The gameplay alone is what makes me recommend this game.

My only complaint outside of voice acting is that it's a bit short, but at least it doesn't overstay it's welcome."
12037,"Fantastic game.

Great gameplay, great story, great environments, great music.

Would recommend to anyone."
12038,"This was one of the best story&adventure game i have played in a long time. plz just buy it next sale!!


-Netrom"
12039,Wish the story was longer :( The story is great :)
12040,"I refunded the game. I'm sorry but I expected MUCH more.

3/10"
12041,"Damn this game was good! Great game mechanics, awesome story throughout, great ending. If you like Portal and similar single player puzzle games or other mystic games, you'll love this! I bought it on sale and it was worth every cent!"
12042,"Don't you just love grappling around, Rocket Boosting, and Power Jumping? This game is really fun especially when your in a good mood. I recomend this game 100% and rate it 10/10. For any of those who came here from LeafyIsHere, a YouTuber with over a million subscribers (including me), asking if this game is good, you should deffinetly get it. The story is absolutely fitting. A boy telling a story to a child of his adventure searching for his Uncle, Fred. Theres lots of different stages including Ice Caves, Villages, and Caves. This game is truly beautiful and has a great story. I recommend this 100%."
12043,"Expected a dope story with interesting gameplay, judging by the reviews.
Turns out the story is meh and the gameplay / obstacle design repetitive and boring.
A sleeper.

Do yourself a favor and pick up Lemma instead - if you haven't yet."
12044,"-A great game. I love the parkour.
-An Interesting story.
-Game needed to be slightly longer, considering it's ¬£10. (I bought my copy for 1.49 :DDDD) 

-Maybe a multiplayer feature."
12045,"Thanks to a friend he gave me this game for free so here is what I think of it. This game is a must recomend. The game is about a boy who tries and go find his Uncle who is gone and no where to be found so you as the main protaginist go and look for him. You will have to use abilites to reach places and to go along the map. The music here is good, nothing memoreable but relaxing and uses perfect music in good stages. The voice acting is fantastic and by the end of the game you feel happy you played this game. Buy it very great game."
12046,"A lil' Gem for the grappling hook Aficionado

If You harken back to the ps2 era you might remember the simple pleasure of swinging through new york as spider man. While nowhere near as grand in scope, this game has a solid grappling hook mechanic and awesome rocket boots (awesome!). The game itself is quite short, but the real treasure is perfecting your runs in Time Trial.

I just wish we had this sort of mechanics in an open world game :)"
12047,"This is one of the most truly delightful games I've played in a long time. The story is heartwarming and wonderful, the characters are lovable and memorable, and the feels are real. I felt sad when they wanted me to, I got shivers at good moments, and I really hope they release a sequel. The gameplay mechanics have a bit of a learning curve, but have a very Bioshock Infinite feel of grappling your way across the sky; it's pulled off very well. Graphics are pretty good; hair looks a little funny but I guess it's fine. There are three main scenery areas; a cave, floating islands, and an icy area, and they all look pretty decent.

That said, it's a little short, and some of the obstacles can be super frustrating to get by, while others an almost laughable breeze. 

Graphics: 7/10
Immersion: 8/10
Characters: 8/10
Story: 9.5/10 (knocked off .5 cuz its kinda short, and a couple minor plot holes)
Gameplay: 8.7/10
Replayability: 6/10

Overall, get it for the story; its wonderful, but wait for a sale. I got it for like 5 bucks and it was totally worth it. I might have paid full price for it, but I would have felt like I was selling part of my soul, like any game I buy for more than $10 (yeah I'm cheap)."
12048,"I was really hoping for a decent sized game that would keep me playing that was the only con...
THIS GAME IS AMAZING the graphics are sick and the parkour is sooooo cool just everything is so cool
I wouldnt recommend buying this game full price wait untill SALLLLEEE if it was longer it would definatly be worth it!!!!"
12049,"simple game but amazing to play. short and sweet. but seems like it could be expanded and capitolized on and the next big name in puzzle runner. 
seriously jump on this before you get outshined like crush the castle.

multyplayer mode for races and watching others freerun around would be amazing.

also you could ass new abilities to go along with a new story line.

like a lock beam. something the keeps you at a locked distance from attached object. maybe use an additional trigger for the ability. that way you can either release the beam or the lock depending on what you want to do.
-can be used to grab and drag movable items around (for puzzles and platforms)
-can be charged to slingshot you far distances making new area's available
-can be incorperated into jumps for harder difficulty

also maybe unlock ways to store more charges for your boots and gloves? kind of like a lvling up system to allow you to reach farther and harder places.


this game could be BIG"
12050,Short but incredible. Praise to this games crew.
12051,"Excellent game. Amazing graphics, Super fun and easy to learn gameplay (like spiderman meets iron man). Okay plot due to how short the game is, which is also a reason to buy it on sale. Great game overall. I hope there's a sequel."
12052,I'm pretty sure my uncle molested me.
12053,"Fun game, get it while it's cheap"
12054,"A fun, fresh game. Smooth gameplay, fair difficulty, and a huge world really creates an enjoyable atmosphere. The one problem I had was I didn't care too much for the voice acting. I'd say 8/10."
12055,Good game
12056,"you see, it's a story about your uncle.




it's pretty good."
12057,Beautiful visuals and just the right amount of challenge.
12058,sold most of my skins in CSGO to buy this and in the end my crappy computer could barely run it. 10/10 would waste money again
12059,"+ Nice art style
+ Enjoyable game mechanics 
+ Straightforward UI
+ Sound design

- Bad animations and character models
- Lack of content (Took me 2 hrs to finish the game)
- Repetitive
- Not challenging
- Shallow (Can't interact with NPCs or environment, only 1 path, predictable, etc.) 
- Overrated

I give the game 6/10 and don't recommend buying it unless it's on sale."
12060,It's a bedtime story. I snagged it on sale for 2$. It's a good game for 7 or so dollars
12061,Decent little game with a touching story and unique gameplay concept - not sure if it's worth the full asking price but I picked it up on sale and enjoyed myself.
12062,"I ... love this game! I Recommend it if you are trying to find a good adventure,first person platform, chill game.
In my opinion this game is a piece of art, although there are things that it could have been improved,for example the NPCs."
12063,This game is amazing and challenging the story is good and exiting. Highly recomend this game!
12064,"Challenging gameplay, excellent level design and beautiful art style.  Definitely worth playing for anyone who enjoys a good puzzle/platforming experience."
12065,10/10 would get high and jumpy swingy again
12066,"Short and sweet platformer.  Good writing, odd pacing in the English voice acting, but not off-putting.  All the tension of good grappling hook fun without people shooting at you."
12067,very yummy game
12068,"This game is fun and good, but only if you get it on sale. I picked it up for $2 and it was worth it. The game is too short however, for $12 dollars. With 12 bucks you could buy a book or something instead."
12069,"This a very chill/relaxing and fun Game to play.
The stages are well set and challenging at some points, the Worlds are big and beatiful. 
The Storyteller has a nice soothing Voice and does his Job great. 

Sadly the Game is not very long it took me 3 hours to finish it but still worth buying it."
12070,"right first things first i LOVE this game,i completed it in less than 3 hours and now am about to go and do maddies challenge as i couldnt be asked earlier xD.

things i like about this game:
great story,
beautiful world,
challenging in a good way (until the end which will take ages),
runs on my mediocre laptop,
never fails to entertain with its many things to do like the challenges and collectibles,theirs roughly about 5-7 hours of full gameplay (including challenges and achievments),


things this games missing:
longer story,
no time trial mode,as the game can be relatively short depending on how fast you are and would also be nice to have a scoreboard if they did add this.

Overall if you have a spare ¬£10 (or ¬£1.49 on sale which i got it on) i would reccomend you buy,but get it on sale preferably as it is relatively expensive for what it is at this point in time.

hope this helps!:)
"
12071,Awesome
12072,"Despite poor AI, the story was a great tale. I loved it. 9/10"
12073,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDAlzqnfmGg

Too long; didn't watch -- The platforming and the sense of movement and speed in a Story About My Uncle are nothing short of breathtaking, but the game overstays its welcome and suffers from some unpleasant difficulty spikes towards the end."
12074,"4.5/10

The mechanics and ideas for it all are great, but the animation, human and frog models, and voice acting are pretty bad.
"
12075,"I recommend it to anyone. although it's a short game, it is a very beautiful game and makes me so happy when I'm playing it, I wish it was longer I really do, but other than that it is a great game if you want to chill out and play. And hopefully one day they will make like a second game to this or a DLC I'm hoping for it otherwise, great game :)"
12076,"I would suggest this game even more if it was at a lower price. With that told, I bought this game on sale and only paid 1,94 euros for it, and that 1,94 euros was the best deal I have ever gotten in any game. The only reason that (in my opinion) this gamem should be cheaper, is because it's small. If the developers could add a level creator, that would add SO much more to the game. Storywise: Absolutely great writing and the level design is beautiful. I rate it 8/10 just because of the price. And while sure 12 or so euros are not that much, not everyone has it available at any time. Overall, this game will captivate you for about a good 2 hours, and give you a good time. Definetely one of the greatest Indie if not best general games I have played."
12077,Awesome game and I completed it fast enough to claim a refund. I'm an asshole
12078,its really good but has too little levels
12079,"Super fun suprizingly, excellent game play. Shame about the limited maps though"
12080,"This game is awsome!
Love the story line would reccomend this to anyone."
12081,"Great little game that is a 3d platformer. 
pros: easy to get with solid controls and physics
cons: very short, hard to figure out were you are going in some parts (could be me) 
Meh: Voice acting, pop culture refernces and internet jokes. lots of easter eggs to find. 
Final: its a fun little game worth getting during a sale. Might do a few play throughs to find all the hidden stuff. 
7.5/10"
12082,I beat it and didn't get a single achievement. Now it just looks like I sucked at this game for 5 hours.

12084,A beautiful game with an amazing story.
12085,"A very sad and short story ;(

UNCLE FREEEEEEDDD"
12086,"Good Game
Need I say more?"
12087,"Great story, Great music, Great graphics, Very fun speedrunning, Just fucking awesome!"
12088,Good game but get it when its on sale as this game is 13 dollars and its about a 2 hour game or just finish it then get a refun xD
12089,10/10
12090,"Great graphics, nice story, cool gameplay, unique

a bit short for 12,99, but 1,94 in sale is great"
12091,"This was a very interesting game. I enjoyed it a lot. This game can get you mad a lot, but its worth it once you beat the game. It took me 3 hours to beat the game. I'm not too sure if thats a good thing XD. I recommend this game if you are bored and if you want a real challenge. The theme and storyline are perfect together.

10/10 will always speedrun this game again."
12092,Pretty cool. There's some cool rocks. I had a cool glove. I grabbed some rocks. zoom zoom.
12093,"13/10 

Loved everything about it~"
12094,"Game is only 2-3 hours long, unless you want to do time trials or collectibles, but it is still a fantastic game."
12095,"Honestly one of the best games I've ever played. It's an indie game with a great story, which is sadly very short"
12096,"for 0,94 this is the best game I've ever bought, 3,8 hours well spent
"
12097,"Great story, Beutiful scenary, Outstanding gameplay  10/10"
12098,"I enjoyed a lot this game.
I knew nothing about it and decided to download it and I liked it after only 5 minutes.
It's a great game, good concept and pretty beautiful.
I'm sad about the fact that this game took me only 2 hours to finish it without rushing.
Nevertheless you can add some life time if you play the achievements.
(One is very hard so the 100% is not guarantee)."
12099,"Gameplay Is 10/10

Story Line is even better! I was genuinly touched by this story :)

Best 3 hours of my life, no reason not to get this game.

Great Job guys, great job."
12100,"Quality, not quantity. 
beautiful game"
12101,very good game SUPER good story + a special game never seen anything like this but if there are more games like this plz say to me . thx for makeing this game
12102,Even though it took me about 3 hours to finish it has a good story regaurdless of how fast you can finish it.
12103,"The core swinging mechanic is pretty fun.  It's a pity, then, that the game is brought down by so many poor choices and bad design in almost every other department.  The floating-rock level design might have been interesting in 2008, but it's so game-y as to be boring, really.  The voice-acting is genuinely awful, and while that's certainly not unique among indie games, since so much of the narrative is expressed through voice-over, I found myself actively trying to avoid having to hear the characters talk.  Also, for a game that's as timing-based and trial-and-error as this, the fact that there's no way to quickly restart to a checkpoint when you know that you've screwed up (yes, you can pause and click the option, but that doesn't feel quite the same) means that oftentimes I was left waiting for several seconds for my character to fall to his death, which only added to the frustration of how finnicky the swinging can be sometimes.

I bought this game for a dollar and I was still disappointed."
12104,One of the best story-driven games I have played. 8/10
12105,the only thing you will not like about this game is that it ends. 10/10
12106,"This game is very very cool and gorgeous.
10/10"
12107,"Great mechanics, oh and...
Even if the game is great, just buy it on sale.
That way you get to enjoy something cool for oh well almost for free!"
12108,"A fun little physics platformer, well narrated with a cute story about a childhood adventure.  The gameplay itself uses grapples and boots to pull yourself  along increasing intricate and conveluted platforming challenges, though it is never what you would consider very hard unless you gun for the achievements.  BE WARNED though, when I say it is little i mean VERY little, 2 or 3 hours at most if you jsut do the story, so i would not reccomend buying it if it is not on sale, but VERY worth the $2 i spent for it."
12109,This game is creative and fun to play the story is short but good. The puzzles are good but sometimes a bit too simple. The world is absolutely stunning. The downfall to this game is that the story is quite short and is not worth ¬£10 at is normal price and I would recommend this game on sale.
12110,"The game was fun while it lasted, but it only lasted 2 hours. The atmosphere was a solid 5/7 though loved it. Get it when its on sale its not worth the full price"
12111,"10000000/10 Worth Buying
Added 20160309:

Too little checkpoints.

Later in this game you'll have to jump around in roughly 120 boxes,in the sky.

Fall off once? Start from the very beginning then"
12112,Great Story though a little short but not complaining.
12113,"A Story About My Uncle :

12114,Amazing and heartwarming story about a beautiful adventure through a new world. Mechanics work well and overall game play is really good.
12115,"Wonderful game, amazing graphics! Totally addicted to it."
12116,"[h1]A good game with an aweomse idea and concept. However, it's heavily flawed[/h1]

[b]tl;dr[/b] - Good game, could be better, a bit frustrating, but short and fun enough. 10/10.


Ever heard of a physics-based game with a broken physics engine? Well, now you have!
Hitting walls makes you bounce off them, which is the single most annoying problem this game could have.

For example - sometimes, the game gives you very small opportunity windows to hit rocks with the grappling beam, and when you do hit them, you fly straight into them, which results in hitting them and flying backwards or simply stopping, resulting in getting to the next stone impossible, and having to repeat the same sequence many times. Also, [spoiler] Using the rocket boots slows you down after the initial boost, what the hell? [/spoiler]

Aside of that, [b]gameplay wise, some of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and are quite frustrating[/b], most of the time it's really hard to see where you're supposed to go, forcing you to fail multiple times for no reason before you actually see the path.
It feels as if whoever made this game tried too hard to be innovative while challenging the player at some areas but completely missed the point, this game is way harder than it should be.

Good thing is, [b]it's still REALLY fun to play[/b], all of the problems I stated ARE frustrating, but the concept of the game and the fact that in the end it's all solveable are good enough to enjoy it, in addition, [b]this game is short and yet ends exactly in the right spot[/b] (took me about 3 hours), not too long, not too short.


[b]Graphics wise, this game is phenomenal[/b], even when running on my machine which is based on a simple intel graphics cards, the world is beautiful and colorful and fun to stop and look at when possible. However, at some points its acting a bit weird, but since it could only be on my machine I cannot judge it.

[b]Storywise there isn't much to say - it's a sweet and fun adventure[/b], not much background to it, but it's okay, because it doesn't need to be much, it's nice and simple, my only complaint is on the voice acting, especially the narrator's, the man almost sounds like one of those computer generated voices.

In conclusion - I feel like this game could have been 10 times better, the main idea is wonderful, but the devil is in the details, it feels somewhat unfinished, not polished, as if something is missing, but it's still a good game as it is, I don't recommend buying it for full price, get it on a sale and have a short fun adventure.

Sidenote - the achievements system on this one is a bit too much, could I at least get an achievement for completing the game? :P"
12117,"I beat this game...in TWO HOURS! This game is incredibly short. However I do think the game is fun to play, but the game is simply to short to be recommended. I luckly got it for a dollar. With this, I suggest to get this game around a steam sale."
12118,"This is a great game but only lacks content, Great art, Great Audio (seriously, props to the guys behind the audio) and a fun game and concept in general. The problem is, as stated above, the content. I beat the game in 138 minutes including time in menus(which let's not forget to point out had almost no options, but did have full rebindable keys so that is nice) and time I spent trying to do an optional challenge you get in the game... I spent at least 30 minutes trying to do this, but I can do it staring at the ground the entire time, I mapped out the entire thing like that cause I kept failing. Anyways, If you can catch this game on a sale go for it but not worth the $13 asking price."
12119,grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
12120,This is a good game to relax after a few intense games of counter strike
12121,"A very nice, relaxed game about a boy wondering where his Uncle has gone. The gameplay shifts in difficulty enough to stay interesting, with spikes and dips so you dont feel put off. There are also subtle hints to the various elements not outright stated in the game too, which leaves some possibilities of the story very open to interpretation, which I liked. Really nice soundtrack to go with it too, and beautiful scenery overall make for a very enjoyable experience.

"
12122,"I love fps/puzzle games and the user defined tags for this game have it labelled as such. I want to clarify though, this is NOT a puzzle game. The puzzle element of this game is the same as the puzzle element from the game Deadcore. They are skill jumpers - games where you load the checkpoint, try to make a jump and when you fail, try again.
Apparently my skill is not good enough for these types of game as twice during the campaign I found I could not progress past the next jump and the game (after failing 20 times or more) just teleported me to the next checkpoint (auto-passing the jump for me) as if to say ""you're not good enough to play this game so we will pass it for you WITHOUT showing you how it was done"""
12123,"I mean it is'nt a bad game nor a fantastic game it's pretty average. ""Note I have not completed this game yet"" Honestly the gameplay is'nt ground breaking it's just grappling from rock to rock so far I mean there was an enemy guard sort of but it really did'nt give me a wow factor considering it was in the video and i hope to see more of those in the future. Another thing is the story the story is well unique honestly a little strange and bizzare feels like im on a really bad drug trip anyways where this game really shines is in the environments all of them display strong feeling of the setting it enforces a feeling in that level accompained with matching music. ""Really feels like im writing an essay here"" However all in all the game is truly beautiful, thats all i can say. 
EDIT: oh yea i completey overlooked the puzzles.
they're nice puzzles.
It is also a really nice feeling of swinging from rock to rock"
12124,After playing I realize that I have a pretty cool Uncle 9/11
12125,Where was New Zealand on the map at the end ? Please fix before i riot
12126,Such a good game.
12127,"Honestly this game is very fun, it was just dissapointing to finish it so quickly"
12128,"this is an amazing first person platformer witha  great storyline and good graphics...

thats all I have to say"
12129,An amazing game full of adventure and has a great story. The game is short but is definetly worth the money I paid for it.
12130,"This game is incredibly fun and a fresh, new idea of what a game can be. This game is overall a great experience and was really fun to play."
12131,"Got it for $1.94, finished it in 3 hours, glad i didnt spend 13 bucks on it. movement is fine, characters look straight outta the PS2, voice acting is sub par compared to the rest of the game but could be worse.

7/10 dont pay full price"
12132,"This game is amazing, 9/10 it would be 10/10 but the campaign is a little short, but the naratimg and the charcters are broght to life by the voices. They should make a second won it could be like his daughter goes there and finds him and then the dad goes, like you get 2 diffrent prospectives on the story. But i highly recommend this game has a good story line graphics or ok everything is good didnt regret buying this what so ever!"
12133,Simplistic And Beutiful Storyline
12134,"Okay, so I took a few hours on an afternoon to enjoy this game.  And I did enjoy it.  The artwork is nice, the world was built pretty well, and the game mechanics are fun.  I didn't feel anything was groundbreaking here, but it did keep me playing all the way to the end.  

I felt the story was just there to make an excuse for the game itself.  I didn't find myself really caring about the characters, but that was fine.   I think Gone North really just wanted me to swing around with a grappling hook for a few hours, and figure out a few puzzles, and I'm quite fine with that.  I picked the game up on sale for less than two bucks, so it was well worth what I spent, and full price at $13, I could probably be convinced to buy it for that much.  It lasted just long enough to keep me interested, and I didn't find it too repetetive to feel like I was wasting time.

In all, I recommend the game if you have a few hours to kill.  It's fun, entertaining and worth the price."
12135,"A fairly challenging, fantastic, atmospheric first person platformer.  
I really enjoyed playing this game, not only because of insane amount of beauty but also because of  the great atmospheres you will perceive when entering the brilliant artistic world in this game.

This was the first first-person-platformer I ever enjoyed. You will not get frustrated playing! There is a  fair amount of checkpoints and the movement mechanics are easy to understand and pretty fair.

Just finished it and im sure I will play it again :)"
12136,good
12137,"I Really Enjoyed this game. Now for those looking for a long story, it's not really here, But was it worth it? Yes. 
Buying this during a sale (like I did) is Definetly worth it."
12138,FUCKING AMAZING!
12139,"Yes.
Buy this game.
"
12140,"gr8 game
19/7"
12141,"Well well, what is there to say but that this game lack of a clear level design, challenge comes mostly from frustration with the physics engine, story is fine but really not the enternaining.
The only quality I'll grant it is the level are visually stunning, even though they're technically old the dev really manage to gave their level a soul, good things because character lack of it. They're ""meh"" at best.
While the game isn't long, I think they manage to not fill the game with to much content. I kinda not enjoy it, but not to point of getting tired of it and not finishing it.
My negativ review is more to reflect that I think it's a bit overrated, I would neither recommend it or not reccommend it."
12142,"Buy this game when it's on sale, and spend the money you saved on some pot and you're in for a good couple of hours. 420/10"
12143,"I don't know how to describe ASAMU because let's say there is NOOO other game like it. Even if it was a short adventure, it was one of the best games that I've ever played. 
The visual aspect and the story are just breathtaking. The characters are awesome, it's just unique. 
It's an awesome game that I really recommend."
12144,"A brilliantly fun game, and seems massively underrated"
12145,I love this game good platformer rich story and soo much more.
12146,"Before I start.
I bought this game cause it was cheap. Looking at the Video I didn¬¥t expect too much and I just got it cheap. 

Amazed isnt a fitting word. This is so far one if not the BEST games Ive played in many years. 

Highly recommended :)"
12147,The game is really fun and innovative but there just isn't enough gameplay for the price.
12148,"For sure this game is not worht 13 dollars. Has a huge lack of content, rate 3/10 poor animation, characters just look very dull and lifeless. would not recommend. its worth more like 5 dollars."
12149,"Great game 8/10

Would give 10/10 if they replaced Maddy's voice actress"
12150,"I saw the title of this game and was like, what is up with his uncle? Then i checked a trailer. Then i bought the game and i figured i could record this. I finished the game without stopping once and i have to say that i really enjoyed it. Cant wait for a follow up! I want to know more about the world, the everything. Even if it is a prequel :D"
12151,"Amazing game. The mechanics work well, and the graphics are lovley along with the music! 10/10 form me :P"
12152,"WOW!

This one was unexpected.

the atmosphere is insanely well done!
happy and cheerfull but still there is a sense of desperateness and a slight creep that is always there for some reason.

pros:
- awesome mechanics
-easy to learn difficult to master
-amazing graphics and artwork
-deep and original storyline
-great environments
-completely open to go the way that you want to go

cons:
-weird character animations at some points
-can a little frustrating due to some minor difficulty spikes
-pretty short

Final verdict is a definitive 8/10

this game has awesomeness all over it
its the first game to reach a certain level of atmosphere and innovation since portal. at least the first that i know of
the game is short but its a great experience.

well done developers."
12153,Great story and fun gameplay! :)
12154,"I started the game and the second I got the grappling glove you could say I was ‚Äúhooked‚Äù but excuse the pun..

The game is amazing in every way possible, story is good, gameplay is good, graphics ain't bad. I would totally suggest getting this game as it's worth a buy!"
12155,8/8 m8
12156,short but very great game
12157,"this game better get a level editor
also the story is garbage"
12158,"A Story About My Uncle is an interesting platformer, with a few puzzle elements thrown in too. It is a very short game, but has a small amount of replay value in the achievement aspect, I did not gain any achievements during my first playthrough. The story is fairly good, with a toutching moment at the end, yet the story is too short to capitalise on this. you spend time waging through the story, yet the reward isn't worth the time. If it were longer, i would recommend it at retail price, but it is not. if its on sale, get it. in my opinion it isnt worth ¬£10, I picked it up for ¬£1.50 and for that price, it was worth it."
12159,A short but very very good game.
12160,"I should say this games is very nice , calm music and very make you adventorous'. You may say this game story really short but in my opinion the story really deep meaning ... About what his uncle done in the other world.I recommend to buy this game because i rate it 7/10 and it really awesome.

My opinion:

Pros:
+Nice Graphic
+Nice Story
+Very calming music

Cons:
-Story short...
-The games not having much objectives
-No soundtrack dlc avaible'

So I will say [Yes] to this game

Psst:The meaning ' is my grammar suck."
12161,"A Story About My Uncle is a amazing game, i love it to bits, great story, great gameplay, not many games out there like this... BUT it is a very small game almost not worth the money... But all in all i rate 8/10"
12162,"Great game, shame its so short"
12163,"about the Art
- The game is short and the ending was rushed. There're still questionable things left after the ending.

- The map design was done beautifully, with breath taking sceneries and matching colors scheme.

- Many areas resemble Tail Concerto's settings though.

about gameplay
- you become a steampunk spiderman in this game.

- compared to western games standard, The Story About My Uncle is on 'hardcore' difficulty but 'normal' on japanese games standard. If you're bored of western games' low difficulty and want some challenges, buy it.

- the game has no place for mistake, you miss a shot by 0.5milimetre after a long swing session? restart at checkpoint!. If you have bad 1-shot running+aiming or have shaky hand, this game is not for you. Also, the achievements are all about flawlessly clearing the game.

*SPOILER* . . your Uncle is a pedo on human-frog-girl.

"
12164,Best I ever had
12165,There is so much to say about this game. The game is absolutely beautiful! It's always introducing new gadgets and enviornemets. The stroyline is from the second you start the game to the rather depressing ending. I loved every single second of this game and I absolutely recommend this game.
12166,"This game was a total Adventure, All the puzzles kept my attention on it for hours, I went back to play it again and again many times. its a total must have if you're a fan to games like ""Lif is Strange"" in that sort of genre"
12167,I feel bad buying this game for 1.94 (sale). I should've payed the full price. This game is fucking majestic.
12168,I finished this game in one long sitting and I regret none of it.  Kick ass concept and gameplay (yes it can be challenging) and a story that is just as awesome. 9/11 stars
12169,I think I'm Spider Man
12170,I could not recommend this game more! It brings the best of old spider man games back to life. The story isn't great but is still very interesting. I was so satisfied and glad I played this game. Do yourself a favor and pick this up!
12171,Leafy played it
12172,"Fun chill game, good story telling."
12173,"The one word I would use to describe this game is, AMAZING

This is one of the best games I have ever played."
12174,"It's been some time since i've seen a game so well built and fun. And I bought it for less than a dollar!
I may have played very litte, I only stopped because it was getting late and I need to go to work tomorrow. But i've already enjoyed it more some AAA games out there. Will edit as the story goes on.

EDIT: Even though the story is very short, the game's mechanics make it very fun. I recomend it, very much.
This game put a smile on my face, that's all i have to say."
12175,This game is so worth the price it has an incredable gameplay experiance and is not lacking at all in story either this is a great game just wish it was a bit longer took just around 4 or so hours to complete it
12176,"Solid gameplay loosely tied to a sappy, yet oddly touching story. You, the player, become more skilled as you play. Although, it was never too challenging for me. Sometimes I'd mess up ten times before reaching a checkpoint, other times, I flew through five of them without even considering my next move until I had already done it. The aesthetic was uniform with the gameplay, and the little information I recieved on the story was sufficient enough to convince me to want to progress to get a little bit more of it. The last level was kind of underwhelming at a gameplay standpoint, but it tied the story off very nicely. 8/10   It was a worthwhile experience."
12177,Good game
12178,"[h1]Introduction:[/h1]

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a first person platformer about a boy who finds an amazing power suit and sets off on an adventure to find his missing uncle.  The suit grants him several abilities, such increased jump height, protection from fall damage, and grappling from object to object.  As the player, you take on the role of this boy and navigate through strange new lands and floating continents that will not only test the suit's limitations, but your patience as well.

[h1]TLDR Highlights:[/h1]

++ Beautiful Environments
+ Great Concept
+ Short
+ Voice Acting

-- Story Snoozefest
-- Repetitive/Frustrating
-- Inconsistent Grapple Mechanic
- Difficult Achievements

= So much potential, but fails due to its own clunkiness and lame story (which should be the best part, given its title).  Honestly, don't bother.  But if you must, then at least catch it on sale.

[h1]Review:[/h1]

[b]PROS[/b] --  The first person swinging physics stuff - basically the ""grapple hook"" thing the whole game is centered around - is a very cool concept, and I'd like to see more of this kind of thing.  And throughout the entire game one thing at least remains constant: the beautiful environments.  If the game had more open world maps it would be fun just swinging around all over the place, exploring and taking in the sights.  Sadly, the game is pretty linear for the most part, but at least it looks great along the way!

The voice acting is pretty good, but not fantastic.  The way it's implemented is crucial to the telling of the story, and the game wouldn't be the same with out it. However, I found some of the speech disconnected and awkward at times.  Still, I'd say it was done quite well overall and more of a pro than a con.

Also, I noticed other reviewers consistently put the game's short length in the cons category, but I'm the opposite.  I think this is a wonderful thing!  I barely got through the handful of hours as it was.  If it took twice as long to finish I'm not sure I would have been able to tolerate it enough to finish.  

[b]CONS[/b] -- Considering this is called ""A Story About My Uncle"", the story side of the game is pretty awful.  The grown up version of the main character is telling a bedtime story (iirc) to his daughter, and rightly so, because it would make just about anyone fall asleep.  The story is as simplistic as it gets and extremely anticlimactic.  I was completely dumbfounded at the end, like, ""I went through all that, and that's all there is?""  Very disappointed about this.

So what did I go through exactly to get to that lame ending?  Lots and lots of falling/dying and just as much frustration, that's what.  The whole goal throughout the game is to grapple and jump from place to place, often with a bottomless cavern or some such below.  A single mistake and you plummet to your death before being taken back to the previous checkpoint, which can be pretty far in some places.  This creates a lot of repetition that gets old fast and generates a lot of frustration indeed, maybe even rage depending on your level of patience lol.

What makes that even worse is the inconsistency of the grapple.  In one area you'll be able to grapple super far, and then five minutes later you're somehow not in range of a giant rock at half that distance.  Also, the surfaces that the grapple will work on is inconsistent as well.  You can grapple on to every surface in sight one minute, but then when you're trying to grapple that big floating rock just a few feet away, hovering above a cavernous pit, suddenly your grapple only works on a few square centimeters of the entire thing and if you don't hit that exact spot you fail.  Honestly, it feels like the devs deliberately tweaked the range and grapple-able surface area in certain spots simply to increase the difficulty.  But it does't make the game harder, just incredibly annoying and sometimes infuriating.

Finally, because a lot of people are OCD about getting achievements, I'll add something here.  You'll probably find it extremely difficult to get more than a few achievements in this game since they are mostly challenges that require minimal uses of the grapple or not falling.  As for myself, I'm not sure I want to put myself through the misery of trying, but we shall see.

[b]OVERALL[/b] --  I was very excited when I got this game on sale, and I [u]really[/u] wanted to enjoy this game... but I didn't.  [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] has so much potential in so many ways, but it fails due to it's own clunkiness and inconsistency, not to mention a lame story when that should probably be its best feature given its title.  There's no way I can recommend this game in good conscience, but should you feel the need to try it for yourself (based on all the positive reviews or whatever), I do recommend that you at least do yourself the favor of catching it on sale."
12179,"So this is the game leafy has been playing, quite short (2 hours), but really fun to play."
12180,Dope!
12181,"Damn, this game is incredible, is an Indie game that you can finish in 4 hours but it worth, It will be interesting making the game of the uncle himself.

Don't buy this game if it stills 12.99 better wait for sales.

10/10. Will make Speed Run of this"
12182,"Probably the best game I've played, really makes you think, get it on sale,its graphics are great, story too, basically everything. GET IT!"
12183,Not as easy as it looks :D
12184,"This is a great first effort and well worth the money. The story is simple, and so are the animations. But where the game shines is in its mechanics and level design.

This is a short game, but still an entertaining one. The grappling hook is a lot of fun and well utilised in the game. I look forward to future games to employ the mechanic. Until then, buy this game and enjoy it."

12192,"I played through the whole game and man it's freaking awesome. The art, the voice acting, the countless times I died. Everything was amazing. I'm playing this again it's a lot of fun. You won't regret buying this game. It is one of the best games I've ever played."
12193,"Grab it while it's on sale, or at least the next time the price drops below $10. $12.99 is way too much for a linear story that takes <2 hours to finish, provided you don't miss a jump and die frequently.  Frog people's running animations are hella awkward, as is some of the dialogue and voice acting, but these people seem Swedish so I'll let that last part slide. Those are my only gripes. 

The visuals and scenery remind me of James Cameron's Avatar done in the style of Bioshock Infinite. 

Fun gameplay, this is an example of the mechanics of a first-person platformer done right. Would have liked one grapple per hand, but that might have made the swinging too easy."
12194,Good game. Might want to ingest some substances beforehand.
12195,"If theres one word to describe this game its bittersweet.

The 2 hour campgain I spent with it was really enjoyable. I loved the characters, locations and story(despite there sometimes static animations). 

But then it ended. And I was left feeling like there could have been so much more to this game like another 8 hours but..that was not the case
I would recommend this game on sale as a short but (bitter)sweet experience, but be warned though, instead of satisfied it could end up leaving you wanting more."
12196,nice game
12197,its ok
12198,"Good, short game with breath-taking visuals and immense landscapes (or cloudscapes, or cavescapes, or skyscapes, whatever). The core mechanic of the game is how you traverse the vast distances you need to navigate by using what looks like a Nintendo Power Glove that functions as a tractor beam hookshot. This is a very fun way to get around, but some segments of the game can be frustrating to get through using this system. The story is serviceable enough, about a boy who is searching for his lost explorer/scientist uncle, using the technology that he left behind. I'm not sure why it was necessary to frame the story as the boy all grown up, telling about his adventure to his daughter, but that works fine, too. I liked playing this but I have to say, this is the only game I have ever played on Steam (that I liked and played through to the end) where I found the great majority of the achievements just not worth getting because the effort just seemed to be not worth the payoff. Really, just got look at the list of achievements and then go back to what I said about how the game can be frustrating at times and you'll know what I mean."
12199,TOO SHORT FOR A GOOD GAME
12200,"This is a well done game. However, it was a lot shoter than I expected. I wish it had lasted just alittle bit longer than just 3 hours. But if you're looking to spend sometime on a game that I believe is very well done. Then I feel that 1.94$ is worth it. I just with it was a bit longer..."
12201,"Incredibly fun game, but just once you start getting into it, the game ends. A sad 2 hours long, but an experience still worth experienced. Worth even half of the $12.99 price tag but not full price. On sale, definitely get it."
12202,Game won't start. 10/10
12203,Very fun game even though it is short I picked it up for 1.95 is it was worth it for me but i wouldnt get it until it goes on sale again too short for 13 bucks
12204,i feel bad for only paying 1.94 for this game. what an awesome game <_<
12205,"The game was fun... but when I purchased the game I didnt expect to beat the game in 45 minutes. Maybe i'll play it again sometime.

Overall if you're looking for a quick puzzle game, grab this while its on sale.

420/69 - IGN"
12206,"When I don't hate this game, I love it, but you know what I don't understand? Why there isn't an easy mode to this thing. Because it's one awesome hell of a game, and I get that the grappling distance is limited so folks can't go round skipping over puzzles like that, but when the only point in the puzzle is to time everything just right, then I think people with shit reflexes deserve to enjoy this all the same, and yes, I am one of them. 
Also why can't I just grapple onto ANY floating rock, but only large enough ones and marked ones? I have a problem with puzzles that can only solved one way.
Awesome scenery though, and literally no source of frustration and/or anxiety, aside from having to redo some things again and again and again and again and again. Unless you're afraid of computer-simulated heights, that is."
12207,"[b]A heartwarming Gem plagued by strange level design and Technical difficulties[/b]

A Story About My Uncle (AKA: ASAMU) is a narrative platforming adventure starting the main character retelling his tales as a young boy looking for his Uncle Fred, a bright minded inventor who spends most of his time spanning the globe and tinkering with experiments. But one day, Fred vanishes again and doesn't call back. No post cards, no nothing! So after suiting up and preparing himself, his son delves into the underground world and the mysteries that lie within.

ASAMU is a Fantasy adventure platformer. Spanning across lovely environments from underground villages to sky-bound cities almost like Bioshock infinite. The player gets around with a grappling hook, allowing high-flying Parkour that can be fun, with more additional features unlocked in later chapters. However, it isn't without its problems as you'll soon find yourself missing easy landings because the collision box is slanted the wrong way.

The Parkour lets you the freedom of taking your own path, allowing some rather amazing bounds and turns. However as a result the game has no clear marker of where to go most of the time. More so, you can easily get lost or end up going in circles most of the time like I have several times. And when you hit [spoiler]The ice caves[/spoiler] you might as well be playing super meat boy. I'm pretty sure I broke my mouse a bit because I smashed it in rage over slip-sliding over an unfortunately slanted Collision box and falling off, going back quite a ways.

Which brings me to my next issue: [b]Checkpoints.[/b] There are far too few for how difficult the game can be at times. By the time you're in the third-fourth chapter you will struggle a lot to get anywhere. Spending up to an hour on a 'simple' bit simply because you hit your head. For a game with basis around momentum, it sure seems to struggle with the concept!

Anyway, Verdict. [b]Should you buy it?[/b]: In my opinion? Not for the $13 it was asking. Maybe $10, probably $5, definitely at its current (At time of writing) price of $1.24

Pros
[b]+High Flying Parkour with Grapple systems (And later additions) is practically always fun.[/b]
[b]+Story and Environments are fun, short and sweet. Some designs are just beautiful to look at.[/b]
[b]+Characters are fun to be around, and bond with more so.[/b]
[b]+Narrative bits you get between the main character and his daughter when you find your uncles parts is nice to hear.[/b]

Cons
[b]-UE3, and all the Optimization issues that come with.[/b]
[b]-Not enough checkpoints in particularly difficult areas.[/b]
[b]-animation on most things animaated is stiff and lanky, especially if you pay attention to surrounding NPC's. Some are just plain frozen.[/b]
[b]-Collision missing from several pieces of terrain. Nothing game breaking, but not great to notice.[/b]
[b]-Momentum sometimes lost out of no place, resulting in infuriating times with levels.[/b]
[b]-Short, took me only 3 hours (And I spent a lot of time stuck on places.)[/b]"
12208,The controls...
12209,This game has an amzing story and great gameplay. I recomend this game entirely you have to play it to see!
12210,"The gameplay of this game is fairly simple enough with grappling, jet boots, and farther jumping.  This game looks beautiful is pretty well optimized.  The plot was somewhat okay but was cut too short clocking in at only 2 hours.  This game would be a lot better with workshop support perhaps.  But overall this game is fantastic and beautiful but the 13 dollar price tag is way too much for a 2 hour game, but I got this game for 2 dollars and it was very much worth it.  It was a tough decision whether to recommend this game or not but overall I will recommend because it is not a bad game, but only if it is at a very low price maximum of 5 bucks."
12211,This game is so beautiful visually and the games mechanics work so well it's hard to stop play it!
12212,"As you can tell, this game took me just under 3 hours to beat. The game may seem short but its very good for the sale price of 2$. The story is interesting and the narration is on point. Would deffinitly check it out for the price !"
12213,Better story than most AAA titles these days. Excellent game! I would recommend it to anyone! Only thing that could make it better is a sequel ;)
12214,This is a really cool game.
12215,"I absolutely cannot reccomend this game enough. Awesome gameplay, incredible atmosphere, likable characters.
The one thing I loved more than anything was the atmosphere. It's up there with the dismal wastes of Fallout 3 and the incredble mystery of Myst. I wish this game was 50 hours long. In the 2 hours I took to complete this game, I had more fun that I had ever had in games like TF2 or LoL

Overall, one of the greatest little games I've ever played. 100/10 and I'd play it again and again and again. 


"
12216,"Buy it.... on sale, beat in 2 hours cant say you should buy for norm unless you like speed running areas."
12217,"Is it worth it? - (85% discount version)

YUP!"
12218,Creepy title... 10/10
12219,"Great game overall.

It has a good story, and an original type of gameplay. Don't think its worth the 13 dollars for its such short, but great, story, so I reccomend buying it on a sale :P ."
12220,"Very good game.  Short, sweat, and simple.  Very good game when it is on sale."
12221,"if you like games like Portal and Brothers .a tale of two sons., then you gonna like this game.

"
12222,"A game without enemies sounds lacking, but 'A story for my Uncle‚Äô was far from it. An immersive environment in which you scale made for a refreshing change. A good story to follow and a pleasing game pace made for an enjoyable game. I got the game whilst on sale for under ¬£2 and I got great value, even without much replay value. All in all I would highly recommend this for anyone with an afternoon off."
12223,"This game is amazing! It's fun, has an amazing flow, and the story is driving. It has cute characters that make me so glad I picked it up! If you haven't played this yet, please give it a shot <3"
12224,"yeah dude buy it, it's pretty fun"
12225,"For as good as the gameplay, the visuals and the way the story is told is, the actual story just ends way too soon, it is anti-climatic, the forced pop cultures references are painful and it never really goes beyond swinging across pits, just the same thing with harder puzzles and no new mechanic that feels organic. Also no replay value for a game that took me 2.5 hours to complete.

Buy it sale like I did, but don't pay full price"
12226,I really am enjoying this game and recommend to anyone who likes first person adventure games.
12227,"8/10 totally worth the money.
Interesting story.
Ok graphics.
The game itself is easy but still fun.
Good soundrtack."
12228,"it is tits
no more explanation required, bish"
12229,"Got this game for 85% off. For that price, I'd say its worth it because of the fun gameplay. The story is weak and shouldn't be the reason you get this game.

On Sale: Recommended
Full Price: Not Recommended"
12230,"I played the campain and i really liked the game,
It is a relaxing adventure/indie game.
You should definetely buy it!"
12231,its pretty awesome game the achievement are really challenging. The story like is kind of good but not the best finished it for 3 hours total. Its dissapointing how small is the game cuz it have a lot of potential. Anyway it was my best 3 hours
12232,"This is a very nice looking game.
It's like a parkour, puzzle and adventure all in one.
10/10 would play again"
12233,"thanks leafy

1337/10

sik gaym tho"
12234,I miss the little frog-people :(
12235,Its amazing
12236,Nice game :)
12237,"""I don't know how to describe the feeling of bursting through the air, like a bullet."" -Main character who's name I still don't know
Story
The Story is good, when I say good, I mean it. Not gonna spoil it for you though. 8/10
Visuals
The visuals in this game are beautiful, it's eye candy, with motion blur it's even better, every detail is well made (not very much of those details though), and it just makes you want to explore more and more, see alot of these new undiscovered lands. 9.5/10
Audio
The voice acting is perfect, the music they put on, is just perfectly set on the moment when you discover something new. 9/10
Summary
It's a great game, better grab it during a sale, but it's still worth every penny of the full price. With great visuals, story, audio, but little lack of details and love I give it a nice little 9/10
"
12238,very good game. paid for about 1.20$ for this. would've still paid about 5$ for it.
12239,It is one of the best and most fun games i have played in a long time and the story is good to.
12240,the graphics are cool the story is very cool and yeah
12241,"This game is truly 3D platforming done right. Not only were the controls responsive the story was so compelling I could not stop playing. The music and sound mixing kept me engaged. I think this game has easily become one of my favorite games of all time. 

To the developers, please keep up the great work! I look forward to playing any new games you create!"
12242,"Really nice game, it's short, about 2 and a half hour to complete without looking for stuff to collect. It looks really nice, good voice acting and a short and simple story: find your uncle! Some of the ""puzzles"" were challenging and I was wondering where to go a couple of times but I didnt mind when theres something awesome to see around every corner. 

A really good game one should play if your looking for a couple hours to spend in a beautiful world with challenging puzzles."
12243,"A short and beautiful story, telled by the protagonist you are playing. The search for his uncle is a unique adventure and it's shortness makes it even better. It will make you feel better and at the end you will remain softly touched by the sad and beauteous ending. If you do not remember how you felt after your bedtimestory your parents have told you, you will appreciate this game. It takes you into a space between childhood and adulthood."
12244,"i have a cool story about my uncle

he has leukaemia"
12245,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNNU2kMhFA8
12246,"I really love this game because it has beautiful settings,superb storyline,many secrets to be uncovered,nice voice acting and awesome artworks.But one thing that pisses me off that the story is too short.
"
12247,"Surpisingly entertaining, a great story/challenge game. Definitely recommend."
12248,"I just need to say this is an amazing game i mean it i shed a tear for it i was not disappointed i recommend it :D

played it again 5 years later, still slaps"
12249,"This game is fairly short and somewhat frustrating. I recommend picking it up when its on sale, the story is decent and the mechanics are fun, couldn't imagine playing it for much longer then the 2-3 hours it takes to beat though, as it gets repetitive."
12250,Hunted this game down after I saw Leafy play it and got it as soon as it went on sale. Quite short but really fun and a lot of challenging achievements to try and get after you've completed the story!
12251,"umm it's ok i guess, but sometimes funky controls, awful animation, stupid idea, etc. It's sort of a dumb game. I guess I'd recommend it but just barely..."
12252,"This game is an absolute favorite of mine. The adventure that it takes you on is just priceless and fun. Uncle Fred, and Maddie are two characters you just want to know more about. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, from the deep dark caves, to the Strays homeland, to the ending. Really enjoyed this game and will hope that eventually, we are told another story or perhaps meet Uncle Fred."
12253,Great But Short Game Would Ride Agin
12254,"I first found this game mentioned on a reddit page and was like, Dafuq is that? So i looked it up on steam and bought it and after 117 minutes i finisheed the game.

I was sceptical when i looked at the photos of the game and at the beginning of it. But all of a sudden after the first 5-10 minutes i was compleetley stuck to it! The story-line, the gamplay was really exciting and fun yet sometimes frustrating. I have alwayws been the type of gamer who only appreciate good graphics (not awesome graphic, but good) and this game made me appriciate something more. The story is odd but great and the voiceactors are actualy good in this one!

I would Recommend this game to anyone out there looking for a good story-line with fun gameplay!"
12255,"Really enjoyed the game. Relaxing and neat mechanics, the puzzles were challenging enough to not make it a walk in the park but never too hard that I got frustrated. The story is good not great. Took me a little over 3 hours to finish, left me wanting more! I got it on sale, worth the price"
12256,"Wow, That game was beatiful. It was truly a masterpiece which made me happy for being able to play it. I just loved how emotional that story was told. The setting is a father who tells his little daughter a bed-time-story of his uncle Fred. Well more of himself in search of his uncle. The Music was phenomenal and the atmosphere of the game indescribable.

Fazit:
Pros:
+Very good setting/story/atmosphere
+beatiful and fitting music
+very good voice acting and good translating(even though with some missing parts(like some side characters' lines.))
+good graphic
+good gameplay. It felt pretty smooth and it was really instinctiv.
+good combination of gameplay and story
+medium difficulty
+signs which show you the way

Cons:
-characters were not that well modelled.
-sometimes pretty confusing. No clue where to jump next, if signs not visible in this part (e.g when they're behind a rock or under a stone ceiling which you need to pass by jumping beneath and grappling up again.)
-sometimes too easy
-far too short.

In the End that game really is something which shouldn't miss in your collection. Okay, I admit it's pretty expensive if you don't buy it in a sale since it's a really short game. I completed it in about 2 hours I think. But if you ever get the chance to buy it cheap or play it on a friend's PC, then PLAY IT! 

9,5/10 => Due to length of the game. :( I'd love to give it an 11 out of 10 but far too expensive for a 2 hours adventure.
"
12257,"My uncle hid his nudie mags under his bed. He was alright in my book.

This particular uncle hid some tadpoles in an alternate dimension that become sentient and stuff. That's pretty rad in my book.

Puberty being the harsh tyrant of hormones it is, I'd still stick with the former's secret stash."
12258,Amazing Game. Fun Story. Love the Mechanics. Worth the 2$
12259,Is this game worth your time? Yes! But is it worth 10.32$ sadly no. But this game is a fantastic grabe if you get it on sale. The gameplay mecaniques are great but the  story is shallow and shourt.(Took me 2 hours to finish). Its a platformer/parkour elements. Great buy if your looking for ssomething fresh. But get it on sale. 9/10 IGN
12260,gg but pedo unclerer!
12261,"1) Essential purchase

GREAT GAME - 
Good Graphics
Nice Controls
Creative Ideas

Just one thing.....

WAY TOO SHORT!!! 
I reccommend to buy this at a discount (50-80 % off) due to the fact that I think 13 dollars is a little expensive for a short game (I beat it in 2 hours) ((twice))

7/10 really nice game"
12262,Pedo uncler 100%
12263,"Great game, great mechanics.  Only found a few places that I didn't think were behaving properly (ex. clipping into ground, invisible walls that killed me).  Other than those, no problems.  Amazingly ""immersive"" (couldn't think of the right word) story as well.  Also surprised that this game came from the same people that made Goat Sim."
12264,"Well, I haven‚Äôt played the game yet, but Leafy did!  LEAFY IS BEEFY!!!!! üçñ <---(Yes that is beef)"
12265,Werry good visuals !
12266,"Hands down, the most detailed adventure game I've ever played.
I bought this game hours ago, thinking it would be great. Noticed it was on sale, so I picked it up and played it for a while.
3 hours later, I'm here writing a review after completing the game. I nearly cried near the end, at how touching it was for me. Normally, I don't like many single player games, but this was wild, and I had a blast playing it. 

Overall, if there were a second version to this game (if there is please tell me I need to play it) I would definitely play it. Otherwise, I'm more than likely going to repeat this game a few more times. It was amazing, and props to all of the developers that created it and even more props to the animators, who did a wonderful job at showing the scenery.

Amazing game, would play again. 10/10"
12267,"Great story, great gameplay mechanics, too bad its so short."
12268,"They have humanoid frogs in this game, and they are fucking teffirying.... worse than outlast and layers of fear combined...


also there is grappling hooks and super jumps and shit

11/10"
12269,"Really fun game. Story is quite short but you can play it over and over and try and beat all the levels in quicker times.

Graphics are really good. But it locks your framerate at 60 unless you have vsync on which is weird.

Soundtrack is really good as well, espsically in the stage just before the ice caves.

Really good game, recommend."
12270,a very fun game to play and its fun for evry age i will give it 9/10
12271,amazing
12272,"Visually amazing, great concept. Story is well told. FANTASTIC"
12273,"Surprisingly good 1st person platformer-y parkour-y thing. Bit frustrating at times, since it's really hard to judge distance.

The setting is beautiful, and the story is actually rather good (especially the epilogue).

It was a little short (~2 hours) and it didn't go anywhere particularly exciting (very much 'here is another floating island in a different theme') but I still found it very nice."
12274,"Great game i really enjoyed it, it was fun to play but very short."
12275,Worth it.
12276,"*gasp* This game is brilliant, ive played it through twice. Like.... Buy it. NOWWWWWWWW 
If you dont i will send this message to someone you love. Then, it will waste their time! You dont want that do you?!?!?!?!?"
12277,A great game. Recommend it for the parkour and the short story
12278,"Has frog people things

10/10 would uncle story again"
12279,"This game, holy shit this game. Get it right now while its on sale, even while not on sale 100% worth getting!"
12280,"Very nice game

Pros:
- Very fun concept, jumping and flying around is really cool
- The storyline is good, an innocent fantasy tale with no drama
- The graphics are gorgeous even if very simple
- Controls are very very user friendly

If I had to pick something bad:
- Physics can be a little buggy (and in some areas you can get out of bounds)
- Longevity is definetely an issue, with 3 hours to finish it without rushing it
- Animations are pretty bad, the characters look like wood statues more often than not

That being said, I reccomend this game and hope the very best for this Indie software house, because I want to see more."
12281,"Some puzzles are annoying but for an indie game it's good.
Story was somewhat short/uneventful.

8/10"
12282,"I finished the game in about 4 hours and it was an amazing experience, the game is really recommended, and i didnt even touched the tricky challenges.
The Story telling is really nice: ++
The Level Design is awesome: ++
The Dialoges are really harmonic: +
The Characters are well designed: +
Found in 4 hours only one bug: +
The requirements for the pc are not to high: i played it with an old pc: ++
The Skilllevel is not to high, and u get skills by solving the levels: as always ""easy to learn"" and ""hard to master"""
12283,"It was a good story but the gameplay wasnt that fun. 
the sotry should have been longer."
12284,"Leafy sent me here

reptilian/10"
12285,"I bought the game while it was on sale for 85 percent off, and having finally beaten the game, I can safely say that while this is a good game, its not worth 13 dollars. It's a puzzle platformer with a charming, simple story leading your character along: your uncle Fred has gone missing during one of his adventures, and you want to know what happened to him.

I will praise the game for its environments. I enjoyed entering a new area and getting to look around at everything. The only downside to this is if you have shit reflexes or suck at puzzles (as I do), then looking at these pretty areas can get a bit tedious after twenty deaths, and you'll long to either go forward or back just to get a change of scenery.

The story is, as I said, simple and charming. You meet a couple of characters, but I was disappointed to see a lack of world building. You enter a new area, but no details are given about it. In one area early on, you're given the impression that everyone fears a place called the Chasms, and yet none of the locals sit down and explain why. You couldn't go up to random NPCs and talk about what was going on. You couldn't trigger conversations with Maggie once she was on your back. For me, I love a good story that has a bit of that in it. The lack doesn't make the story bad, its just a personal preference of mine. 

I will say that the ending, for all its build up, seems rather abrupt. After chasing Fred all around these fantastical places, and wondering what would lead him so deep into this realm, the answer you get is... lackluster. It makes sense, logically, and it ties the story off, but if you were craving some kind of big dramatic ending to go with the story like I was, it won't give you that. 

All in all, I give the game an 8/10. It's got heart, its got charm, its beautiful and it doesn't stick around longer than need be. If you're here for a simple story, no great big strings attached, then that's what you'll get. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect much more than that."
12286,"It took me literally two hours to complete on my first playthrough. It COULD have been more creative with the game's mechanics, sadly the most interesting thing the game had you do is fling yourself off of moving platforms and whatnot. Character Development is there...Ish... Honestly, I couldn't reccommend it even if I tried. The game is short, there isn't much variety in the level design, the game HARDLY tries to challenge you, and overall it got pretty boring during the end. If the game happens to be on sale, it wont hurt to try it. The game is very pretty, and the gameplay flows very well. Though, it wont last long.

So, try it if you're REALLY curious, but I wouldn't get invested into the game."
12287,"One of the most underrated games I think I've ever played. If you're reading this because it's on sale right now, then buy this game! It was worth ever cent I paid even with full prive.    9.8/10"
12288,One of the most heart warming and beautiful games ever made. Would suggest trying out if you enjoy mirrors edge.
12289,stupidest shortest and worst story driven game ever like wtf y go all that way to find someone and just leave right after then GAME OVER LIKE WTF was the point of finding ur uncle if u only see him for 5 sec then u leave and game ends
12290,do you hate america? If you don't you should get this game and if you do then you should get this game cause its awesome IM OLD GREGG
12291,"Got on sale, beat same day. Although story is kinda short its great and worth the time and money. 12.99 is even worth it!"
12292,This was one of the best games I've ever played. Great platformer I would pay full for it. Hands down. This was fun. BUY IT
12293,"It's a very nie game that's a lot of fun. Though it is short, I had a good time watching a story unfold before me. With a unique idea, I'd recommend this game to my friends. 9/10"
12294,"A Story About My Uncle is one of the best storyline-intensive platformers I've played. Although most of the game may seem like a walking simulator, there's a good amount of skill and timing required to get through this game. The one and only problem I had with this game is the storyline being too short. Seriously - I finished this game in two hours, and I fell and died at least 50 times. I would love to see a sequel to this game or another game similar to this.

The entire idea of a suit you use to grapple rocks,[spoiler] rocket through the air, and power jump[/spoiler] is one of the best things I loved about this game. The dev of this game also strategically placed landmasses and other objects to get you thinking of how you want to overcome your next set of obstacles. I can't count how many different ways I noticed to clear a set of platforms. ASAMU lets you choose your own path to the ultimate goal: [spoiler]finding the player's uncle, Fred[/spoiler].

All in all, if you're thinking about buying this, definitely buy it. Especially now, while it's 85% off. I mean seriously, you can't dish out $2 for an insanely creative first person platformer, whose dev worked hard to make for you guys?"
12295,"Didn't know I could get a game with amazing graphics, story, and gameplay for under $2.00."
12296,"Jumps are incredibly finicky and the addition of the ""Eye"" just makes you waste time more.  This is not a runner or even action. It is a jumping puzzle."
12297,"All I can say is this game is a fantastic game, it is very short but I have enjoyed it very much and you can try to do the challenges which make levels a lot harder and longer. It runs very smooth and I have a PC from 2007. If you see this on sale get it for sure or if you just want a game that you can play through a nice story and do some fun jumping puzzles for sure pick this game up. I would love for these devs to make a larger game or expand on this idea, or a level editor would make this perfect."
12298,A fantastic little game to pick up. Great movement and a fun story
12299,"damn,this game is totally worth it!!the story is amazing!"
12300,"A Story About my Uncle is a lovely little game that will occupy your afternoon.

The game is basically narrated by a father telling his daughter a bedtime story about the fathers Uncle, Fred. The story is narrated as you play through it. You start off in Fred‚Äôs house, you make your way upstairs and there‚Äôs a funny looking suit made to fit you. You put it on only to find a ‚Äòwaste disposal‚Äô platform. After activating it, you are transported to a distant land of frog people and floating islands.

The gameplay is very enjoyable (what little there is of it unfortunately). You use your grapple and jump abilities to move from island to island, upgrading your grapple and eventually even getting a pair of rocket boots you can use to fly with. You then move on to increasingly difficult levels to find your Uncle as you tell your daughter the story. The narration and story are a sort of background so that the player doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre on an LSD trip, flying through floating islands. It does add to the game, but not significantly enough for you to really care. It‚Äôs a nice addition, but mainly there so it‚Äôs not a silent jumping game with another mute protagonist. 

Overall the game was very enjoyable. The playstyle is something that is relatively new to me and very arcade-esk. There are also little collectables that unlock certain modes (such as goat mode, but I‚Äôll let you find out what that is) and time trials. I feel though, that this game could‚Äôve benefited from a workshop feature so that people could create their own levels and share them with the community. This would‚Äôve changed it from a 3-4 hour game, to a 15-20 hour game if you enjoyed it. But unfortunately this was not to be.

Yes you heard correct, the game is only around 3 hours long. However, if you are a completionist, you may be looking at a bit more as the achievements are extremely difficult to earn. Would I say this game is worth it? Yes, but not for ¬£10. I purchased this from EBay for 99p, and for that it is a fantastic game. 

In short, really enjoyable, too short, could‚Äôve benefitted from a Steam workshop to add to the games length and diversity.

12301,"A charming and beautiful game, with a great little story and world. Challenges for those looking, but a pleasant adventure for the rest. Potentially the the most ""enjoyable"" game I have ever played."
12302,A beautiful looking parkour/platform game where you have lots of danger and adventure without ever firing a gun or killing someone! I wish there were more games like this. A fantastic game for adults and kids.
12303,10/10 would find my uncle mining mushrooms again
12304,"Running, jumping, swinging, beautiful aesthetic, charming story, its all here folks. Go back to being a kid with a kid's imagination and wonder with this game. No, its not perfect, NPC's could have been a little smooter though they aren't bad, and voice acting kinda jumped around in quality. But man, I love this game. So relaxing and fun. Its not the longest in the world but it is a decent length and has many bonuses. Its a beautiful little game with a lot of heart."
12305,"Amazing game.
Parkour game with a great story line, although quite short.
Buy it."
12306,"I loved this game. It only took 2.8 hours to complete, but wow. I could play this game for a lifetime. I love the style of gameplay. I feel like spiderman!"
12307,"Even though the game is pretty short, the story, the scenery and the amazing gameplay will make it worth your money ! I highly recommend this game and if it was a bit longer, it could easily be one of my favorite game of all time."
12308,"I reccomend it as a great game, but the hefty price is too much. Wait till its on sale."
12309,this is the best game ive played.  just a super chill game to play late at night
12310,"Pros:
+Graphics

Cons:
-Voice acting. Annoying or super phoned-in
-Physics didn't make sense.  Sometimes I'd stop right where I grappled to and sometimes I'd bounce off the surface and die with no discernible reason why.
-I just now discovered that apparently I had a limited number of grappling hook uses.  This was either not mentioned in game or not made clear enough that I knew about it.
-I frequently got lost and had no idea where I was supposed to go.  

Overall, it was a frustrating experience."
12311,"A Story About My Uncle has  a very extraordinary atmosphere with a sweet little frame story, fable like creatures and motivating gameplay which result in an sweet 4h grappling-flying-fairytale-adventure. The ending seemed a little bit rushed and uninspired but thats not really a dealbreaker, because exploring the caves and floating islands is key and the sensation you get while jumping through the air with your rocket boots and grappling hook is just awesome."
12312,"I came for the gameplay and swooshing around but loved the graphics and story.
Crazy fun just to fly around and have fun in."
12313,"It's one of those love-hate games when you adore some aspects of it and cannot stand the other. It's also difficult to decide whether to recommend or not.

It has gorgeous environments, but horribly looking and poorly animated creatures.

It has a good level design, but too many issues with collisions not being where you suppose them to be or vice versa. Since it's a platformer, that's a big issue.

It has an interesting gameplay mechanics with the pulling glove, but cannot provide much more. Yes, there are rockets boots later on, but they don't really change the gameplay much.

It has an intuitive controls, but sometimes you cannot grab the object for some reason. The objects you can grab are marked with a bright symbol in the first levels, but later all not all of them are marked. This is especially frustrating on the last level, where you need to go via trial and error to find a correct path through the location. Why can I grab this stalactite and not the other one? They are looking the same!

In fact, the game has a lot of small irritating gameplay issues. Also it would be so easy to make the game more enjoyable: just add more checkpoints, light the correct path, show the distance to the objects so you know when you can grab them or not, etc. This wouldn't make the game casual, but would eliminate some of those trial and error moments.

Overall, not bad for an indie game, but the gameplay quickly becomes boring and clearly lacks more mechanics. Mostly because of this I decided not to recommend."
12314,"1/10 
üçåGreat first person play
üçåGrappling , cool story , cool creatures etc.
üçåSHORT GAME I FINISHED IN 2 HOURS 
üçåThats why 1/10"
12315,One of the most wonderous and exciting platforming games I've had the pleasure of playing. A perfect match of story-telling akin to that of the child-like wonder filled adventures anyone would tell as kids and fluid controlls. Not to mention the beautiful visuals stand strong amongst the streaks of motion blur coming from your adventure suit you use to progress throught the floating archipelago. Pros: It's good shit. Cons: There's not a longer sequel. 77/100
12316,"Let me tell you a story about my game in my steam library.  Or a review rather.  Or something.  I don't know.  I thought I could make a good pun here and let's face it, I just can't.  Let me review a  Story About My Uncle.  There we go, we'll pretend it's a pun!

This game is set inside a little girls' imagination as her father tells her about his time he spent looking for his uncle in a fantasticle land.  In this land he has a crazy suit that let's him grapple, swing, and later in the game burst jetpack sort of from platform to platform.  As far as gameplay goes that's it.  You work your way through, and you feel freaking awesome the whole way because this is the best non Spidery-Spiderman game that ever existed.

This game is pretty short, but it's perfect because it doesn't overstay its welcome.  That's not to say it's boring, just beautifully paced leaving only the last 45 minutes or so to be extremely challenging, with the rest mostly allowing you to just feel like a fairytale spiderman filled with success and awesome.

The game tells a very nice little story, though it doesn't leave much to the guesswork.  All told, it really doesn't really tell you a ton, but it's one of those games that tells what it does tell so gracefully that it ends up feeling beautiful in a way.  I swear I wasn't puffing the magic dragon as they say.. when writing this.  It's just one of those dang games leave me alone!

Pros:
-Runs Amazing
-Very cool look and very sharp overall
-Sound is excellent, soundtrack as well as that awesome sound when you land from high up
-Story is simple, but effective
-Gameplay just feels spot on.  After finishing it's still fun to get into a groove in places found earlier in the game since the later puzzles force you to really get a tight grip on the platforming mechanics.

Cons:
-Would have liked to see some challenge areas or something to allow further use of the awesome platforming.
-I guess you could complain that it's short

Overall Score if you held a gun to my head and forced me to blurt out a number:
8 platforms out of 10"
12317,"played the game, bet it in under 2 hours, and refunded... gg no re 10/10 still diddnt pay attention to the story but good game mechanics"
12318,"I picked this game up for 2 dollars. While the story is short, it's really meaningful and incredible. Super fun, and if you can get it on sale, I 100% recommend it. 

The story is about 2 hours, but with time trials and what not it could take much longer. 

Money well spent."
12319,k
12320,Looks great! and it is very decent!
12321,"A nice and short game, very nice environment, and great platforming. The game never becomes a chore to play, and keeps you in you're  seat till you pass the next section."
12322,"Great game. Amazing graphics, and great storyline.. Only downside is quick playtime.. But has high replay ability"
12323,9/11 would grapple again
12324,"After all the very positive reviews (currently 92% positive) I really expected something good, but I was really disappointed at the end. Let me tell you why:
I expected a (very) good story at least, because this was mentioned by many players in their reviews. 
To be honest the story is rather basic and too short to be very touching or thrilling. If you would cut out all story parts of the game and make a video about all the narration and conversation parts it would barely exceed 10-15 minutes. It's sadly not a (story) gem like e.g. ""To the Moon"" or ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"".
The gameplay itself was ok, but very frustrating at some parts, mostly the final level.

Pros:
+ nice environment & design
+ gameplay is ok, but repetitive

Cons:
- Disappointing story 
- Very short about 2-3 hours walkthrough (isn't that important for me)
- Achievements are very hard (most players will finish the game with 0 achievements)

I would only recommend it, buying during a sale if you are looking for a short filler."
12325,"Short but sweet.

Probably best to get it on sale."
12326,"Can you stretch the mechanics of jumping and grappling to cover an entire game? Apparently yes.

A Story About My Uncle does just that: this first person platform explore all the possible variations of jumping and grappling end stretch it to a full 3-5 hour story.

This little game is not much of a puzzle, is more a coordination game where you have to look around for clues of where to jump next: i think that it could be described as a slower paced, non violent mirror edge.

The level design is great: challenging but not frustrating. The game world is quite interesting, but the story itself has some good ideas but is not that much (""Your uncle is in another castle""); anyway even if the story is so and so the game remain fun to play.

So, about the price: if you are not ok to pay full price for a 3-5 hour experience with almost to none replayability, wait for sale or a bundle."
12327,"It's short, the NPCs look like the Timez Attack character. Story is generic, writing is lackluster, voice acting is lame. The gameplay is fun though and you can get it for $3 on some sites so go ahead and get it."
12328,"Fun little game with some great graphics, level design and use of color. Got a valcan_s vibe from all the colors used, looked so good. Fun story that took about 2 hours to complete, the grapple hook took a little getting used to mainly with keeping momentum and the rocket boots kicked ass. This is a game that will give you sweaty palms pretty much the entire time. Definitely give this a try if you've been curious about it."
12329,"A solid game with a surprisingly heartfelt ending. Get it on sale, or for full price if you enjoy parkour."
12330,Highly reccomend this game for anyone. Very responsive controls and it takes you on a journey and fills you with a sense of freedom.
12331,"OK so this an Awsome Game!

Although it is not that long i had VERY much fun with it because the Story fits perfectly together with the gameplay so go ahead and FCKING BUY THIS!!"
12332,"Simple concept with a great storyline (in my opinion). With great I mean it's pretty good for the length of this game.
It took me about 2hours to finish it but it's 1 of those games you feel like replaying over and over again to find out some new tactics how you could go faster through all the stuff.

It's not worth to pay over 10 Euros for it though. I'd recommend to buy it once it's on sale - or just get it from a keystore for $1.

Overall I'd rate 9/10 - the story could've been a little longer :("
12333,"If you love a story with a mystery, then you'll LOVE this!"
12334,"The game is pretty short, but it's amazing. I beat it in around 2 hours but I'll  probably come back and play it again sometime because of the quality of what you get. 

The only thing I can recommend is to buy a steam key for it on G2A instead of buying it here, as on G2A you can find this game for around $1, where here it's $12.

My personal opinion is that it is not worth $12, but it still is an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for something that's different than the usual ""Go here, kill this guy"" gameplay."
12335,Ive got to say Ive never played a game quite like this. The gameplay is quite unique and amazing. The story is absolutely intriguing. The Graphics are beautiful in their own way. I really like this game and hope to see a sequel.
12336,"May the light guide me through the tunnel of the dead, and let oblivion shake hands with the abyss. So that I may finally find peace."
12337,7/10 game. The story is a bit meh. The playability is cool :D
12338,"9/10
Because directions are not very clear"
12339,i wus gud
12340,A short old gem
12341,Good game
12342,yes
12343,"An extreme sports game starring spiderman with rocket boots. This is probably the best first-person platforming you'll find.

The game is all about the movement mechanics, and they're awesome. I haven't had this much fun moving around a game since Tribes: Ascend or Portal. This feels like a game designed for speed runs, since you're moving at a crazy speed. It's not long - only about 5 hours - but it's good fun while it lasts.

I read some of the reviews saying that the difficulty was too steep in parts and that some of the jumps are frustrating, but I had no trouble with it and rarely needed to retry any section more than twice."
12344,"One of those games that can speak to you if you're open to that, or turn into a boring playthrough otherwise."
12345,"i love all the references to other games and shows in the game

[b]Few words about the game[/b]
Exciting and lovely game about exploring new, unknown world full of beautiful and thrilling views. All you have is grappling hook and quest to find your lost uncle. At first I wasn't sure about this game because lets face it, what game, with this kind of descripiton might offer us? Apparently ALOT more than you think as on me, it left a huge impression. One of the best, prettiest adventure games around, 100% worth it.

[b]Advantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - World is full of colorful and magnificent graphics, what makes it exceptionally atmospheric
[*] - Charming characters models and nice concept of undiscovered civilization
[*] - Easy to master controls, both on controller or mouse & keyboard
[*] - Amazing storyline
[*] - Amusing voice acting, sounds and music
[*] - Astonishing design of levels
[*] - Puzzles are not really demanding what makes the game convenient to play even for our younger part of community (it's also violent-free!)
[/list]

[b]Disadvantages[/b]
[list]
[*] - Could be a little longer, took me approximately 2 hours to finish it once. Also replay value is bit low, only for time trials
[*] - Little bit expensive as for that ammount of content, but hey, that's what discounts are for! (~3.5 euro on discount)
[*] - Ending of game leaves the feeling of being incomplete somehow but I guess alot people will like it, as it leaves place for ""thinking"" about what might happen next

12348,good.
12349,I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN THIS GAME WAS FK*NG OVER.
12350,"The trailers and reviews look nice so I decided to pick this game up on sale. It became very boring within like 30 minutes. So it explains how to run, ""super"" jump if you will, and combine the two to make a far leap. Then gives you a glove like grappling hook. And then you just continuously run threw obstacle course like areas with pit falls that restart you back at the previous checkpoint when you slightly miss a grappling onto the next item and fall in water. The scenery makes it even harder to see the next point that you can grapple onto because it's so dark. 

This game really didn't do it for me. I was surprised too because it has so many positive reviews. I got a refund for this one. In a nutshell, IMO the game is simply grappling obstacle after grappling obstacle, and then more grappling obstacles. ""Oh you missed a grapple and fell into water? back to check point do it again, and again. Got it? Okay onto the next grappling obstacle......"""
12351,Great game 10/10
12352,"this is one of the most fun games I have ever played.
the story is epic, the puzzles are fun and not too hard, the gameplay is awsome!
the only thing I really donty like is that that this game has about 2-4 hours of gameplay!
please make more and make it longer. 
I want to enjoy way more of this game and sequels. PLEASE

and for the one that considers buying this game, JUST DO IT it may be short but it is an EPIC GAME that you will enjoy!

pls make more"
12353,"Although the ending did feel very slightly anticlimactic, this is one of the best games I've played. The grapple hook is flawless and I never felt out of control, making for an enjoyable experience. Highly recommended if you like games with a grapple hook!"
12354,Highly recommend amazing art and story telling
12355,"My Experience

1: Looks fucking beautiful 
2: Gameplay didn't dissapoint 
3: I was actually happy and excited to play this game while not knowing what to expect
4: I would extremely suggest people to experience this game for themselves
5: I would gladly pay for this at the price it is at (12.99)
6: You can be like spiderman but like not gay 
7: You can be fabulous with boots

10/10 Fucking love it please buy it
"
12356,"great game! it's kinda Short.. (3-4 hours.. more if you go for the achievements)
The game has good mechanics.. and a great story that will leave you  in Aww.."
12357,"It makes you think like Portal/Portal 2 does. It is a gorgeous game with how spacious and beautiful the surrounding elements are. The achievements are a challenge for any player. And clever storytelling. It really is the title's namesake.

I recommend it. It's a nice journey to adventure."
12358,he touched me.
12359,Very nice game. Peace full journey thorught a fantastic world. It is a same it is so short but very well executed and fastastic soundtrack
12360,"If I had to use one word to describe A Story About My Uncle, it would be ""Charming"". It has a cute little story, very fitting colourful graphics (the kind that won't age as badly, because they weren't trying to be super cutting-edge ""realistic""), and a fun central game mechanic. I'm not a HUGE fan of puzzle-platforming, so it almost got a bit tiresome near the end, but the game was well paced and sized, so I was able to complete it before it wore out its welcome.
Definitely recommended!"
12361,"A Story About My Uncle is a first person parkour game that to me, resembles a fun adventure in which you can relax and grapple around while listening to music, I haven't finished the story yet however, I know that it is rather short (3-5) hrs so perhaps not for 12.99 USD, I would suggest buying the game during a sale or if you perhaps get a coupon (that's what I did and I got it for $6) but to top this off, I would suggest don't pay anymore than $8 for this game however, it is still great fun that you can play for a few hours"
12362,This game is awesome it is filled with beautiful artwork and has such a good story. Now yes this game is kind of short but it is also kind of cheap so in the end I do think that it is worth it. It is a very relaxing game in my own opinion now I don't think I could play it more then twice. First time to get the complete story and then the second time while listening to music so yes I think this game is a 9/10.
12363,"SURPRISINGLY GOOD!
cons:
uninteresting story, bad models, and really short
pros:
really solid gameplay, I have never seen a good 1st person platformer, until I played this game.
conclusion:
buy it on a sale for a really REALLY fun 2 hours."
12364,"This game looked beautiful and I had my eyes on it for a little while. i decided to snatch it up during the recent lunar sale. At a price of about $3.75 the game was well worth it, and I felt that the voice acting was good and the atmosphere of the game was beautiful. A touching story paired with fluid, smooth platforming makes for a great experience. I was really sad when the game ended so quickly. I would LOVE see a SEQUEL for this game.
RATING- 8.5/10
PROS
-smooth gameplay
-nice voice acting
-beautiful art
-unique concept
CONS
-npc's were less detailed than I would have liked
-no npc interaction
-very, very short (~2.5 hrs depending how you play)
-At full price this game is a little pricey.


"
12365,"This game had nice voice acting okay platforming, great atmosphere. It was well made with Heart and Love. 4 out of 5 stars."
12366,"The gameplay is smooth and not too difficult.. it's one of those games where some...you have to think where to go for 2-3 minutes then go ""ohh!"" then just continue... the storyline is amazing, the beautiful scenery, voice acting, everything is 10/10 for me! The way to use the tools is also very simplistic and same with controls so even better. It's also a very nice relaxing game too with music in the background.."
12367,"It's middling. The animations are awful, the character models are terrible, the voice acting is atrocious, but the gameplay is quite fun. It's very short, but that keeps it from getting repetitive. I think that more content with more abilties would be very helpful. As it stands, I don't really think you should pick it up unless you really want to try a too short but generally fun experience that's pretty overpriced."
12368,"Fantastic!

I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Swinging from place to place with a magic grappling hook and using rocket boots to soar through the air. It's a very simple premise, you are looking for your uncle in a magical world in the stars. To do this you move through different levels featuring floating islands, dark caves and giant, one eyed worms (errr...). You upgrade your abilities as you move through the levels and the get progressively harder but never difficult enough to present a massive challenge. Once finished, I went back to have another go.

Positives:
Magic Grappling hook!
Rocket boots!
Great but simple story
Loads of little hidden secrets
Decent voice acting
Pure fun

Negatives
Ok, so it's not the longest of games. You will probably finish it in <5 hours.
If you really try, you can sometimes land in places you aren't meant to so your grapple won't recharge. It's a little irritating but rarely an issue

If you can pick this up on sale then I would highly recommend it."
12369,"Loved the narrative and style of this game, it kept me interested and eager to find Fred! However, the grapple is incredibly frustrating and I found myself just quitting the game a lot. On some occasions you can grapple from a mile away, on others you have to be basically touching a surface. The inconsistencies lead to so many unfair deaths and was really annoying."
12370,"If you like flying through the air while someone reads you a bedtime story, then this is the game for you."
12371,"...another odd little curio... a first person platformer (felt quite old-school) with an interesting grappling mechanic... seems like a pleasant enough premise and one I'd spend a bit of time exploring... presentation is more than a little muddy (the first main area at least) - and controls aren't as precise as I'd like for something like this... and I got stuck in the scenery within the first few minutes of jumping around (couldn't move / jump / etc.) so that's put me off a bit... still, worth a look if platforming in a first person is your thing (storyline seems nice too)..."
12372,"This game is fantastic.  It is absolutely gorgeous, and the gameplay is very innovative and fun in my opinion.  Really my only negative thing to say about it is it was too short."
12373,"I feel as if this game is very underrated. It may be short, but is has amazing replay value. The views are breathtaking and the story is simple and sweet, like what you would expect from a unknown developer. I do say the game is too short, which I think is the only problem. The way this game was layed out and made, it could have been the next portal. Overall, if you have 12.99 to spare or some free time, this game is 100% worth it."
12374,Game is short and not too difficult but is extremely compelling and has an air of wonder to it. It feels like a real adventure and I really enjoyed the story. Well worth the price.
12375,Best game about frogs since Frogger.
12376,"Good story and beautiful level design, rather short tho and can be frustrating sometimes with the puzzles"
12377,8.5/10 great game needs longer story but great anyways!
12378,"Captivating, for sure

I loved this game. The world was so beautiful and it was so amazing to be immersed in this fantasy alternate universe and just fly through the sky.

Pros:
Beautiful graphical detail
Voice-acting is done rather well
Controls, for the most part, respond well

Cons:
Too short (Just when I started really enjoying it, it ended. 3-4 hours.)
Poor balancing of difficulty in some spots (especially the stage with the falling cubes, oh my god...)
Cheesy characters/story

Is this game worth playing? Yes. It's fun. But it's no masterpiece or work of art. It has flaws and the plot is shallow but the writers have definitely put in effort to make the experience almost ... Disney/Pixar movie-esque. I like it.

To my knowledge, this game was developed by a very small studio. I applaud their hard work as this was ultimately an enjoyable experience."
12379,"I loved this game! There wasn't a dull moment while playing it and just listening to the story, If you are concidering this game I highly recommend it because you will not be disappointed if you love a story rich game. I have only beaten the game once but there is no doubt that I will come back to play it in the future. There is one con to the game though... it's so short and when you reach the ending you wish you hadn't."
12380,A Story About My Uncle is fun and beautiful game although it was a little bit too short. Still great value!
12381,"Love this game, even if this is a rage game for me. It's like a mixture of portal and mirrors edge but more rage."
12382,"Simply.
Beautiful.

Fun and relaxing plus great story behind it."
12383,"this game has cool mechanics and can be very fun. the only real drawback, besides the voice acting, which is not even the reason you'll play this game, is the short length. the game is so short it feels unfinished, which is a shame because i was having a lot of fun. there is some replayability but not a whole lot. i would not pay more than $10 for this game."
12384,"Very good game, but I fell through the entire map within fifteen minutes. XD"
12385,"I bought this game on sale. Was fun until the level when I had to jump only. Before that part I went through the levels with ease. I usually dont get angry enough at video games to do anything, but this game caused me to break my keyboard and get roughly 2 seconds away of drop kicking the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outta my monitor. Im not kidding when I say i had to restart the same scenario over 90 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING TIMES!

Gameplay up to that level-8/10
Gameplay at that level-0.2/10

Unless you want a brain hernia, a broken keyboard, or hemorhoids... dont buy this game. Of course buy it if you can handle thinking youre good at the start and having to do that same level an endless amount of times. 

But in all seriousness I just need to cool the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• down before I actually end up killing myself by putting my head through a wall."
12386,"A nice bedtime story, very relaxed gameplay, the only thing that can at times be challenging is making sure you are going the right way. As some paths may look exactly like the path you just took. Or that might just be me. 

Apart from that the artstyle is great, the charcters are rather odd looking and it would have been nicer if they were developed a little further (they feel slightly like cardboard charcters) , both in terms of looks and limited story influence (excluding Fred and the boy himself).

The story telling itself is nice, and I really loved the scenery. Its a game you play once to hear the whole story and thats about it, would have been nice if it were slightly longer (took just over two hours to complete), but then again they say that ephemerality has a unique beauty of its own.

All in all, it was a good game and I would recommend it to those who just want to relax."
12387,Great story.  Immersive gameplay.  Virtually no learning curve yet still requires a large amount of skill.  Very rewarding in many ways.
12388,"Lovely, story-driven puzzle game. The grappling hook and getting to and from some platforms can be rather frustrating to get to grips with though. But would definitely recommend"
12389,"My new favorite game 9/10 
Was too short and had some bugs in it. But wow its so fucking good"
12390,"Gameplay: 9/10 mixes strategy with a parkour like element

Graphics: 6/10 nothing that makes you think wow but its generally good

Story: 5/10 kinda cliche and nothing special

all in all i would definetly reccomend but keep in mind the game lasts about 2-3 hours but there is a bit of replay value in it"
12391,Gorgeous and amazing game. Grapple works better than in Just cause series. You should buy it to have like 3-4 hours of nice narrative platforming expirience
12392,"the game is great but feels too shot ill rate it
8/10 becase it felt shot
"
12393,"I highly recommend this game to everyone cause this is the best singleplayer game i have ever played in my life. It has a great storyline , good voice acting and...
THIS GAME IS JUST A PIECE OF ART!!!!
Buy this game every cent is worth it.
btw it costs less than 2 bucks on G.2.A"
12394,"10/10, have not found anything wrong.

I'll probably have to edit this lol."
12395,great adventure
12396,This is what'd happen if Jules Verne wrote Spiderman
12397,"just play this game, and you will see"
12398,"A very interesting and fun platformer, the mechanics can be a bit clunky sometimes with the environments but all in all the game is pretty fun, also has a nice, touching story. The game is what it is, no hidden gimmicks or modes, just pure platforming and it is fun, a bit short but fun."
12399,"One of the most, if not even THE most beautiful game I've ever played, great story line, amazing scenery and fun gameplay. Even though the ending really hit me in the feels, I wish it was longer, as it only took a couple of hours to finish. But then again, I bought it on sale, so it was only a bit over 3‚Ç¨, money well spent."
12400,"I recently just finished this game about a month or so ago.
The following is my impressions:

PROS:
+ Excellent, tight gameplay
+ Surreal and intriguing story (Only took about 10 hours to finish)
+ Colors - so pretty!
+ Grapple and super jump! Whoooooo!
+ Narration/Voice acting is superb - almost feels like you are watching a film sometimes.
+ Beautifully rendered environments.

CONS:
- Movement of models on the NPCs are well... a little strange, but is forgivable as the NPCs blend well with the rest of the world. Besides, the ""Hand"" model you see and use most of the time in first-person is very well done.
- Once you finish this game, there really isn't anything ""new"" to go back to. I wish the developers made a challenging mode with procedurally generated levels or just like a 100 level challenge to keep me coming back. 

Summary:
Game is an exceptionally artistic experience I believe everyone should experience at least once in their life. If you have multiple family members, share this game in their library and ask them ALL to finish it individually. It's amazing.

If you can snag this game off on 75% sale, it's 100% worth every penny."
12401,"It's not action-packed, it's not a strategic challenge, it's not the most life-wrenching story. It's a game. A game that made me feel happy, sad, confused and curious all at the same time.

Definitely recommend it,"
12402,"Amazing Story with sad but amazing end√≠ng.
AN AMAZING ATMOSPHERE
Good controls and some nice easter eggs:)

Atmosthere 10/10

"
12403,"A really great physics based game with an interesting story (and some-what less than intersting voice acting). The gist of the gameplay is mostly just aim-jump-swing and is a blend of jumping and epic spiderman stunts. While it gets a little boring with simple jumps and easy areas, the more difficult jumps will keep you interested.

All in all a great game!
8/10"
12404,Great game and would play again
12405,"Other than the game being very short, the gameplay and story more than make up for it. a great buy while on sale."
12406,This has to be the most beautiful first person platform adventure game I have ever played. The graphics were just stunning and the story and gameplay was 11/10. The ending was a tad bit disappointing... but still good and that definitely won't stop me from playing it again right now! :)
12407,"I Like the story telling i like the art style i Pretty Much like everything.
 
   The gameplay is a little hard but still fun. Graphics are incredible!. I Highly Recommend this Game."
12408,"It was good, but in my opinion it was too short. (3,5h)"
12409,"Note: I accidentally left the game running for a night so it has more hours than I actually played.)

       This game is phenomenal. I am not the biggest fan of puzzle/ platforming games, but this engaged me and brought me on multiple playthroughs. I found this game to be extremely gripping in the story aspect, mainly because the way it explains the story (as the character telling his daughter of his adventure through a bedtime story) was unique and benefitted the atmosphere and tone of the game. The visual style of this game is actually very pretty, and sometimes a view made me go ""wow"" since the colors blended well with the tone. I didn't beleieve I was going to enjoy the ending, but I didn't find any issues. Please play this with headphones, considering some of the deaths or sketchy grapples you make allow you to hear the wind whipping past your ears, which can only immersive you further. 

          My only complaint is the fact that the NPCs aren't exactly perfect, but for considering what they are they aren't too big of a problem. I can only hope for a sequel or another fantastically immersive game from Gone North Games. All in all, I would highly reccomend this game, even if you aren't fanatic about puzzle games like me."
12410,"Comfy firstperson platformer, featuring Uncle, Salamandergirl and Snek.
"
12411,"Let me just say. Sure, this may be a short game, but in those 2 hours i played it, i thorughly loved it. The art was beautiful, The lighting was amazing, I can't express how amazing this game was. Get it if you love Sci-Fi adventures, this game is the one."
12412,I truly enjoyed the experience that this game offers
12413,"This game, even though short has a lot to offer, and I enjoyed every second of it! The music and scenery are beautiful and go very well together with the story. Game mecanics work well and it's a real treat having to fly between floating islands and narrow caves. The only negative thing i could think of are little bugs on some surfaces where the body eventhough on a solid surface is being treated like its in air. That happened a few times and messed me up when trying to use jump. it would go to boost boots and throw me into abyss. Other than that i recomend this game!"

[b][u]Summary[/u][/b]
Your uncle has been gone to long and you go to look for him.... What? That's the story.

[b][u]Positive[/u][/b]
The worlds and life in the world do a great job of creating a sense of wonder which is great for making you want to continue. The game controls pretty good for a lower budget platformer. The game has checkpoints quite often.

[b][u]Negative[/u][/b]
They do throw in a few jumps that are more frustrating then fun. Sometimes it may seem like a delay killed you. Toward the end checkpoints are sparse which is just annoying. The story is not interesting honestly. Your searching for you uncle... guess how it ends. It's not always obvious where to go. This may seem like puzzle solving, but I don't agree with that.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]
It ends up being a great atmospheric game that makes you want to explore it. So if you love that feeling of discovery you will probably enjoy most of your time with this game.

It's a fairly cheap game normally, but I'd still suggest getting it at around $5."
12415,"A fun, immersive game! It's all about the experiance. The controls are simple, but ejoyable. The gameplay is extremely satisfying. An A+, Two-Thumbs-Up, 10-out-of-10 game."
12416,Best solo player game i ever play thx Coffee stain studio for that great game !
12417,"Best game i ever played, amazing Story... I'd like to see a sequel!"
12418,This game is absolutely gorgeous! I reccommend you to play it at least once..
12419,like skyrim without guns or swords or dank memes
12420,"It cut short too soon. That's the big problem. It felt more like an extended demo that just tailed off when the developer got bored. There were some interesting parts, such as a giant cyclopean monster in a cave, but it was very linear and struggled to create engaging challenges out of a handful of core mechanics that could have been better utilised.

All in all, if you like jumping around on floating islands and little else, this is the game for you."
12421,"Un joc superb , are o grafica buna ! Cel mai bun joc !

M-as juca non-stop."
12422,It makes you crave what's next the whole way through
12423,"Best game I have played in a long time, becuase it is so small (took me like 4 hours) the developers could make it as good as possible. Story was good and very unique and same goes with the gameplay and beautiful graphics. Very impressed with the grappling hook system and I always had the feeling of being lost yet somehow knowing exactly where to go. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience."
12424,"10/10
This was an amazing game and I sure wish it was longer."
12425,Its amazing!!
12426,"This is one of those games that just flies right under the radar and you'd never think much of it. Coincidentally, it's one of the most fun games I've ever played. It's not too long, not too short, it's just right, and the gameplay in it is just plain fun. It's not often developers get platforming down so well, especially in a first person game. The visuals are nice, with some pretty beautiful environments, although the majority of the game is spent in caves. Easy to understand, but difficult to master, that's how I would describe the gameplay and controls. Swinging and flying around just feels so good, it's definitely a game I'll play through multiple times just because the gameplay is so fun. If Gone North decides to expand on this type of gameplay again, possibly make it more of an open world game, then they'd have a AAA title on their hands."
12427,"The main gameplay mechanic feels very nice and polished, and they do enough to keep it interesting. The graphics and are pretty and the tone of the world is well done. However, this is a pretty short game. I knocked it out on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure it's worth the $13 entry fee, but if you don't mind spending that for 3-6 hours of gameplay, then I recommend this game."
12428,A friend also recommended this to me and I really liked it. Gameplay was fairly simple yet a challenge at times to remember  where to go and how to get to the next part of the game. this is another game that wil challenge you and wont take you an immense amount of time say 3.5-5 hours depending on your skill and how much you admire the games great graphics.
12429,"Short, but sweet.  It's a bedtime story told by a father to his daughter.  This game is fantastic to play with your little'un(s) or younger sibling(s) before you send them up to bed.  I loved it and so did my little brothers"
12430,Beautiful environment and fun to play.
12431,Game was fun. Unique. Great visuals. Heart warming story. Short and sweet!
12432,"Gappled my way through several caves and landscapes thousands of feet above the air to find my uncle. Find uncle, tells me to fuck off and go home. 10/10 -IGN"
12433,Great. Game.
12434,"I'd definitely recommend this game. Quite simple idea, but execution is awesome. The only disappointment is that the game was quite short. I'd play for another 2-3 hours without any doubts."
12435,Da feels
12436,If you're looking for something beautiful. Here.
12437,So glad I bought this on a whim
12438,Really recommend this game if you are looking for a short but a full experience. It has a nice concept and a nice atmosphere with a simple story. Took my 4 hours to complete it but enjoyed every second.
12439,"I haven't gotten to the ending yet, but I am very close. This isn't a long game, but it has a lot of pros and a few cons to it. It's beautiful and has a sense of freedom to it that I love in platformers. There is still a concrete path to follow, but it isn't exactly clear where you need to go all of the time. There is a rendering line that I tend to get with the graphics from time to time which can be distracting when you need to time everything perfectly. Some of the locations in the game are near impossible to beat. This mostly happens in the Ice Cavern (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there yourself) that nearly made me want to give up on this game.

I suggest picking up this little indie game if you like platformers and can deal with some frustrations. All in all, it's a good game!"
12440,"A story presented in the form of a well-made 1st person platformer. Level design is very important for this genre and this game does it right. Start with some basic jumps and unlock more advanced moves that are required to pass later puzzles. Scenery is varied, but there are some levels with very dark areas. Voice acting is good and in tone with the story.

Overall: nice, but short journey with a lot of attention to level design and story presentation. It takes about 3-4 hours for a playthrough - recommend getting it during sale or with a bundle."
12441,A very beautiful game I would recommend to anyone who likes first-person games and/or puzzles. The game has a very pleasant pace and I have yet to find a single glitch or bug. The scenery is amazing and even though it has a very interesting story there is not much talking or pausing for story in the game. It is not vey long and I would recommend playing it in one sitting since it's very captivating.
12442,"Fun but way too short. Especially seeing the entire game was really just a platformer with minimal story and animation, it would not have been hard for the designers/programmers to make it longer. Still, worth a coffee, if you can get it on sale."
12443,Really beautiful landscapes and awesome parkour makes this game worth a go at. :D

12446,"8/10 It's short but nice game. 
For ~2h gameplay, 13‚Ç¨ is overpriced, so buy only on sale."

12448,"This is honestly my favorite game of all time. Even if it has it's flaws, it's gameplay is tight, the story is good, and the ending almost made me legit cry. (I'm a pussy I know)
If you enjoy a good Pixar movie like Up or Toy Story, you'll love this game. Seriously, highly reccomend it."
12449,"A short game, but is an amazing one. Get it."
12450,"A Story About My Uncle is a small indie game with strong emphasis on storytelling and precision jumping. 

Pros:
+ Beautiful, fantastic environment.
+ Emotionally rich story.
+ Music that enhances the lore.
+ Interesting characters.
+ Good game mechanics.

Cons:
- Puzzles are way too easy.
- Without a gamepad the precision jumping/ grappling can feel clunky.

Conclusion:
It's got a lot of speedrun potential, especially considered, that on the first playthrough you probably won't even unlock any achievements. It's also quite short, but that's not really a flaw. The level design and mechanics make it a satisfying experience."
12451,"A Story About My Uncle combines two of my favorite aesthetics into one game: abstract runic designs and floating islands. I fell in love with the thumbnail art in the store was so hopeful that it would be good. Fortunately, those two things are great. You'll find one of the most awesome twilight skies in gaming with waterfalls dressing floating islands and runic symbols illuminating decorating the landscape. Some of the foliage looks out of place, like two different art styles came together in the same painting, and the character models and animation are poor. With that, much of the voice acting could be better and the audio could be cleaner so that voices sound like they are coming from characters and not being read into a mic, complete with faint mic hiss. These gripes are present but not enough to dramatically affect my enjoyment of the game.

The gameplay simply involves getting from point A to point B using a grappling hook, power jumps, and a pair of rocket boots. The grappling hook pulls you towards your target rather than swinging, so you have to release early and use your air control to go around the rock you are flying towards to keep your momentum up. There is no demand to move quickly, like a time limit or grading system, so you can take the game as fast or slow as you want, but I found trying to go as fast and far as possible to be the most fun. Howver, there is a distinct feeling of loss of momentum when connecting with a new grapple, which is immensely dissatisfying and can be frustrating, especially when doing time trials. Furthermore, what feels like inconsistent physics and even grappling distance can make determined time trial runs immensely frustrating. Taken at one's own pace, ASAMY is brilliant, but when going for a fast time, little details can become massive pains.

This game inspired a feeling in me no other game has really elicited: trust. Trust that when I throw myself into a void, that there will be something for me to grab hold of. I quickly, confidently, yet desperately search for a floating rock, still falling, still knowing that it must be there. When I see it, I know that I can reach it and, even though I have no idea where it is taking me or where my next grapple point or recharge point will be, I trust that it will be there and fly through the air with determination. It is a remarkable sensation. I finished my first playthrough in about 2 hours, but I will go back through for the personal satisfaction of flying farther and doing better.

If you like Mirrors Edge, you might like this too. Buy it on sale."

But seriously, I do love parkour-esque games, and this is a pretty good one if you just wanna chill and just ""fly"" around pretty much."
12454,"Its an AMAZING game, i mself as not a very pro gamer i finished it in around 5 hours, but i had waay more fun with some of the extra features. this game DEFFINETLY is worth its money"
12455,"I can strongly recommend this game! the gameplay itself is perfectly designed, the graphic is stunning and the story is nicely told. Bought it for around 3‚Ç¨ at Steam sale so the value-for-money ratio is simply perfect! :)"
12456,awesome ! game
12457,"Really Loved it , unforgetable ."
12458,Very fun platformer with a great storyline to go along with it!
12459,oh my gosh this game is one of the best games ive played no joke amazing but kinda short in my opinion but still the graphics are awesome and kinda sad a bit at at the end but never the less so much fun
12460,"It's a good game. Good gameplay, fun story, challenging platforming...
I'm not saying you'll die if you don't play it, but if you liked it from the trailer,
you'll like it more if you just play it together. It's worth its money, I promise."
12461,"Solid physics. The grappling can be difficult to get accustomed to at first, but checkpoints are generally well-placed, so you don't lose much progress if you make a mistake.

A relaxing game that'll have you leaning into every jump."
12462,"[h1]First person platforming is really hard to get right, but A Story About My Uncle absolutely nails it.[/h1]

The jumps are so huge, and the mid-air redirection is so lenient that I never missed any jumps that I thought I was going to land. Whenever I fucked up it was my own fault. The game-feel is also pretty good which helps make the platforming really fun.

[h1]While the graphical fidelity is not exactly state-of-the-art, the art style more than makes up for it.[/h1] 

The environments and scenery are beautiful from begining to end. It's only when the story sections appear with in-game animated characters that you remember that this is a low budget game. The character animations leave a lot to be desired, as does the voice acting.

With better voice-acting and maybe a more memorable soundtrack, this game would be absolutely stellar. As it stands, it's just pretty damn good.

[h1]I would recommend this game to absolutely anybody, especially those who enjoy platformers.[/h1]"
12463,"It's a great game with great and fun mechanics. However, i was really dissapointed with how the game ends. It's also really short."
12464,"A very short but fun game. It starts off really stong in story but by the end it gets a little too quiet. The platforming is really good and you usually know exactly where you should go, until the end again when you seem to do more searching for the next spot than getting there. Lots of trial and error with the occasional annoyingly placed checkpoint but it's not overly difficult.

It's an uneven experience and very front loaded. It's not worth the current full price ($12.99) because it's so short but it is worth playing, get it on a sale or in a bundle."

12468,I'd write a review on this but master said im not allowed to think on my own.
12469,"Very fun experience, the mechanics were fun to learn and do.  Wish it was longer or had more dynamic gameplay though."
12470,"Just some quick thoughst about the game.
This is a first person platformer, with a beautiful visual style and really good voice acting (imo).
The gameplay is rather simpel - you get a suit that lets you use a grapple and make high jumps, and about an hour in, you get a pair of boots that lets √Ωou thrust forward in mid air.  

The story is simpel, but entertaining and kept med hooked for the roughly 3 hours storyline. There are no puzzles in the game, but using the jumps, grapple and thrust to get around the amazing floating world really is fun, and for me the game was all about the atmosphere. 

It should be noted that the game also is suited for kids - no adult themes like murder, conspiracy, gore og anything like that."
12471,"I've been playing for about two hours, but I'm almost fed up with it already. Maybe it's me (I almost never play FPS), but playing this game with a controller it's like playing Dark Souls with a keyboard - frustrating as heck. You need to be very accurate with your aim, an accuracy that is so very difficult to achieve with a gamepad. Pretty graphics and possibly interesting story don't really make up for the frustration of dying 10 times in the same spot, thinking you're doing something wrong, and see on walkthroughs that you are doing what you are supposed to, only you keep on dying over and over and over.
Not recommended - sorry.
5/10"
12472,A simply beautiful and well made game. Worth every penny.
12473,"Beautiful gem of a game with a compelling story and lovable characters.

Picked this up in a bundle but now that I've played it, I'd totally recommend paying full price if you can't find it anywhere else. It's worth it!"
12474,Such a beautiful game.
12475,"Performance:
 * no SLI support
 * ran at 1440p60fps (vsync on) on a (single) gtx 980, with about 50-60% utilization with everything maxed.

Pros:
 * actually looks really damn nice considering it's an indie game and the cheap price
 * the grapple/swing mechanics are a lot of fun
 * the large expansive world (sometimes got too large and overwhelming)
 * no loading screens
 * a fair bit of hidden secrets and story that you have to zoom in to see and understand (in the first room, if you look around, you can see the plot synopsis of what's going to happen in the next 5 mins, written on a few papers scattered around)
 * the voice acting for the most part was great.
 * has an FOV slider! (goes from 60-120, I played it at 100 just fine.)

Neutral:
 * completed it in about 4 to 4.5 hours. Probably could have gotten through it in 3 if I wasn't screwing around so much.
 * seemed that there were multiple ways to get through several of the levels.
 * no map or minimap, easy to get lost and not know where to go, but more realistic I guess.
 * need a mouse and keyboard to play. it's a precision first person shooter/action platformer, you need to be able to make fast and accurate shots to the next grapple area while freefalling down.
 * mouse acceleration on by default, but easy to turn off in the options.
 * the game gets dark and hard to see sometimes, but makes for a great appeal when you fall down to the dark abyss after you miss a grapple. Adjustable gamma in options, but that's not enough.
 * graphics options are just acceptable imo. ( https://i.imgur.com/RO5WWnQ.jpg )

Cons:
 * not too much replayability (aside from trying to complete the levels faster/with fewer hooks)
 * there were several times I got confused and had no idea where I was going or where the next objective was. Several times I just jumped off the cliff without knowing where the next grapple spot was. 
 * one time during the story, your ""double jump"" gets arbitrarily broken and unusable, only to get fixed in the next zone.
 * there is no obvious way to make a followup. The way the game ends makes it obvious that it's a standalone game, which is a shame, I want to explore more of the wonderful world that they built and fly around in the air more.

It's a great little piece that more people should play. Perhaps not at the full ($13-ish), but if you pick it up for $4 or less, then absolutely get it. It's gone down to $2 a few times on other sites (check isthereanydeal) and for that price you can't afford to not get this game."
12476,"I was looking forward to a 3D platformer but it was more frustrating than fun.

-the ability to reach certain platforms of a certain distance was inconsistent. Sometimes a platform would appear so close but you were unable to reach it, and other times platforms would be incredibly far away and you could miraculously reach it. 
-ice caves were repetitive, which is a tendency in platformers, but I just couldn't wait for the game to be over.
-storyline felt very thrown together, and ending felt like a copout. Again, I know platformers don't normally have strong storylines, but I was hoping the storyline would make up for the gameplay.

There were some redeeming qualities about the game (I liked it enough to finish it) but overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
12477,A good game Fun.. good story telling and a fun little puzzle game
12478,"Fun short game. It's a nice take on 3D platforming. 
The environments are very pretty, and jumping around in them is immersive and fun. 
The actual people are quite crudely made, and the voice acting is bad. The narrative is still decent, and I liked the end."
12479,The game sounds like what you would hear at a court hearing but its a acual good game
12480,"Decent platforming gameplay but very, very short. The story was very shallow, & also I hated the dream like directing style with a passion. It just flat out doesn't work."
12481,Pretty great story Grandpa
12482,"Nice story but frustrating game and too short.

The game mechanics make it frustrating and not enjoyable. When you try to use the grapling it only works within a certaint distance of the object but when you are flying trough the skies you can't tell how far away you are from the objects so you just have to try and retry to guess you are in the distance. [spoiler]Also, when you reach the level where you can recharge the grapling it's even worse since the recharge only works at certaint speeds so you can't recharge when you're flying fast and just wander what you did wrong.[/spoiler]

Overal 6/10."
12483,"Some of the puzzles were slightly frustrating, but overall I was very surprised by how well this was made."
12484,"An interesting platforming title based on grapples and gravity. Enjoyable, albeit short and with a weak story. It can last longer if you go for the achievements, but be ready for some imprecisions within the grappling system. Recommended on sale."
12485,this game is very fun and the graphics are great just wish the could make a buyable dlc so there could be more stories or something would defeniatly recommend to a friend

12488,"Look at you, soaring through the air, like an eagle....piloting a blimp.

12489,"Its so rare to find games that just want to tell a story and imerse you into their world. This is a game that does not force its story down your throat. Suprisingly its also a rather touching game. Its so uncommon to find a game that tells a sort of fantastic story about people moving on and overcoming the things in life. This game does it all perfectly.
Id even go on to say its the next Portal."
12490,"so here i was, trying to decide what to play on a friday night, I already played alot of the witcher 3, mad max, MKX, MGS V and wanted to play something new. my friend told me about this game so i decided to buy and play this game with low expectations. All i got to say is THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN"
12491,"A short but fun game.
I recommend this game but I'm currently stuck in really difficult stage where cubes falling from cellings.
I watched other players video for hint but it seems they go through it straight forwardly.
No matter how I tried I can't do that."
12492,Very fun to play and overall great game.You wont regret if you get it!
12493,"I want to, oh man I want to recommend it. At first, that feeling of freedom, of exhiliation as you soar and grapple... it's awesome. Then you've been playing for an hour and all you get is frustration and a ragequit. Unclear layouts leaving you wondering where to go, split-second timing over and over, jumps where you have to be pixel perfect to make the next hook, so so so many respawns, but never a feeling of triumph, just another impossible jump. It felt great, briefly, then it felt padded with unfair design. If you want some challenge, you might like it. But it never felt like ""fair"" challenge to me."
12494,"The story is great.....if you can get past the actual gameplay part of it. The controls are a bit slippery, and the graphics could use some work. The mechanics aren't very reliable either..."
12495,A very heartwarming experience. The game has a grabing story the only bad thing about the game in my opinion is the time it takes to finish the storyline. You can replay the game for the collectables and the game offers a time trail mode so you can test your skills.
12496,Fantastic Portal-like game with fun mechanics and heartwarming story.
12497,"This game is one of the most fun singleplayer game I've ever played. I reccomend it to anyone to play it, although the game time really doesn't take that long to beat it."
12498,"Short and sweet. Not too replayable, at least in my opinion. This is a one sitter, so hunker down and get ready for a quick adventure."
12499,"Fun, Short, but worth it in my opinion.  only took me 6.1 hours to beat the game and that was with me doing some of the challenges. Like the frog that sits on your back nagging that you can't do an area without grappling=3.  Totally showed HER!!! 

In short this is a sort of Puzzle game with A grappling hook, Rocket boots, and a Jump Assist Suit. The story is mildy interesting and by the end you are either invested or it goes right over your head lol."
12500,"This is a great platformer. It's not very long, but the environments are well-detailed and feel huge around you.
A Story About My Uncle is fairly short, while still being challenging enough to be satisfying when you complete a section.
The story is acceptable; not any more than that, but it feels like it's really just there to guide you through the landscapes.

Buy it for the sweet grappling-hook glove action."
12501,"First person platformer with a very nice story and awesome music, only thing is the voice acting is kinda meh, Uncle Fred and the protagonist are pretty good tho

9/10"
12502,FUN GAME
12503,"Surprisngly fun. I really didn't think this game would be that fun to begin with, but I was wrong. It falls short on the story side and the graphics are just out of this world. Overall, a good investment, although I recommend you wait for a sale before buying this."
12504,"Short but great platforming mechanics with a strange, but entertaining, story

10/10"
12505,"If you want a game that has a simple story and gameplay pick this up!!
Plus the music is really nice too!"
12506,"u shoot laser beams out ur hand which makes u grapple to said thing with laser beam on it
u jump far too

12507,dear esther needed a grappling hook

Story: Great story 10/10"
12510,10/10
12511,"Interesting story.
Great mechanics.
Really feels like you're about to fall to your death.

A great afternoon for casuals, a challenging few weeks for speed runners.

8/10 frogs"
12512,"Fantastic platformer, great use of grappling hook and jetpack. Shame about the voice acting and story, but the gameplay is solid. Needs workshop support! I can only imagine what awesome custom levels can be made."
12513,"A visually stunning game with challenging puzzles and really terrible fake-accent voice work.

Loaded with references, jokes, and callbacks.  Lots of things to keep your eye out for.

It has an FOV slider!

A great game for chill-time."
12514,very chill game with a bunch of pop culture references. It makes you feel like you're dreaming or like in the middle of a pixar movie.  Great game for when you just need to relax.
12515,"This game.......powerful stuff. From the exciting and sometimes confusing platforming to the soundtrack, this game is completely deserving of a recommendation. The grappling feature is probably the most amazing part of this game- you truly get a thrill using it. I only wish you could swing using the grapple, and not just use it for pulling yourself toward things. The game is beautiful, and while the character animation isn't the best, the voices suit the charaters. 9/10"
12516,"Such a fun game. Replayable, and a great story. 10/10"
12517,"Short lovely story, about a boy who went looking for his uncle, its amazing.
not really a long review but, enough to say this game was awesome."
12518,A nice 3D platformer that will make you feel like Spiderman. Brutally challenging in the later stages but well worth sticking with it for the story
12519,"Very kind, sweet and insanely beautiful game. Actually every location is gigantic and its good for this particular game, each location is fascinating for its atmosphere and beauty.The grappling mechanic is well done, the charge jump is fantastic, and the jetpack is also well done.And the story is... is just amazing and so cute. The game is a little bit too short but its worth the price:) It has become one of my favourite games that i will never forget and i could play all the time because it never gets boring."
12520,One of the best platform games i have played and can be challanging at times. I would like to see a sequal to this story.
12521,A beautiful and well crafted game. Short but makes up for its quality content.
12522,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚úØ‚òÜ
A really amazing experience, the areas are fun to explore and the grappling makes it a fun experience, gameplay wise it is a fun experience, atmosphere wise it is also a really nice experience, but there isn't really much of a story but the narration is amazing, the guy has the perfect voice for this type of gig, to round off : good game, worth the time to play (although it is a short game) and it's something fun to have experienced, the mechanics would be awesome in a game like Dishonered where u can use it to murder or get around the environment faster though, but it was still a fun game. 3.5/5"
12523,"A first person platform adventure with an amazing scenery, beautiful graphics, engaging story and a lots of frustrating jumps.

You will love to hate this game. It will make you scream. From anger. And ragequit. But you'll come back to it cause of the storyline and absolutely beautiful surroundings.

Suggested [b]discount[/b] buy if you love adventure, platforms, sci fi and frustrations.

12524,"A very charming game that is very relaxing and peacful and yet at the same time can fill you with exileration. It looks beautiful and the visual is only made better by the great music and voice acting. It wasnt an extremely challenging game but there were some parts that had me stuck but it wasnt too easy either so a good mix. At times it did feel neverending and I would find myself just wanting to hurry up and get to the next checkpoint, however when it finally was over i found myself rather sad to see it end. I do recommend this game. Its a nice relaxing wind down type of game to play with a touching little story behind it, that was my favorite part."
12525,"It's only a few hours of gameplay, but it's well designed with nice visuals and fun mechanics. Worth it when it's on sale."
12526,"First off, this is a good game. However, the animation... Well, let's just say it isn't worth 13$. So, I would recommend buying this on sale, if at all. The gameplay is amazing, but for the price, there isn't THAT much, but again, it IS a good game. The core game mechanics are pretty interesting, the grapple, jump, etc. 


So, basically, buy this on sale, and enjoy it(and make fun of it at the same time)."
12527,"Not saying it was amazing, but I really think more games like this should be made.  This was a pleasant experience that was around the length of a movie.  It was engaging (mostly because of the fun mechanics) and even had a cute story.  If more games were made liek this that maybe were a little more story heavy, I would play the crap out of them."
12528,"I really like this game. It's short but has a great story. The gameplay is a mix of mirrors edge and spider man, fast paced, on the fly puzzle solving. Artistry is great and gives you a sense of being in some magical colorful world. Very underrated, would defintely recomend picking this game up!"
12529,"it fucking ruined my life
"
12530,"Can't actually express how much I loved this game. It's chilled, Laidback and has a really nice story to it. The graphics may not be next gen but the game is still absolutely breathtaking. 10/10 would buy all my friends."
12531,Fantastic game. Nice mechanics and a short but charming story. Would recommend to everyone to try.
12532,Dick went hard the first 5mins
12533,"It is a wonderfully atmospheric and beautiful game with a unique genre. Being a mixture of Puzzle, Jump n Run and to some extend, First Person Shooters, none of these are among my favored game genres, ""A Story about my uncle"" captivated me regardless. 
The game seems to revolt around the idea of moving onward in a wold where you can't see the ground bellow the flying stones, and the creators executed the idea well.
While I admit there are certainly some flaws in the game design, such as ocasionally not knowing which way to move onward to, not making a leap because the stone that was supposed to guide your way slowed you down or even blocking your view of the next step on your journey, it is overall an incredibly fun and forgiving game. Even if you, like me, love to take a moment and just look at your surroundings and take in the little details that the creators strew around everywhere, you will take a lot of joy from the details this game has to offer."
12534,"So the game took me 2.8 hours to complete so depending on your skill if your ok with a short game i would highly recommend this game, it has a great story which is built together extremely well, the game also has a beautiful world the only thing that i would say is bad is that the (spoiler) salamander people dont look as well made as other things in the game.

9/10 great game with frozen whales."
12535,"Great game, lot of fun! It's worth it!"
12536,"One of the most fun and exhilirating platformers I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Highly recommended if you like fun, not recommended if you hate everything about fun!"
12537,I knew very little about this game before I bought it. It is an absolute delight to play. Wonderful puzzle game.
12538,"Brilliant idea, executed perfectly.. perfect 5/7"
12539,"Just beated the game, so... This is nicely done at some points, but I dont find it good enough to what seems to offer you when you watch the trailer all excited.

-Story lacks emotion, is like is all really empty and simple
-You meet a girl named ""Maddie"" but seems lo lack personality even when she acts like a child
-Map desing feels a bit confusing at times and not clear enough even for been really linear
-You can't create your way through the map, there is a pre-made route you must follow (total fun killer)
-The grappling laser feels a bit.. ehm.. ""basic"". It only has one mode, I was expecting like a rope mode at least, like playing a spiderman on first person. Also would be much more natural to move around instead of feeling a bit awkward at times
-In the last map there are stalactites and there is pretty much just one chance to do it right, you fail you need to die to try it again
-History a bit short

And now the strong parts of the game:
+Decent graphics, the engine can do it better but no complains, I really ain't a graphic b**** so..
+A unique kind of adventure you get to live it through FPS perspective, which can feel refreshing
+The collectibles are well hidden, so if you like the ""work to find it"" or just carved by old school games, this is a feature you can enjoy
+The unlockables that you get through the collectibles are nice (you can change the color of the beam and some other functionallities)
+The narration is amazing, my round of applause to the narrator. Really great voice to the roll he plays in the game.
+Beautiful sub-real fantasy like environments

Overall, if you can get to pick it at like 5 dollars I think it kinda worth it, if I could know all the gameplay from before hand I woud perhaps not have bought it but oh well, didnt spend much money so, I'm ok (this comment is mostly cause the dollar on Argentina isn't exactly cheap, so I feel everything I buy must REALLY worth it)"
12540,"FUCKING AMAZING.
Beautiful artwork, amazing story, intense moments."
12541,The ice cave is a bitch but the feels at the end definitely made up for it!
12542,"Short, but well presented and challenging first-person action platformer with a real sense that you're 'flying' through the levels. There's definite time attack potential once you've completed the story, plus a few tricky spots to reach off the beaten track. Have to appreciate the character animations and lip syncing, too."
12543,"Cool story, uncle."
12544,"Pretty short but deffinetly of high enough quality to be worth ¬£2.50 . 

The gameplay has a nice learning curve to it, introducing new mechanics as the game progresses through the various chapters. The story is somewhat weak with a slightly unsatisfying conclusion albeit a logical one. Personally, I felt like the platforming became really engaging and appropriately challenging slightly too late. It was only in the last chapter (particularly towards the end of it) that I was thoroughly enjoying the gameplay. However I understand that this won't be for the majority of customers so I don't count that as a negative. 

Interesting world, minimal yet capturing story. A fun way to spend a couple of hours :)"
12545,"After watching the Game Grumps crew play a bit of this, I decided that it looked quirky and interesting. I was impressed by the lovely art style, the challenging, yet not impossible, level design, and the way the story is presented.

Quite the game considering this studio's previos goat-related work."
12546,"the narration is amazing, the story and the atmoshpere is very well done.i reccomend it!"
12547,"A very solid game, a fun story and interesting platformer."
12548,This game is fantastic play it!
12549,"Its kinda short but thats just a detail, the only thing you need to care is that this game is MARVELOUS.
The narration, the simple but nice story (its not complex, it has no plot twists nor an overwhelming ending, its just simple, and somewhat, it fits the game) and the AWESOME and BEAUTIFUl visuals make this game unique, along with the well designed gameplay. I have no cons to put in this review, because this game satisfied me 100% and it was really well spent money. If you are thinking if you should buy the game or not, stop thinking and do it, you wont regret."
12550,PLAY THIS GAME the story is SO good. The characters are good aswell.
12551,"A beautiful story about a genius inventor and his nephew. A Story About My Uncle, is one of these modern art installation games, but features actually challenging gameplay in the form of 1st person platforming. The game has a bunch of really well made movement mechanics, which I won't explain in detail because they are very fun to discover along the story.

I said beautiful before, and I meant the graphics too. Really nice art style, atmospheric environments, every chapter has its own distinct look and they are very enjoyable to look at. The beauty is also in the narration, the spoken lines of the narrator are good stuff, and they help you along this adventure. There are also many subtle things going on in the game world, relating to the story, for example: you can encounter lines of text written in a weird language, which you can learn to translate yourself. I recommend figuring things out, it really is worth it. Going into detail would once again spoil the experience.

I'm one of those people who enjoy experiencing visual stories, even without actual gameplay mechanics, but I know some people really don't like such experiences (e.g. Dear Esther). I strongly recommend this game to anyone who didn't like Dear Esther because of the lack of gameplay mechanics, I think this is a game that has what you were looking for.

Go on an adventure, play A Story About My Uncle, figure things out and overcome the platforming challenges, in the end you might be surprised by how beautiful this story is."
12552,Game is good. I like game. Game is fun.
12553,"Fantastic game. A little short, but you'll probably die enough times for it to keep you busy.

The storyline was great, since the characaters weren't super in-depth, but just deep enough to fit with the story and make you grow a little attached to them.

If you like puzzle-shooters and 3D platformers, then you'll love this game."
12554,"A great game to relieve stress, flying around without a care 5/7 m8"
12555,"Interesting story and some new gameplay experience.
May be good game for Virtual Reality.
8/10"
12556,"Okay so this is NOT A BAD GAME BY ANY MEANS, some parts are outstanding by any standards, while other parts fall flat. I think the think that distinguishes this from a game I would wholly recommend is that there are parts that are so frustrating it ceases to be fun, and also because the game did not meet my (admittedly high) expectations. What I mean to say is it is good, but could be a lot better.

Let me start out with the good things: 
-The scenery! I love it. The game's landscape is eye candy.
-You get to meet some cute frog aliens.
-There is a cool ""boss"" level.
-The framing device of a man telling his daughter a bedtime story works well. I got some good Narnia vibes. Prepare yourself for a wonderful adventure!
-There is something exhilerating about the gameplay, the jumping and swinging around like Spiderman or something. It's lovely.
-Gets challenging.
-Some cute easter eggs, example: a gameboy with ""A Story About My Uncle"" title screen.

Now, the bad:
-Pretty short.
-A lot of bugs, getting caught in the terrain in some places, or the grapple being juuuust too close to the edge of a platform, causing you to get caught and sort of wiggle endlessly in front of the platform instead of landing on the top of it (giving you no choice but to let go and fall to your death).
-While I appreciate that there isn't some kind of ""locking"" system in place with the grapple, because the gameplay really is exciting and challenging the way it is, the game punishes you a lot if your aim is even just a liiittle off, which is a shame, because it eventually gets frustrating.
-You are going to fall a lot.
-There are areas where there are not enough checkpoints.
-Voice acting is not bad, but definitely not stellar.
-Small nitpick, but outside of what you need to do to progress there is very very little you can do to interact with the environment.
-They go overboard with the easter eggs at some points and it kind of broke immersion for me. It's been a while since I played but I believe there was a My Little Pony reference, a Game of Thrones Reference, and a Breaking Bad reference. None of them adding anything to the experience.

Conclusion: Definitely buy it if it goes on sale! But don't get your expectations too high (like I did) because you'll probably be disappointed."
12557,"This game, was mental banana hype. I didnt expect this at all.
Never played something so fast.
Was heinous fun, I think it would make a really good VR game.
Ill probs play through again in the time trail mode.
Would recommend to anyone."
12558,Much prefer this story about my uncle than the basement one
12559,"This game is awesome ! A lot of cool views ! Instabuy ! I really,really like this game !"
12560,"Short game, great adventure. Worth the money"
12561,"A fun little platformer with some beautiful visuals and a surprising amount of variation on its primary grappling mechanic. It does get a bit repetitive, but fortunately ends before it begins to get tedious. Storywise, it feels like it was very much written to suit the environments and mechanics, which is fine - just don't expect anything groundbreaking.
If you're looking for something straightforward and whimsical, this might be worth looking into."
12562,"I'd say this game straddles the line between walking simulator and platformer. However, unlike some walking simulators (cough Everybody's gone to the Rapture cough), it actually has something to showcase - characters, an interesting story, an absolutely breathtaking game world. The gameplay...I'd say it's above average. It certainly has the whole ""easy to learn, hard to master"" thing going on. Some of the later areas are very difficult. But know it's not for everyone. If you prefer a bit more action in your games, this is not for you."
12563,"Very Nice Gameplay
Really nice Voiceactors
Nice Graphic
Cool Story
I had much fun playing it. :D"
12564,"Are you a masochist? Do you hate yourself? Do you like the pain and agony of shaky design? If so, stop reading and buy this game. Otherwise keep reading. A Story About My Uncle suffers from something I'm going to start calling ""violent design"". In other words, its poor design that makes the player suffer. Is it an adventure game? Exploration? Puzzle? Platformer? The designers obviously couldn‚Äôt decide and the player suffers for it. The story is so-so and far to slow to feel story ""driven"". The platforming is violent towards players in that it is inconsistent, requires the player to be shrewd, yet tricks the player into thinking the design fosters creativity. For example, why is the player limited to three grapples? If its story-adventure, unlimited grapples would have helped the player ignore design shortcomings. If its puzzle-platformer, three grapples should be enough as long as the player is accurate and creative. Unfortunately, the design in this game forces the player to play exactly how they want you to. If you innovate you die. If you can't keep up with the inconsistent grapple distances and objects, you die. Each ""puzzle"" must be taken on its own terms, the grapple effectiveness changes with each; this forces the player to proceed slowly and with much frustration. Given that the overall theme seems to be story and exploration based, where taking in the environment is most important, the restrictive design seems counterintuitive. At one point the game dares the player not to use the grapple; here its most obvious design flaws are made clear. Platformers should be smooth and momentum based, puzzle games ought to be clever; this section asks you to play a puzzle game using platforms that is both clunky and not clever. It‚Äôs just memorization through trial and error masquerading as a free-running, open experience. It mocks the player by suggesting they should be able to travel freely and quickly but punishes them for trying to rely on any kind of design by changing the rules. I'm hoping, once my frustration cools down, to give it another try. However, I'm starting to get really annoyed at this kind of design. Most players may not be old enough to appreciate how bad this design philosophy is but that doesn't justify calling it good."
12565,"vri short, but vri guud, vri nice, i lik it"
12566,"Beautiful, I got some kind of nostalgia from this game as years ago when I played the Playstation 1, there were a lot of games that were as adventurous as this one."
12567,"I just want to say, this game has a very beutiful, and compelling story. It contains great graphics and is fun grappling around. If you like surfing on CSGO, this is a bit like it."
12568,This is a positive review.
12569,"Really fun gameplay, although short, but great fun for the time playing.
Would really want to try to use a VR device in this game!"
12570,"This game revitalizes and reinvents the platformer genre. Definitely unique, fun, and interesting."
12571,"Beautiful scenery, simplistic yet enjoyable gameplay. I'd say the best part, though, is when Kylo Ren kills his father Han Solo."
12572,That does not look like a child's hand!
12573,It's bretty good.
12574,"So I was planning on playing this game for a let's play on youtube, and I decided to play some of the first level to get a feel for it. Several hours later I finish the game never saying a word. I was so enamored by the concept and visuals of the game right off the bat, that I wanted to enjoy the whole thing without any interruptions. It has some of the funnest platforming gameplay of any indie game I've played lately. It is a shorter game, but it is nonetheless worth the couple bucks.

Pros:
-Fun gameplay
-Good Story
-Grapple mechanics are AWESOME
-Just enough difficulty to make it challenging at times
-SPECTACULAR visuals and map designs
-Great sound 

Cons:
-Some minor glitches (going into objects, taking longer to die) those that I ran into were fixed by restarting at last checkpoint
-Frog people aren't interactive for the most part (would have made the setting for villages a bit more interesting)
-Nothing to do past the main story except for time trial

A definate buy if you want to play a short, fun, and AWESOME platforming game."
12575,"A Story About My Uncle is short but sweet. I had a ton of fun playing it, but wanted to keep going when it ended.
I heartily recommend it if you are looking for a good experience that won't take more than a day or two to complete."
12576,"its a gooda show, nice game. like it"
12577,Great game.
12578,"A Story About My Uncle follows a young boy who goes off searching for his uncle in a fantastical world inhabited by frog people. To do so he uses a device which lets him grapple to most types of walls in the world. And that is the basis of the game's gameplay. It's a first person platformer where the sole objective is getting from A to B. There are no diversions here, there are no enemies or sidequests or an open world to explore. You can find some collectibles along the way, but that's about it. Thankfully the game is very short so the platforming aspect doesn't manage to get boring.

And to that point it's a shame that the developers didn't really fully explore the complexities of the platforming they created with this game. There are checkpoints on almost every platform and the time you spend in the air is very short, so if you fail you probably lost around 5 secs of progress, which makes the game very easy (but also not frustrating, which is nice). Only at the very end you can start stringing together longer grappling jumps as a new option to refill your grapple device in the air opens up. Everything else is pretty straightforward.

The world that they set up also feels underdeveloped, there are only passing mentions of it in the narration, and not much is actually explained. Perhaps there isn't much time to do that as the game length is about 2 hours if you're going just straight from beginning to the end. You can do some time trails on all the levels, and you can go back and select the level you want to replay if you'd like to get some perfect run achievements. Other than that there isn't much replayability in this short game.

All in all it's a good first outing from the developer, the game simply feels underdeveloped in a lot of areas. Get it on a discount and you'll be fine with the purchase though.

6 / 10"
12579,"It's a bit short(2-3hrs) for its price, but grab it on sale and you will not be dissapointed."
12580,"A Story About My Uncle is one of the very few first-person perspective games I've seen to do platforming right. Even Half-Life's first-person platforming was a bit dodgy, but Uncle dodges tactfully around this issue by making a lot of the actual platforming be based in the air rather than on landing tricky jumps onto the ground. There's a very fun, tangible sense of speed to be found and the mechanics are fun in a Garry's Mod sort of way. And, for the record, the 3D modeling and texturing is far better than I would expect from an indie studio.

All in all, it's a fun, exhilerating game with beautiful scenery and unique controls that flow flawlessly. Barring a bit of strangeness in the dialogue and the one forced stealth section, it's a great experience."
12581,"10/10

This game is a freaking masterpiece through and through. The story is well composed and the graphics take your breath away.
My only regret is that it took me barely 2 hours to complete. 100% worth it and even after I completed the game, I came back to play levels over. This game is great and deserves way more recognition."
12582,"Amazing, beautiful, heartbreaking.  10/10.  Buy this game.  Do not question me, just do it."
12583,"What a wonderful game. 
Story, art , graphics, gameplay amazing."
12584,"It's a beautiful and original game (story is outrageous, but nevermind), but buy it with clear and sober acknowledgment of the fact that there is at least 90% chance you will not be able to finish it. It will continuously get tougher and when you will think you've just conquered the hardest bit, you will be faced with an even harder one, and so untill you will not be able/willing to proceed. The game will have multiple moments that will look like an ending, because they will be insanely difficult. But those will be not endings. Far from that. If you're fine with that, get it.
We are still in the phase of transition. Developers are not sure whom they want to cater - hardcore gamers of the nineties or eighties, or, well, regular people. This game tries to cover both, but it is not possible. I just cannot recommend it knowing very well that majority of regular people will not be able to play it.

BTW, I have played it for at least 15 hours. The Steam counter is completely broken, as always."
12585,"First off this game is really short, completed the story in 2~ hours but there is a time trail mode that could maybe add a couple more hours, besides the shortness i enjoyed every minute of it and has a little twist at the end that was nice 8/10"
12586,"I want to be able to recommend this game because of it's story and mechanics, but unfortunately the controls are extremely unresponsive and the maximum distance your grappling hook can travel is so inconsistant that every single section is a game of trial and error... and frustration and anger. 

Repeating the same section over and over again when you are doing it right just take the fun away.  It gets to the point where you stop trying to do it right and start looking for exploits to get past the ""challenge"".

Speaking of exploits there are plenty of places where you can (and sometimes need to) cheese the game to proceed with ease, things like positioning yourself onto the top of one of the grappling points that you are supposed to attach to in order so your grapples recharge and you have extra for when the game bugs out and throws you off the edge of the platform."
12587,"Such a great game, I loved every bit of it. Just Amazing, one of my best short games I ever played. One of those games that you don't want em to end... I'm hoping there is a sequel... I would really love to see one."
12588,"This game is a work of art. A work of art that takes 3 hours to complete. I really enjoyed playing this game. It kept my attention, had plenty of fun gameplay elements, and the story wasn't awful. I would highly recommend this, but keep in mind that it's short. It's really good while it lasts, but you probably won't get more than 10-15 hours out of this if you're a completionist."
12589,"Great story with fun gameplay and is very cheap for a game, I beat it within about a three hour time period and it was worth the five bucks I spent, overall I give it a 8/10 if the story was longer then this couldve easliy been 9/10 or even a 10/10"
12590,i really enjoyed this game - mechanics were fun and story was pretty neat too.  do recommend.
12591,"This game is truly remarkable with it's stunning artwork and design, amazing voice actings, and a story that will bring you excitement and hours of entertainment. It offers 5 hours of calming gameplay that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I would definetly buy this game expecially on sale."
12592,"I was able to beat the story in 2 hours, but I died constantly. Was a great game, the story was nice as well. Feels a lot like surfing in cs sometimes in the way you can move and use your mouse to control movements."
12593,"This game is an excellent adventure experience. The music is supurb, the narrorating is well done, the art style is epic, and it's just plain fun."
12594,"[h1]Overview:[/h1]

A story about my uncle is a short, sweet hidden gem of a game where you play as a nephew of your adventurous uncle. While you traverse the levels, the entire story is being narrated as a bed time story by your future self. The premise is this: you basically enter your uncle‚Äôs cabin and find a special suit he uses to go on his adventures, except this one was specifically tailored for you. You strap it on, and propel yourself through each level, gaining stronger abilities as you move along. I‚Äôll save the rest for you to enjoy, and enjoy it you will.

[h1]The good:[/h1]

[b]- Unique gameplay:[/b] It‚Äôs a first person platformer but with very addicting mechanics. It‚Äôs not like anything I‚Äôve played before. There‚Äôs just something amazing about soaring through caverns and caves with your crystal-powered grapple gadget.

[b]- Challenging puzzles:[/b] This game may seem all nice and fluffy but don‚Äôt let it fool you, it is actually quite difficult, which I actually enjoy. It‚Äôs nice to have a challenge, you may get annoyed at some parts but it just makes completing it even more satisfying.

[b]- Vivid story:[/b] This is probably the biggest thing this game has going for it. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre immersed in this book where you get to reenact the story. I love it, and I don‚Äôt even like story-heavy games or books for that matter, so it just goes to show.

[b]- Speedrunning:[/b] Although this isn‚Äôt my cup of tea, I still put it here as there are many others who like speedrunning. If you‚Äôre one of them, there‚Äôs no reason not to get this game.

[h1]The bad:[/h1]

[b]- Lack of content:[/b] The story, though being fantastic, is way too short and you almost don‚Äôt want it to end. It takes less than an evening to complete the game. Sure as I mentioned earlier there‚Äôs speedrunning, but apart from that, there‚Äôs nothing much. 

[b]- Price:[/b] Although $12.99 isn‚Äôt a lot for a game, I don‚Äôt think this game has enough content to support its price. However, when there‚Äôs a sale this game usually gets a massive discount and is just a couple of dollars, it is definitely worth it at this time.

[b]- Character models:[/b] Although I think the graphics are quite stunning, the character models are almost something straight out of a nightmare. Albeit, this is an indie game, so I‚Äôll cut it some slack.

[h1]Final verdict:[/h1]

7.9/10

‚ÄúThanks to you, I have found an even greater adventure‚Ä¶‚Äù"
12595,"The game has an interesting story, but I feel like the control scheme is poorly done. Enough so that I find it distracts from just enjoying the game. To explain, you have a sprint button, a jump button, a super jump button, and a grapple button. Super jump takes a couple moments to charge so you have to hold it down for a bit or it does nothing. The regular jump button makes you jump the moment you press it but it's not a huge jump, and doesn't seem to do anything if you hold it down. It just feels like to me that the jump buttons should have been combined into one. Tap the button to do a basic jump, and hold it down to do a super jump.

Furthermore, the regular jump is A on a controller something I feel is very intuitive, but the super jump button is the top right trigger and the sprint button is the top left trigger. Grapple is the bottom right trigger. It just feels wrong that the super jump feels like the jump I'll most likely be using most the time but is also a button that is pressed with the same finger as the grapple button. But it's not like I can just switch the controller layout so that the super jump button is the A button, because you still need the regular jump for hoping over little things.

Perhaps for some the control set up seems natural and fluid, and they go running around jumping and grappling onto things like in the trailer. But for me it feels counter intuitive and instead of feeling like I'm gracefully jumping through the sky I'm instead having to think about exactly what buttons I want to press to do something.

With a game like this, I feel it VERY important that the control set up feel instinctual, and I feel it fails in this. Sadly Steam only lets me either recommend or not recommend a game, so I have to go with not recommend. I trust though that if you've reached this point in reading the review though that you understand my primary complaint is the control set up. If you are all right with games with strange controls or you don't feel that the set up described sounds strange, perhaps this game is for you."
12596,"I enjoyed this game for what it was, but be weary of the price point. I wouldn't say it's worth buying at full price, given that I just finished it up in 2 hours, and that was with some exploring. I got it for $3.24 during a sale, so I feel like it was an okay purchase, but for 13 bucks I'd steer clear. $6.50 per hour is really steep."
12597,"When I first saw this game it was just a guy doing a commentary talking about CS:GO and I thought it looked cool. It stayed on my wishlist for a while, but when I finally got it I couldn't stop playing it. This is one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, and it's just fun in general. The only problem with it is that it's too short! I finished this game wanting more and more, but that shouldn't stop you from playing this game.

10/10"
12598,Fun game. Definatly worth $13. :)
12599,A Great looking game which feels well built and is solid as a first person platformer.
12600,"Brilliant game, its really good for relaxing and it has some great lines in it."
12601,"This is the kind of game you can finish in 2 hours and then write a review about.

Story about my uncle is a spider-man game with some action moments but it is mostly a calming game. 
This is the kind of game you play after playing some shooters or rage games because it makes you calm.

I loved the game from start to finish and I would recommend it to everybody. 
When playing this game you are experiencing something you can't find anywhere else. 

10/10"
12602,"This game.....I don't know where I got it from, but I love it and I have no regrets.

Flying around in first person, forgetting to not use space bar, Mattie and the sheer fun of it all.
It may be the alcohol talking, but I freakin' LOVE this game.

I can't recommend this game enough."
12603,"A super awesome game. The trailer represents pretty much what the game is actually like. The world is epic (take note that it is linear ) and it is basically a huge parkour course where you have a grappling hook and rocket boots. Also, if you are worried about this game being creepy or scary in any way, it's not at all. Having said all this, the game will take you sub 4 hours to complete so I would recommend waiting until there is a sale to get your money's worth. 9/10"
12604,"Way too amateurish with that kind of ""indie"" aspiration that really doesn't help.

Gameplay relies on mechanics which feel less like intuition and more like guesswork."
12605,"A Story About My Uncle, A first person platform focused game with a wierd sci fi fiction tale. The story follows a Nephew who is asked by a relative of his for a story, the man feels compelled to tale of an  adventure he once had as a young boy, one day when visiting his uncle, who had always taken him to travels and journeys around the world. His Uncle, a  renowned and ambitous scientist in many manners. Upon arrival to the uncles house the boy in question discovers that his uncle is missing. Furthur investigating leads the child to discover more mystery than he had always dreamed for. realms, locations that have yet to be visited by man, Following the clues left by his uncle, The boy sets out to discover the whereabouts and fate around the mesterious journey the uncle had set out on. The narrative is conveyed from the boy as the adult to young girl, the girl will promply interrupt the story the Man is telling of his childhood journey when a question isin her head, or she may state a thought, which adds more to thoughts as to where or what this tale really is.

Gameplay, over the course that is layed before you will jump a lot, given an item early on in the game you wiill be using it to tether yourself to objects,(most likely a rock), to propell yourself through the air, the game will for the most part not ever  hold your hand, delivering a lot of immerssion for the player to discover where and what to do next. Playing the game I felt some trial and error was happening throught most of the gameplay scenarios handed to you. A checkpoint system is mostly generouse, very few momments where you felt annoyed by the need to recontinue some elements of your journey. I never found any reason to complain, logically the mistakes i made were from my own doing. The game itself being relatively short, tries it's best to give the player a diffrent way to traverse the enviroment to feel a more fresh feeling towards the platforming, rather than desighning what you see at the beginning of game constantly, though you'll find that the game will always keep older platforming, ""routes"", around the entirety of the game, while constantly bringing forth new ones so that the feeling of repitition is hardly there. You'll as well will be given  ""upgrades"", that will help you greatly as well add the diffuculty.

Final thought this game is fantastic! I won't say any more in fear of spoiling the whole wonderous tale that you'll have to platform through to reach the conclsuion. I personally think the story is very thoughtful as well the game itself being aware of own challenges. The cheaper you can get this game the better, however if it's twenty, im really not sure what the price is. I would still recommend the purchase if you have that to spend.

Good Day!"
12606,"Picked this game up for $1.50 (AUD) so like $1.08 (USD)
100% worth it, would have paid 5 USD pick it up on sale 
- Great story
- Great gameplay excluding the last level
- Only 3 - 4 hour gametime"
12607,"A cute little game with an interessting and fun platforming-gamplay mechanic. It is a little bit short (about 3 hours if you're not rushing through), but the length feels fitting.
[list]
[*]The visuals and the soundtrack are great, except the character design, which i needed a little time to get used to.
[*]The story is nothing spectacular, but is nice and has a good pacing.
[*]The puzzles are ([i]mostly[/i]) fair. Sometimes you have to look around a bit or take a ""leap of faith"" to see the next part of the route.
[*]The grappling hook-like gameplay mechanic is implemented very good and a lot of fun. There are regular upgrades which increase the variety of puzzles.
[/list]
Playing the game felt very relaxing and i can completely recommend it.
[i](But maybe wait for a sale to get it with a discount.)[/i]"
12608,its good
12609,"this game was fucking amazing
"
12610,
12611,"Quality game I got on a steam sale. Sometimes challenging and tricky. Brief story, but still interesting. I loved the world with the islands floating in the sky. Also, If you like this game, check out the game Grow Home or deadcore."
12612,This game was fantastic
12613,"A Story About My Uncle is a fantastic game. It's a bit short, but to be honest, I would rather have a short, high-quality game than a long, low-quality game. 

I really enjoyed the first-person gameplay in A Story About My Uncle, and I think the devs did a great job with the mechanics. Games like Mirror's Edge and Dying Light have always been enjoyable to me, and I think A Story About My Uncle is actually better than them in some respects. Take Mirror's Edge, for instance. When you could really land jumps and time everything right, it felt [i]great[/i] - like you were flying. In A Story About My Uncle, you get this feeling much more often. Sure, sometimes you get stuck on a puzzle, but for the majority of the game, the movement is fantastic.

This game is visually fantastic as well. The world that the devs have constructed is absolutely gorgeous, and I loved the architecture of floating structures, the glowing caves, and the enormous mountains. I feel like a lot of modern games have lost the ability to project that objects in-game are [i]big[/i], but A Story About My Uncle does it very well.

As far as my complaints, there are few. I noticed many people complaining about the last parts of the game being awful to navigate, however I did not have any trouble with it. Personally, I would have liked to see the final bits of the game be a bit more visually perfected, as the previous bits of the game looked measurably better. The other problem I had with this game was the voice acting. Let me say that this is VERY FORGIVABLE, but I still felt the game would have been better, had there been better voice actors (and maybe more emphasis on narration in general).

Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a very fun, beautiful, and interesting game. As I said, it's a bit short, so you might question paying full-price, which is understandable. However, if you think it's worth it, you should definitely give the game a try."
12614,"Beautiful game (especially in 21:9), and interesting mechanics but ultimately too frustrating to be fun."
12615,10/10 love this game <3
12616,Yes
12617,Really cool game
12618,It would be pretty cool if it would give a function to upload / download custom maps
12619,"My yes to whether or not you should buy and play this game is more a 'maybe'. Lots of pros and cons.

Pros:
+ Amazing scenario.
+ Amazing characters.
+ Amazing decor, great sounds.

Cons:
- Glitchy physics with the grapple.
- Terrible, terrible gameplay, extreme lack of precision in the controls.

The game seems awesome, but I've been losing way too much time frustrated over the lack of controls precision and smoothness. The limit of the grapple is excessively frustrating, and although I do acknowledge I'm personally not a very 'skilled' player, this is by far the most frustrating game I've played so far."
12620,"Bought this during sales, great game worth the money. Loved the parkour and the story!"
12621,"Greatest game ive ever played, theres very little wrong with this game, the only negative point ive found is the completion time, its a short game if your like me and speed run platformers, but its such a beautiful game, it ran smoothly and the simple controls where amazing, please, buy this game and you will not regret it :)"
12622,"[h1] Short Review 

It has a great story and is very interesting, has many different puzzles and has a very mysterious atmosphere."
12623,"A surprising fun game and very interesting. The only downside to is the game is quite short, but I suppose long enough to tell the story it did. Game play was a lot of fun, even quite frustrating at times."
12624,"Cool atmosphere and gameplay,I will save myself the trouble explaining the same ole same and just suggest you look at the more ""detailed"" reviews from other players. Yes I am being lazy because I can be lol.
Yes I recommend this game."
12625,Such a beautiful game... those graphics are awesome. And the story line is interesting too! I love it :)
12626,Amazing platformer with an equally amazing story.
12627,"If you are a person who know nothing about your family or maybe not even anything about the world in general... then atleast buy this game to get some information about your Uncle, It's a start.. and It's maybe a start to your new life?
I recommend this game for sure, cause I guess everyone wanna know some deep shiet about their own Uncle?
10 / 10"
12628,"During the opening of this game i already felt like i was inside the story they are portraying.
The constant Narration just makes you feel like your reading a book.
Which in this game is amazing.

The Adventure suit and powers are great.

If you want a good story this is a game for you.

The gameworld is amazing. 

Everything is well made.

Have not run into any glitches so far.

Buy this game!"
12629,"A really fantastic navigation-focused platformer with a great story, great voice acting, excellent level design, and sound (game) mechanics.  A bit on the short side (3 hours) but never overstays it's welcome. Highly recommended to anyone. A real surprisingly good find on steam. I only regret not playing it earlier."
12630,"love the game, it feels like something spiderman would doif he used energy tethers rather then webs"
12631,"This game... like whoa.
An amazing piece of art, as well as a game itself.
One of the best platformers i ever played, the game is very optimized (even low graphics are amazing, not to talk about high) and smooth.

If you like indies or platformers in any way get this game now

Only thing i dont quite like it is quite short, i done it in 3 and a half hours but it was worth the money."
12632,"Nice game, portal like physics"
12633,"i believe the story was inspired by ""a journey to the center of the earth"". now that doesnt mean that it was the same exact story! on the contrary, the story is about a dad tucking in his daughter, but the daughter wanted a bed time story.
and that was the start of ""a story about my uncle"". it's quite a lovely story, tho there were times i wanted to pull my hair out coz i couldnt time the jump right or the grapple. but either way, i enjoyed every bit of the 5 hours i spent on this game! and i played it straight through, with no interruptions. will play again for the achievements!

gameplay 8/10 - think a very simple spiderman game with no web to hold on to or tarzan with vines that vanish after one use on Mars LOL. didnt give it a perfect 10 coz of all the repeats i had to do to get through some places, im going to blame the controls haha! oh and a high score coz no health or lives so this game is purely for the story, the visuals, one known ""bad guy"" and the grappling/superjump/glide thing. it takes a bit to get used to the timing and limited ammo. i love that you have to apply strategy with each chapter! it doesnt feel like a puzzle game yet, it is a puzzle game. also there were times when i literally moved my body forward while the player is landing as if it would help in the game haha silly me.

story 9/10 -  not a perfect 10 coz i dont like the voice acting. though it was interesting that, since the character you play is a young boy, and they used the man talking in past tense instead of present tense when talked to by the npc's, i kinda liked that. despite the voice acting, this game has a really good story!

music 6/10 - i dont have a real review for it, except for it was good, but something just didnt stay with me.

visuals 10/10 - one word: beautiful.

overall 9/10 - considering my cons xD really really good game, would recommend to everyone! oh and this will definitely test patience lol Enjoy!!! :)"
12634,"Fantastic game. 

Story telling and character development was actually really good considering how short it was. The story was wrapped up nicely at the end, totally did not expect that ending. Gameplay is very good as well. Its a little hard to grapple certain objects like windmills, judging how far away objects, how long your grapple is, or how to orient yourself in the air so that you get the most amount of momentum, dont hit the object your barreling towards, and are moving in the general direction you need to go. As long as you dont forget about all your abilities the game isnt overly difficult. Difficulty is probably a 6/10, with some spots hitting 7 or 8 until you learn the trick, then it drops back down to a 6.

Is it worth 12.99? Thats probably the upper edge of what I'd pay, seeing as though there isnt much replayability, and once its over, its over."
12635,It's fun.
12636,"This is one of the worst games I have played in the last years. If you like terrible controls, terrible level design and and a terrible desgined gimmick this game is based on then by all means. THere is literally no fun to be had its pure frustration. Oh and if you want even worse experience than most players play it with a gamepad. MAny jumps are next to impossible with bad console controls and being stuck in broken menus is also wonderful,"
12637,"very chill and relaxing game, pretty original and good story, can get frustrating though"
12638,yes
12639,"I literally just finished this game and I have to say it's absolutely phenomenal. I can't believe how truely amazing this game is, the gameplay is challening but in a way where you want to beat that stage no matter what. Worth every cent. The gameplay overall was an easy 10/10, the storyline wraps around you and I absolutely loved it. Easy 10/10 on storyline. I have no complaints on this absolutely beautiful creation, I just hope they will add more soon."
12640,"Graphics: beautiful
Gameplay Mechaics: Really damn  cool
Difficulty: Casual, until you reach the sectionof the game that is in the ice mountain when you want to rip your brain out through your ears after constantly falling into the black abyss and dying. Keeps it interesting i say.

Short story but amazing art style and relaxing gamplay for the most part."
12641,"Really worth it, the game is a bit short but if you are a completionist, trying to get all the achievement is quite a challenge. And if you are like me, well just relax and take part in an awesome adventure :)
The story is pretty cool, and the graphics... just wow. The landscapes are soooo beautiful, only the character models are... well pretty ugly actually :S it's not a real problem tho because the voice acting is exellent.

TL;DR : You wanna relax ? Play this game. You wanna have a challenge ? Play this game."
12642,"A short game that's a bit uneven in the difficulty department.  Graphics are good, sound is on point, and the story is minimal but touching.  Honestly it's a pretty great and fun game until about 75% of the way thru the 4th section.  At this point the game just feels... Frusterating.  The length of your magic graple whip seems subjective, or perhaps it's just impossible to determine depth.  This leads to way too many undeserved deaths which can be especially tiresome in the last level.  It's an interesting platformer but definitely an aquired taste, read reviews before buying."
12643,"It's good until you get to the village with the blue people in it, kinda ruins the atmosphere.

I still recommend it tho."
12644,"what a great game that is !

Started out interesting. AMAZING controlls. Love it :D"
12645,"Terrible name, but a great game for any parkour lovers! Just wished this game could've gone on longer, but the length of the game is good for the ¬£2.99 I paid for it! Strongly recommend trying it out as a change instead of the other mainstream games out there, especially during a sale. 

The stroryline is fanastic with a great ending, I loved playing every minute."
12646,"Pros:
+Stunning environments
+Very nice soundtrack and sound design
+Gameplay starts out pretty great, solid controls

Cons:
-Very underwhelming story
-Some levels are quite tough to navigate (if you get lost, you'll be lost for 5-10 minutes just trying to figure out what or where you need to reach, which is weird considering how incredibly linear the game is)
-I expected more puzzles, and was instead treated with a lot of timing-based jumps and grapples that waste too much time before getting sent back to a checkpoint. This becomes tedious and frustrating near the end of the game
-Quite ugly and badly animated NPCs characters
-Very short, only 3-4 hours long

If you have nothing better to play, or want a short something to play on a rainy day, pick it up on a sale. Otherwise, your time and money are better spent elsewhere."
12647,"The most simple and rewarding game I have played in a long time. A well narrated story with a stunning design and great gameplay mechanics. I couldn't ask for more from an Indie title. Up there with the greats; super meat boy, Binding of Isaac, Braid etc..."
12648,"Mechanics are simple to understand.
puzzles are fun to solve.
parkour.
voice acting is superb.
story is fantastically well written.
level design is spot-on. 

Only problem with this game is that it is fairly short.
So although I enjoyed this game and recommend others to play it, I would highly advise any potential buyers to wait for some sort of discount before making the purchase."
12649,"[H1]Buy it on sale![/h1]

Watch the gameplay videos. If it looks like fun, buy it on sale beause you won't get more than a few hours out of this game. The gameplay is fun and there's a nice little story to go along with it as well, but it's short for a $13 game.

Snappy controls.
The framerate feels rock solid despite my aging computer struggling to keep it at 60 FPS. 45 FPS a lot yet no feeling of jutter at all. (Why cannot all games accomplish this?)
Interesting and varied gameplay.
Unlockable speedrunning afterwards."
12650,"Things this game is about;
-beautiful scenery
-creative/captivative
-jumping
-grappling
-rocketeering

Things this game also are;
-frustration
-""what thats an acheivement""
-""i need to go back again""
-""well !@#$""

10/10 wont try to go back for acheivements
11/10 going back for scenery"
12651,"Spiderman Simulator, more or less."
12652,"This game is a really good first person puzzle game with a fun and interesting storyline.

I finish the game in around 2.5 hours so it‚Äôs not too short or too long and the graphics are very pretty. I am very glad my friend recommended this game to me so I am doing the same for you.

I recommend this game 100% to all people that like puzzles or like a good storyline. 
"
12653,"This game is absolutly amazing!
The athmosphere is just right and the voice acting is perfect.
The gameplay is fast paced(if you want) and the grappling hook feels familiar to the grappling hook in other games (for example quake).

It took me about 4 hours to complete and i took my time to enjoy the game.
I really liked the shortness of the game, its a nice fit with the story.
Also a big plus is that you are sometimes give a ""hard"" and ""soft"" way, so you can play around with the hard way, but if you just want to progress you can also take the soft route, really nice level design overall!
I would love part 2! :)

Thanks for this game!"
12654,"Gone North Games proudly introduces us to their debut project A Story About My Uncle. An atmospheric first person puzzle platformer that will keep you engaged throughout.
[b]TL;DR at bottom[/b]

[b]Graphics[/b]
Jumping straight into the options menu you'll find it to be sparse. Resolution and VSync options are available and you also get an FoV slider. More advanced optons are absent and you're stuck with only two options for Detail Level. 'Medium' and 'High' and you also get a Texture Quality option. That's about it. 
However this does not mean the game isn't beautiful. Built on the Unreal Engine this game has one of the most amazing set pieces I've ever played in, with vast caverns and floating mountains.
 
[b]Audio & Music[/b]
Really not much to say. Voice acting was amazing. Ambience was spot on. And the soundtrack? Top notch and absolutely beautiful. Big props to Santiago Ferrero on such an amazing job. The OST really is the highlight of this game.

[b]Story[/b]
I won't spoil much. Basically you are the protagonist telling a bedtime story to your daughter about how you embarked on an adventure in a fantastical land on a journey to find your uncle. Total playtime was about 5 hours which felt a little short. Considering the amount of retries I had to do to complete a section of the game.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Gameplay consists of you using your grappling hook and long jumps to swing between platforms and ledges. You also get a pair of rocket boots which is awesome. Timing and reaction is incredibly important in the later stages of the game. As you embark on a journey to find your uncle you are taken through dark caverns, floating mountains and ice caves. Each stage is beautifully designed and nothing feel the same. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
A beautiful atmospheric puzzle platformer with and endearing story and amazing soundtrack this game is definitely worth your money if you dont mind the short gameplay time."
12655,"An excellent game that asks you to set your mind off to another dimension, really. This experience felt so soothing. The controls are responsive and the music is atmospheric.

I'd recommand this to anyone that feels like trying a whole new genre. I would best describe this as ''space parkour''. There's no one to kill in this game.

Only drawback is the lenght of this game which is very short."
12656,"the writing made me gag sometimes but the gameplay is so solid 
overall its pretty good"
12657,"An alltogether enjoyable game with fun gameplay, pretty graphics, cute characters and... well minimal story. Play it for the gameplay."
12658,"Amazing atmosphere, I can hear the wind blows through my ears when I was falling.
Nice story with strong empathy.
Beautiful music.
Some puzzles are little bit hard and not enough hint, but gain a lot of fun by overcoming them.
Overall is a very nice adventure game.

Just be careful if you have Acrophobia or 3D-Vertigo, you may feel uncomfortable during the game.

"
12659,"Man, just, play this game, it's fun, challenging, mezmerising in it's views and landscaoes, and the game as a whole just warms your heart and make you think about loved ones and death (or departure idk) in a very touching and sweet way.
This game has flaws, and it's only 4 hours long, but that's kind of irrelevant because it was just perfect in it's own way. If you like these type of games, I highly fucking recommend it. Enjoyd every second. :)"
12660,"reminds me alot of portal. great story, fun gameplay, beautiful artstyle. it has some refrences to movies an tv series. see if you can find the heisenberg note early in the game."
12661,I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle/adventure games. This game is very short I managed to complete it in under 2 hours but amazing little fun game.  And u kinda fell like spider man swinging around.
12662,"a fun 3d platformer useing a grapple device, and jump booster to move between platforms. has a ok story and is short."
12663,"There should be ""Fall X # of times"" Achievements. Then i'd be 100% satisfied."
12664,"This could have been a good game, but it wasn't. It starts out great - It's got stunning visuals, fun platforming action, passable narration and characters, and a story I actually kind of care about. The world opens up in a breathtaking way, and you start to get the sense that the most interesting part is just around the corner.

And then, there are the ice levels. Endless ice levels. You leave behind the stunning world of the early game for what seems like an eternity of drab, monotonous, completely visually homogeneous ice caves. The puzzles become increasingly frustrating and poorly planned out, the story development all but stops in its tracks, and any drive you may have had to finish the game dies, frozen to death in an infinitely tedious, perfectly homogeneous icy wasteland as you wonder: who thought it was a good idea to pad out the game's playtime with this absolutely meaningless garbage? Who thought it was okay to put such care into crafting an interesting and immersive early game only to ruin it with a sloppily cobbled-together grind of a late game? And will they ever be held responsible?"
12665,"Very fun and time trials are so hard
Probably buy on sale though its not very long"
12666,"The best thing I can say is, watch the trailer, if you love reversed-parkour and/or if you love the feeling of being free and swinging from rock to rock while hanging in the air, then get it, with or without a sale it's worth it.
And if you don't like parkour, get it anyway, because it still has a decent story, at least a better story than Twilight."
12667,"This game is a very good game for passing time, It's not long but it's really fun to play! Trust me."
12668,"Amazing game. The story is not overly complicated, it's just enough to get you hooked and evoke an emotional response. The visuals and atmosphere are great and the gameplay is one of the best I've seen in the last few years. Only downside is the length of the game, it leaves you wanting for just a bit more."
12669,Very beautiful game!
12670,"I have a lot of mixed feeling about this game.  On the one hand, I did have fun playing the game.  It is very unique, made by a small developer, and sold for a great low price.  However, much of the game feels like a missed opportunity.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Unique story and world, you won‚Äôt find anything else like it.
[*]Good premise.
[*]Good gameplay mechanics.  Ever thought you‚Äôd play a first person shooter without ever shooting?
[*]A short and sweet campaign.  I'm glad the developers didn't drag it out for too long.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]Graphics and sound feel like a lost opportunity.  They are really good in some areas but lacking in others.
[*]The story is really under-developed and the ending was just so anti-climatic.  The premise was good but the story could have been better.
[*]Some areas are really hard to figure out, and the checkpoint save system means you will do the same dumb 1-3 minutes over and over trying to get to the area that you are stuck at.  The save system works great 95% of the time and fails horribly 5% of the time.
[*]Supports high refresh rate, but no 144hz v-sync means you will burn up your GPU pushing frames."
12671,I played it up until there was a MLP reference. It was a good game until that point.
12672,"A different type of game. the gamplay was very fun however the story was a bit lacking, could be a good thing if you like simple stories, and the voice acting was good for an indie game. overall, 7/10."
12673,Fucking hell it was fast... literaly its all about momentum very nice you should all play this if you die alot or cock up like i did you can clock it at about 2 hours or so if you are exploring and shit maybe 4 or so hours and if you die little and do it vaary fast maybe less than an hour. Bloody brilliant game!
12674,wtf fred thats dangerous
12675,"This game has a really intriguing storyline, along with great game mechanics and good visuals!  It's well worth playing through!"
12676,One hour in and already hooked. This is a beautiful and easily missed gem. I'm glad I took the chance of giving it a try.
12677,"This game is neat. It stays true to its own title, as the game is a story about your uncle, told like a bedtime story. Fun grapple hook puzzle style gameplay with a neat short story. This game is perfect if you're looking for a shortish game to pass the time and don't want to get overly involved into a plot. The easter eggs in this game are a nice treat as well."
12678,"[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a linear platformer in which a man tells his daughter about the day he went to find his uncle Fred, who had been gone for a few months, but never gave any news.

[b]Story, game length and replayability[/b]

The game's story is interesting, and even though it's pretty short (according to steam, it took me 2.3 hours to finish the main story) and simple, you do want to understand what's going on in the very weird world the games takes place in. As stated above, the game is pretty short, but it does offer some hidden objects that give you access to new story elements and a race mode, which I haven't tried, but I personally don't feel like playing this game as fast as possible would be that fun.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The gameplay is pretty simple : hold right-click to charge up your suit, giving you a super jump on release or a leap if you're running and use left-click to grapple onto something. The way you make your way through the levels is prety unique and fun, but it does get boring fairly quickly. One thing that bothered me though is that you sometimes can't see the rocks you're gonna have to grapple to next, so you have to find them while in mid-air, which often end up in you falling to your death and feels a little bit frustrating since there's nothing you ould've done to avoid that death.

[b]Other considerations[/b]

The graphics in this game are pretty impressive. It isn't the most beautiful game ever, but it does look really good. The characters are well made and the environments are really beatiful, especially when you're not stuck in a cave (which sadlt isn't the case for a very bg portion of the game).

[b]Conclusion[/b]

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a pretty good game overall. I do recommend buying it, but I'd advise waiting for it to get on sale, mostly because it is pretty short. Next time you're home alone and don't know how to fill up your evening, you should definitely consider playing this. Finally, I highly recommend playing the whole game in a single session, as I feel like stopping halfway through it will break the immersion pretty bad."
12679,"Pros:The graphics are nice. and the story and the world and it's charecters are really fleshed out.the grapple feature is boss.
Cons:the grappling is not always acurate"
12680,"I could go for some better narration, but all in all a satisfying, fun game that makes you feel accomplished when you reach a platform. Cool mechanics, more of a child-oriented story. If this all sounds good to you, pick it up!"
12681,"A Story About My Uncle is a great platformer game that has nice adventure and an amazing storyline that keeps you interested. I kept finding myself coming back to this game becasue i was so interested in the story. This game surprised me with nice graphics and amazing dialouge to keep me intersted and to explore the levels and find the secrets.

++++++Pros
+Scenery
+Easy controls
+Storyline
+Puzzles weren't to challenging but made you think
+Time trials

--------Cons
-Character moldes weren't the best 
-Short storyline was hoping for more
-$12.99 to much

Overall I loved the game and I will keep going back to it but I will say this the price of the game is not right for the shortness of the story, so i would say pick this game up when its up on sale."
12682,I loved the story in this game but its sad that the game was too short.
12683,"I picked  up this game for around 4 dollars. I beat the game in three hours and it was quite enjoyable. I would recommend this game if you are looking for something new to try. Great game, but I don't think it's worth full price, pick it up on a sale. 8/10"
12684,"A Story About My Uncle, a wonderful 3D platformer with fun and exhilerating gameplay. I very much enjoyed this game that I got for my birthday, but it does have some flaws that hurt the immersion that makes the game so enjoyable.

Pros:
[list]
	[*]Gameplay is fun and moves at your own pace
	[*]The First Person View makes the flying through the air feel absolutely incredible
	[*]The environment textures are very good, making it feel like you're exploring real and awesome places
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
	[*]The gameplay is very challenging at times, but for the most part the difficulty curve is linear
	[*]The First Person View can make it extremely difficult to find where you need to go. (Sometimes your can't find where you need to go at all and have to take a leap of faith)
	[*]The textures for the people lie somewhere in the uncanny valley
	[*]The dialogue is bad. The english is awkward and the voice acting is off. It doesn't sound like real conversation. When people start talking it snaps you right out of the feeling of exploring. Thankfully it's a small part of the game
[/list]

Overall, it's fun, moves at your own place, and feels amazing. It has its fair share of problems, but the game is still lots of fun even with them present.

I would give it a 7.5/10"
12685,"The one game where i cared about the story..
Even though it's very short, it is truly amazing.
"
12686,"Great game!

It's a short one though, but otherwise really really great, especially if you like story driven atmospheric games."
12687,"An OK exploration jumping game with alot of restrictions. 

Can't skip long texts for some reason.
Often you are forced around one single path.
For a game revolving around jumping and timing you have little input in the ""jumps"". The only real input comes in timing the two other things. A mechanic I found frustrating since the game boils down to always trying to reach as far away as possible by guessing whats clickable/reachable.

For me this game falls short of it's true potential. Should have offered more different paths and exploration options. Still an OK game but not something to give 10/10. 

My vote is a weak 6/10."
12688,"Such a nice game! One minus though, its short."
12689,"A Story About My Uncle is a puzzle game, that takes place when a father tells a bedtime story to his daughter of the Adventures He went on to find his missing Uncle Fred, who was also a world travelling adventurer. The obstacles are not to difficult, you acquire a grappling hook and upgrades making it easier to traverse various terrains. As you work your way through different levels, the father narrates in the background. There are collectibles you can get and the game offers trading cards. It isn't a bad puzzle game."
12690,bruh get this game. youre basically spiderman and you give a frogchild thing a piggyback ride for like 75% of the game. its amazing 10/10
12691,"Excellent atmosphere and a creative world. That and the best first person movement system I've seen since Dishonored. The ending feels a little phoned in and the voice acting could be more convincing, but altogether this is a 4-5 hour experience nobody should miss out on."
12692,Such a great game. The only negative about it is that it was too short!
12693,Very addictive game and fun to play. Recommend it for people who have good hand eye coordination.
12694,"Very fun game time flew as i played.
*Keep in mind this game does have many points where you will keep failing and get enraged, But hey, thats what parkour games are about, right?"
12695,best story ever i see about lost placed
12696,This game is simple but fun to play.
12697,"I started this game when it first came out and made it about 2/3rds of the way through. I got stuck and frustrated because I was REALLY into the story and upset that I couldnt make it through one particular puzzle. I just recently decided to give it another go. It had been quite a long time since I played so I decided to start from the begining and I'm glad I did. I made it all the way through. Fantastic story, beautiful art style, easily mastered controls. Short but doesnt feel too short. Excellent game highly recommend if youre patient enough to get through the frustration of figuring out how to properly get through a jump. What is especially nice is the checkpoints after every jump (or two) so if you die you dont have to worry about starting the level all over again. 10/10"
12698,"First off this is a very good game, has a great story, but it was short (2 hours) 


                                                 9/10"
12699,"Someone has to say it: the voice acting in this game is terrible! On top of that, I fell off a cliff about 500 times because of terrible game design. It looks great, and the mechanic is fun for a little while but I can't recommend this to any one."
12700,"[h1] Review on A Story About My Uncle [/h1]

This is a great game for anyone looking for a short story (took me 2,5 hours to finish). 
The story is about you trying to find your uncle, and on the way wierd things happens. 
Keep in mind if you buy this game that it was made by a small student group in Sweden.

The voice acting is not too bad, could be better but once again made by a small student group.

Summery:
I know this was a short review but I dont have too mush to say about this game.
I dont think it's worth the 13 eruo for 2,5 hours story so go buy it somewhere else

Hope you found this helpful, if you did could you please upvote iy :D"
12701,A Story About My Uncle has some great gameplay and beautiful environments but It's a very short game. I beat this game in 2 hours and probably won't be replaying it for a while If I ever do because the only incentive to replay is to get some collectables. The Story was pretty boring but if you think about it and you can easily find the real meaning online it's not too bad. I would reccommend this game but only when it's on sale.
12702,"A great little game. Doesn't have that much in the way of story but makes up for it in gameplay. It reminds me very much of Spiderman 2's webslinging, and that's an itch that's been waiting years to be scratched. The environments are beautiful, the rocket boots are awesome, and there's plenty of secrets to find. The animations/voice acting can be a bit jenky at times and the models aren't that detailed, but that's the only issue I've had with the game. It's quite well produced for such a small team.

Buy if you like parkouring around giant environments, if you're looking for a long intricate plot-driven game this isn't it."
12703,"No game has ever made me write a review about it after finishing it, but my god this a wonderful game. I won't go into a whole lot about the pros and cons of the game since that has been done very thoroughly in the myriad of great reviews about the game, but I just needed to throw it out there that I haven't played a videogame in a long time that made me feel the feels that this one spurred on. It really is quite a gem and I recommend anyone with a few hours to kill and a desire to see a beautiful game from the aesthetic to the storyline to pick it up. Hell, even at full price it's just a bit pricier than a movie and probably a bit longer. I know I didn't regret it one bit."
12704,Great little game. Pleasntly surpised doesn't even cover it.  It's actually about the best exploration game I've played since the original tomb raider.
12705,"Excellent game in every aspect. To bad it's really short, would've like to play more:/"
12706,"I enjoyed this game. It is fairly short so keep that in mind in relation to the price its at (its been on sale a couple of times). Some of the leaps and jumps can get quite tricky and take a second to work out exactly where you need to go. you get rocket boots mid-game that help a lot and the grapple, jumping plus the boots let you approach the terrain in different ways. I'm pretty sure I got through some levels in ways the game creators never designed them to be traversed. It sort of felt like cheating at times but also satisfying that you could think outside the box.

This isn't an action game and there is nothing to kill. If you are looking for that, look elsewhere. This game is played as part of you(a Dad) telling his daughter a bed time story. I played at night so when you save and quit you/the Dad says ""it's getting late maybe we should continue tomorrow."" which had its own kind of immersion for me as he was right it was getting late.

The story is quite simple and it has a few unanswered questions but it ties the jumping sections together and serves well enough to weave an interesting tale. This won't make GOTY anytime soon but it is enjoyable and what it does it does really well."
12707,"For $5 maybe, but wth less than 2 hours and I'm completely done with the game. I found the Uncle and I was like OH now the game can really begin. And then it ended and I was like WTF. Good game overall. Terribly short."
12708,This game is actually really enjoyable and I was suprised at how elegant of a game it is.
12709,"This is a awesome game, first person and grappling hooks and a great storyline just adds to how much of a cool game this is! 9/10- Could have been longer"
12710,"Very fun game with a great story.

Only real negative I can come up with is that the voice screw up with their english a bit. English is not their first language and it comes out with a few awkward sentences. Otherwise, perfect game and well worth the pricetag, though it can be finished in 4-5 hours so its a bit short."
12711,Loved it!
12712,"This is a nice little game that i got in a bundle and i'm glad i decided to play it. It's not something that's going to blow up your mind, or keep u addicted for days. However it will be a good use for that extra hour when you have nothing to do...
The premiss is pretty good, the whole game is a story being told by a father to his daugther about his Uncle.

The major flaw about it's its lenght since you can finish it in 2 hours or less (this will affect the story aswell...)

Pros:

+ Nice Game
+ Nice mechanics
+ Nice development
+ Nice enviroment
Cons:

-Too short
- Story could be further explored
-It would benefit of more mechanics

Veredict: 6,5/10    (Buy it if it's on huge sales like 90% or at a price like 1-2‚Ç¨)

Would definitely all into the water again !

"
12713,"Fun gameplay, beautiful artwork and a good story. My only complaint about this game is that it's too short."
12714,I need more of this in my life.
12715,love this game
12716,"Okay, so I don't remember buying this game, it just showed up in my library for free, so I figured the least I could do to make up for that was write a review.

The story was short and sweet, with a good soundtrack to go along with it. The mechanics were solid and effective; actually, they were fun to use (for the most part), which surprised me a little bit. I can't say it's everything I would wanted from a game with grapple hooks, but I'm probably a bit more demanding than the average person when it comes to grapple mechanics. That being said, I still enjoyed using it, it felt like I was going exactly where I intended with very little practice, which is exactly what you want a movement mechanic to do.

But the thing that stands out most to me about this game is the purely beautiful landscapes. Everything is perfectly lit and the world feels almost magical. Also, they managed to make it obvious where you have to go without making it seem like there's only 1 way direction you can go. All in all I'd say the level design was top notch.

Unfortunately character animation wasn't amazing, and the voice acting wasn't perfect either, but that didn't take much away from the overall experience.

So, would I recommend you buy this game? I'm not sure, it would depend on the person. I wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't comfortable with first person controls, there's a decent amount of semi-fast-paced aiming that needs to be done. I also wouldn't recommend it to people who don't have a lot of expendable cash, because at $13 for 2.5 hours of gameplay there isn't much value to time spent.

But if you're comfortable with general FPS control and have enough spare money and are looking for a fun experience? I would definately recommend this game."
12717,"Beauty in videogames, in its most pure form."
12718,"If you enjoy repetition, dying over and over while you try to figure out where the hell you are supposed to go and pulling your hair out then this is the game for you! It's hard to tell where you are actually going to land and I died repeatedly just because I thought I was centered up over a ledge to find that I was just a little bit off. I stopped at the part where you have to figure out where to go while turning on lights, that go off soon after you turn them on, in a totally black cave thing and trying to find the ledge to stand on while simultaneously targetting the next place you are supposed to grapple to and find the next light source to turn on. Walked off of the path more times than I can count because YOU HAVE NO FEET to use to tell whether or not you are centered up on whatever it is that you are walking across. I don't mind trying something time and again if I know what I am supposed to do and I am failing at it but this game has no direction markers of any kind and I fell to my death more times than not because I ever so slightly walked off the edge of a small path no wider than a foot, respectively, based off of the size of the character's disembodied arm. 

I was exilerated at first, the high jumps, the strange world, the bright colors, all very fetching and then the game actually started.. I was quickly annoyed by the grapples to the little floating rocks and the lack of any way to know if you are close enough to grapple onto them or not. Not to mention on many occassions I went to a rock that I thooough was the next one in the succession but alas, no, it was not and seeing as I was out of charges with my grappling hook and it wouldn't recharge, because I had gone the wrong way, I was stuck there, forever.. or until I committed suicide or quit and repawned.

Undoubtedly I didn't make it all that far into the game but that's because within thirty minutes of dying over and over and over it was seriously trying my patience and I wanted to scream and throw my computer out the window. If you like an unfair challenge from a game that is too short, according to all the other reviews I have been reading, and mechanics that are rather clunky and unpolished then this is the one for you.

On a side note, I made a specific category just for this game, this game is the only one in the category and I have yet to find another that annoyed and frustrated me to the extent that this game did so I don't think it will be getting any company anytime soon, the name of this category is: WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK??????
That is all."
12719,"An interesting first-person platformer set in a really well designed world, with a somewhat unique mechanics and a nice background story. In a way it fits well with Portal and The Ball, but is different from both of them. Finishing the campaign will unlock extra stuff like time trials."
12720,"Made me cry, 10/10 because tears"
12721,"Beautiful...Awesome mechanics...pleasant story...just a little short, but definitely worth a go if you can get it at a discount.

[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31208751/]Please follow my Pixel Art Curation for other great games...[/url]"
12722,"The grappling hook version of Portal, with the same quality of depth, rich story, and extensive detail in the environment. A great game that i believe most people will like, both younger and older!
"
12723,"""Portal meets Mirror's Edge which a dash of Blackreach from Skyrim.""

A wonderful (although brief) game which causes the player to slow down and appreciate the scenery around them. The light storyline causes you to focus on creatively getting from point A to point B, enjoying the surrounding beauty along the way. 

I highly recommend pursuing the collectibles, as the unlocks you receive from every 5 you collect will bring more enjoyment (and a few laughs). 

My final advice is to wait for this game to go on sale, as ~6-8 hours of gameplay might not be worth $13 to the average gamer."
12724,"It's a wonderfull game! 
Loved everything in it.
It was better then i thought.
Thank's for making this game.
I will always remenber Uncle Fred <3"
12725,"the people who made this game have put so much time and effort into it im surprised it didnt get that much praise. it is definitly better than most games i play today
"
12726,"It's a short game.  I beat it in about 3 hours.  It was a lot of fun though and at times very daunting.  I could see rage quitting often, but I pushed through and just had some sore fingers to show for it.

The voice acting is a step above average.  The ending was a little anti-climactic, but good none-the-less.  There's a lot of detail in certain areas where you get to zoom while looking around.  That was fun.

Full price for the game is steep for how short it is.   Wait for at least half off."
12727,Absolutely amazing. And a real surprise.
12728,"This game is 2 hard 4 me (*Ôºæ‚ñΩÔºæ)Ôºè 

almost 2 hours in and my achievement progress is at.. 0/15 WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE AHAHAHA ahahah.. ahah... *cries*

The story is interesting and the environment is really pretty (: 

Give it a try,folks. You'll like it if you like relaxing to a game while enjoying your hot chocolate. 

Or beautiful chocolate. Whatever it wants to be called."
12729,"eh, pretty graphics, strange mechanics, little clumbsy, but has a card set and alreught for some casual play."
12730,FUN. Weeeeeee soaring through the air.
12731,I enjoyed this game alot. It's very different and easy to get use to. One of the best FP games i have ever played.
12732,"I've had it. This game p[b][/b]issed me off.

In first impressions, A Story About My Uncle is an absolutely beautiful looking game with really solid mechanics that add together to make a wonderful game to play, and it lives up to that moniker as ""a wonderful game to play"".

The visuals look absolutely stunning and the game is a whole boat-ton of fun to play through. If you ever screwed around with +hook in Quake servers, or even the unreleased official Q3A grappling hook, then you'll be right at home. This is an entire, single-player campaign video game based around such a Quake-style grappling device. To back it up, the player is equipped with a ""super jump"", that allows him to bound across long gaps or up large heights, and later recieves a pair of rocket boots that allow you to shoot through the sky letting you traverse even further distances without grip. This is probably the updates the game has recieved talking, but unlike many reviewers I never ran into an instance where the platforming solution I chose dissallowed me from continuing. If a solution was wrong, it was extremely obvious. You could even game with platforms that weren't meant to be landed on to recharge grapples. (You get 3 grapples per jump, but it builds you up to that point throughout the first level.)

A quick note on the level design: There are a few ""waiting puzzles"" were you have to time your grapples to when a rock comes to you to use the momentum to your advantage, but these disappear pretty quickly. Later puzzles with moving parts have enough grapple points to be more like ""momentum puzzles."" Otherwise, the level design and gameplay is nearly flawless.

[b]This all works together to make one of the most fun video games I've played in a long time.[/b] That's why I kept playing the levels, over and over again, looking for unlockables and seeing if I could 100% it plus achievements. It's [i]so fun[/i] to play.

Hope you've girded your loins, because that's all the praise this game is getting. I'm really not sure how to begin this next paragraph, so let's right out say it.

[b]The story is shit. It's garbage. Tripe. It's so bad it made me [i]angry.[/i][/b] This is truly ironic for a video game where ""story"" is the title's first non-article word. It's practically painful. The story follows an unnamed protagonist who visits his uncle's house one day after a long time with no contact. Inside, he finds a powered suit and launch pad that send him to another planet with mysterious flora and strange inhabitants as he searches for his missing relative. This is told through the framing device of our protagonist in his old age telling the story back to his daughter as best as he can remember it.

There's nothing to examine here. He's looking for his uncle. Nothing will stop him. That's the whole story. The sheer simplicity of the [i]actual[/i] story here makes all the attempts the game makes at detailing itself and making itself coherent moot. When it does attempt it, the game falls flat on its face.

For example, there's a very big bit about an outcasted group called ""The Strays"" who either left or were banished from a village encountered early in the game. Much later, you finally get the chance to meet some strays. You say hi, your NPC friend exchanges some banter, and then you leave. [b]You only meet one other stray afterwards and nothing ever comes from these three NAMED characters.[/b]

There's a language The Strays have, and it's 1:1 to the English language. Translating them explains nothing. Only jokes and pointless phrases that are so generic they could've been fit anywhere else in the game at any time.

The voice acting is shoddy. Nobody seems to have put any effort into saying their lines beyond the intensity I would expect from an Edutainment game from the early 2000s. The best actor plays Fred, who only appears at the end of the game for a grand total of one scene.

Elements are introduced and then are not explained. The writing is so terribly written that it really shines how terribly plot-holey it is, not to mention the dated memes peppered about here and there. (20% Cooler, anyone?) There's so much that didn't give me any sort of closure. [url=http://md.osuv.de/OQBwF]Take a look at this list (spoilers) for things the game never explains. It's so big it was taking up more of my review than Steam would allow.[/url]

And that's just coming off the top of my head. I wouldn't doubt there's a ton of other inconsistencies and confusing instances one could come up with as to the quality of the game.

There are sets of unlockables, 5 per level, that add little jokes to how you play the game. There's a ""Goat Mode"" which makes the character's grapple beam be a Goat Simulator-style Tongue, and make the character spout annoying Goat noises whenever you do anything. Did you laugh when I mention that? I didn't think so. The only unlockable worth anything is ""Beam Color"", which you obtain after 10 unlockables. After that it's just the unfunny Goat Mode, Midas Mode, which is kind of cool, but makes it hard to identify things like Power Crystals when swinging since they turn Gold instantly and stop glowing, and Acrobatics mode, that makes your camera swing around wildly when you jump, making the game completely unplayable. [b]That's the big all-secret-machines-collected unlockable: making the game unplayable.[/b]

My last complaint about the game is the inconsistent animation. It looks like the budget ran out about half-way into the game. Everybody all of a sudden moves so stiffly and expresses only basic emotion in their face, when in Maddie's first appearance she has lively facial expressions and body movement that really brings across any sort of emotion. Maddie herself is an annoying little brat, but her animation was stellar. Suddenly the quality dropped off the face of the earth for everyone. What happened? The modeling is pretty bad too: Even on highest detail settings, Maddie's face (amongst all the other frog people) looks disgusting.

So, verdict: The game is an absolute [i]joy[/i] to play. However, it is too short and WAY too poorly written to really make it a game I would reccomend. If a modding community can spring up and create a series of awesome levels to go along with the game, I'd probably recommend it. But A Story About My Uncle itself is not a very good video game. I can't reccommend it in good judgement."
12733,"A first person platform where you explore an gorgeous imaginary underworld with super jumps, boosts and grappling hooks? Well kind sir, you just found it! 
Plus, you get a charming story with funny and somewhat scary looking ""frogs"". Worth it, all of the 2 and half hours of gameplay."
12734,"Nice, short, atmospheric platformer that tells a bed time story. This one took me less than three hours to play through, but it has challenges and hidden content so it kind of calls for another go? Graphically the game suits the story, even though the characters sometimes look a bit too sketchy. From time to time, the game can also surprise you with tough puzzles!

I liked the game, but for the full price (12,99‚Ç¨) it is a bit too expensive. Grabbed it from a bundle."

quite diffrent from what i've played so far, but thats a good thing. 
it may be on the short side 3.8 hours with qute a bit of falling, and reseting. 
But i loved the scenery in a lot of places as well."
12737,"I have never said ""What the ****?"" in so many different ways before.

In all honesty, one of the best games I have every played. The controls are smooth, it isn't confusing and it just plays well. Story-telling is where this game shines. 

10/10."
12738,"Well spent money, incredibly fun, nice graphics and an extremely hard adventure game. You grapple thru the world trying to survive, and it's like you're getting into the game even tho you're not. It feels so real in some ways. The story is really great, but very sad in many ways. He never met his uncle again.. But he was surely a good guy! 

Well spent 12,99‚Ç¨.
Haven't finished the game yet, because I'm at the part where blocks are falling, see picture #1 here on the store page. Extremely hard in my opinion. I can't handle it without getting a bad vibe thru meself. I think I need vodka for the last part of it to be more relaxed. ^_^"
12739,"OK if only on sale and youre a huge fan of  first person platformers.
Otherwise, look forward to a pretty frustrating and linear game without much of a payoff at the end."
12740,Great game as all games with grappling hooks are.  Good short length. Only a couple of annoying loose physics parts.
12741,Really good game a must try!
12742,Abandonment Issues: The Game
12743,"Alright, I'm re-writing this review after having replayed it some years later. Honestly, this might me one of my [b]favourite games ever.[/b] 

Not only does it have very satisfying momentum based grappling-and platforming mechanics, but the story dude... The frickin' story. 
It's very short, very simple, but very raw and honest. Every time I think back to steps you take in this, the journey you go on, something about it just tugs at your heartstrings man.

This game is a 2-3 hour journey, I promise you won't forget.
I'll quote myself from my old review: [b]""One of the best books I've played in a long time""[/b] - [i]Me, 2015[/i]"
12744,The atmosphere and story of this game is cute.
12745,"This is a very... fun game. I'd buy it just for the gameplay alone. It's unique and challenging, albeit repetetive if you view it that way, although it never got boring while I was playing. 

The story is interesting and engaging while playing, although the ending is a little cliche and subpar. Still, the gameplay overshadows this."
12746,"Short but sweet, just like this review."
12747,"Great and creative puzzler. Charming story, good mechanics, nice looking. No complaints, definitely a must-have for puzzle lovers"
12748,"Great game, I can't guarantee u how many times u can die in this game..."
12749,"A Story About My Uncle is a decent game if at all.  

[u]Pros[/u]
-Fun gameplay mechanics
-Nice environments

[u]Cons[/u]
-Some of the dullest voice acting
-A really weird and not very interesting story

[i]Summery of my Thoughts[/i]

A lot of people seem to wanna say that the story is good.  I personally don't think there's much here.  It's kind of painted like a children's story, which, I know that's kind of the point, but it's hinted at that it's based off of his actual experience.  The dull narration doesn't help, especially where he replaces his own words with his narration.  You can hear the voice actor try to get into the script in some parts, but you can't really feel much there for the most part.

Now, why would I ever suggest this game?  Well I'd say it's a nice game to try if you have the money or see it on sale like I did.  5 dollars for 2-4 hours of pure fun was pretty nice to actually see in a game, and when I say fun I mean that type of fun you get from enjoying the game mechanics.  Being able to zoom around and trying to not fall to your death is a simple idea for a game but this game does throw in some nice ways to get around.  There's no ground breaking puzzles, or anything like that.  The environment did look pretty nice, too, and that's all that really mattered.  There was just one or two frustrating parts from time to time because a level or two might have been glitched and never patched.  Otherwise, solid gameplay.

One day, I'd like to see some DLC for levels because I really liked zooming around and all but the game is a bit short.  Like I said:  only 2-4 hours of gameplay and that 4th hour is really pushing it.  If you can get past dull narration and an odd story though, then I'd really recommend trying this game."
12750,Fun game a bit short.
12751,A fun and enjoyable game if a bit short. I would reccomend this game to anyone.
12752,"Fun for like 20 minutes, then the awful mechanics and HORRIBLE voice acting get to you.

2/10 at least they kinda tried I think"
12753,"TL;DR
This is what Narbacular drop is to Portal. A good idea just waiting for somebody to make it great. Get it for the idea and experience, nothing else.

Longer review
This is indie as it gets. Visually different, story is a interesting, the mechanics are wonderfull....but thats it, there is no real hook to the game. I mean, there is a point to the game, but I personaly found that this should be played in 15-30 min bursts max, as it just gets repetative and boring.

The main issues I have with this game are:

Direction. you will wonder where to go many times and quit the game because of that, as many many times, the path just wont be obvious.

Mechanics. They are a great idea, I love them, but the execution is really lacking and could use a few more features, most importantly, better physics, as that would solve 90% of the issues I have with thegame, as the current way is ok in the begining, but is just too basic to use in the later stages.

These are the 2 main reasons this game is not a hit, but they are a relativelysimple thing to fix, as everything else is there.

But, despite all that, I will recommend the game simply on the basis, that these mechanics ned more work being put into them and in a different game."
12754,"Amazing narrative and nice gameplay. If you like indie games with good storytelling, make sure you don't miss this one!"
12755,I got this game as part of a humble bundle. I really enjoyed the game. It's a narrative driven patformer. The only thing that disappointed me about the game was how short it was but I did enjoy completing it.
12756,"I bought this because I liked the idea of what the developers were making.  Grappling hooks? Hell yes! The first half lived up to my expectations and provided a fun experience.  The second half had me fighting against the controls so often that it became incredibly frustrating.  This could very easily be my own fault, but I don't think it was.  There were times I would grapple down onto a flat surface and then after touchdown, it would still fling me so far off the surface and to my death setting me back.  It wasn't just once or twice either.  It's annoying knowing you're doing things correctly but being punished anyway.

In spite of that, I enjoyed the idea of the game and definitely had some fun with it.  If you find yourself getting incredibly frustrated in the second half, it probably won't get better so you need to make the call whether or not to keep playing."
12757,"           One of the best overlooked games that I have ever played, an excellent way to spend your time!

12758,"I don't think I've ever written a Review about a Game on Steam, but this Game just deserves it. Got it with the Humble Bundle, installed it with a ""Meh"" on my face thinking 'i need something to do man', got the ride of the year. Its just one of those Gems you find by accident, and then never forget. Brilliant game, Brilliant Plot, fun to play even for noobs like me."
12759,"""A story about my Uncle"" is a sweet tale about a man telling his daughter about his Uncle Fred and the adventure he went on to find him, a beautiful and colourful story, but the puzzle can be hard since you have to aim and swing yourself pretty perfect to land correctly.

It's a short game with about 2.5 - 3 hours game time for the story, but there are unlockables to increase the game time, but for 13 euro vaule isn't that great. I would recommend picking this game up at a sale and enjoy the world that had been created within it.

4 / 5 score the only down side is the short gameplay and the frustration with some puzzles"
12760,A quick fun game. Its mostly story driven with some easy traversing puzzles. I enjoyed it but if your looking for a real challenge I wouldnt recommend it.
12761,"I wasn't too sure what this game would be like when I first played it. I had bought it based off of a youtube video and the grappling mechanics. Just finished the game and I've got to say I am very surprised. I genuinely enjoyed this game and it was refreshing to play something different to what I usually play. 

The game isn't overly long and I got through it in about 2 hours but I feel like I got my moneys worth in terms of the enjoyment I got out of the game. The mechanics of the game are rather simple but it can get challenging in places."
12762,"Very nice game! It really feels like you are in the story, Sadly it takes around 2 hours to complete! 
7/10"
12763,"Ger√ßekten ho≈ü bir oyun. Bir film izlemi≈ü, g√ºzel bir hikaye okumu≈ü gibi oluyorsunuz bitirdiƒüinizde. Tavsiye ederim."
12764,"Fantastic!. kinda short, but it tries to make up for it with speed trails. Amazing atmoshpere. Pick it up on sell."
12765,"Beginning is a bit boring, but gets good later."
12766,"I see people writing these long reviews about this game, but I don't feel like writing a long one. I just played through the story and I have only one thing to say: I-LOVED-IT! This is one of the best short story-game I have ever played. In my opinion it beats ""The Stanley Parable"" even though there are more options in The Stanley Parable. I think this game is fantastic and you still get the feeling of freedom even though you have to follow the story. Who doesn't love flying through the air with a magical suit? I recommend this game for any age and you should try it out even if you don't like platformer games. This didn't feel just like a platformer game, this felt like a story too!

10/10 - My favorite shortstory/platform game yet!"
12767,"It's a good night fairytale in videogame form. It's a lovely game, I totally reccomend it.
E' una favola della buonanotte in formato videoludico, da giocare!"
12768,Beautiful game but can get lost sometimes
12769,"A first person platformer in a rich and beautiful world. The gameplay is very smooth and you'll quickly learn to use your jumps, grappling hook and rocket boots to get around the world. Story is quite good aswell and combined with the gameplay it makes for a very enjoyable experience. The only flaw is that it is quite short and not that hard, great game nonetheless."
12770,"i Usually don't play Indie games, but this one daaaamn, took my heart with storm, beautiful game, the contrast. i absolutely love it, will play again 10/10

This is a story about a boy who searches for his lost uncle and ends up in a world he couldn't imagine existed. The game focuses heavily on a grappling hook-mechanic that gives the player a wonderful sense of speed and freedom. The player can also use various types of jumps and leaps. An early assignment was also to write a deep and engaging story that the player would like to immerse himself into."
12771,"Great game! Im sad it was so short! The mechanics are really cool, you feel like spiderman racing through the air. The story was also great."
12772,"Surprisingly cute, simply enjoyable."
12773,feels like i'm playing portal while i'm actually spiderman in a tron suit
12774,"WOW, got this from  recent humble bundle. I new it would be great, and I love this fps platforming gameplay but this is better than that. for any body who loves source surfing, rocket jumping in tf2, or straitgh up super fluid gameplay, and a mysterious and strange story, this is a must buy.



gameplay: fluid, creates a complex puzzles and jumps through simple mechanics. keeps adding things so it alwalys feels a sense of cwonder
Story: afterrit ended I wish there was some more closure.super engageing through out the run time though. LOTS of small hidden detials.
Music: sound, KAPPA
Athstetics: SO BEUTIFUL OMIGODDDD REKT

"
12775,"That was a fantastic game, good simple gameplay elements used in a challenging yet entertainingly intuitive progress through a well pased short story of a game. 

The story progresses quite well and, while it is a linear game you still have this sense of adventure many games seem to lack these days."
12776,"[h1]Is it worth your money?[/h1]
It's short but beautiful, so wait for at least 50% off. I reccommend it on half the value max.

[h1]When to buy it?[/h1]
If you're from better earning countries like US/Germany/Norway: At 50% off.
If you consider yourself poor or you're from Poland/Mexico/Whatever: At 75% off.
Game took me ~4 hours."
12777,Truly amazing game. I really enjoyed playing it.Story is amazing the concept is amazing.Only one con that it is way to short..
12778,"Half a day of adventure, time well spent. Just this game alone made the Humble Bundle worth it!

For those who fantasize about becoming spiderman, here's your chance! 

The difficulty of the puzzles were just right, tough without becoming too frustrating or tedious. The checkpoints system is well done, at least you don't have to start from the beginning of the level when you fail, and failing doesn't make you feel bad, just try again."
12779,the voice acting is worse than heavy rain
12780,"This is a great first person adventure game in which you run, fly and grapple yourself trough a variety of different levels.

Overall a solid platformer. I would reccomend grabbing it when it's on sale.

8.5/10 would burst through the air again"
12781,"I saw this game in a pack and that was the main reason I bought it on Humble Bundle. The gameplay looked beautiful and the puzzles challenging enough to be enjoyable and not frustrating, and let me tell you, this game delievered. Occasionally I would get annoyed when I kept doing the wrong thing to get up to the next platform or stage of a level, but the pathways are always well marked by the grappling icons. The levels are beautifully crafted and the story so much more interesting than just a boy looking for his uncle, and there are even a few Easter Eggs hidden throughout. I don't know if I would recommend it for $13 because of the length but on a sale this is most definitely worth picking up."
12782,A really cute little game
12783,"beautiful

10/10"
12784,Love the game. Love the story so far. I have not completed it but i love it so far. It is a fun game and worth the money.
12785,"I loved this game overall. The story was entertaining although not brilliant, gameplay for me was mostly fun.

However if like myself you tend to suck at precise timing/fast reaction sequences then there are one or two areas in the game that make you want to break things. :P However even though I really do suck at fast/precise reactions I managed to get through it all anyway, so it's not really that bad. For me personally Mirror's Edge was way worse in that regard. :P

Aside from that my only real complaint is that there are some areas which are rather dark and where I did not find it entirely clear where I was supposed to go next.

Gameplay is rather short for the listed price, though I didn't acquire it at that price so for me that was not an issue. Would be worth placing in your wishlist and waiting for a special if you're short on the green stuff."
12786,"This game is so much fun! Beautiful scenery and not too hard.
A pity that it is so short..."
12787,"Running, jumping and grappling from platform to platform so fast while humming Indiana Jones theme song.
Missing a platform and screaming NOOO!! as I fall into the abyss.
10/10 would Indiana Jones again."
12788,"Amazing storyline, great physics and gameplay, great optimization. I r8 9/9"
12789,"Pretty well written story, I felt the emotion even though there was little happening. 

I enjoyed the puzzle/platformering mechanics of this game and it progressed logically and didn't seem to get stale. There were no parts where I felt ""Now I've got to do this for another x hours."" It kept advancing and held my interest.

The game is short, the story doesn't really have a logical conclusion, although I still liked it.

This is basically what Dark Void should have been all those years ago. 

8/10"
12790,Good story with amazing visuals
12791,"Total 3 hours, that felt like 10 or 20, but in a really good meaning.
I wish this game never end. This game is like a really good book.
I enjoyed it really much, well... sometimes I was getting frustrated that
I wasn't able to jump high enough there were 3 places like that.
Narrator did a really great job, and sounds and music were awesome.
I am recommending this game to anyone who like Athmosferic games or Spiderman XD

REALLY REALLY GOOOOD JOB!!!!"
12792,"Great story, unique puzzles, beautiful game."
12793,"2 hours long, boring, and easy."
12794,Short game but really good! beautiful landscapes that you get to jump around. I would recommend getting this on a sale but getting it for sure
12795,Good magic stuff.
12796,"This game was visually great, the controls were very smooth, however it only took me 2 hours to beat on my first shot.  The storyline was pretty weak but it was entertaining enough.  I definitely would not pay full price for this game, I picked it up in a humble bundle with 8 other games."
12797,great game and story i wish they would do another one
12798,loved it
12799,"A short, but fun, first-person platformer.

It's a free-running game, basically, with a few extra tools for more mobility. You move fast and smoothly and when you can pull of the jumps it all feels really good, and when you don't it reloads you quickly with no loading time to speak of and lets you try again - which is what you want from a game like this. It's also a very pretty game, and the music is, if not exactly inspired, a pleasant ambiance.

The only major problem is that it IS short - I finished it in about two and a half hours, but for a game like this I don't think you want it to be too long."
12800,"Hey... anyone else catch the reference main character makes to Rainbow Dash? It's pretty obscure, but it's there... Nice job devs, I never expected a game like this to directly reference MLP. Oh yeah, and I really like the game, really unique for a first-person game. Fantastic story (Maddie is adorable) and the mouths actually sync with what the characters are saying! AAA games can't even do that. Maybe a little overpriced, but totally worth the buy if it's on sale. You won't be disappointed playing this game. For me, I was interested throughout the whole story, and the ending was beautiful, the even if you don't like the game, that ending was so sweet that it makes up for any problems i may have had with the game"
12801,"Looks great.
Plays great.
The story is great.
Provides 3-4 hours of fun."
12802,"This platformer has a beutiful story. I was wrapped up just like the narrator's daughter was. I am bummed it was only about 3 hours of gameplay, but there is also the option of Level Select, and Time Trials for longer play. There are unlockables for finding hidden seismograph looking things which is pretty neat."
12803,"Can I just say one thing about this game? It is B-E-A-utiful. Has a great narrative and story plus stunning visuals and an awesome soundtrack and well you have an amazing game. The controlls are stellar and the gameplay is smooth. I got this game in Humble Bundle and to tell you the truth I would have happily payed $12 for this game. A moving piece of art,"
12804,I loved this game! The environment and gameplay was so beautiful and stimulating. I admit there were points where I got frustrated and didn't know how to progress but that's because I'm an idiot and luckily my girlfriend was beside me telling me where to go. It had a very engaging storyline and I highly suggest playing this game.
12805,"Excellent game, good mechanics, not buggy. It's a shame it was so short."
12806,"Cautious recommendation.
It's a Portal-ish platform puzzler, with basically a grappling hook instead of a portal gun.
The grapple mechanics are great fun, until the final area, where the difficulty level goes off the charts. It becomes frustrating instead of fun."
12807,"I enjoyed this game when I'm not crying over not being able to jump on rocks

A Story About My Uncle is a First Person Puzzle Platformer made by the Makers of Goat Simulator. It took me about 4 hours to beat. The gameplay sort of like Mirror's Edge meets Portal, but it's still unique with it's grappling glove and rocket boots and the Scenery is beautiful. Basically the game is about the Narrator telling his Daughter about the time he went to find his lost Uncle as a teenager. I wouldn't want to spoil the rest of the game because it is definitely worth the buy especially if on sale which I got for 3.74 USD

All in All: Shit was Cash"

+ Awesome story
+ Awesome graphics
+ Awesome EVERYTHING

- Short story

11/10 IGN"
12809,"Pretty short for a game, pretty long for a bedtime story,

but still an epic story. Beautyfull graphics and scenery!


10/10"
12810,"You mostly just jump over and over and yeah, that's kind of boring."
12811,"Amazing game, a little too short for my liking though; only two hours long, but it is worth the price. The story is enthralling and the platforming mechanics are flawless other than few rocks I fell through but that was only a few times. This is the best platformer I have played to date and I don't think that will change soon. Oh, and a My Little Pony reference.      
9.5/10. Too short but worth the price tenfold"
12812,"I... I can't explain how much I like this game. The story is... is just amazing. The gameplay is feels so unique, the world what we need to explore is beautiful. I don't want to talk more about this game, buy it and play it, you won't regret it!"
12813,I wish all games were this good
12814,"Actually I really liked this game. If it weren't for the stupid frustration you'll get if you're not able to pass one part of a level after nearly 30 tries. The story, as much as I played it, is wonderfull and nicely presented. If youre a pro in this kind of game. Play it and enjoy it. What the game needs is some way to built a bridge over the parts frustrating for the player. Methorically. Otherwise the tendence to rage quit is larger than the acutal interest in the story. 
Sorry. But that destroyed the fun for me."
12815,"This is certainly one of favorite games of all time. The graphics, though they may not be the most realistic, are beautiful and fits the game perfectly. The story line and game play are amazing and the sound is great. Overall a great game. It is a must buy, well worth the ¬£10!"
12816,"Beautiful game, Short but wonderful story, isnt too hard but it does give a small challenge and has time trials to beat. Would definitely reccomend this game"
12817,"A Story About My Uncle is beautifully crafted game with an actual story which is good. Graphicwise, the game is very good and the platforms as well as backgrounds look convincing enough. Gameplaywise, the game is good. The mechanisms for the jumping, grappling, rocket boostings, etc are all very good. Sometimes they may feel a little insensitive though which is something that I noticed when I was playing. The story is compelling and has pretty good voice actors contributing to the atmosphere and the music fits well. The whole game itself is short enough to beat in one sitting. It will take around 2-4 hours on average but there are extras such as time trials. Overall very good game.

Rating: 9.1/10"
12818,"""I don't know how to describe the feeling of bursting through the air, like a bullet."" -Main character who's name I still don't know
Story
The Story is good, when I say good, I mean it. Not gonna spoil it for you though. 8/10
Visuals
The visuals in this game are beautiful, it's eye candy, with motion blur it's even better, every detail is well made (not very much of those details though), and it just makes you want to explore more and more, see alot of these new undiscovered lands. 9.5/10
Audio
The voice acting is perfect, the music they put on, is just perfectly set on the moment when you discover something new. 9/10
Summary
It's a great game, better grab it during a sale, but it's still worth every penny of the full price. With great visuals, story, audio, but little lack of details and love I give it a nice little 9/10"
12819,"This game is awesome! Reminds me a lot of Portal games. 
Puzzle like action game. Super fun, trying to figure out all the correct routes."
12820,"This game is such an experience. It's plot and playtime is short, but you enjoy the most out of it, and that's what makes it so special, not to mention that most of the time, it gives you the feeling that you can do whatever you want, given the game mechanics. Jumping here, grappling there, falling +500 feet without fall damage. 10/10 would re-play 10 times"
12821,"A freaking masterpiece

With the exception of the NPC models it the visuals are stunning. It is one of the most fun I've had in a game in a while.

If you still have the chance go and get it from the Humble Bundle. If not it is 100% worth the $13."

First; I found it kind of a short game ( even tho, if it was longer it would have started becoming a bit repetitive ) and the ending ; [spoiler]It was a bit of a turn down , makes our adventure a little meaningless... well, i actually may be saying that cuz it was a sad ending and i didnt like that Uncle Fred decided to stay after all [/spoiler]
but still.. 
Highly recommended üëç"
12823,Great game with amusing gameplay and extraordinary story. I wish the plot was a bit more extensive because less than 3h is not enough :(
12824,"I will make my review pretty simple: It's awesome. For real. Buy it now.

The stunning graphics mixed with some great plot easily makes this game climb up to my top 10 list. If there's anything negative to it, it would be the length of the game. 
I got it in a Humble Bundle, so I can't argue for the price I gave."
12825,"Just like every mario game out there - starts out cool and relaxing, then gets annoying and frustrating as hell, however I clearly did enjoy it despite me having to repeat some parts for maaany times. Would recommend as there aren't many similiar games out there."
12826,"Platforming is good fun, despite the first person perspective. 
Sleepy bed-time story narration is a welcome plus, lending to the laid back atmosphere (for the most part). 
Some entirely unsettling characters to behold, which I believe are intended to be cute. 
Short. Short short short. Might want to pinch those pennies till it's a little cheaper, to better justify the sparse amount of hours you'll invest."
12827,amazing game and atmospheric
12828,"Amazing story, awesome gameplay, beautiful world & atmosphere. All of these futures you can find in this game. Don't expect a long story, but believe me, it will definitely worth your money.

Check out my channel, to find a full gameplay.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnptJcpeO8cQIrbRgaAamA

But first, you must buy the game & play it on your own. This is the only way to achieve a full experiece of the game."
12829,"This is by far one of the best games i have played in a long time. The gameplay is so addicting and unique, the story gets you caught up from the very first moment. You wont regret it. 
But what i also like is how challenging it is. Even though it took me 3 hours to complete, i know i wont stop there. There are far more challenges and unlockables to offer at least 25-30 more hours if you do well. 
10/10 would fall down again"
12830,"This game reminds me of my Uncle, my Uncle Rolf
I used to show the counsellor on the doll where Uncle Rolf touched me 

I rate this game 10 out of 10 purely for how my Uncle used to make me feel
"
12831,10/10 made me feel like spiderman.
12832,"I wish there was a sideways thumb, because that's how I feel. The gameplay was super fun, but the game was two hours long! Really, come on if they had just put a little more into it, it would have been longer, it wouldn't have take taken much more. In the end I suggest you buy the game because it's pretty and fun, but get it cheap.

EDIT: It was two and a half hours.

ANOTHER EDIT: I just figured out that there is a time trial mode, all previous criticisms are completely void, buy the game full price, finish it in a few hours, and put too many hours in the time trial mode."
12833,"Great game, more than worth the price."
12834,"i have no words. Story - heartbreaking , music - awesome , graphic - 0.0 ... world , don't wanna even talk about it.. i have no worlds like i said .. i wish there is more games like this .."
12835,"Everything about this game is just [i]almost[/i] great. The story is [i]almost[/i] interesting, but suffers from weird pacing, lack of meaningful payoff, and awkward english, both in the writing and voice acting. The graphics and enviroments are [i]almost[/i] beautiful, but small map sizes and lack of interesting architechture hamper what could have been a much more visually interesting experience. The gameplay is [i]almost[/i] perfect, if only aiming weren't such a massive source of frustration. Overall, in every single aspect of this game you can totally see what they were going for, and see exactly how it falls flat. Even though the gameplay is mostly well-constructed and introduces new mechanics at a steady rate, the game is just too short to really feel the satisfaction of mastering it. The constant feeling of inadequacy will most likely hamper most people's enjoyment of this game, even if they're just playing for the gameplay."
12836,"One of the best games I have ever played. The story is amazing, the visuals are stunning, overall a beautiful game."
12837,"So i'm gunna start out by saying the game is definitely very short, so if you're looking for a game to sink hundreds of hours to, this game isnt for you. Beyond that, the game is quite a relaxing and enjoyable ordeal. The story is pretty straightforward, a boy looking for his uncle, who has left him a suit with the means to do so. While the game isnt overly difficult, the mechanism it gives you for its puzzles is a nice addition to physics/momentum based gaming. There is also a time trial mode for any players who wish to hone their skills and race against the clock. 

Overall I enjoyed A Story About My Uncle, but it does feel like the gaming mechanisms have so much more to offer than can be utilised in such a short game. I do still recommend picking this game up, although if you dont feel a couple of hours gameplay is worth the price, you can always wait for it to be on sale."
12838,"This game can only be described in one word:

Breathtaking

If you like these adventure platformers be sure to check this one out. The game is not very long and it doesn't need to be. Take it from me: you will not regret buying this."
12839,"Lovely story. The game until where I played it for now is pretty easy, I mean everyone fails a while probably but the story is so lovely."
12840,"Bit short, but worth it as a part of a Humble Bundle.
Great game for an afternoon. Achievement hunting could make the game a bit longer."
12841,"Don't usually expect little indie games like this to ever be any good, but this was a really nice excpetion. Pretty cool grappling hook type mechanics, beatiful world building and levels, neat little story that is well told and decently voice acting. Reminds you of when you was little and would be told a crazy bed time story by a family member, it really grasps that sense of wonderment and awe from back then. Really glad I decided to install and play this game, it might have been short, but it won't be forgotten any time soon."
12842,8/8 was gr8 m8
12843,"Wonderful game. Touching story, great visual style, and surprisingly not annoying trial-and-error gameplay. Pretty short, however."
12844,"Fantastic grafics!!!! Smooth gameplay and a interesting story!
This is one of the best games that ive ever playd. I recomend it to everyone!
I rate 11/10 a fucking great game!!"
12845,This beautiful game along with it's incredibly immerse story line is absolutely astonishing. This game has lived up to its potential and is well worth the money.
12846,"If i bought this for $12 i would have been very upset, instead my friend bought the humble bundle: jumble bundle5. He didn't want the game and i told him i was interested so he sent me the code. So the gameplay was very repetitive, every world would have a little twist. Completeing the game in less than 2 hours would not be worth 12$ in my opinion especially since the gameplay felt dull after playing for 20 minutes. Once the game felt boring my only interest was to find my uncle at this point. Not to mention that the trailor litterally shows every level (yes thats how small the game is)


SPOILER:







When you find your uncle at the ending (the part i was interested in for the rest of the gameplay) he just says ""its good to see you, but you need to go home"" and then thats it. You get teleported away and im just thinking to myself... I was looking for my uncle teleported to this whole other world searching for him for him to tell me hes not interested in the real world and dosn't want to come back but wants me to leave is RETARDED... i give the game a 4/10 in my opinon."
12847,"Pretty neat so far. My only gripe is the level with the falling cubes. Everything seems too far away and the cubes are falling too fast. I can't seem to get back across :(

Edit: I made it. Very cool game!"
12848,"sadly its realy short but i loved every minute of it 
"
12849,"This game has grown to be one of my favourite story driven games, im not a single player big timer but evey now and again i feel like sitting back and enjoying some good story and this gave me all i needed for this time, sure. its short and simple but sometimes that is just exactly what you need. For what it lacks in detailed story it compensates with an amazing gloomy and magical enviroment, it leaves alot to the imagination which was a very nice touch. It was also pretty difficult at certain points and i really feel the work the devs have put into making the physics unique and fresh to play around with. Thank you coffeestain for such an amazing adventure!
"
12850,A well made short indie game. Provides a lot of mobility and has a captivating story line.
12851,Great 2-3 hour game
12852,"This game is sick. Want a visually stunning, super relaxing pass time and an immersive story? This is it."
12853,well after all the COD clones i must say this game was like a breath of fresh air :)
12854,"A short, yet great and beautiful game. The gameplay is unique and fun."
12855,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

7 out of 10 talamitos."
12856,"Really fun.  I was exhilarating to jump and grapple from ledge to ledge.  Kind of the feeling you got out of the 3D Prince of Persia game that was annoyingly just called Prince of Persia.  This one also had a very nice art style.  It is very short, however."
12857,"My two A Story About My Uncle:

A good, solid game, with a decent graphic and decent gameplay. The story itself is not so special, though.
 
Real Value: 5$ or less."
12858,Probably one of the best games I've ever played.
12859,Nice Gameplay And Full Of Story
12860,"This game is worth every minute and every cent! i liked the gameplay, the soundtracks and the colorfull worlds!

i give it 10/10"
12861,"A very interesting story in a very strange world.
Somewhat of a puzzle-jump game in a fantasy-surrounding.

It only took me 3 hours to complete it, and when I did, I was sad it ended :(

Hopefully there's going to be a follow up on this little gem."
12862,"I recommend to play this Game with Keyboard and Mouse.If you want a Seizure , play with Conrtoller.
But it was a true Adventure , beautiful environment ! A bit tricky , but not that hard."
12863,"Can not recomment to casual players who are looking for a platformer. Difficulty curve is steep and really ramps up at the later stages which can cause some agonizing moments and frustruation. Checkpoint are also too far apart for these later difficult parts. I was able to finish the game but it may remain unreachable goal for many players.

There were also some technical shortcomings that prevented me to enjoy the game and made it even more difficult. One of the dominant one being getting stuck at the corners of the geometry when grappling in mid air and falling slightly past the object (or grappling the side of the object from below). Mechanics where the game pulls you around the corner in these cases, would have add some additional polish to the gameplay and made it better in my opinion."
12864,"What a beautiful game.

It is also such a short game, it took me like 2 hours and a hafl to tcomplete it but I would definetely reccommend A Story About My Uncle for two main reasons:

-Desing is way too beautiful. The atmosphere in the surroundings where the story transcurs are simply astonishing, beautiful characters, houses, and everything around is well designed.

-Lovely Story and storytelling. An endearing bedtime story told from a father to his daughter, how did he see his uncle for the last time, the story develops perfectly and makes you keep playing until you finish it.

Definetely worths a buy but because it is that short, maybe you should prefer to get it while the price is reduced."
12865,"Basically this game is what happens when you mix Mirror's Edge and Spiderman into a game. 

Here's in a nutshell what I think is good and bad about the game:

Pros:
-Good graphics: The graphics of the environment and characters is amazing and one of the best aspects of this game
-Good Soundtrack: There are a few songs in the game, but the ones that it has fit the atmosphere of the game nicely
-

Cons:

-Bad Voice Acting: The voice acting in this game is atrocious! The narrarator is the worse of them. Just listen to him in the game's trailer!

-Controls need to be tweaked: For me the controls sometimes were either too responsive or not responsive enough. With a game like this, this is very important as a few extra seconds of waiting could be the difference between life and death!

-Short Game with little replay value: This game is really short. I finished it in under 4 hours. Once you beat it, there's very little replay value"
12866,Nice short 1st person puzzler. Interesting cast and setting. Good time.
12867,"Short and sweet, such an amazing game.
Parkour styled gameplay, beautiful enviroments and a great story told to you and experianced as you play.
It was a rather short game to play, but enjoyed every minute of it with no regret. 

Recommendation? Just buy it.. you know you want to."
12868,"Short game with not much replayability but very fun
"
12869,"An awesome game, although it's much too short...By much too short I mean it's like unbelieveably short. I haven't played a game this short EVER. 

The last game that I played and thought was short was a game made by a single developer and it took me 6 hours to beat. This game took me 2 and a half hours. THAT'S IT. 

They have a team of developers working on this game and they couldn't make it more than two and a half hours long?! I mean I payed $12 for this game!

Honestly I think this game is amazing, and has an incredibly unique sense of gameplay and style. It truly is art but I do not think this game is worth the $12 I payed for it to only be 2 hours long. 

A not to the developers DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!"
12870,"Well... it sure is a grapple game.  Not much other than grappling, really.

If you really like the idea of grapple mechanics where you can't stop the line from reeling you in, then you may enjoy it.
I didn't really enjoy it that much in the end though.  Most segments required a specific sequence of grapples without much margin for error and it got tiresome to deal with."
12871,Dlc's plz
12872,"At times immensely frustrating (I'm not used to keyboard and mouse 1st-person controls), but most of the other times I was in awe and actively engaged with jumping and swinging and rocket-boot blasting my way out of crazy situations. The child's bedtime story narrative was sweet, as well. Definitely recommened this one."
12873,Why am I so short!?
12874,very good game very different from other games i wish they come out with another one and also a map editor that would be really cool
12875,"bite sized but awesome, took just about 3 hours playing casually and wasn't bored one bit."
12876,"Good game, interesting story to say the least. It's wayyyyy too short though,, and is definitely not 13‚Ç¨ worth. Took about less than an hour to complete, too short for it's price."
12877,This game is fucking gorgeous.
12878,"Great Graphics, Good Storyline, and Amazing Idea!"
12879,"It's AWESOME! Trust me, you won't regret it! Have fun! :)"
12880,"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS GAME!





YOU ALREADY WANT IT! AND IF YOU DIDNT THEN YOU'RE A LIAR AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU DEFINITELY DO. okay enough caps; i dont do lengthy reviews so i'll make this short and sweet. the artwork is phenomenal, the story is otherwordly, the mechanics are perfect, the voice-acting is indeed foreign and at times may sound off but only adds to the quality. 10/10 would swing to my death again."
12881,"I was told to purchase this game by a friend. At first I was reluctant to play it but after starting it I didn't want to stop playing. I had to stop myself so I could preserve the integrity of the game and the story-line. Kind of felt like a book but in game format.

At times I was very frustrated at different parts but remained persistent. I could definitely play it again however.

I do recommend this game, it isn't like any other game I've played but the story itself is captivating and worth sharing with others,"
12882,This game is a goddamn feel trip.
12883,great looking game. cool story. fun
12884,"PROS:
Beautifully Crafted World
Great Gameplay Mechanics
Awesome Soundtrack

CONS:
Short (Especially for the off-sale price)

Overview:
A Story About My Uncle is a beautiful game that has Breathtaking visuals and very smooth gameplay mechanics. However, the game is roughly around 2 hours long, so take that into consideration if you're debating whether to buy now or wait for a sale."
12885,"Gorgeous visuals (highly optimized, to boot). Tight, intuitive, flowing mechanics that are a joy to utilize. Interesting, well voice-acted story. As others have said, it's like Portal+Spiderman+Parkour in a linear, procedurally story-told relaxing and exhilirating adventure.

Super pleased with this game. Support these developers, this game is a labor of love!"
12886,"good story my br... uncle.
Very original and good graphics. Some (not main)character animation are a bit unpolished and weird.
And there are some bugs but pls ignore them and inhale the story xddd weed"
12887,The game is beautiful definitely a must play.
12888,"Short, fun game. Get it on sale"
12889,every game should have a magical grappling hook
12890,"A wonderful experience, 143/100 recommended.
 Mechanics are not all brand-new, however it is integrated really well, gameplay just flows as liquid and the story is pretty good also. It just satisfies you with any means.

Note that I haven't finished the game yet so It may be short, frustrating or etc. on further steps."
12891,"What can i say about this game?
First off, the gameplay is beautiful but it doesn't require a beast of a pc to play.
Secondly the story is perfectly made, and it made me feel kinda sad in the end.

The only thing i have a problem with is how the frogs walk but thats just me,
If their walk animation was better it would be a 10/10 but i give it 9/10

edit: years later it still holds up, wpwp"
12892,"The swinging physics aren't very fun. You just click on the swing point and it just drags you to it, there isn't any momentum. 
That being said, I did finish it, and that doesn't happen very often. Only buy if on sale for a few dollars.
P.S If you can't afford good voice acting, don't bother putting it in. Text only would work just fine."
12893,One of the most beautiful games of our generation
12894,"This is one of if not my favorite game ever. and keep in mind this is going up agains't Tribes ascend and 
Portal 2 and Tf2 and all that good shit. I will be very dissapointed if there is not another one of these games 
made or at least a DLC.


Legendary. Buy it now faggots."
12895,"I highly recommend this game... such a beautiful world with amazing scenery around ever corner! The game mechanics are perfect for what it's made for and it's such a pleasure doing all of these cool tricks and last second saves before you fall to your death.

The story is simple and sweet, nothing deep, but it does tell a story through a child's mind with that child's future grown voice. I can't wait for more of these games to play! It's too bad the story is short, but it was really rewarding for me!

Just play the game! (:"
12896,"You'll probably finish it in a couple hours, likely one sitting, but it's really fun. It gets quite challenging by the end and, while it was rather underdeveloped, I think the story was pretty cool. It's begging for a sequel. If you can get this on sale for maybe $5 or less go for it, if you really want to support an indie, pay full price."
12897,"(Spoiler) So I finished the game and found my uncle. He was in an ice cave. How did he survive so long? Instant noodles. Yup. Instant. Noodles.



9.5/10 wasn't even top ramen. (But the game itself was fun and great with a nice storyline 10/10.)"
12898,Would like to have played ..sadly the game would never launch.
12899,"Very nice game that I beat in 3 hours.  Good but simple story.  Dont let the gay name trick you into not buying it
"
12900,Spiderman + Mirror's Edge + really really difficult achievements = very rewarding experience. 10/10
12901,"A charming little game which has a unique flair to it.

Definitely pick this one up during a sale. My only real critic would be that it's a little bit short."
12902,"8/10

Solid platformer/puzzle game. 1st person, some issues with controls and response etc. But the game reloads you quick and runs smooth. Great landscape, enjoyable music and a cute story. 

Beat it in 4 hours; wasn't rushing or looking for hidden items. Game was right length."
12903,"Definitely better than I expected from watching the video. Interesting and fresh twist on the platformer genre. Not excruciatingly difficult, but just the right difficulty. While it does have controller support, I found the accuracy of a mouse much more suitable for this game.

I really enjoyed the voice acting, especially Madeleine's. Their accents gave the game a lot of flavor in my opinion."
12904,"Rather good Portal -esque game in the genre of ""FPS without shooting"". Has very pleasant visuals and simple but addictive gameplay. Story is given to you by several voiceovered memories. WARNING: Ridiculously short. It's like couple of levels, man. Quantim Conundrum is much much bigger (having similar premise)."
12905,"A very beautiful game, although it is short, it's a lot of fun and is made very well with a great story."
12906,"There isn't much I can say, other than I LOVE THIS GAME. It's really short, which is unfortunate, but the gameplay is super fun and the setting is... well, magical? I guess that's the best I can come up with right now, but I really do love this game."
12907,"Best parkour game ive played to date! 10/10, right up there with portal! This game isnt popular enough!"
12908,"This was so much fun.  The gameplay, the visual, and my god the story was bueatiful."
12909,"You jump and grapple (later on even boost) your way through bizarre surroundings from a first person perspective, then find your uncle - just to be shot home again by him...speaking about Sysiphos...Took me 5 hours...but only because I needed not few attempts to memorize the stage. Some stages seem harder than they really are. Story is meaningless though."
12910,"ever felt a game so perfect in every single way that u just want everyone to know about it?
this is one of those games, the atmosphere , the voice actors , the story , the art design , the mechanics , the smooth movement, the soundtrack  and last but not least the creativity are all just so on point.
the ending makes you question everything in life btw, it just brings the whole game's story to another level
IGN 11/10"
12911,"Very boring puzzles. Everything feels very repetative and somehow, rather slow. Especially since the environments seem to consist entirely of floating rock fields in different colours.

Nice enough story though, even if the narration sounds awkward."
12912,"A nice short game to kill a few hours, perhaps a little overpriced. I definitely recommend it if you see it on sale. It's pretty and a nice blend of challenging and simple. The voice acting could stand to be better, but it was good enough for the context of the story. It's a game you'll want to complete in a single run otherwise frustration might get the better of you and you won't get your moneys worth."
12913,Simply amazing.
12914,"Fun gameplay, nice graphics, charming story, solid game, did not experience any bugs, good performance on an old machine."
12915,A beautifully amazing game that will piss you off.
12916,Stop reading and download this game
12917,"Be warned this is a good game but it is really short. If you really wanted to you can beat the game in 2 - 2 1/2 hours. The story is cool and interesting. Game play is fun and satisfying but isn't that hard. The devs should take a portal approach and allow players to create their own levels. Not worth 13 dollars, get the game if it goes on sale though."
12918,Awesome game but quite short. I had some problems with some walls not working correctly but othervise really great platforming game with some quite challenging parts. 5/5 would find my uncle again.
12919,"Please don't be fooled by the title, this game is simply beautiful. It combines interesing parkour mechanics with stunning, artistic visuals to create a truly unique experience, and it remains exciting all the way trough, even without combat.


It's amazing. 

9.5/10"
12920,"Gorgeous game. Character NPCs are a bit wonky, in most ways, but the gameplay was lots of fun and the story was actually touching. Here's hoping for a sequel..."
12921,"Graphics: Stunning
Story: Great
Gameplay: Interesting, if a bit frustrating at times with some of the more difficult puzzles.
Length of game:...a bit short given the price.

Overall: Would definitely recommend giving this game a chance, especially if it's on sale (50%+)."
12922,"This was made by the same people that made goat simulator....

All jokes aside this is a very fun platformer with a sweet story, and some excellent mechanics. If you like games like portal or.......portal 2.....you will like this game!"
12923,"beautiful gameplay, lot of fun although at some parts its getting difficult.
only story is a little short..."
12924,"This game is amazing, even though there is a short amount of gameplay I highly recommend this game"
12925,"Really nice game, enjoyed it. But extremely short, would have liked more puzzles and maybe more enemies?
Anyway still a great game, not storywise or anything else really, just a nice puzzle game.

Try it out, it is quite nice. 6/10"
12926,"Love combination of graphics and music to create a fantastic atmosphere. Lovely puzzles, I hope that they choose to make another at some point."
12927,"gameplay - fun and fast, but with the bullshit grapple detection the fun wears off real fast 
story - decent 
voice acting - pretty good but the shitty animation ruins it 
graphics - vary pretty 

there was plenty of points to where i was clipping through rocks and walls, there was this one point i couldn't get past because the crystals you click on wouldn't register no matter how hard i tried until thankfully it registered after a whole bunch of attempts. 

i have 3 hours of playtime, for the $13 that it cost it'd have to be 75% off just for you to break even, and half of that time is going to be spent angry at the game. 

5/10 ""who even made this shitty game?"""
12928,"A story about my uncle it's a nice game, with great graphics, nice and original story and sometimes you may lose your temper :D the only bad thing is tha the game is short

12929,Such a great game! Not very long though.
12930,"Very good game with a fair amount of challenge that still is fun and beatable. Only downside is how short it is compared to price. I got this in a deal with 9 other games for ¬£4, if you can get it for around that price, totally worth it."
12931,Beautiful and inspiring exploration puzzle game. It's very active and enjoyable.
12932,"This is a rare gem of a game.  A first person platformer with beautiful landscapes and challenging gameplay.  And best of all you don't kill a single thing throughout the game.  The challenges and game play ramps up nicely through the first four levels and then  the learning curve sweeps up precipitously in the fifth level. (Think of it as the boss level.) Many people criticize the last level for being tedious.  For me it was only slightly tedious because it was an ice level and looking at icy landscapes gets boring pretty quickly. Fortunately there is no Lava/volcano level, breaking the unwritten rule that all platformers have to have an ice level and a lava level.  One hint about the game that works for all of the levels  and especially the last level: don't just concentrate on your aim, but concentrate equally on your rhythm as well. Both aim and rhythm are needed to make it through the tricky parts. 

To sum up: very fun, very beautiful, and highly recomended"
12933,"Quite possibly the most beautiful game I've ever played. The name of the game has no correlation to this games utter genius. I have played many games, but I have never had such enjoyment from a game as this one gave me. I wish it was longer, but hopefully there will be a continuance of some kind in the future. I bought this game during the Summer Sale for a little over $2.00, but I would have no problem paying $13.00. Hell, I would pay $20.00. I love this game and I recommend it to all who enjoy a fantastic game. You will not regret your purchase.."
12934,"A Story About My Uncle combines an engaging story with fun, challenging, and quickly paced gameplay. If you enjoy games such as Mirrors Edge or like rocket jumping in TF2 you will most likely find that there are great times to be had here. The only negative about the game is that it is only about 2 hours long (and this is with me spending about half an hour working at the one challenge your companion gives you). Yes, you can go back and work for achievements, but you don't get that sense of wonder with the game's stunning environments twice. The game should have included more challenges from your companion and preferably more levels. What it does it does right but it doesn't expand upon it."
12935,Good game difficult in some areas but good quality and story is interesting
12936,"Cool little game

Amazing and creative world.

Fun adventure.

Bit short though. About 2 hours."
12937,"This game.... phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and I learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for Uncle Fred! If you guys made a DLC or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
12938,"A fun, albeit short game about a father telling his daughter a bed time story about his search for his missing uncle Fred. The story starts innocently and almost boring and then quickly falls into a fantastic run and jump adventure which carries itself forward amazingly well.

The scale of the levels is amazing and the difficulty gently ramps up as you progress and become more comfortable with the run and jump mechanics which take getting used to. There are more than enough checkpoints which lets you quickly pick up not too far from where you left off should you fall or mess up.

It's one of those wonderful titles you actually need to play to get the full experience. Grab it."
12939,"Few hours into the game and changed from console to mouse and keys because i think its much more convenient for me. The game is beautiful and im absolutely loving it. First time trying out 3D platformer game like this, and feels like im spiderman in a parallel world. Hope the story of the game goes well too as i move on. I have a feeling that the frog eggs that uncle fred was searching has something to do with the people in the village and outside. Lets see how it goes :3"
12940,"This game was phenominal.
The gameplay was mostly the same throughout, but increased in difficulty and creativity as the game progressed. All of the levels were brilliant and unique with special challenges for each.
Even though the gameplay was great, the best thing about This game was the story. It's well planned and refreshing to see this kind of storytelling. The characters grip you and you want to learn about what's happening and watch them develop.
I loved everything about this game."
12941,Short but sweet... I would buy it off G2A its like ¬£1 on there.
12942,Good but short.
12943,"MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD..very minor..

There are many things about this game that could be way better, however I am overall going to recommend this game IF you have lots of money to burn or it goes on sale.

This game was a fun game while it lasted. The graphics were nice, the environments beautiful and interesting, and the gameplay really fun.

Unfortunately, the trailer shows all of the best bits of the short game that beat in a couple hours. I also don't feel this game has much replayability. The main aspect of this game is the story (hence the name, right?) so replaying it for that reason won't do much for you. There are 'collectibles' you can get, but I don't feel compelled to try in the least.

Anyway, pro con list:

Pros:
-Beautiful environments
-Cute story
-Interesting and fun gameplay

Cons:
-Short
-Poor NPC movements
-Shallow NPC storyline (other than Maddie)
-Cost
-No Replayability
-Though the story was cute, it was kind of weak, so the storyline gets both on both the pro and con list.
-The voice acting was a bit off in parts


With more attention, this game could be great with sidequests, more characters, more enemies (there is only one in this game...that was a bummer) and a deeper story. As is, it's worth a few bucks.

12944,"A very good narative focus first person platformer with very solid controls and a fun grapple mechanic. While I would fully reccomend it, it is short. Only took me about 3.6 hrs to beat it."
12945,"Fun and challenging game! It was enjoyable, but I would wait for a sale to get it as it is too short for a $15 game."
12946,"Very good game, worth playing.

The begining is very detailed and provides good atmosphere. The following gameplay and interactions are a bit off, but very acceptable coming from an indie game.
Most story elements are very unpredicable and add well to the overall story.
The end is a bit anti-climatic though the prologue makes up for it with very touching elements.

Undoubtedly this is an undeservedly overlooked game.
"
12947,"It has a wacky name of game, but great game, it has some unexpected features that will be used in game, the game itself challenge the user to try as hard as they can. Although, sometimes it maybe frustrating when we reach certain tries, still the game is very fun and easy to play. This game seems to be non-violent, but still it has lots of great things in it, such as awesome story, and the feeling when you fly with the grappling hook. I totally recommend to buy this game, it is much worth that the price itself."
12948,"One of the best games i ever played! If you love beautiful worlds, a bit of riddle and a fast reaction platform game you should buy it! The story is short but very beautiful. I give 9.5/10 cookies."
12949,it's like  watching children movie while platforming i love this <3
12950,Worth the money
12951,This is an incredible game and definitely one that should be in everybody's library. It's a hugely entertaining and well written title with breathtaking jumps that are made more death-defying due to the first-person perspective. It's a shame that the game hasn't gotten the recognition it truly deserves but it's never too late to pick it up and give it a go. You won't be disappointed.
12952,"A bedtime story about two foolhardy children that die hundreds of times. Lots of fun, but with many moments where the physics seem internally inconsistent. Perfect for anyone missing an eye, since depth perception is irrelevant. When things work, this game is fantastic. The story is interesting, and the world is cartoonishly picturesque. Worth the money."
12953,"This is probably one of the best games ive ever played. any genre any generation. the story (though brief) draws you in and glues you to your moniter. the enviornment is so beautiful and well designed. you can flip your mouse around and land on random directions and 9 times out of 10 you will come up with a screensaver worthy screenshot. the gameplay is challenging (but not agrevating) and engaging. its so respinsive. If i could recomend any game to my friends, it would be this one. thank you coffe stain for creating this masterpiece of a game.

10000000000000000000 / 10

"
12954,"I wish it was longer! it has to be one of my favorite games now! i loved this game!
almost made me cry how awesome it was! 

10/10 Whould Recommend to anyone!"
12955,"[h1]Story[/h1]

The story is superb. The narration between you and your daughter is amazing. I love the little jokes they throw at each other. The interaction between you and the other NPCs were also extremely well done. I love how the story unravels itself as you uncover secrets.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

This is where it killed it for me. I have so far took a break 3 times from the game already because some obstacles were just too annoying to complete. I'm love achieving 100% completion in games and I set out to find all the jewels in this game. At the beginning, it was a lot of fun. But when the game started getting complex with boosts, and limited 3 grapples and having to handle recharging them, it became a lot more annoying than fun. It is especially annoying when the character's head hits a rock. It becomes almost instant death. And I have to repeat the same obstacle multiple times. 

I would have enjoyed it more if the grapple functionality spins me around my target when I'm close rather than straight on collision.

I vote ""No"" for this game because while I enjoyed the story, I dreaded playing it. I just want to know what happens then I will probably never open this game again."
12956,"This game has pretty okay gameplay to it and a very 'meh' story. 
The nevigation was really confusing that it felt like it wasn't tested at some places... 
Annoying bugs happen all the time like grabbing into a platform and not being able to get to it because the game decided to stop holding on to it.
The voice acting was also very 'meh' and the story telling was pretty bad as well.

However it was a fun game! I kinda liked it but it lasted for only a little more than one hour...... 

I would not recommend buying this game at a full price."
12957,"Found this gem while looking through the sales section and took a chance. I paid 4 dollars and hoped for the best.

And after its all said and done, I'm glad i did. To me it played a bit like portal, just a lot more user friendly, a sweeter and simplier plot, and less complicated mechanics.

Gameplay is pretty linear, the story itself will probably seem familar in one way or another, but in a good way.
Visuals look pretty nice, and i encountered no bugs/glitches while playing.

The only thing that keeps me from making this a 10/10 is the fact that there are certain parts of the game where the difficulty spikes to a 9/10, where as every thing else you may have encountered was only a 5/6... I personally liked that though (just seen comments online where ppl said this ruined the game for them)."
12958,BEST GAME EVER
12959,"A very good storyline and is definetly worth the price.  $3 for sale today.

==============Spoilers================

I didn't like how it ended with his uncle leaving him even though the entire campaign was on finding him.  It just felt sad and how his uncle rather stay with his experiment than his own nephew who just risked his life to find him. ( Virtully died a 1000 times over )

==============End Of Spoiler============

I had a fun time playing getting through some of the harder lvls was also an enjoyable time."
12960,"Amazing. The story, the adventure, everything in this game is just perfect."
12961,"Just bought this game yesterday, started playing it tonight, and had the benefit of beating it tonight. Amazing story, gameplay, graphics, everything. If you don't have it, get it. Finally a story game where I could go anywhere but still end up in the right spot. Don't have to look up a quide every time I get lost... Still some minor bugs, but meh. Worth every penny. The contols are smooth, everything is well thought out, I'm very impressed. 9/10"
12962,"I'll preface this by saying that there are very few games I've played that, as I progress through them, make me stop in awe of something that's happened.

Just two hours in, and A Story About My Uncle not only made me pause during my playthrough, three times now it's made me audibly say 'Wow'.

The last time a game managed to make me do that, I'd just doused civvies in white phosphorus in Spec Ops: The Line, and let me tell you, I'll take My Uncle's moments of discovery and bittersweet farewells over murdering dozens of innocents any day."
12963,An amazing little game.
12964,loved dying over and over.
12965,"Pretty dank game, solid story about uncle Fred. Had a blast swinging from rock to rock for 2 hours
10/10 but would'nt pay more then $4."
12966,"""I don't know how to describe the feeling of bursting through the air, like a bullet."" -Main character who's name I still don't know
[h1] Story [/h1]
The Story is good, when I say good, I mean it. Not gonna spoil it for you though. 8/10
[h1] Visuals [/h1]
The visuals in this game are beautiful, it's eye candy, with motion blur it's even better, every detail is well made (not very much of those details though), and it just makes you want to explore more and more, see alot of these new undiscovered lands. 9.5/10
[h1] Audio [/h1] 
The voice acting is perfect, the music they put on, is just perfectly set on the moment when you discover something new. 9/10
[h1] Summary [/h1]
It's a great game, better grab it during a sale, but it's still worth every penny of the full price. With great visuals, story, audio, but little lack of details and love I give it a nice little 9.5/10"
12967,"Wonderful, beautiful, gorgeous, heartfelt."
12968,"Reaaaally fun game! It makes so much fun grappling through the jungle of possible points to hold on and find out the fastest way. The graphics are awesome and the environment was made with detail. Though sometimes, especially in the towns, there are transitions in the ground which can not be overwalked, but must be overjumped. It is a great game which makes fun and has replayability with time trials, which are not easy to beat. Buuut, it is a bit short!? I wonder why? Ok, if you tell your daughter a bedtime story, you don't want to make it too long, but he could have continued the story the next day. I would have liked the game to be 4 times as long with more items to achieve and story to be told. There was much more potential. But still, as it is now it's a great game and totally worth playing! :-)

SPOILER FUN ADVICE:
[spoiler]When you found Fred, you talked and he stands beside the button, promise me to slowly walk up close to him and watch his face go from super kind 'n' understanding to mega evil and horror-wicked xD [/spoiler]"
12969,"I have been enjoying this game. Rocket boot jumping and spiderman swinging through beautiful areas is as fun as it sounds. I've struggled in places but the movement and controls are make it so satisfying when you land on that platform after your jumps and grappling swings.

I recommend."
12970,"I bought this on sale for $3.24. 

It's a casual experience that last a few hours at best.
Pros:
Simple but heartwarming story
Good music/visuals
Flying around with your grapple glove..

Cons:
Very short
Not variation for replaying"
12971,"I reaaaally loved it !! Very immersive and fun to play, cute story. I recommend it !"
12972,"Very kind, sweet and insanely beautiful game. Actually every location is gigantic and its good for this particular game, each location is fascinating for its atmosphere and beauty. But the biggest problem of this game, the wildest repetitively. What you do in the beginning you will do in the end. Boring.

But still i can recommend this game for meditation purposes, buy it with a discount :)"
12973,"I'm gonna put this paragraph first because I feel this could make someone change their mind about buying this game. A Story About My Uncle is one of those that was literally made for speedrunning and it does have a time trial mode. Searching for the best shortcuts and choosing the best moves to overcome certain obstacles, planning and executing the perfect run is much more exhilirating than the basic gameplay. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you can significantly stretch the 3-5 hour average playtime. On the downside, there's only a handful of maps so you can grow bored with it pretty quickly.

Now, I'm rather bad at platforming so it probably took me significantly longer to play through the game than almost everybody else and there were a few times I had trouble navigating myself through the 3D environment as well as a few times when I knew what I had to do but had difficulty executing it. All that sprinting, jumping and basically flying can be very exhilirating but since there isn't any other aspect to the gameplay (except the speedrunning potential), you may feel unmotivated to get through the more difficult/annoying bits. If there were other puzzles and a more extensive (and compelling) story, it would be an epic game. As it is, it feels more like a promo.
 
I probably don't have to mention that this game is simply gorgeous. Yes, the quality of the surroundings and of the NPC models seems rather incongruous but the overall impression doesn't suffer from it much. 

The story could have been interesting if they developed it a bit more. As it is, I feel it's only there so you wouldn't be swinging through otherwordly caverns just for the hell of it. The storytelling concept has been proven to work before and I find the dialogue between father and daughter rather sweet as opposed to some other people, but I do admit that the voice acting is terrible."
12974,"Really good game, would highly reccomend playing through this game! Stunning graphics, awesome platforming, interesting story. The only downside is that this game is really really short. I finished the whole game in about 2 hours. Only buy this game on sale."
12975,Highly recommend 10/10/10
12976,This is a great game.   Really enjoyed the playthrough.  The settings are beautiful and the gameplay is fun and simple.  I do recommend this game.
12977,"I really enjoyed this game.

The controls were easy to use and the sense of agility was really cool, being able to zoom onto platforms, swing across floating rocks and using rocket boots. It was pretty challenging at some points, but not too hard that it made me give up. Sometimes it took me a while to figure out exactly which direction I was meant to be going and couldn't actually see the intended path ahead, but this wasn't a major issue, it acutally adds to the challenge in a way. I found the visuals really nice, especially after coming out of the caves for the first time.

The story was also interesting and adds to the enjoyment. In terms of gameplay length, it doesn't take too long to complete, only a few hours. But there's replay value in it. There are collectables that are hidden in the game which you can go back through and find if you miss them the first time. I found the achievements hard to get, so going back and getting those aswell will also let you get more play time out of this one.

Overall, I'd defintiely reccomend this game. It's fun and worth buying, especially if you see it on sale."
12978,"You should defenitely buy this game, especially when on sale. I'ts not much of a long game not gonna lie here it's actually pretty short. But the way of how the game lets you choose your own path to the location you need to get to is really awesome. The story is pretty great too, i like the way how it's told. So get it on sale while you still can."
12979,"This is a beautiful game with alot of mind calculations you need to do as you approach the platforms, I found my mind wandering about how stunning this game is. I think the hardest level was the ones with the falling boxes, I found myself trying to find the correct timing for it to come down and me to get on it properly etc.

It was kind of short, took me 2 hours to complete but I will definitely play this again and I will eventually get 100% because of how much I love this game. 

Great job devs!"
12980,A faily short first person platformer with a good story and good movment mechanics that remind me of Dishonored. One of the only bad things about this game is that sometimes the voice acting is not up to par but apart from that it is brilliant.
12981,Honestly it was annoyingly difficult at some points and didn't give a clear view on what to grab on to and why.
12982,"They didn't exactly go nuts when naming this game. A Story About My Uncle is one of those games where the gameplay takes place as your character relates a story about his uncle to his daughter. In this case the story is the narrator's fantastic journey through an alternate dimension to find said uncle, and the gameplay is some straight-forward first-person puzzle platforming. The main gimmick is your grappling beam, which honestly is more like the grapples from those ancient Quake II mods than the one from Tribes or even Super Metroid. When you hit something with the grapple it pulls you straight towards it, making Tarzan-like swinging a bit of a dicey proposition and most of the challenge centered around not catching your grapple point with your face. Your ""adventure suit"" has some other nifty tricks baked into it though, like a super jump and rocket boots, and these are unlocked as you progress and grant some much-needed variety to the platforming. The levels are fairly varied as well in terms of look and layout, though one is unpleasantly dark and the last is unpleasantly hard. This wouldn't normally be an issue, except the game is only about five levels long. It'll still take you a good three or so hours to get through them all, but it makes the weaknesses in the level design that much more apparent.

A lot of this can be forgiven when you reach the game's set-pieces, though. ASAMU has some gorgeous levels and scenery, and regardless of how you feel about the gameplay are worth seeing for yourself. Screenshots don't really do them justice, as you'll be observing them while plunging through the air at otherwise fatal speeds. The presentation does a great job of imparting vertigo when you disengage from a grapple at a peak, or plunge to your demise. The story is also quite strong, as should be expected from any game with ""Story"" in the title. Your narrator muses in a heartwarming way about his wayward uncle, spinning a fantastic story for his daughter. There are secret story beats to discover as well, which flesh out the narrator's relationships with the rest of his family. You get to interact with a few colorful NPCs, too, including one that actually gets some character development. It's a charming package through and through, only spoiled by some particularly frustrating bits of platforming near the finale."
12983,A truly beautiful game
12984,"Well narrated game, feels like a children's story being played out.  The mechanics work quite well in the gorgeous world as you make your way across.  It definitely felt like art.  Despite it being a short game it was enjoyable."
12985,"Here's the workflow for this game:
1. Latch onto floating rock.
2. Hurtle toward the rock.
3. Bump into rock, fall into the abyss, go to step 1.
4. If you didn't bump into rock, success, you get to repeat steps 1-3 on a different set of floating rocks.

The game looks beautiful, the story is appealing, the price is low on sale (I got it for $3.74), and the whole thing is fun for a while. I'm glad I didn't pay more though."
12986,"This game is really nice, you just cant stop to play the story. The mechanics are incredible and the sensation of fly around big areas is just amazin. If you like non-violent, rich story or platform game, this game is for you!!
9.99999/10 (The only thing is it's too short )"
12987,"This game is absolutely beautifull, but the only bad thing about this game is the lack of content.
I got sucked into the game and after 2 hours i had finished it.
I feel like they could have added so much more to this fantastic game.
The gameplay is really good aswell."
12988,"This game was great, not much to it
its one of those games that takes just one idea and does it very very well
short but really fun quite challenging towards the end

would recommend this to anyone."
12989,"Beautiful narative, difficult gameplay, revolutionary mechanics! This game was full of fantastic surprises in this majestically quarky world where you search for your uncle. At points while playing I had never felt more inclined to stab myself but it was all worth it when I hit that check point! Normally I do not review games but this truly deserved it, I played it straight through in a day the second it started, I couldn't put it away, I just had to get the next check point and hear the rest of the story!"
12990,The game is shorter than this review.
12991,"This game has a great storyline and was completed in only 3hrs, very tricky but a great thinker game similar to portal type game. would highly reccomend."
12992,I'm dealing with a problem but around next Year i'm getting a new pc to play this so it will come out better (hopefully I'm getting a new pc) also game develpors don't blame yourself because of it. My pc is an old 2013 pc designed for work that can only play a certian amount of games. But as this game is on sale I'll buy it so it's new on my pc.
12993,A short but amazing game. visuals and atmosphere of the game are so magnificently beatifull that I couldent play the game because I just tried to explore around and just look at those beatifull sights in the game. Has satisfying controlls for an averge platformer.  a bit too easy tho. I recommend but I ll say 7/10 because of the shortness of the game 3 hours are enough to finish it
12994,"In a way, this game reminds me of the first Portal: It introduces a simple mechanic for solving puzzles, and then presents you with increasingly difficult and creative ways to use the mechanic. And then it ends. It almost feels too soon, but any longer and the unique mechanic (swinging on the grapple) would have become dull and tedious. It wisely ends while its still fun. I completed the game in about 6 hours, and had a wonderful time, and it was well worth the low price."
12995,This is really good and georgues game. I really recomed it to everyone. You wont be disapointed.
12996,"* Story: ‚ô•‚ô• (2/5). Story of a missing scientist in a fantastic universe created by himself. (like in Tron: Legacy film).
* Atmosphere: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (3/5). Pleasant. The actors narrating are the key element. When the surrounding is getting repetitive, you'll probably get to the next chapter (5 of them).
* Gameplay: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (4/5). I've found that jumping around with a grappling hook was very fun and entertaining.
* Value: ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (4/5)

I've struggle with the controller for a while, just to switch to a keyboard and mouse in the last chapter. It was a much easier and less annoying."
12997,Sadly these two hours is all it took me to beat this fantastic game. Carried by an interesting narrative and very fun rope swing style gameplay I would defenitely give this a 10/10.
12998,"Touching, unique, beautiful, challenging, rewarding ending. Possibly the most perfect game of its kind I have ever played."
12999,"Most original game I've seen to date. Super fun, amazing story and really interesting. Check it out if you like fun games."
13000,great game! is all i can say
13001,"I dont like it. i hate it

10/10"
13002,a quick fun game. good for kids. worth a few bucks
13003,"it's ok but it has some problems
i rate 9\11"
13004,"One of the most fun games I've played in a while. Modern puzzle platformer with interesting and fun mechanics. I clocked it in about 3 hours but there is replay ability with the timed modes. 
"
13005,"this game is so entertaining and fun, good graphics and nice story. 5/5 would totally play again"
13006,"Get ready to play a game that lasts like 2 hours gameplay, this game is fun but it's not a long one, the story is nice and so, if you like adventure kind games like portal and games with  a story then i recommend it but the game as said is very short."
13007,"Enjoyable Story
Enjoyable mechanic
Some parts ramp the difficulty way up compared to the parts leading up to it, but still remains fun."
13008,Incredibly relaxing.
13009,do you like jumping on magic rocks while listening to a slightly awkward sweedish man talk about his uncle? then this game is for you.
13010,"This is a beautiful game that is all about flying through the air and franticly looking for the next place to grapple.  It is a very short game that is not overly difficult to beat.  It is crazy difficult to get the achievements (no story progression achievements or achievements for learning how to jump like other games).  It is a short game, but the character development of your friend is pretty good, and I found it a nice little adventure.  What makes this game spectacular is the environments and the gameplay.  The speed you travel with the grappling hook makes for a really fun game, and completing more complicated sections is really rewarding. It has also been on sale for a while, so why not give it a try?

10/10 would fall to my death repeatedly again."
13011,"The cutesy, sometimes pastel graphics of this game and the lack of enemies belie the fact that I died hundreds of times in this relatively short game.  Thankfully the reloads are quick.  This game is all about grappling, flying through the air from grip point to grip point.  When it works, it's amazing, but sometimes the physics seem arbitrary and there are some sections that are immeasurably frustrating.  I didn't quite rage-quit, but I did have to take a break on multiple occasions. 
   Even though I finished the game, I'm not very good at it; I think this is the first game I've beaten yet managed not to earn a single achievement.  This is a very challenging game disguised as something easy.  That contradiction best defines this game."
13012,"Amazing platform game, smooth controls and stunning graphics. It's really challenging and one of the best platform games I've ever played. The game has a great atmosphere and also, blue people.  10/10 - IGN"
13013,"Whether or not you should get this game comes down to if you perfer long games, or short and really well put together games. If you're in the latter camp, then this game is a great experience. This game doesn't waste your time, it does what it set out do to and doesn't fill it with unnecessary extra mechanics to pad out the hours.

The most obvious flaw is the voice acting. It's not great, but I personally enjoyed it. That said I wasn't expecting much in the first place, and it's no where near as bad as say Megaman 8. Aside from that, the techincal aspects and gameplay aspects are top notch. The game runs perfectly well, and has a smooth difficulty curve making it very approcable."
13014,A first-person grappling hook!  And it's not awful!
13015,"One of the most unique games I've ever played. Great setting, game mechanics, and story telling."
13016,"""A Story About My Uncle"" feels like the type of game where the creators had an awesome idea for a gameplay mechanic and created a story and levels as an afterthought.

Pros:
- Gameplay mechanics make you feel like a boss (in an adventure sort of way).
- Color was used pretty well in the graphics.
- Music and sound effects fit well.
- Opening scene of looking around the uncle's house was close to being really good with the suspense and papers everywhere.

Cons:
- Story feels like an afterthought; it wasn't that well developed.
- Levels feel a bit repetitive.
- Levels are confusing in that I felt like I was going in circles.
- Difficulty curve is terrible: easy and hard sections oscillate in unpredictable fashion. Difficulty is primarily amped up artificially by increasing the distance between checkpoints.

I wouldn't buy this game at full price with what I know now, but I can't say I regret buying it <$5."
13017,pretty great maaaaaaan
13018,"Finished this game, amazing game. loved it. it's beautiful. but the name.. why this?"
13019,"From the makers of Goat Sim, A Story About My Uncle is an intriguing and overall spectacular little game. I was thrilled with the idea of Coffee Stain making a game like this, so when I first saw it, I was all for getting it. The story, unlike many indie games, is fully developed. Along with the ambience and magical art style, I just couldn't put this game away (until I had to go to work). I do reccomend this game, it only includes minor flaws at some moments, but it is indie after all."
13020,"+Beatuful graphics
+Great gameplay
+Intriguing story
+Awesome game

-Too short

9/10"
13021,it is good
13022,"The best comparison is Portal 1. It's a short game with first person puzzle platformer gameplay.

It's quite fun to play and the enviroments look great. The story is pretty interesting but also cliched. The voice acting does sell it well though."
13023,"This was a super fun game, and my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough for me! Haha, I enjoyed the interesting little creatures, and how the mechanics of the game functioned. Definitely worth the random purchase, looking forwards to more games from this studio!"
13024,"A short but great game. The story might not be top notch, but it is easy going and delightful. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys platformers and the feeling when you were grapling in Bioshock Infinite. Not too hard but not boringly easy either. A good linear difficulty."
13025,fucking fred...
13026,Short but amazing game. Look past the name and you're in for a treat.
13027,"ASAMU, lol, great game, if you love adventure, this is a game that you must have"
13028,"A story about my uncle is a very hard game to describe, it is one of the few games that has a fantastic balance between story and game-play.
The game-play is fantastic, it is a first person platformer with a fantastic ‚Äúgrappling hook‚Äù mechanic similar to what you'd expect from a first person Spiderman game, you will swing from place to place and eventually find new ways to get around, the game is linear, but by no means constricting, you can follow the path, but you can choose your own way of getting around the environment as well, in fact the game will reward you for doing so. The game is also very challenging, if you screw up you will not get much of a chance to recover, but fortunately the checkpoints are very generous and I never felt frustrated (ofcourse if you try to get the achievements I imagine you will go nuts as they can be absurdly challenging). 
While most games have a storyline of ‚Äúepic heroes‚Äù and ‚Äúvillains‚Äù, this game has neither, there is no combat at all and there really aren't any ‚Äúenemies‚Äù in the game, honestly I found it to be a massive relief from all the violence from most other games (don't get me wrong though I still love those games but seriously, there are very few games without some sort of violence in them). 
It is also not something like Gone Home either where there is very little ‚Äúgame-play‚Äù either. A story about my uncle is instead a simple story of a young man trying to find his uncle.... in an alternate dimension with a super suit that allows him to swing like it was Spiderman's birthday, deep stuff I know but it is literally a bed time story.
Sarcasm aside it's a very sweet story, and one of the few games in the past few years to genuinely move me, there may not be that much dialogue in the story, but it is honestly just the amount that it needed.
The game is very short roughly 2-3 hours long, which while very short, also has a lot of replay value (it's the length of a good movie and like any good game it left me wanting more), if you want a game with a moving story, great game play, beautiful graphics and an exhilarating feeling of soaring through the air, then I can only recommend a story about my uncle."
13029,"Some really fun movement mechanics make this unique in the subgenre of ""first person platformer"", but it kind of sputters out before it reaches its full potential. Still, not bad."

[spoiler]You play as a person looking for ""The Uncle"" that has been gone for a long time. While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired.[/spoiler]

[h1] Personal opinion [/h1]

I.	Love. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!!

13031,"No spoilers review, if you're thinking about buying the game, here's a quick review.

The game took me an hour to beat (literally). I breezed through it while still enjoying the game play, scenery and music. After beating it of course, unlocked me Time Trials. From what I'm seeing to give the game some challenge is that you need to read up on the Achievements, such as using a certain amount of grapples throughout the whole stage. It's a relaxing game, has a straight-forward path (can get confusing at times, so you need to check your surroundings). The game resembles closely to Mirrors Edge and it's perspective. There are a certain amount of secrets per level (basically standing in front to rip the telegraph paper), and unlocking them gives you alternative bonuses in the options such as changing the color of your grapple. The grappling hook was something you needed to get used to, in terms of velocity, angle, reaction, and momentum. It is a unique game, but I wish there was more to it; A longer story-line to say, a stronger feel and connection with characters that gives you a sense of depth and what the main character is going through as he's trying to find his uncle as he dwells deeper into this adventure.

Game-play/Visual: 8/10
Music/Portrayal: 7/10
Story/Feel: 5/10
Price: 3/10 (It feels more of a $4.99 ranged game)
Overall: 6/10"
13032,"Bad name, still, an amazing game!"
13033,"Fantastic game, played from start to finish in one sitting. Great visuals and fluid controls. Couldn't ask for more :)"
13034,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ - ""Worth your time, give it a bash"" 

PROS:
- Very fun game mechanic which although its been done before, has been expanded upon.
- A different kind of puzzle game, its linear but challenging..more of a gravity based platformer puzzle game.
- Beautifully designed with stunning scenery, colourful objects and crisp graphics.
- Its one of those stories where its nothing special yet imaginative and engaging due to an air of wonder.

CONS:
- Short game, its not overly dense with puzzles..I guess the length is okay but I enjoyed the mechanic and would have definitely put more hours into this game if they were available.
- No real reply value to be had.

VERDICT?
 Its one of those games that comes out of nowhere and strikes you with an immersive world and fun gameplay."
13035,"I picked this up for like ¬£1 or something - it was good, but really short.  Quite fun platforming mechanics, not particularly dificult, but there are time trials, etc if you are looking for difficulty.  Cute story that is actually quite poignant at the end.  Some funny easter eggs. Not a bad looking game either.  Defintely one of the better random ""ah-why-the-hell-not-it's-only-a-quid"" steam sale games I've gotten."
13036,An incredibly well voiced game with a unique story and breathtaking views! Gameplay can be a bit hard to get used to especially with the distances you can use your grapple but other than that a brilliant game with a unique tale!
13037,"I played the beta (not too much changed) and it's a beautiful and challenging game.  I loved every minute of the awe inspiring environments.  I'd give this game a 7/10 just because of how short it was.  The layout was challenging and very satisfying to overcumb, but the shortness of the game really did limit it's potential.  But it is still a surprisingly good game, especially for the price."
13038,"I kind of feel like they were trying to push all this story and lore onto me like I cared, but as far as I knew most of events that happened before the game were just as little as spoken facts compared to the deep backstories and significant visual develepment in characters and setting found in Portal, a game everyone including myself seem to be compairing it to. And I have to say, the ending did conclude with achieving the main goal of the entire story, but for godsake could have it been any less rewarding and anticlimatic? I cared more about the integrity of the story then the poor player models and the weird voice actors because dispite all the nit picking, I thought the story was pretty good. But I tell you, the gameplay makes It all the better, because it is the most fun you'll have flying around pretty floating islands. 

Just call this Avatar 2 the video game and buy the fucking thing when its on sale."
13039,"An excellent little platformer with a unique style that just makes you feel good. While some parts could have been better designed, the game as a whole is fairly easy to play through. The story line, while having a strong beginnning and end, falls somewhat flat in the middle. 

I would recommend waiting for a sale to buy this, as the play time is very short but well done. Some say they took about 4-5 hours to complete, while I was able to finish it in 2 1/2 hours. It's worth noting that shortcuts are almost everywhere if you look, which can very greatly affect how long this takes."
13040,"This game is cool to start with. However if you're using a 360 gamepad you will quickly become infuriated with the terrible controls and ridiculous difficulty spike in the last level. I only know that it's the last level because apparently this game is only like 2-3 hours long?

Fuck it, not worth the money."
13041,Stunningly pretty and engaging. It's quite a short game but it really manages to suck you in the entire time you're playing.
13042,"Absolutely absolutely recommend this game. I would describe it as a 3d platformer, but the gameplay is unlike anything I've played before and although some areas are hard to figure out, in the end, the reward for doing so is so gratifying. Story and gameplay are fantastically balanced out and story is paced out throughout the game so it doesn't feel like plot-vomit. Super satisfying to finish the game, I think cos of the length of the game and the focused goal throughout."
13043,"My critique of this game:

Pros
1. Stunning visuals in landscape.
2. Challenging at times (There were several very frustrating points for me).
3. Interesting concept.
4. Very immersive. This wasn't a game that sat on the backburner before I decided to complete it.

Cons
1. Not so great visuals other than landscape (and characters hands). Honestly the people and towns don't even look like they belong with the landscape.
2. Voice acting lacking.
3. Very short.


Overall, it was a simple, fun game that I would recommend as long as it were on sale."
13044,Nice and cute!
13045,"After seeing this came from the same publisher as Goat Simulator, I was expecting a simple game with nothing but platforming mechanics to carry it. Instead I got a surprisingly heartfelt game with a fun premise. The narraration was top notch, and the interactions between the father telling the story and his listening daughter often made me chuckle. The game's mechanics are also pretty excellent. They take a couple minutes of getting used to, but pretty soon you'll be zipping from platform to platform with ease. Not to say that the game is easy; it has some pretty difficult obstacles (I'm looking at you ""room of falling boxes"").

Altogether a great game. I would buy it again."
13046,"Amazing game with a great atmosphere and the grappling is a lot of fun. The only thing this game is misisng is any kind of good music while playing, there's music in the main menu but barely any in the game itself"
13047,"After completing this game, (being completely addicted to it in the duration I played it) I think it's safe to say I have no regrets in spending ¬£9.99 on this game, it was worth every penny.
When you first step into this alternate world, the first thing to blow me away was the scenery; it was just...immensely beautiful, I cannot fully describe it. Though I was a bit creeped out by the frog people at start, I grew to like them and the part they had in the story.
The story itself is amazing; the search for a lost uncle, only to find yourself wrapped up in your own adventure whilst finding him.
The gameplay mechanics work so well; besides Portal I haven't played many platformer games but I can say for sure that this has made platformers a favourite genre of mine.
The only downside I have to this game (it's a tiny detail) is that there is frame drops at certain parts of the end, as well as there being a few exploits whilst playing in different areas and places you can get stuck in, but nothing too major if you don't go too in-depth exploring the environment.
I highly recommend everyone who is contemplating buying this to get it as soon as possible, I fell in love with it. Even though it is quite short, it is full of story and character and a hell of a lot of fun."
13048,"A Story About My Uncle 2?
please?"
13049,"A bit short (my playtime was like 5 or 6 hours and I was probably a bit slow), but a beautiful and fun game. Cute and interesting story. Definitely recommend it if you like this kind of game."
13050,"Fun little adventure game, most of the game is either story elements or grappling on to things. There are several moments in the game where I found myself saying ""I can't believe I just pulled that off"", this is because a vast majority of the gameplay involves flinging yourself through the open air to get from place to place. I really enjoyed playing this even if it was pretty short."
13051,"It's fun and pretty for the eyes.I had a bit of a nerve wreck every time i fell.But it's very smart first person platformer.
The only problem i would say is that is short ,maybe thats normal for these kind of games but i finished in 2.9 hours.And that is with regular falling down.
Anyway i want to recommend it to everybody.
I have to rate it 7.5/10."
13052,"Wow. I mean really, just, WOW. This thing right here; It's a gem. The gameplay is fantastic, the story is quite good too. My only complaint is that it's way too short, and although there is definite replay ability, I wish this game was more than an hour or two long. If this somehow got mods, and put on the workshop, this could very well be one of the best adventure / puzzle / platformers. Amazing Idea, amazing execution, just WOW!"
13053,"I'm going to say this right away, [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is probably my favorite platformer of all time. Imagine Portal, only without the Portal Gun and you're Spiderman instead. 

The core gameplay mechanic is your grappling hook, which you can attach to almost any surface to swing yourself through the levels. [i]ASAMU[/i] combines thrilling, high-speed platforming with a beautifully crafted and detailed fantasy world and a captivating, though really short story. The difficulty scales very nicely throughout the game, starting off slowly and becoming quite the challenge at the end, but without ever feeling frustrating or unfair, or breaking the pace of the story. And for those seeking more of a challenge there are always the achievements, which in this game are really an 'achievement' to get. The story/motivation is pretty short and can be explained in two or three sentences, but it's more the presentation than the content that keeps you on track. And I absolutely love the main voice actor/narrator!

In summary, I can recommend this little hidden gem to anyone who has a thing for platformers and loves to admire gorgeous graphics with a slow-paced story. If you're in for a ~5 hour long adventure, you're definitely gonna have a blast!

13054,Awesome game
13055,"Good gameplay and visuals.
Ended just as it really grabbed me. Imagine if portal 1 was half as long as it is. You get into it, and just as u do it ends. Leaves a sour unsatisfied feeling despite having a great time.
Because of that i wouldn't recommend paying over 10‚Ç¨. Grab it on sale."
13056,"What can I say. It was absoloutly beautiful from start to finish. I highly recommend this game. My only complaint was the length, I wish it was longer!"
13057,"Wow! that pretty much explains this short yet amazing game, the atmosphere in this game is outstanding, never felt so immersed in an indie adventure game before as i did in this one

The game took roughly 2 hours to complete (might take longer depending on ""skill""). But dont let that discourage you, this game is worth every penny, its truly well made for an indie game."
13058,"The ice caves. Near the end of the game, you'll know it when you see it. I can't recommend this game because of that. Extended insta-death if you make a mistake awkward platforming that requires twitch reflexes, and very few save points.

Just kills the charm of the rest of the game that came before it."
13059,A story about my uncle looks gorgeus. I enjoyed every level of this game while listening to its great soundtrack. But it lacks in content. Definetly worth the money if on a discount
13060,"was supposed to take me 2-3 hours as was approximated, but i ended taking around 8. im really bad at video games ;)

Fantastic experiance and well crafted"
13061,"A very nice person offered me this game. No regret. Nice game, 10/10"
13062,"(7/10)

An exploration 3D platformer, with a little bit of story thrown in.  Overall my favorite moments in the game came from finding new areas, and learning how to move through the 3D space in each to see and get to everything.  The difficulty can vary from area to area, and some can be quite punishing with several minute sections requiring near perfect timing and not offering any checkpoints.

Outside of those several spots though overall the difficulty and checkpoint system felt just about right and I was never so frustrated-dissuaded that I had to give up on the game and walk away.

Overall length is a few hours for the core game, and another few hours if you want to go though the various time trials/achievements.  Given the relatively low price and indie nature, that was just fine for me."
13063,"Beautiful, fun and touching. A real gem."
13064,It was good but HARD has a great story.  good story but hard it took me 11 hour to beat because i died all the time when i beat it i was so happy the creppy thing there was a frozen WHALE that was bigger then any whale i seen
13065,Amazing
13066,"slightly wonky grappling, I wish sometimes the physics would carry through my swing instead of drawing my directly towards the rocks, but otherwise it's a fantastic mechanic I wish I could use more often

there's some replayability in the form of time trials and collectibles, but everything is very linear and I imagine it would get old pretty fast."
13067,"Pretty little game. If you like platformers and a good story this is for you.

- Cons> 

* a little frustrating at times, but manageable if you play it in short bursts.
* maybe a little short overall.

+ Pros>

* The graphics are nice, and the world is interesting and beautiful.
* The story is pretty nice too."
13068,"The game is more on the platforming side , with an amazing story"
13069,bobs ur uncle
13070,Great game (and sadly overlooked)!
13071,"A Story About My Uncle:

It is such a good game, It takes you into a whole other world that is such a mesmerising experience, You'd be surprised how good the story about his uncle really is! Before playing this game with stress playing it for a bit was a big stress relief, It's just such a chill game and calming. Istrongly suggest you to buy this right now. 

11/10 would listen to story again."
13072,"All I can say is... Wow. 

I really enjoyed this game. From the grappling and jumping around to watching the story progress, this was certainly a masterpiece to behold. My money was well spent, and I'm gonna go back and try and unlock all the achievements now. 

10/10"
13073,"Yeah its alright. Voice acting and writing is rough and filled with cringe moments, citing Game of Thrones and My LIttle Pony memes. The less you hear the story and you just soak in the gameplay the better. Game plays well and flying around and falling and figuring out where to go is very enjoyable. Graphics are okay, colors and setting is beautiful, just don't look too closely to the character models. 

People say this game is like Portal, it absolutely is not. Don't buy this because you want a game like Portal. I don't know what they're talking about. It's like they've only played one puzzle game before."
13074,"I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

It may not be the best first-person platformer I've ever played. It isn't. But it gets pretty close. The movement mechanics are really enjoyable, and you rarely get a jump that feels badly designed. The level design is good.

My biggest praise with the game is its overall universe design. It really tries to go for its own thing instead of settling in on ""fantasy clich√© #81672"", it invents its own outlandish alien world, and that's something that video games desperately need, as those have been really scarce since the late 80s/90s. It misses the mark on a couple occasions, but the execution is solid and I would have commended the game even for just trying. 

The ""production value"" has lows and highs. While the landscape is flat out gorgeous, the characters definitely have something weird about them. The good kind of weird (outlandish design that's not afraid of itself), but also the bad kind of weird (model and animation quality). Although animation-wise, I do like that for dialogue, the game went for entirely hand-animated the whole way through; there is no re-use of dialogue poses, and they never stand still, not gesturing, Oblivion-style.

My biggest gripe with the game is the audio. The voice acting is alright, nothing's really bad but nothing's really good either. The sound effects lack some ""punch"", some clarity (I'm especially thinking of charging the glove, which sounds really weak). I thought it was really weird that the sound of wind in your ears when going through the air at high speeds was so faint. More atmospheric sounds could have REALLY enhanced the experience. And then there's the music... or lack thereof. There is almost no music, which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but it really feels like it should have been there. The lackluster ambient soundscapes make its absence all the more noticeable.

My first reaction to the game ending was that it was pretty short, and that I wish I'd seen one or two more locations in this magical world... but on the other hand, it's good that the game doesn't pad itself or overstays its welcome, and lasts just the right length before making all that grappling and jumping lose its charm.

This is unlikely to happen at the time of writing this review but I wouldn't mind seeing some DLC that expands on the world, maybe from the point of view of the uncle. That'd be pretty great!

If I had to assign this game a rating, I'd say 8/10. But despite its flaws you should absolutely buy and play this. NOW."
13075,Amazing platformer with stunning graphics.
13076,"A Story About My Uncle is a narrative exploration about a man relaying an adventure he had as a child to his daughter in the form of a bedtime story. In the adventure, he put on an ""adventure suit"" his uncle built for him and tampered with a device his uncle left behind that warped him to...somewhere else; the game doesn't really tell you where but it's also not important, so for all intents and purposes he was taken to ""another world"", one that is mostly constructed of impossibly floating rocks ala Avatar's ""Pandora"", or for bigger nerds ""Zendikar"".  Since his uncle used to adventure out into the world all the time and used to send postcards back, the fact that he hasn't been heard of in several months got him thinking that maybe his uncle ended up in this unusual world, and so he sets off to try and find him.

Mechanically the game is played as a first person platformer, in which the kid in question walked into the device wearing a modified version of his uncle's adventure suit, which allows him to charge up a ""superjump"" and is also equipped with a grappling hook that gets upgraded very quickly to handle multiple mid-air grapples which also cause the game's difficulty to spike very quickly since it's expectations of what you can do slightly outpace your ability to get used to the awkwardness of trying to fly with a grappling hook without hitting the things you're latched onto.  The Floating Islands bit of the world design allows for the jumps to get pretty crazy and combined with the grappling hook also make a lot of the jumps fairly lengthy, but they also require you to have a pretty good understanding of momentum and how to make it work for you while in mid-air.  It's not an easy game by any stretch.

As you travel through the game you'll meet a few characters, see a few significant landmarks, and are given small quantities of backstory via strange objects left behind regarding the relationship between the uncle and his nephew.  All that being said, the actual narrative isn't especially deep nor is it anything terribly surprising; you can guess most of how things are going to play out right from the beginning, and while there are surprises they aren't the sort that make the story any better so much as make the world around it more diverse.  I may not have gotten a lot out of the story, but the world construction was very imaginative and full of vibrancy, even in the darkest of places.  And even though the story wasn't anything really special, the conversation around the story between the father relaying the story and the daughter listening and interjecting made the experience feel quite genuine.

Would I recommend it?  Yeah, but not desparately.  It's a neat game with some great scenery in a cool location, a story that isn't bad but maybe a little simple, and the game ends before it has a chance to get too stale, but getting there will probably require a fair chunk of trial and error.  If it's on sale, definitely get it.  Otherwise you have to ask yourself if this is your sort of game: If you like difficult platformers and beautiful scenery from what feels like a very small team of developers, you'll probably enjoy this."
13077,this game is by far very worth the price it has a amazing story and feel to it if you are thinking about buying this game do it
13078,"This is a very pleasant experience.

At it's core, this game is about going on an adventure. You can compare it to something like Dear Esther for the way it drives the story as you travel through the world, but this game gives you a lot more control and freedom. The main grapple mechanic is both challenging and fun, making the platforming in this game liberating.

This is a short game, but you'll have a good time with it. The story is sweet, and the gameplay fun.

Check out a quick video review here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT7nITEQxVg"
13079,"This is a truly beautiful game. Using the grappling hook was quite complicated at times but this isn't really a downside of the game. I found the atmosphere relaxing and the game looks astonishing. I loved it, it was super interesting and I'm really happy I bought it!"
13080,The only thing bad was how short the game was
13081,"This game is Beautiful. Absolutely Beautiful. This little game is, while extremely short, a marvel to play. A real adventure. I managed to finish it in a mere 3 hours, and while I could put more in trying out the ""Trial Mode"" (Finish each level in a certain time frame) it is none the less an incredibly short game. It's extremely fun to play, and as soon as I began playing it I was intrigued by it instantly. You would probably be better off waiting for the game to go on sale if you can wait, as 13 euro for a 2-6 hour game is perhaps a bit much for the picky, however it is a quality game and I definitely recommend it if you enjoy a little adventure or perhaps your just bored."
13082,"This game is absolutely gorgeous! It is 1st person platformer, sort of a mix of Portal and Spiderman (as others already mentioned). 
The only let down is how short it is (3-4 hours max). I did not believe that it was the end when I saw final credits. I was hoping that it was an end of Chapter 1 or something. Nope. I still don‚Äôt understand why build such a beautiful and unique world and have so little to tell about it. 
Don‚Äôt let that discourage you though. I do recommend everyone to play this game. It is a piece of art. 
Achievements are hard to get (there are no automatic achievements at all, even for completing the game). I did not find all collectibles either on the 1st walkthrough. There is also a time trial mode that unlocks after you complete the game. I can see myself putting another 10-15 hours (or more) into the game to try to get everything."
13083,Met a cute girl she jumps off cliff to avoid me 10/10 most realistic game
13084,"This is a fun little game. Only 2 hours to beat.
My daughter and played/watched this game. It's a good puzzle game for the whole family (very portal-y)"
13085,"Absolutely stunning visuals and fairly simple and functional mechanics. Great fun for speedrunning too, I'd imagine, if you're into that."
13086,This game is one of the best game i have ever played this needs a sequel and big longer but it was the best 12 dollars i have ever spent.
13087,"barely any uncles in this game, 0/10"
13088,"I have just played through the entire game, and I am happy I did.
This game was not the longest game I've played, but certainly one of the most beautiful games.
The visuals are absolutely amazing, and so is the music.

Even though the game does not need your constant attention, it managed to catch and keep my attention throughout the entire game. That's something I had never experienced before."
13089,"When I first saw this game, I was insanely curious and I just looked at the ratings, which were positive to 92 % and I thought, I'd just give it a try without further looking at any ratings etc. 

Well, I finished the game within my first session playing it and here instantly comes the great, great downside: It's only 2 hours long, even if you play it for the first time and are a good player that can go through it without bigger problems. 2 hours. Well, additionally to that, there were some noticeable bugs and the ""People"" you meet (pretty early in the game) are... well... ugly as hell. The graphic of the surrounding areas etc. is amazing (Especially because of the great level/world-design), it's just the character models (and animations). But well, why do I rate this game as good? It's pretty buggy and ""unfinished"" and only pretty, you could say.

Well, first of all, this game offers amazing gameplay and an unique experience. It truly offers a journey, a journey in a new world, where you have to search your uncle. The story is good (but pretty predictable), the setting is very good, and the few dialogues that exist are at least believable. Except the last one, but adding information here would be a spoiler for the already short story. 
Plus: This game offers options for speedrunning (Tracking your time and a level choice after beating it). Still, to be honest, this game is not worth 13 ‚Ç¨ in my opinion. Get this game when the price is reduced, or if you are into amazing experiences, or if you are a really ambitious type of human being.

All in all, I'd recommend anyone who could think he likes it, to get it, when it's price is reduced by 50% or more. This is an amazing game, but too short."
13090,"Surprisingly fun game, recommeded with keyboard and mouse to better aim at grapple points"
13091,"Started playing A Story About My Uncle and immediately got drawn into the story with the spot on narration and graphics. Truly an immersive experience that hits your right as you begin and continues to amaze and capture your attention throughout the entire game. Though being on the short side (if rushing through the game without looking for all of the hidden machines and exploring the villages in depth), the game was well worth the purchase. I plan to replay it again on stream at some point in the future so others can experience this remarkable story as well. 10/10"
13092,"9/10 - Truly amazing game that gave me goosebumps throughout because of a real sense of connection with the character. My playtime is one playthrough without stopping to get a sense of how long it took to complete.

Pros
Amazing Soundtrack
Great movement system
Interesting characters
Beautiful world (I took about 30+ screenshots)
About the perfect length for any platformer
Good story

Cons
Some levels lack checkpoints in places where I felt they were neccessary
Achivements are near impossible to do in one playthrough
Some of the enviroment that wouldn't normally be reached lacks propper clipping
Extras are a bit lacking (Additional menu option that adds random noises or asthetics to the game)"
13093,A very short narative first person platforming game that has a more engrossing story than a game 10 times is length definately worth playing through if you're a fan of platforming or a good story.
13094,"Fantastic story.
Brilliant visuals.
Full of dads. 
10/10 ign"
13095,"[h1][b]Amazing game overall[/b][/h1]
In just an hour, I have realized that this game revolves around someone's uncle who has helped develop a civilization for a race of salamander-like creatures that has left anonymously. You must go on an adventure to find out what has happened to him.
-------------------------------------
I thought this game would be pretty crappy and boring, but this game has changed my whole view of platformer games.
I'd recommend this to any one of my friends."
13096,"A very underrated adventure-puzzle game. Really great graphics, detail, gameplay, and story. In my opinion, it should be at least half as popular as Portal. About 2-4 hours of gameplay (depending on how fast you go through the story, and how much you fail) plus extras and achievements. I would rate this game a 9/10. The only cons about the game is how short it is and a few bugs here and there."
13097,"This game is more akin to an extremely immersive tale with a gentle narrator. It plays out more like a movie than anything else. The game follows the main character, who goes to follow his uncle through a garbage disposal suit after acquiring a suit with new powers. With the suit, you have a grapple beam and upgraded sprint/jump abilities. You travel through a series of caves using these powers to overcome obstacles on your way to find your uncle.

The gameplay of this game is not very exciting or impressive frankly, but the atmosphere that the game gives off with its beautiful backdrops and immersive music builds the intensity of the game nonetheless. Coupled with the very powerful and touching ending to the game, this is one i would definitely recommend. 

As a side note, there is little to no replayability unless you want to find all the collectables or speed run. The game is also short and took me 2 hours to complete. I think that it would be best to pick this game up on sale or in a bundle."
13098,"While I have a few games on my steam account, this is only the third that I have beaten (first is civ 5 and second is borderlands I).  I REALLY enjoyed this game.  it pulls at your heart strings, and the ending is just beautiful.  

The charactures are not overdone but are loveably and realistic.  you actually feel for them (which is a feat that most games fail at).  I had fun, and I know you will to!

While the game is short, I belive it is worth the time invested.  One bit of advice though: don't give up.  I got stuck on a certin part, and I got flustrated and put the game down for about 6 months.  I picked it back up today, and as it just so turns out I was on the last level and didn't even know it!  

Buy this game. I would recomend this game to anyone and everyone!"
13099,"This game is AMAZING, phenomenally well done and incredibly interesting, my ONLY problem with this game is that it took me a mere 2 hours to beat the entire game (No I didn't speed-run it)! Granted I did not get most of the extra things, but paying almost $15 for a game like this is a bit steep. I got it in a humble bundle so that was nice, but I just wish it had more content, because it's a great game, just a bit too short to really feel like a satisfying experience."
13100,"A delightfully quirky little game. Great mechanics, interesting fluid storyline, challenging but not rage inducing puzzles and lovable characters even if there are very few."
13101,"Fun game! Reminded me of Portal with all the acrobatics and whatnot. It was fun figuring out how to get through the levels. Not terribly challenging and I played it through in one sitting. Replay value is going to be pretty low unless you care to unlock achievements and the Unlockables in-game just because once you've played through the story, there's no other reason to play through it again, as it's not a deep story. I got it on sale during Summer Sale and feel I got my money's worth."
13102,"A beautiful adventure, reminds me of Arthur and the Invisibles :)"
13103,Best story ever
13104,"I great game with many challenges and some cool locations, Beautiful landscape and at least to me a light yet compelling story, tho not a particuarly long game it is quite memorable none-the-less and well worth the price and play In my opinion"
13105,"Voice acting is annoying, story is insipid, trying to grapple for the right length of time becomes seems like something of a guessing game at times."
13106,"A story About My Uncle is one of the most beutiful games ive ever played I the art the gameplay is just outstanding everything was welldone although it was a short game it was definately So much fun  recomend this to anyone who just has  
2-3 of their time to play something amazing :D. 10/10 would play again on a rainy/snowy day."
13107,"I have just finished the game after 3 and a half hours and i can honestly say that i have never been so blown away by a game, ever.

This game was fantastic, the gameplay and controls are balanced just right, its not too hard (the only time i failed was when i was too busy being blown away by the beautiful scenery) the storyline game me goosebumps as i couldn't help but imagine myself in the boys situation.

Well done, thats the best ¬£9.99 i have spent in a very long time!

This is also the first game in a very long time that i can not find any fault in, at all :)"
13108,"tl;dr fun game, good physics, bad story, short length.

This game has some GREAT platforming. Challenging, Fun, and new. The engine isn't perfect, but it's great nonetheless.

The biggest issue is the length. After dying CONSTANTLY, I still managed to beat this under 3 hours.
The story is also pretty bleak..just a shallow story about finding your uncle. It attempts to make itself deeper than it actually is, but it's just a shallow story with a built world that NEVER capitalizes on itself. The world is so deep and beautiful at times, and it just SKIMS over these parts.

I feel as if the game ran out of money, which makes me sad. If they had 2x the budget, I could tell this game would have been much bigger and realized.
"
13109,"10/10
Longest bedtime story ever"
13110,"The game is really short at its very core, even if you stop and stare in awe or smell the flowers along the way, but the feeling it leaves you throughout its journey... That, my friend, is something money can't buy.

I totally recommend it."
13111,"Play it. Though there are slight problem, they in no way lessen the joy of this game. I rarely say wow when playing a game on multple occasions I found myself saying it right along with a character. Do yourself a favor and play this game."
13112,"I just finished the game. As you can see, it really doesn't take long at all but it felt like I was playing it for a good bit of time. There is extra stuff you can do afterwards if you choose to do so, and collectables to gather ingame. 

Overall, I really liked the game. Sure, there were grammatical errors and the animation for the humanoids was choppy but the environment was phenomenal. I have taken so many screenshots ingame of just the world itself.

As for the game itself, it's simple but not too simple and it does have some rather difficult areas. Some locations have more  than one way to get through it, others just have a singular path. I did find it tricky to figure out where to go on occassion, but that's part of the fun of the game. Skydiving simulator.

This game has a lot of ""easter eggs"" at the beginning so keep a look out for them.

10/10 would recommend."
13113,Fun mechanics. Interesting environment.
13114,"would rate 10/10 for gameplay
8/10 graphics people look like aliens shit"
13115,"My stats (at the time of writing this review):
- 8.6 hrs to get to the end
- 10 collectibles found out of 25
- Zero achievements out of 15

What I liked:
- Visuals up until the last level (ice caves)
- Story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game

What I disliked:
- Visuals in the last level are uninteresting
- Gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right
- Achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!

Replayability:
- I'm not really into playing games over and over again just because of collectibles and achievements but because the game is pleasing and fun. Since the last level (ice caves) got on my nerves I'm definitely not playing it again.

Recommending the game or not:
I hate it when games become a frustrating experience. I don't think that a precise timing to push buttons makes a game fun."
13116,"A greatly under-appreciated game, A Story About My Uncle is one of the best indie games out there without a doubt.
Its got Charm, Charisma and a sense of awe that will blow you away. The story is great, the aesthetics are incredible for a slightly lower budget indie game and the gameplay and mechanics are fluid and enjoyable.
I would definitely recommend this game, especially when its on sale! 
"
13117,Awesome game! But maybe to easy to complete :/
13118,Awesome sci-fi parkour. Really Enjoyed the game
13119,You will fall. That's about it.
13120,"Please.. just please buy this game. It's a really damn good swinging/grapple-hook game and it's new, we don't have much new grapple hooking games now do we."
13121,"When i was a small child, my parents asked me what i would grow up to be, what i wanted to be when i was older, 
I looked them in the eyes, puffed up my chest, took a deep breath from my lungs and said i wanted to be spiderman.
However, the news was taken as i thought it would, my family ridiculed me, they laughed at me, Mocked me! ""I wanna be spiderman"" they howled.
""spiderman isnt real"" they said.

So i was forced into picking a different career, i was a janitor at a state school full of rich kids, they would ask me 
about my hopes and dreams and despite being ridiculed by my family i told the children, I wanted to be spiderman.
However yet again fate has bistowed upon me such shame as the children also laughed at me... I had to quit my job, i just
couldn't bear their judging eyes, looking up at me and laughing ""spiderman isnt real"" But it didn't stop me.

One fateful night i decided i have had enough, 
But it was that night when it came to me, the only person i had left suddenly came into my mind.... it was him... he had come
to save me from the shame.. as i lay on the floor with my wallet i prayed to Gaben. I needed it for my life..
he was the only one who could rescue me now. I sobbed upon my wallet until i finally fell asleep.. it was that fateful evening.. that my whole life changed.
The next morning i woke to my sweat stained clothes.. ""just one last time i whispered to myself... i logged into to steam.. i loaded up the steam store and there it was..

A story about my uncle. As i purchased it i screamed louder than a dying gypsie... my wishes had come true.. i could finally be..
Spiderman.

I called up my family and laughed in their faces
""I told you mum! i told you dad!"" i laughed and laughed.. ""Only thirty years have gone but now i can finally become him!""
I can finally be..
Spiderman.

I whispered ""I love you Gaben"" as i ran the game for the first time.
Because this was the first time in my entire life where i was finally happy.

Spiderman is love.
Spiderman is life"
13122,"Very very interesting and exciting game, very like this game. =)"
13123,"one of the best games ive ever played !!! if you like an adventure, abit of a challenge, and some patient game then this is good ;) loved it and the story was amazing 10/10 :)"
13124,"at the end you will have shivers.
nothing else to say.
"
13125,"A short first person patformer game. Nothing fancy about the story, but quite fun and challenging."
13126,"Would never recommend unless on a massive sale. It's a decent game, but horrendously overpriced."
13127,"[h1]Short Review[/h1]
This is definitively one of my highlights in my SteamLibrary. The design and gameplay is awesome. All the controls are very smooth. You can jump, high-jump and far-jump between platforms and you can use the grappling hook to reach each platform very easy.

Highly recommended for all indie and platforming fans. Even if you don't usually play platformer you should give it a try.

[h1]Design and Sound[/h1]
These developer like details. Its is awesome what you can discover in your journey through this world. I didn't expect that much from such a (relatively cheap) indie game. I made so many screenshots and will most likely use some of them in my desktop background cicle. The designer made sure to create a wonderful dream land.

[h1]Gameplay and Controls[/h1]
Well this a platformer, so you will mostly jump and grapple between platforms. Using static and moving objects to reach your target. Although I enjoy most games with a gamepad I had never tried it with this game. But in the options the gamepad was availabe for use. You can change key mappings, but I choose not to, because the default mapping was just fine. 
It was a little hard at the beginning to use the right mousebutton as power jump, but I got used to that after couple of minutes.
Besides the story (which I finished in about 2.5 hours) there are time challenges, collector and minimum-grapple-use challenges. To be honest, they are not easy.

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
There are not many story based achievements. In fact you don't have to do any of them during the story. There is the typical ""Collect everything"" and ""Explore everything"". But the other are just skill based. For example do every part without failing or with at maximum of grapple uses. These achievements are really challenging, so you will have to exercise each level a lot.

[h1]Rating[/h1]
I will rate this with a solid 10/10. The story and graphics are so good. And the challenges extend the gameplay by many hours."
13128,pls make a 2nd one where m'uncle comes back or i die of broken heart. i lov u
13129,"[h1]A Story About My Uncle[/h1]

is a great game...in the beginning you really don't get to see much, but after the first few minutes you explore the beautiful world. I finished the game in about 2 hours, I failed here and there but in these two hours I had about 4 or 5 ""oh my god"" moments...in the good way. As you enter and leave the chasms, it opens up a completly new world, different and way more modern than the village you were before.
[u]Long story short:[/u]
Graphics       7/10
Gameplay     6/10 (the controls were a bit weird from time to time due to glitching and stuff)
Voice acting 9/10 (really good overall just, not perfect I wasn't statisfied with uncle fred)
Storytelling   8/10 (the end when you find fred wasn't statisfying but the last scene made me kinda cry)
Animations    3/10 (you really need to work on those, the npc's and especially maddie looked stiff like ice..ha..ha yea okay ...)
Overall I would rate this game 8.5/10
"
13130,"They was a great game, 8/10"
13131,"This is a fantastic little game. 
Beautiful, challenging, facinating and doesn't outstay its welcome. It's nice to see such an unsusually imaginitive world brought so vividly to life in a game. 
The grappling gameplay is tight and natural once you've got the hang of it and the challenge never spikes too severely.
I was enchanted by the whole atmosphere of ASAMU, I hope to see more like this in the future!"
13132,I died a total of 213 times.
13133,"I think I would have found this game more compelling without attempts at storytelling. Although I love a good story, the execution of the narrative and dialog were both lacking. There was very little emotional payoff to the end to top off a consistently mediocre dialog/narration performance. The voice acting was at best believable, at worst downright awkward. Accents were all over the board and internally inconsistent. Fred himself was a decent performance, but only barely used. So, overall, a big 'meh' for the story elements. Although I will say, I did love the old-school whimsy of the environments. It's nice to see characters and landscapes that aren't designed to be dark, depressing and 'realistic', so full credit for that.

The gameplay, though... was quite good. The mechanics were a bit odd to me at first, but they built up nicely. The ending puzzles were suitably difficult, and even adrenaline-inducing. There was only one gameplay aspect which I found to be truly bad, and that's the dash jump. With absolutely no control, I often found myself just barely overshooting a platform because I'd been a little *too* careful to make the gap. That's a frustrating feeling. I think making the dash jump have far less control than a normal jump is a good idea, but at least let us move a few inches for a bit of fine-tuning (or design long-reach platforms with backing walls/rocks to catch the player from over-jumping).

Overall, I'd say if you don't mind cringing a bit at a mediocre story, it's worth a go."
13134,"I picked it up long ago in full knowledge, that id play this in one sitting.
It quickly picked me up with its great story and setting, furthermore it had unbelievable charming voice acting. 
The basic mechanics of movement were pretty cool, though one or two jumps were a little bit tricky. Specially for the secrets. 
All in all, a great game worth every minute of it"
13135,Pretty nice. Fun swinging around... Interesting voice acting
13136,Fantastic game! I loved the story and seeing all the different environments! It was always a challenge but never too hard! I loved how you got new controls/abilities as you progress through the game and how it didn't feel like they were just for show. You felt like each added ability was actually required to progress through the games! I'd give it a 10/10! I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys 3D platforming and a good story!
13137,"A charming, dreamlike, game that is reminiscent of childhood. Total gameplay time for me was about two hours. Definitely worth a buy when it's 50% off.

Rating: 7/10"
13138,"A Story About my Uncle was an overall enjoyable experience. It's a first person platformer with a grabble beam similar to the one in the Metroid Prime troilogy. Progression is mostly linear but there are some places where you can take shortcuts. There's not much of a variety of tools that you'll be using, but it keeps the controls simple and lets you focus on building your skills. The graphics are nicely done and it runs very smoothly with antialiasing and motion blur. Although it seems liek it was designed for keyboard and mouse, I had no problem playing it with an Xbox 360 controller.

The character animation underwhelming. There's very little of it in the game and if feels very mechanical. The character designs don't match the quality of the enviroments and objects. The narrator's voice acting and recording quality is quite poor. It sounds like someone's reading it off the page and whoever's reading it doens't have a lot of experience speaking into microphones and it needs some equalizing. It's the only aspect about this game that feels unprofessional.  But the other characters actually sound pretty good.

Despite the simple controls, this game presents a few good challenges. You'll fall a lot but you have unlimited lives and it doesn't send you back too far."
13139,"Highly recommend this game - it is so pretty.  It's not very long, and just the right amount of challenging."
13140,"This game will aggrevate you in the best way possible. Its floaty physics and grapple mechanic make for an incredibly fun and challenging experience. This game nails the ""setting"" aspect with its beautiful scenery and vivid colors. Story was ok and length was quite short, but every moment felt fresh in that the game never got repetitive. 9/10 Would definitely recommend."
13141,"This game really seemed like it had potential, but ultimately fell short due to the core mechanics. The grappling hook felt more like a tractor beam due to its speed, and the requirement of it in nearly every interaction of the game made the experience very flat. It's a shame since the power jump/leap would have been enough to create a riveting experience on their own."
13142,"TLDR Version: 
    Good gameplay, Solid storyline, Decent graphics, Pretty short but still worth the money though I'd suggest wait for it to go on sale for a few dollars off due to the length of it.

In depth version:
    Let me start by saying this is a yes-ish recommendation. There are some key things that need to be said about this. First, it's not explicit what the audience is for this game. The graphics, dialogue, and actors diction make it seem like it should be for younger ages (6-12). Yet the puzzles, storyline (and theme of it), controls and gameplay all make it seem like it was made for a little bit older ages (15+). It also wasn't all that long. The time you see, 118 minutes, was 1 straight playthrough with minor amounts of messing around/exploring, about 45 seconds of graphical tweaking, and an average amount of deaths/failures. All this being said, I, at 19 years of age, can officially say I enjoyed this game. The gameplay was new enough to keep me entertained but not side tracked by the story. If you're a graphics junky, this may not be your game. Models and animations are somewhat lacking but this is an indie game and it wasn't the main focus (though the animations for your character were perfect! Couldn't have been done better). Overall, 8/10 on a professional scale, 9/10 on an indie scale.
** I should also note I got this on sale for $2.00."
13143,"Overall, the game is wonderful. I quite enjoy the story, seeing [spoiler] the two different types of villages, one very traditional and one that has advanced through technology [/spoiler]. However, the game was quite short. I got through it in 1-2 hours, and then redid some of the first missions to try and extend the playtime. Overall, the story was sweet but the game is short. I picked this up for $4 from a coupon, which I thought was the best price for this game."
13144,"A Story About My Uncle: Its Gone North Games first game, and I have to say this game is just excellent. The story of the game is very unique, and about the game itself its just beautiful. The gameplay is sure fun, you get to feel like you're Spider-Man or some other flying hero. About the graphics, well they're cool I guess... like, the game is beautiful  and the character are cute but they could improve that a little, and about voice acting, well they made a very good job. I myself, really love the voice acting of the characters in here. I highly recommend this game guys, its just fun and lovely!"
13145,"First things first I gotta put it out there: First Person Spiderman.

The game is as the description says, if you're not looking for a platformer then don't get it, BUT me on the other hand did not read that before buying it and I don't regret it one bit. 

The world you step into is the type of world you would have dreamt up as a child, the story gave me a sense of longing the type you make with those special types of people or friends and I found the gameplay fun and challenging at points.

The only things I have to put down is the game is quite short, and there are a few bugs similar to Halo 2's superbounce or long distance sword lunge where I found myself skipping a whole cave by lining myself against a wall and using the graple, as well as being able to access some areas and others that wall you off, again letting me bypass certain minor puzzles.

All in all it's a great game to play if you're into puzzle platformers with a very interesting grappling mechanic and a story that wishes there was more. Hoping for a #2."
13146,"I do not want to spoil this game, but if you love a nice story and exploring then you should get this. Safe for all ages and fun for all ages must pick up."
13147,A unique fps puzzle game.  Lots of fun to run around.
13148,Like Spider-Man running out of web cartridges
13149,"It's a really nice story and a beautiful game, but it is a tad short. I had quite a bit of trouble with some parts, but I still finished it in basically one sitting. If it's on sale, getting this is a no-brainer -- if you enjoy games like Mirror's Edge or Portal, you can consider getting it at regular price too."
13150,"I had a hard time playing this game with a controller, but I managed somehow and although I died A LOT I really enjoyed playing this game.
It looks really nice, the music is good and I don't remember what I payed for this game but I'm pretty sure it was worth the cost."
13151,La o be»õ√Æe merge!!!
13152,"One of the prettiest games I have ever played. Fantastic game, not very long, doesnt need to be. 9/10"
13153,"Yea sure, It looks kinda pretty, but that barely helps when you have to get horredous dialogue, awful voice acting, terrible controls, terrifying animations, it\s too damn dark to see anything, and god awful pacing. My favourite part of a speed platformer is having to start and stop constantly because I can't see and black rock spinning next to other black rocks, with a black rocky background."
13154,it's fun! like spiderman!
13155,"My journey was extremely short, but extremely enjoyable. The story, voice acting, and graphics were some of the best I have ever seen in a game. I would have LOVED the game/story to have been longer, but I can confidently say that this was a $13 well spent."
13156,"I cannot reccommend this enough.

The 13 dollar price tag might seem a bit steep for a 2-hour game, but believe me, it's worth it. That being said, grab it on sale if you can.

On to the game.

Gameplay is very solid and extremely enjoyable, if a bit frustrating at times. Certain puzzles can take a bit of trial and error before being solved.

Story is amazing and legitimately made me cry a little at the end with the feels.

Overall, a 10/10 experience. This game is incredible.

TL;DR

Pros
-Amazing Story

13157,Story is hard to follow. Got lost on what I was supposed to be doing and where I should be going and quit.
13158,Fun little game with just the right amount of challenge when you've got 3 hours to kill.
13159,"Let's get this out of the way: the story is pretty weak and the character models are pretty wince-worthy. That said, pretty much everything else about this game is great. You won't be killing anything or having any combat whatsoever, which are normally things I prefer in games, but I had a ton of fun in this game without there being anything to kill or fight.

This game is all about making cool jumps, grappling/hookshotting to stuff midair multiple times, and other such stuff. I wouldn't call it a twitch game because my reflexes are crap, and I managed to complete it without too much trouble. If you enjoy maneuverability from a first person perspective, sailing through the air, and pretty scenery with soft music, then you will like this game. Granted, if you told me that's what was in this game, I sure wouldn't play it, but I'd be missing out. If you can get this game for like...3-5 U.S. dollars, then go for it; quite fun."
13160,"This is IMO a hidden gem of a game. 

- Its quite a short game but it has an interesting story 
- Acceptable graphics that will run smoothly on a potato
- Music that immerses you into the world

The main point of the game though is the grapple. It doesnt dissapoint :).

13161,A short but quite delightful little romp.
13162,KB+M > Controller
13163,"I got this game on a sale, I really regret it because it worth full price.

A story about my uncle is a great combination of storytelling and playfull physics platforming.
I got so immersed with the game that every time I was jumping unintentionally was leaning on my chair to the direction I wanted to land in game.

Also when I got it I was expecting something more on a way of ""Dear Easther"", the game style that I call interactive storytelling, but I had so much fun with the platforming and in that way it was more like portal, just you know without portals.

I enjoyed the game and the story was the best bedtime story I ever heard."
13164,"Very well done story and great narration, was on my toes till the end.  Play this game you won't regret it."
13165,"It's worth it on sale. Very short. Clever/unique game mechanics.  I wish it was longer, though, also should be in VR."
13166,"I spammed my Screenshot Key so much that it Broke.

"
13167,"In this game the rule is simple: don't fall! It is very entertaining, from the beginning from the epilogue, some levels maybe tough, but with a good look you can find where to go and try to get there; sometimes it can be easier, but the levels are very funny and the views are very cool. Simple commands and a good story make this game a gem of videogame.
Great game, I enjoyed it."
13168,"""Told you you could not do it.""
Did anyone in your studios have ever managed to get through that level in 5 tries?

Sorry but;
Nice graphics, bad level design."
13169,its the best game ever its realy short but fun i hope they will do secend game or more levels because this game is amazing
13170,"I dont really review stuff as its not my style, but im going to make an exception after having just completed the game. Its harder that in looks, while it only took almost 4 hours for me to complete I found there were many parts that took many attempts. Lots of emotions for a game. Mostly anexity though from not getting a check point after doing a few very hard parts in a row. However the game is stunning visually. Just take it in as you walk around and explore there is so much to see and if you rush youll miss things. Im looking at you ice whale. Its worth a try and spending some time playing. A must have game when its on sale. 8/10 because I think I devleoped vertigo while playing."
13171,well...that was just enjoyable. 'Nuff said.
13172,"A Story About My Uncle is a great 3D Platformer and is very underlooked.

[h1] Pros [/h1]

Great Story

Fun Gameplay

Excellent Viewpoints

Cheap Price


[h1] Cons [/h1]

Character Models could have been a lot better

Very short, beat it in 3 and a half hours

If you were planning to perfect this game (Achievement wise) you're going to need to get your brain examined


This is a very great game, despite how short it is, you will still have fun playing."
13173,A nice little game that will keep you busy for a few hours. It is brobably 1 of my favourite puzzle games of all time and the way it is done is nothing short of amazing. If it had DLC i would play the s*** out of it. 10/10 would rocket boots again.
13174,"Loved this game. It felt unique in the art and feel of the game, but learning and playing feels natural. The story was cute and had a bit of emotion put in. Only issue was that it dident last me very long. Still, I definitely pick this up again"
13175,I liked the aesthetic and the platforming but I was a little dissapointed at how short the game was
13176,"great game short story but the story is great game to.                                                                                                                            the hole game you have to do cool parkour moves its so cool 
"
13177,fun and brutifulgame . im the real knut
13178,"A really beautiful game but quite short, finished it in 2 hours."
13179,"A very short but sweet experience.

Get this game when it's on sale, not really worth the full price when you only get to play it for a couple of hours."
13180,"Un juego corto pero muy entretenido con una buena historia, lo musho :)
8/10
"
13181,This game is very good it is kinda short but has a great story (except for the ending) Still it is a good game and i had fun playing it.
13182,"Amazing graphics, pretty cool story. Though the grappling system got a bit fustrating towards the end."
13183,"One of the greatest platformer game of all time, a very touching story of a boy looking for his uncle."
13184,"This game gives you a domain and, by the end, you can excercise mastery.

It is no longer than it needs to be."
13185,Best first person game ever
13186,"A Story About My Uncle: Graphics are Beautiful, Sounds Good and Music was Nice. This game has a Great story and Gameplay is Running, Jumping, Boosting and using a Grappling Line. I have not had a platforming game in some time that move me to the point where I wanted to keep going to see what was going to happen next. I played it from start to finsh, It took me eight hour's to beat and The grapping got a little bit hard at the end of the game cause my hand's would be all sweaty. Now down to business A Story About My Uncle is a 8 out of 10"
13187,"Short but very staisfying first person platformer, great level design with solid game mechanics.

Good value for the miniscule price tag and worth every minute of game play.

Short but Sweet"
13188,"Picked up this game on sale. It looked interesting, but after buying it, I sat on it for about a month. Big mistake,
I love this game. Im into puzzle type games. If I knew it was this good, I would of started playing much sooner.
This is my first review, so I keep it simple and short. Buy it!!!"
13189,"-Took me 90 minutes to complete. 
-Some errors with grappling and getting stuck behind trees
-Not worth 12usd. (Max $6 USD)
-Couldn't really classify this as a game, more so a minigame.

+Graphics are absolutely awesome
+Storyline was great
+Music was good, fit the scenes."
13190,One of the best games out there!
13191,"~Warning: Spelling may fry your brain, I just got done streaming this after being up for 19 hours. I'm tired.

First off, Let me just say that I'm a very nitty griity reviewer. I make it a point to rub it in everyone's face what is wrong and what is right within a game, be it story, delivery, or the gameplay itself. It makes it hard to for me to say yes or no upon writing a review. 
Luckily: I didn't have that issue here.

Long story, short:
This game is short, sweet, charming, and... Hell, great to look at.
Playtime expected on first run: 2-5 hours
Overall Rating: 9/10

Cons:
My only issue with this game is the ""hitcheck"" system on the rocks, which can make you stuck for a short while. This is a minor issue though, as f7 fixes that at the cost of 1-3 minutes of progress at most; often only costing 30 seconds or less in most cases. 

Difficulty.
This game is a bit on the easier side with all the checkpoints, but getting from one checkpoint to the other can offer a challenge, which is fun.

The gameplay.
The gameplay takes a little getting used to, being a physics game. But after you adjust to the game, it does everything right. Nothing feels choppy, and this game doesn't try to be anything it's not. On top of it all, it's really relaxing and enjoyable.

The story. 
This story is so charming that in the end, I was left speachless. This gam- no, adventure, was thrilling to watch, as the story unravels. Be warned that the voice acting did feel a little monotone, but that did as much harm as it did good, and was enjoyalbe in the end.

The price.
It's slightly overpriced, but only if you plan on playing it once, like myself. If you are a completionist, you could be looking at a 10+ hour game, with unlockables and challenges to test your skills. It's also very nice to look at and explore when you can.

The breakdown:
I base my rating on 5 simple things: Gameplay, Story, Price, Stability, and overall experience within the game. The last one holds the most weight, as a cheap, wellmade, story rich game can feel worthless if it bores the Hell outta me.

Gameplay: 9/10 ~Fun to learn and play

Story: 9/10 ~It's a ride, with very little holes in it.

Price: 8/10 ~Not too pricy, and many things can be done to add to the game's lifespan.

Stability: 9/10 ~Game never crashed or critically failed on me once, and I streamed it on twitch the whole time. 

Experience: 10/10 ~I felt like I was in the game myself experiencing all of the marvel along with the character. 

Overall: 9/10 ~Worth the buy. Good for a calming night with nothing to do."
13192,"I'm recommending this game, but not enthusiastically... if that makes sense.  While refreshing in concept, this game remains a platformer, and regrettably, progresses much the same way.  Instead of progressing in a game by challenge, or by diversity of solutions, this game, like the vast majority of those out there, rely simply making it hard, and by hard I mean making it so one has to be very timed and very precise.  It becomes less about the game and its discovery and more about remembering the sequence of movements, timed just so perfectly right... what a waste.

This game is solid, decent story, gameply is good, graphics are good.  These are reasons why I am recommending it, but I'm pretty sure this game will not end up in most people's top 10 list of favorites; frustrating games... maybe.  This game actually reminds me somewhat of Mirror's Edge; hit the right buttons, do the precise movement, at the precise time... you live, otherwise, you're dead."
13193,"This game was very emotional. I loved the way it was narrated, and the interaction with Maddie, even the last part, with Fred, was a great one. The game itself is sort of a puzzle game, and you will find yourself restarting again and again because sometimes it takes some luck to do them correctly, pressing the button on just the right moment or at just the right angle for example."
13194,A short but fun game with very engaging mechanics. Wouldn't have payed full price for it but it is worth picking up on sale.
13195,"A Story About My Uncle is a wonderfullyenjoyable game about a father, as the title might suggest, recounting the tale of trying to find his uncle. This game is a platformer, where you jump and rappel incredible distances via a special suit left behind by your uncle. [u] The game's spectacular jumps combined with its story create a surprisingly sweet experience. [/u]

A Story About My Uncle's irresistable charm is established within the first few seconds of starting the game, and it never lets up. From the voice of the narrator to the scenery of the different locations you visit, [u] the game is both whimsical and peaceful[/u]; it is literally like being told a bedtime story about fantastic lands and faraway places. [u]Equal parts beautiful, breathtaking, and simple, A Story' About My Uncle delivers a satisfying story. [/u]

It can be argued that the game's length is a bit on the shorter side, clocking in at around 2 hours to complete the story. Yet, this succinctness lends itself to the fairytale nature of the game, never overstaying its welcome in any one setting, and quickly wrapping up when the story was done and told.

If it is one thing I would like to point out to the developers, it is the scene involving the giant eye worm in the caverns. I loved it! While not particularly difficult, as well as being a very short aspect of the game, the atmosphere it created was simply fantastic and fitting. Just as the eye worm really represented the setting it was found in (dark, strange cavern), I would have liked the other settings to also have their own equivalents. For example, [spoiler]in the final section of the ice caverns right before meeting your uncle, there is a massive frozen whale-creature at the bottom of the cavern. While its very existent is fitting of the surreal nature of the game, I would have liked to have seen more done with it.[/spoiler]

Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a sweet game that caught me by surprise with its incredibly huge jumps and fantastic story delivery,"
13196,Wow!!
13197,"Short and fun, kept me entertained. 

Recommended for those who are seeking for a quick adventure to pass time. Puzzles are not too complicated, yet the world can be slightly disorienting enough to give you a small challenge with them time after time. Game is very smooth to play and there are hardly, if any, issues at all with the gameplay. The story is interesting enough to make you want to go through it, and it's short enough for a single session. 

Nice little interactive bed time story."
13198,"Very fun, very poignant. Set in a beautiful world with a creative and interesting story. I liked it a lot. I'm not especially great at platformers and it took me about two hours to finish, but I could see someone doing it in 80-90 minutes on the first run."
13199,great!
13200,"This is a bad game. The story is really nice but the characters are annoying. I detest Maddie more than satan. The narrator is annoying as are all the voice actors because it sounds like they are talking to children, which I suppose they kind of are. But the writing seems really bad and the english seems choppy. The game itself has a great idea for the gameplay but it doesn't deliver as I was hoping. It feels awkward once in a while and distances are really hard to tell. But maybe I am just bad. It is a challenging game and the achievements are difficult to get which is a nice touch. I just felt like this game wasn't as fantastic as a lot of the reviews lead me to believe it would be. My recommendation is to get it on sale. It only took me 2 hours to beat. However, at some point I just got frustrated and started doing everything quickly, so maybe that is why."
13201,"I didn't really get into this game until some time after I had completed the main story and had started trying to get all of the achievements. The story is really short (about 2 hours), and I didn't really get the hang of smoothly jumping/grappling in that time, especially since simply finishing the story is incredibly easy. After I had done a time trial or two and got more skilled at navigating the large environments, the game became more fun, and finishing all of the achievements is very challenging. Still, I feel like the game is not as smooth as it could be, especially in the first half of the game. Often things are either trivially easy or just [i]frustrating[/i]. Getting stuck in parts of the environment is pretty common.

The story is cute in general, though it's fairly generic, and there are many groanworthy lines. Maddie's voice actor is good, though sometimes her lines are ungrammatical or weird... The other voice actors aren't very good. 

The visuals are great. Lots of detail in the scenery.

Achievement hunters beware: To get most of the achievements, you will need to replay entire levels many, MANY times, and these levels include unskippable cutscenes and repeated dialog. That's awfully annoying.

Probably the game would be good for kids. There isn't any violence or anything, and the story's difficulty is probably OK for kids. For adults, I'd probably recommend this game only if you like challenging platforming (as I do) and you plan on trying to complete some/all of the achievements, or if there's a really good sale that makes the ""OK"" 2-hour story worthwhile.

6/10"
13202,"A game you cannot ignore, A Story About My Uncle is a beautiful story-driven platformer that almost anyone can run at great frames. Gone North Games has created a very accessable title that you should pick up and have fun with! :)"
13203,"Take elements from Portal, Bioshock: Infinite and Dear Esther and mix them in the blender - the result?  A first-person platformer on floaty mountains with the narrative pacing of Dear Esther.  

You are a nephew who has discovered a suit from your uncle's laboratory that will take you to a mysterious place where rocks float on air.  The suit acts as a device that tethers platforms much in the same vein as Just Cause but with limited usage.  Like portal, the whole mechanic is soly based on that specialized item.  The passive narrative is driven by the player recalling his experience as you move on allowing the exposition to slowly reveal the elements of this strange new world and universe.  I would go on but that would go into spoiler territory.

Because I don't believe in a scoring system, I will present my review in binary fomat listing the postives and negatives of the game.  I believe it is up to the user to judge the content of the review rather than the overall value of the score:

+ Very polished for an indie title.  The UE3 engine runs optimially with nary a frame-drop at 60fps.
+ Control scheme is simple with utilizing only the directional keys, spacebar and the two mouse buttons.
+ Tethering system gives a sense of vertigo, like Bioshock: Infinite's rail-hook but with the flexibility of a grappling hook.
+ Voice-acting is well done and is presented without being too over-the-top nor does it take itself too seriously

- Even for a short game, the game has quite amount of level-padding.  
- Platforms can get very confusing esepcially how much agency you have over gravity.  Getting disoriented can happen on occasion that can throw off the player's sense of direction.
-  Some scripted occasions take control away from the player with micro-story elements.  It woud've sufficed being in the background just like the reset of the narrative.

Overall, it is one experience I highly recommend, especiallly for an indie title.  I hope to see more ambition from their games in the near future."
13204,---
13205,"This Game is a great 3D platformer with a great story and a really cool power suit you can't stop playing once you start. I bought this game a little bit back and never downloaded it but after i did i realized i had stumbled across a great game, i finished this game on the same day that i downloaded it and found myself wanting restart and find the extras. this game has the coolest suit that lets you swing around like spider-man, use roket boots like iron man and super jump like the hulk. I well and truley recommend this game to anyone and everyone granted you have a few hours of spare time to play start to finish"
13206,"Great little 4-hr game, especially for such a small dev team. The flying / grappling / rocket mechanics were a lot of fun, but I wish there were more attachment points and alternate routes to get through each level. The script and voice acting were also not all that great, but certainly not dealbreakers. It would have been nice to have some NPC or object interaction... it was a bit of a let down when I got to the first village and I couldn't do anything there. It really took away from the desire to explore outside of the pre-determined level paths. All-in-all, a fun game for an evening, especially if you can pick it up on special or in a bundle."
13207,"This is a first person platformer where you navigate levels with a grappling hook-type of device and rocket boots. There are a few parts that I found pretty tricky, but I found the game challenging enough without being too difficult to complete after enough deaths/tries. The environments in several of the areas are really cool and nicely done.

I liked it. The later stages of the game, after you have all your abilities available are fun; recommended if you like first person platformers."
13208,Beautiful metaphoric story. Interesting and unique gameplay elements that do not overstay their welcome due to the relatively short length.
13209,"One of the most unique platformers I've played. Environments were lovely and platforming was fun and challenging. The story itself was nothing special, but the gameplay more than made up for it. Definately worth a playthrough."
13210,"A beautiful and reasonably challenging game with a fun storyline. Five stars.

This is a very fun, visually stunning and at times quite frustrating first-person platformer. Game mechanics start out simple and build nicely throughout the game. Reaction time and planning are key, definitely use keyboard and mouse. The main story is short (shouldn't take more than four hours) but it engaging and entertaining. I've not yet managed a single achievement, the difficulty level outside of the main story is insane!"
13211,"Don't get me wrong. The game is visually stunning. Very beautiful scenery, nice music, it's like you stepped into a magical dream. I like the character designs of the frog people, and the story was okay. The idea of soaring in the air, being able to jump great heights is also a nice addition. However, I'm just turned off with jumping puzzle games. I have no patience for them and they are frustrating to the core. When you have to recharge your grappling hook as you're in the air, it's amazing the narrator's uncle didn't die on the way to where he was going...I would maybe recommend this to friends that are super artsy fartsy, but majority of my friends, I wouldn't recomment it."
13212,"I would only recommend this game if it was on sale. The maddie story should have been flushed out more to add more emotional depth in the beginning, but the overall story and gameplay was interesting enough to keep me playing through to the end. It's only about 2-3 hours long with collectibles and time trials, which just isn't worth it for $13."
13213,"Even tho the game it comes from a small group of develoupers, its actually really well made. I loved the whole game, yeah, sometimes you get bored of dying, but then you grab the ""mood' of the game and it becomes a game to remember for your whole life."
13214,this is one of the few games you will sit down an actually like
13215,"Great game that is short by itself, but all the achievements will add a few hours more. You should buy it, ESPECIALLY if it's on sale."
13216,"Atrocious voice acting and corny ass script aside, this is a fun first person platformer. A good steam sale buy."
13217,"If you get the chance, buy this game when it's on sale, you won't regret it^^
A little short in my eyes, but still very well made and the story is really cute too."
13218,"Wonderful game if you like first person platformers.
Swinging through the beautiful world with your grappling hook is just a fun and unique experience.
The challenge of the game is often in keeping your momentum when you swing from object to object and I found that to be a very fun and refreshing concept. 

The story of the game is also pretty interesting and since not everything will be explained into detail, it has some mysterious touch to it, which I personally liked, because it leaves the world as a mysterious place.

The game is pretty short. According to Steam it didn't even take me 3 whole hours to finish it, but every minute of it was enjoyable."
13219,"I do recommend this game, however I wouldn't buy it outside of a big fat sale. It's just not worth 12,99‚Ç¨."
13220,"Lovely casual game. Mid-difficult platforming from first person view. (I found it too difficult to complete with my xbox 360 controller,  so I had to change to mouse+keyboard to finish it.) Absolutely lovely story and atmosphere. I would love for my son to play this once he gets a bit older. Regularly overflowing with cuteness and feel good moments. :-)"
13221,"Wow, just wow! I was blown away by this game! It's truely a hidden jem. Even though it took me just under 4 hours to finish the campaign, I loved this game! Now I have to go back and find all the collectibles. I will 100% play this again, as I feel I didn't appreciate the work that went into this game the first time round. It's a feast for the eye and has a beautiful story. The gameplay is simple yet challenging. I bought this game on sale, but it's truly worth full price.

Buy it"
13222,A 3D platformer with innovative gameplay mechanics.
13223,"A Story About My Uncle is an amazing First Person Platformer game. There is too much spidey stuff. It's not a hard game nor a easy one except the glorious ""Achievements""...

+Graphics are beautiful
+Story is intense, absorbing and admirable
+Mechanics are good and different
+Narration (i think they should have agreed with Morgan Freeman for the ultimate epicness)

-The story is short (5 or 6 hours probably if you are not willing to play it over and over again like me)
-And of course the ""Achievements"", the bloody hard, sadistic, motherfucking ""Don't even try"" level achievements.

Overall there is not much to say it's a game that you should play. Everybody should play. I totally recommend it. 
"
13224,"A really short game for those who dream of swinging around like spider-man, but in caves, and meeting new beautiful scenarios, and looking for your uncle Ben - I mean, Fred - and also finding new creatures as you unfold small chapters of the story of your greatest adventure.

The graphics aren't top quality, but the colors and design make up for that more than enough.
The story is OK, not amazing, but not thaaat boring either.
The achievements are somewhat hard to get and I just noticed them after finishing the game, but never bothered going through it again just to get them.
I'd say buy this game if you have money to spare and/or if it's on sale. If both options are on your side, then do put it on your library."
13225,Amazing game but short.
13226,"Had a great time with this, voice acting is a bit ...bad, but the rest of the game more than makes up or it :D"
13227,"Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But Layton, I don't want to do the first person platforming!"" But you know what? A little first person platforming is good for you every now and then. First person platforming builds character and puts hair on your chest. So do it. Do the first person platforming. But maybe on a sale, because there isn't very much first person platforming to do in this game."
13228,% 100 suggested game
13229,"Ah, this game.

While playing it, every second of it reminded me of those fantasy adventures from my early childhood: beautiful worlds, strange people, danger and making friends with said strange people. The story itself is quite a generic adventure story, but it's interesting enough to keep you going.

I simply love the platforming concept of the grapples, boots and suit, it's just makes you feel so free. A single jump can be done in multiple ways and it's up to you how you want to do it, you aren't just limited to ""click spacebar to jump"". The only thing that I found to be bad about this game is the length of it, I finished the story campaign within 3 hours so unless you play on trying to get gold medals on all time trials, you won't be playing this for a long time.

I won't annoy you with any more details, I'll just say this:
-If you are a speedrunner, get this game.
-If you were anything like me as a little kid, get this game.
-If you...oh forget it just buy the damn game."
13230,"Short, but sweet, ASAMU is a first person platformer in which you follow your uncle's steps through several beautiful environments. The game is difficult, but I never found it to be frustratingly so, and the difficulty curve is well balanced. The game contains more story elements than I had expected going in, and these became a highlight of the experience for me."
13231,"I bought this for about ¬£3 during a sale. It usually costs ¬£10 which is ridiculous, the game took me 2 hours to complete, which is something you'd expect from a cheap game. The game itself was good but it's not worth it unless it's on sale."
13232,"This game. This game is possibly one of, the best games I have ever played. I love the mechanics, how you can just swing around, and that thrill of shooting through the air , and then hitting the ground softly, just wow. But enough of that, I also fell in love with the story, and the ending, oh the ending... It left me wanting so, so much more, and I truly do believe, that this game NEEDS a sequel. If you read this, please do buy the game, it is worth every penny, and I hope you love it as much as I did. (btw, hey, coffeestain, SEQUEL, and thanks for another great game :) )
"
13233,"First of all, I'm not the greatest at 3D Platformers. That being said, I hugely enjoyed this game. It's few hours of fun, with some really challenging parts embedded in a cute story.

It's doesn't take a whole lot of time to play through, but the concept is fun. The developers managed to keep it interesting with new challanges and various difficulities throughout the game."
13234,"Pros:
Great idea
Fun gameplay
Good puzzle platformer mechanics
Average graphics
Solid FPS

Cons:
GOD AWFUL STORY
Repetative
It needs more options"
13235,"Beautiful art, querky character models, stunning soundtrack, and a cute little story of adventure. 

A good buy, a good game."
13236,"Mechanics work well for the majority of the game, though there are a few clunky parts. Voice acting is pretty poor but story is a good palate cleanser in comparison to much of the grim shit on Steam. Overall, it's a quick play from a small studio, and worth a few hours of your time."
13237,If you don't like jumping puzzle games don't get this.
13238,"Some people really put a lot of love into this game, and it shows.  It's just gorgeous and pretty simple for the majority of it.  I didn't get frustrated until the near end, where the save points got less and less frequent.

The ending felt a bit abrupt, so as to not spoil it for others, Ill just say that I wish it had gone for an open world ish theme so I could have tried to complete one of the impossible achievements without starting a new game. 

The character models could have used some love, maddie will forever be in my nightmares.

If you like jumping puzzles and portal, give it a shot, you'll probably really enjoy it. 
"
13239,good game
13240,"Brilliantly simple, clever in execution. A great narrative of a father telling a bedtime story to his daughter in the background as a framework for your adventure. Definitely worth a playthrough!"
13241,"Well, it was a story, and it was about his Uncle. 

Great platformer, amazingly stylized graphics and decent story with a few decent characters along the way. If you love story or platformers, it's pretty solid, but I beat it in 3 hours, and that was me fcuking around trying to do challenges. I suck at platformers, so you can probably beat it in 1.5hours, maybe less if you rush. So, I wouldn't buy it for any more than $5 when it is on sale, but it's a great game."
13242,"A very nice story with fresh gameplay.
I enjoyed every minute up to the credits."
13243,"The game sports a fun core mechanic, but a middling story and awful voice acting limits its potential."
13244,"The Good:
Probably the best first person platformer I've ever played
Heartwarming story
Exciting level designs
Omg grapple parkour

The Bad:
Dialogue/voice acting seems poor (lost in translation?)
No real bosses or difficult segments
A little short

The Story About My Uncle follows a narrative in past tense of a man telling about his Uncle to what we presume is his daughter. There are a few secrets here and there, but the game is pretty much a grappling platform game with only additional grapples and booster boots as upgrades. The game is rather short, but pretty fun the whole way through. I think it did a good job making it first person, as that usually fails for platforming. Pick it up when it's low."
13245,"A great 3D platformers, in fact it's a reference in terms of controls. Story is very good and, at first I didn't care much then I was invaded by feels it was awesome. Very good."
13246,"Such a beautiful 3D platformer.
Difficult at times where I almost lost my shit but it was worth it. Made me smile like a dork at the end."
13247,"I Rate this game 10/9 cuz it was so demmm good! and like the story is amazing! i recommend u to play this game :D 
( this is a self experience game ! )
i finish this game under 2 hours so i wish that the game was longer but! this is like jurney with beutifull art and sound!
BUY NOW!!! :D"
13248,"A short but fun game. It can be frustrating and hard at times, but it certainly stays a good playthrough.
Really worth buying it when it is in sale."
13249,comfy game.  short though. fun to play grapple mechanics were fun.  good flow from learning the mechanics to using them to using them well.
13250,"Fantastic first person grappling platformer game! Sometimes I would have to exit in frusteration and try again the next day from a checkpoint, but made it through the Story in less than 6 hours over 3 or 4 days. And what really made me realize this was a great game was the fact that I always came back for more. Wish it were longer and had more gorgeous areas to lazer grapple hook through ;)  but I expect there to be a sequel or something... 
Give yourself a little time to get used to the controls and you will not regret this magical experience :D"
13251,"It's a very beautiful game, you could say, breathtaking sceneries, interesting ideas, a cute underlining story, etc.

But for me, all of this simply got destroyed through the gameplay. It does feel intriguing at first, when you enter the world of this game and try its mechanics, but soon i had to realise, that, despite the mechanics seeming rather simple (there are just 3-4), either it is very hard for me to understand the exact rules of them, or they just are inconsistent from start to finish, which resulted in a constant, unsatisfying game of trial and error, when it shouldn't be. It also becomes clear that exploration, or even just deviation from an intended path isn't planned, when interacting with objects away from that path is even more inconsistent, or you just start glitching through them. This results in zero immersion, ruining the rest of the experience.

So, i think it is sad, because i can see all the care and detail which went into it, but i still had no fun playing at all, nothing to think about when i stoped playing and no reason to replay it ever. So i can not recommend it."
13252,"Beautiful, amazing atmospheric platformer with a rather emotional story. A worthy pickup."
13253,"Well this game.



This game.

Amazing.

13255,"I really liked it.  It is a first person view and reminds me of portal a bit.  The story is just fun but not amazing.  A good buy.  Not a very hard game, and can be frustrating making some jumps but still fun."
13256,Pretty meh story telling and conclusion. Fun gameplay though
13257,"There is only one thing more DIABOLICAL then CRAB PEOPLE, and thats FROG PEOPLE, voiced by an adolescent SQUIRREL"
13258,Great story and game mechanics. Kind of short but worth it.
13259,"Pretty good game.  Fun and interesting physics based platforming.  Controls well.  Great atmosphere.  The world is interesting to take in.  It's got a very dream like quality to it. Its price is just barely justifiable given the length and no replay value (unless you enjoy speedrunning. This game is great for speedrunners).  I reccommend getting it on sale. Definitely a must buy for hardcore platforming fans even at standard price.  Everyone else should consider it at $8 or less.

7.9/10"
13260,one of the best games i've ever played! though lacks a bit of polish but still awesome game!
13261,"A Story About My Uncle is a FPS-Puzzle game where majority of the time, you would ""endlessly"" try to grapple your way through bizarre worlds and meet weird characters. If you like short FPS-Puzzle games where expected gameplay can be between 3-6 hours (or even longer?), this game is for you, especially if it is on sale. :)"
13262,"Very clever gameplay, the characters and story are also well crafted. And the scenery throughout the game is breathtaking! Although not very long, it keeps you interested until the very end, and makes you come back for more!"
13263,"First person platform game, with a beautiful story, amazing gameplay, stuning world.

This is the most beautiful game a played in a long time.

10/10"
13264,"Extremely nice story with calm and soothing male narrotor during the game, reminded of Bastion a bit.
Short, yet very powerful story that works.
Would recommend to anyone.

Also good for those who like challenges and collecting bits and pieces hidden around the world.

Note: Estimated game value in time - 2-5 hours"
13265,"GREAT GAME! Very strange name, but the game isn't strange; the game is actually very fun! The gameplay is difficult and uses basic physics, but if you like a rewarding challenge then this is for you!"
13266,"For me, I always prefer storylines than other things, and this game has simple, but beautiful and touching storyline. 
The game is intuitive and easy to play - if you are good at controlling it would take 2-3 hours and if you suck at controlling it would take 4-6 hours. (It took 14 hours for me because I slept without turning off)
The graphic and the movement of the player was fantastic. It felt so real and natural.
I felt like I am spider-man and iron-man at the same time:)
"
13267,Fun awesome game 10/10
13268,"TL;DR 8/10

A Story About My Uncle is a nice and short 2-3 hour adventure game. The story isn't deep or well developed but the movement mechanics fully make up for it. 

You play as an unnamed nephew searching for his uncle Fred, but theirs a catch, your uncle is at the end of a fantasy world of his own creation. It's now your mission to navigate this magical world using a suit fit with a grapple gun and later on rocket boots as well. 

Visuals: 8/10 
The game is graphically nice looking at distance and even mid-short range the graphics are still nice. However, if you get near the NPCs in the game they don't look so hot. 

Movement:10/10 
This games movement mechanics are flawless. You can so smoothly run, jump, grapple, and rocket you could spend hours just messing around seeing what you can do. It's very clear 99% of the developers effort went into perfecting the movement and map design. 

Map design:10/10 
The map is designed to be quite linear but it easily gives an appearance of a more open map concept so you never feel too confined yet you are never lost. 



Overall I'll have to give this game a 8/10. This isn't a must have game but if it goes on sale it's certainly worth buying."
13269,Nice game great story
13270,"While it didn't take long to beat, this game was adorable, the animation was unique, the game mechanic was entertaining, and the story was riveting. Excellent game."
13271,"Oh. My. God. I played it all in one day. When I say that I mean two things: Yes it is a short game, but I was also so addicted i finished it late on day on a school night. I reccomend this to EVERYONE. Buy it, now."
13272,"I wish for the narrator not being so tired next time, as this story might be entertaining, but too short, meaning I had to lay in my bed for almost an hour before finally falling asleep.
Hopefully I will hear it again soon."
13273,"Fantastic and short mix of adventure and puzzle solving. The graphics is absolutely fabulous and fantasylike, just what the game needed"
13274,A charming game that is as interesting to play as it is visually pleasing to look at. Thoughtful puzzles that reward you for being creative.
13275,"If you liked ""A tale of two brothers"" like me,

This is the same, just much, much better.

9.5/10"
13276,"Beatiful story, good graphics and intuitiv gameplay and features. 10/10"
13277,"A Story About My Uncle is probably one of the better games I've played n the last couple months. It's short, atmospheric without ignoring good gameplay, and incredibly simple. The story told isn't ""the greatest ever"", but there are certainly layers the be interpreted.The narration is good, and the flow of the story is such that you don't experience many ""lulls"" where you ask yourself ""what am I supposed to be doing?"". Well worth the 3 and a half hours I spent playing the game to completion."
13278,"One of the most awesome and beautiful games i have played. 
It feels great to run, jump and fly with your grabber like there is no limits. The history is not very deep, but it is enough. You have to see the gorgeous scenarios and the fabulous ambientations where the game takes place. And when you end the game, wich is not too long :(, you can have fun trying to get all the achievements and trying to win the gold medal on the speed trials of every level.
You should definitely check out this game."
13279,"First off let me say that I would absolutly recommend this game. From the stunning art design, the intresting story, and the drop dead beutiful mechanics, this game did not hold back. However, this is not a game is not easy on any acccount, many parts of the game require split timing and reflexes to make it through a stage, and if you fail it, you have to repeat the part that just took you 50 tries to get through. This game was a journey, and if you have the patience and the skills that this game takes, it is worth a play. 

Overall 8.8/10"
13280,"By far one of the best games i have played in a long time. Its story is not the best but the game makes up for it with its great gameplay and difficulty. many people said that the story is to short for what they paid, i agree if you pay the full 12 or how ever much it costs but i got it for 4 and i think that is was a very fair price for what i got out of it. I got 5 hours into the game before completeion but about 3-4 hours of gameplay. 

Pros:
great gameplay
presents a challenge
pretty good story
mostly good preforming

Cons:
can get bad frames at times
the ending leaves the desire for a second game but there isnt one

8.15/10


UPDATE: Still my favorite game that I have ever played."
13281,"From the makers of goat simulators comes the latest grappling-hook-flying-thing-in-super-cool-places-with-smooth-references-to-other-things Simulator, except it's a bed-time story. Still good though."
13282,"Solid gameplay, a nice little story and superb, free-flowing platforming. The pace is as fast or as slow as you want it to be, the soundtrack is very well suited to the environments, which themselves are eerily beautiful, and the story is simple and clear, providing a superb backdrop to the game. The levels are very open, and you can pick out your own route across the environment - it doesn't feel at all constrained. The challenge increases naturally throughout the game, and it's very satisfying to learn how to use the new abilities and gameplay features in series. There are also hidden extras to the main story which add that extra dimension to the game's feel.

It is, however, a very short game - I completed it in 3 hours. As it's a story-based game, I feel like going back and playing it again would rather miss the pont - there wouldn't be that same sense of discovery. A such, replayability is pretty low.

I bought it on sale at 66% off, making it ¬£3.39. At this price, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who likes good, solid platforming, or a nice, simple, beautiful story-telling game. At full price, you'll have to make your own decision."
13283,"This is a a really nice platformer. I liked the concept and the game also adds a new mechanic every level. Unfortunately this game is very short. It didn't even take me 2,5 hours to finish it, and the replay value is only within the achievements, which are not that much of interest to me.
If you like 3D platformers with a sweet story, and it's on a massive discount go ahead and grab it."
13284,"It's okish in terms of story and graphicstyle, but it's way too easy. Also i miss the speedy-thing in, speedy-thing out physics if i may put it like this. You have no flow in it, every jump feels like a single action with moreoften than not endless time to think about it. Buy this game if you have never played platformer before/are not so into complex mechanics and like a relaxing story. Avoid if like platformers."
13285,this has one of the best story and its awesome
13286,"One of the best looking games with amazing scenery, it satisfied all those childhood imaginations i used to have. The grappling hook mechanic is definately interesting and fun to use, though i thought they could of added more levels and more items to change it up abit. I found it sometimes slightly too easy or predictable, however overall it was a very enjoyable game."
13287,"A well-made, beautiful and challenging game. Well worth the money spent."
13288,"Oh my God.  Far and away standout best game I bought during the summer sale.  Pretty and creative like Myst, controls are a really generous and fun platformer with a grappling hook, and the framing device is absolutely adorable.  Nonviolent as far as I can tell from an hour and a half in.

I don't think I'll get a lot of replayability out of this and it can't possibly be all that long (gotta be several more hours), but if you're going to play just one game all the way through, this has GOT to be one of the best on Steam, no exaggeration."
13289,A wonderfully charming little indie game about a boy looking for his inventive uncle in a strange and mystical world. The settings are beautiful and the spider-man/parkouresque gameplay entertained and challenged consistently through the two  and some hours story.
13290,"I highly recommend this game, It has a great story line and amazing visuals. The graphics are cartoony but that is what sells it to me. The music is subtle but great. I beat this game in only about two hours so yes it is a very short game but a very well made and thoughtful game at that. I would say only buy it when it is on sale as that is what I did but make sure you do buy it when it goes on sale because it's well worth it in the end"
13291,"A Story About My Uncle is a good game I'd have to say. It has fun and easy to use mechanics that are very unique and I would definatly reccomend the play if you enjoy playing small story driven 3d platformers. Don't go in expecting much though. I beat it in only 6 hours, but had a blast doing it."
13292,THis kind of storybook game makes me want to give it to my children to show them just how great an adventure they can go on with just a video game
13293,"Has more potential and just fails due to lack of polish. Has a very Mirror's Edge vibe but with too many variables and not being fully aware of what you can attach to or distance wise, causes myself to fail jumps. The problem solving is tough but not impossible, just the controls could be better.

The voice work is pretty off, especially the narrator. You play as a child but I never really got the vibe that I was a child. Was taken out of the experience when I met the first creature character in the game. Just looked very bland compared to the environment that seemed gorgeous. Another thing that seemed off is the way you use your grapple ability. Just seemed to fload toward something instead of being tugged over to the object.

While I don't recommend this game it could be something special if it was retooled and updated."
13294,"As most people are saying: the game is short, possibily to a flaw. It could have done a lot with a larger budget. It is especially sad considering how fun the game is. I also feel ike the voice acting is a weakness, which is unfortunate considering that the plot is good.  Unlike what other poeple are saying, the game is not difficult. At times I would go through half a dozen checkpoints without dying. The whole game took me four hours.

Bottom line: The game is just as fun as it looks, and just as short as everyone says it is. I wouldn't call it an exceptional game, but if it looks like fun to you, you'll probably enjoy it."
13295,"A very touching story with great gameplay! 
It gave me a tear to my eye! 
Fun, creative and still a bit challenging!
A must buy, even at full price!"
13296,Best game i've ever seen.10/10 I comfirm!!!!!You must play this game!!
13297,awsome game loved it but finished it really fast so i refund it worth the money when on sale
13298,Amazing for an indie. Kudos to the devs. But a bit difficult towards the end.
13299,"They should have called this 'A Story About My Super Jump, Laser Grappling Hook, and Awesome Rocket Boots'

Short and sweet. Pick it up if you're into experimental first person movement systems and not prone to motion sickness."
13300,The most good 4 hour of my life :3
13301,"Short and sweet. Like great indie games, they keep it simple, focus on a couple of fun and nteresting game play mechanics and deliver an interesting story along the way."
13302,"I feel like this would more aptly be named A Storty About Me Constantly Falling To My Death.

The grappling hook mechanic is neat, but some of the levels are laid out in such a fashion that I am incapable of completing them.  I gave up on the game after spending 15 minutes dying in the exact same spot, over and over again... I'd prefer if the game wasn't so linear, maybe having more than one path through an area.  Perhaps something for the twitch gamers and something for old curmudgeons like myself."
13303,A surprisingly well crafted and fun game with a decent story to boot.
13304,"This game was... interesting. The core mechanics are pretty simple...There is an enhanced jump, long jump, and a grapple and you have to navigate your way through ""levels"" or ""sections"". The game overall is pretty short (Took me about 3 hours to complete) and the story is a little lackluster but was a pretty enjoyable experience overall. There aren't too many games similar to this one so if its on sale I would go ahead and pick it up. I won't lie, at the end there are some frustratingly difficult parts where I may have gotten angry at my computer...but the overall atmosphere of the game made up for it."
13305,"The most relaxing game I have played in a long, long time. I wasn't frustrated when I fell. Something about the atmosphere of the game made me feel that falling was just part of the game, that it was OK. Most games punish failure with your character screaming or meeting a violent death. A Story About My Uncle avoided that without a cheesy recovery that prevented you from actually dying.

All said, that was a two hours well spent. I wasn't even mad when it was over. I will definitely revisit this game in a few months."
13306,"10 out of 10 
its a super fun game with a good story i just recently got this and have enjoyed playing every part so far i would recomend this game to anyone who likes playing adventure, open world, story games!"

A superbly-written and produced adventure. Easy to learn (though a little too steep an increase in challenge at some of the end points for an otherwise fantastic ambient and atmospheric game). Kudos to the writer, who clearly loves his daughter very much.  :)

Thanks for reminding us of the humanity and heart behind our adventures. Best of luck in the future.

13320,"It was short, but I loved every second of it."
13321,"The game was good but it was far from great.

Pros
-Great platforming elements
-Amazing enviornments
-Tells a soft hearted yet enjoyable tale
-Great speedrun game

Cons
-I beat it in less than 2 hours... Really.
-Low replay value unless you are into speed running and collectible finding.
-Not worth the full cost, I got it on sale for about $2.44. I wouldn't pay more than $7 for this game.
-The animation of the creatures is a bit off and they don't really interact with you very much.

Overall I am mixed on this game. I loved the platforming mechanics it had but I also felt it could have been a bit more challengeing and longer. I would play the game if you like platforming puzzle games but aside from that skip this title becuase you will beat it in about 2 hours."
13322,"Ees sooper gud
tenouttaten"
13323,"The game looks nice, but the writing and voice acting are somewhat terrible.
The gameplay has potential, but it feels like a tech demo.  You never do anything other than follow the glowing markers.  
It's fun at first, but gets tedious very quickly.  

I got it for $2.50, it might be worth checking out if it's on sale for that much again.
Otherwise, I cannot recommend it."
13324,"This game had an enormous amount of potential. The basic grappling and movement mechanics are amazing, but the game feels severely rushed and cut short. The early stages have excellent pacing and aesthetics with clever variations on using the grappling and movement mechanics. There is even a fun ""boss fight"" near the beginning that requires timing your movement so you aren't seen by the boss. But inexplicably (other than the game being rushed), there are no other boss fights in the game. There is a fun endlessly-falling-platforms section, but I don't consider that a ""boss fight"" since there really should have been other sections like it with some variation.

The rushing becomes increasingly apparent as the game wears on because you mostly end up either repeating more of the same tricks or doing the same thing but with more difficulty. Requiring the same tricks with increasing difficulty is not necessarily bad but it should be interspersed with new ideas and other content. The end game just becomes a grind of doing tricks without much exploration beyond finding the necessary surfaces.

The end game also suffers from what appears to be a lack of design and testing. Sometimes you can easily and obviously skip things that would otherwise be difficult. Yet other times you have to go through a rapid and convoluted series of precise actions to just barely reach the target.

The game is also very short. I wasn't in a particular hurry, yet I beat the game in 2.7 hours. If the game were longer, and the quality from the early game carried over to the end game, I would recommend the game. However, I can't recommend the game as it is."
13325,"It's a nice game, but extremely brief. Might be worth it if it's on sale for $2-$3, but wouldn't recommend getting it at MSRP."
13326,"Amazing gameplay, along with an easy to follow story. However the game is quite short, really only taking about 3 hours."
13327,"What a challenge this game was, and a fun one indeed.
This game is a GEM, and had a phenomenal storyline and interesting spider-man like gameplay.
This is a solid 8/10. And all the points mainly come from the amazing storyline and unique gameplay.
Pick it up if you need a break from your fast paced life style and want a doped out platformer.
"
13328,"[h1]Disclaimers: [/h1]

[b](1)I played only 95 mins before I decided to return it. The farthest I was willing to try is just shy of the rocket-pack. This is roughly 2/3rds of the game, and I probably could've completed the game within the two hours of the new refund policy. I don't want to rip the devs off when it didn't meet my expectations. That's why I returned the game.

(2) I respect the intentions of the devs with what they wanted to accomplish, so I am going to probably be nicer out of sympathy. However, I don't think this is a must-have game or an experience worth buying anytime soon.[/b]

Please take any criticsm I have with these caveats.

The initial impressions of this game had me interested to get this game on a sale based on its short length. The mechanics looked fun and unique, and the story seemed full of wonderment.

Sometimes I really do like the narrative-focused games that run around 2 to 3 hours. More polished storytelling and gameplay segments for a reasonable price is what I look for in these kind of games (Portal 1 and 2, Thomas Was Alone and TRI: Of Friendship & Madness).

And within the first thirty minutes, I was enjoying myself. Then after stopping after shortly an hour and a half to see how much of the game I had completed, I asked myself just what was I really getting out of this game. 

[h1]Problem with Linearity in Gameplay, Not Linear Stories[/h1]

Once you get the intial set-up and the gist of the gameplay mechanics (grappelling and power-jumping), the game doesn't seem to progress to anything more challenging or does anything different to offer variety with the mechanics. 

Although there are sometimes small deviations in the paths you choose, you still feel like the gameplay has only one solution and you are trapped within a corridor.

A similar problem I have had with games like Magnrunner Pulse and QUBE is that the puzzles are scripted with only one solution. It's not a matter of using your powers to solve a room; the puzzle is doing everything in the correct order to reach the end. 

Besides the story-bits, the optional seismographs are lackluster; they're not elaboratively hidden in the levels, and they don't provide much to you other than a few unlockables fpr achievements. 

Even though the environments make you feel like there's a whole world to explore and absolute freedom at your disposal, there was nothing to set me off-course or extra challenges for choosing to go one route over the other. A corridor with a skybox canvas in disguise. 

[h1]A Small Story Told as An Epic[/h1]

Much like the environments, the story also feels like something made much bigger than it actually is.

Your Uncle Fred went missing months ago, now you wander in this dimension with some small clues about where Fred went. He was some entrapenour scientist/inventor who became obssessed with his creations and they took him to another, magical world he inadverently created. 

Good idea for a story, but not enough for this game. And there's not enough of motivation for the player to care.

There are some optional story-bits that flesh out characters like Mad Maddie and her relationship to Fred or of the protagonist and his attachment to his uncle from one of many adventures. Moments like these are so few and far between the experience, and some of which are hidden as details on the walls as notes, that you might overlook them entirely. 

But other than these small glimpses of a narrative, I didn't feel any attachment to the protagonist. That's the failure of the narrative being given towards the player; the question I kept asking, ""Why should I care about this uncle of yours? He sounds like a farce.""

Here you have the narrator saying how awesome his uncle is and recalling some part of the in-game story in past-tense (so he obviously comes back home). I couldn't really get too attached to someone who keeps telling me how awesome his uncle is.

I'm more interested in my invovlement: What am I, the player, doing? Why should I care? What makes me invovled in the plot when it's been done already?

Perhaps it wasn't the story itself but the delivery of the narrator that drew me away. He is far too monotone without any reason to be--the guy has an uncle who creates jetpacks and alternative dimensions!

Maybe the narrator is supposed to be a blank-character that makes you want an uncle like Uncle Fred. Or perhaps you are the son/daugher of the narrator dreaming up the story about this uncle. (I'd believe that interpretation).

But it's not just a lackluster character that ruins the story. The world itself raised more questions that were never answered. Why is everyting in this world floating islands? Why did Salamanders evolve into people (yes, I know they were transported here in a hidden story-bit by Uncle Fred when he took in those eggs) but what led to their cognitive evolution? 

Maybe I am not supposed to ask these questions. Or maybe I'm left to imagine the answers. The problem is nothing from the characters or the world made me grow any attachements. Only in the visual presentation.

For example, you stop by the Salamander village for the first sign of Fred. You don't really talk to anyone other than Mad Maddie, and then you  get their crystal from the elder. Off you go again to find Fred . There's simply not enough time to spend there to grow attachments to any character or place in a game where that should be the focus of its time.

[h1]The Game is What it is[/h1]

Lackluster despite all the care put into the game.

If this game was a proof of concept to flesh out a future game, I would be happy because there is the potential for something amazing in its mechanics and for the game to bring out a charming narrative. 

The game, if it ever gets a sequel, needs to remember the golden rule for stories, ""Show, Don't Tell"", because then we might be able to immerse ourselves in wanting to find our uncle in a strange world rather being told to find him. (Maybe some harder obstacles/challenges too.)

But above all for any narrative-focused titles in the future, the game doesn't need padding for the sake of artifical length; let us immerse ourselves in the world you create at our discretion as the player. Let us discover these worlds; let us discover these bonds we create; let us learn through our involvement why we care for something."
13329,"Absolutely beautiful game, best five bucks I ever spent. I was VERY UPSET when it was over! I just wanted it to last forever. If you're thinking about buying it and can't decide, just get it. It's more than worth it while it's on sale, even when it isn't on sale it's worth it."
13330,"I have one and only one complaint about this game. It's far too short. By the time the game was ending, I felt that I had only just begun my adventure. I would have liked to see more environments and more boss monsters to get past besides the first one you encounter. A longer game would have supported the story too as you continuously stumble upon more villages, constantly hearing about how you just missed your uncle by a few days, adding an air of mystery around him. I got to the ending and I have to say it was really anticlimactic. I thought I was moving on to another challenging area, and was dissapointed to find out that that was it.
Other than that, this game has everything spot on as far as gameplay goes. It's worth a play if you're into platforming games of any kind."
13331,"A heartwarming and beautiful, albeit short, game.  For the length, I'm not sure it's worth full price.  I didn't find the difficulty an issue, nor the spacing of the checkpoints."
13332,"The game was really great. I enjoyed the gameplay and the graphics were phenomenal. It was really challenging and took me a few tries at some points. The only thing that I would have to say is that the game is really short and only took me 3 hours to complete. Also the game has no re-play value. After beating it, there isn't really anything to do. So I would say to get this game and enjoy but it only last for a couple of hours."
13333,"I wanted at least one achievement. And I thought that Maddie's Challenge can be that one! 
When I heard Maddie's voice for the first time I found it cute.. But when she's saying all over and over again that I coldn't do that challenge I started to hate her. 
Well. After an hour of jumping like idiot I finally have that one achievement! I'm proud of myself"
13334,I absoultely love this game. The story is amazing and it was totally worth the money. It is very challenging and very fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested.
13335,"This game is nothing more than a lame jump'n run with a predictable plot, awkward NPC's, high frustration and a tedious follower.
You search for your uncle who vanished through his own garbage disposal invention and after you follow him you find yourself inside another world with lots of garbage and frog people. You have a grappling hook thingie and a jump thingie and can fly somewhat through the air but don't go explore too much cause often you'll get stuck on a rock with no way back (there's savepoints only). Even following the normal path isn't that easy because if you finally find out where the hell you have to go, you have to grapple on one of those tiny flying pebbles to get whirled onto another one, and - oops, hit your head on the rock, missed the rock due to the flipping camera angle and fall down. Again. Again. Again.
This is the whole gameplay, basically.
There's one follower who rides on your back, a frog girl named Maddie who is the stereotypical tomboy who gets sent home by the stereotypical village elder and (surprise surprise) sneaks out to help you on your quest.
To make it short, I bought this for 5 ‚Ç¨ and would've gotten a large pizza for the money if I had saved it. 
I wish I had that pizza instead."
13336,"This game surpassed my expectations. A great hidden gem that is hiding behind a weird name. It is a bit short, and I would have liked to see some puzzle element added to make it more challenging."
13337,"This game is entertaining and challenging at the same time with a narration style that I have not encountered before. The only problems I have with this game are replayability and game length. The main story finishes in only a couple hours if you are going slowly and there are various points where the game forces you to walk slowly and none of the conversations can be skipped no matter how many times you hear it. Naturally, that makes replaying the game very tedious. 

Due to the length of the game (~ 2 hrs with mistakes made) and the unskippable cutscenes ruining its replay value I cannot recommend this game unless it is on steep discount."
13338,"I saw this game at 92% Positive reviews, and checked how long people played it, saw 2-3 hours. Game's visuals* and videos didn't seem to worth buying it, so I thought it must be a great adventure, platform, scenario/story or fun game. 

It's a fictional adventure-platform game, but it's not fun.

[*] It has a *beautiful atmosphere, but that's all. The rest is a clich√©. 
[*] I didn't find its story new, genius, funny nor emotional. 
[*]I  thought playing this game is something challenging. But it's obvious that its gameplay is glitchy, repetetive and annoying after fifteen or twenty minutes when the player starts to make mistakes.

I didn't want to disagree with people who recommend this, but these are the truth. 

[b]Only thing I recommend you is to try-before-buy this game.[/b]"
13339,This game was an ambitious reimagining of spiderman 3
13340,"I would really wish I could recommend this game, like, REALLY. But here are quite a few things that that for me just take out all joy of playing it. From the reviews i expected a game where you just run and fly and soar through the air, endlessly free, but what i got was basically a well animated ""falling of a cliff simulator"".

anyway, I¬¥ll list pros and cons as far as I played:

PRO:
-it looks nice
-great atmosphere
-the Idea
-lots of checkpoints
-lots of funny little details to be found

CON:
-if you don¬¥t do it ABSOLUTELY EXACTLY one hundred percent the way they ment it, have fun falling of a cliff.
-slightly bumping into rocks sends you bouncing off them in a way that gets you falling off cliffs.
-if grappled to a moving object and you look the wrong way for a second, you guessed it, you fall off a cliff.


Result: I find the game immensly difficult to master and to play. Maybe I¬¥m just too bad for it. If you¬¥re a total pro, you can go play it i guess."
13341,Awsome game and i would recomended people to play this game
13342,"This game is simply amazing. I love the storytelling, the gameplay feels smooth. Like I said, simply amazing. Just buy this gem."
13343,"There are few games that feature a grappling hook mechanic, fewer still are ones that are in first person and 3D, allowing you to feel the rush of chaining together multiple grapples together freely. A Story About my Uncle is a short, whimsical traipse through a well realized world that features a grappling hook and 3D platforming. There were a few moments that I truly felt I was fully in control of my actions as I used the multiple movement mechanics to blast through the world around me. 

There are some pitfalls however, as there are images on the rocks that you can grapple to and while they aren't necessarily 'lock-on' mechanics like for example in the newest Devil May Cry, it still feels unnecessary as you are still allowed to freeform grapple around the world for most of the game. The ending also felt stilted as it features a lengthy 3D platforming area where you are simply running around and combined with the icy environment it takes place it, the game prevents you from grappling to most of the world. This felt like the antithesis to what the game was conceived to be, and my deaths here felt unfair and undeserved as the floaty movement that helped push the early parts of the game forward were now throwing me over a platform and plummeting to my death.

Overall though, the story and core mechanics of the game are enough to recommend this quaint indie title, especially at the current offer (¬£1.99)."
13344,"Worth it just for the gameplay.  Has aspects that remind me of Portal, and maybe a non-violent Bioshock: Infinite"
13345,"This was one of the best short games i've played. This prolly is in my top 10 games. God damn was this thing worth the $2.59 i payed for it, hell this game beats out most $60 games. 10/10 would fucking highly recommend.

A little hint at what the game has in store for you:
1. you have a power suit
2. you meet some ugly hoe named Maddie, she fugly. but she chill
3.you have to find your uncle fred through many obstacles and hardships
4. you tell a bedtime story to your daughter.

But fr this game was hella good."
13346,"A Story About My Uncle was a fun game. It had a short and sweet little story, and all the mechanics were awesome to use. I just wish it was a little longer."
13347,"Good god, for $2.59 on sale I bought this game thinking it would be a simple indie-like game that i'd play a little bit of every now and then. But damn is this a great game, i'm writing this right after finishing the story for the first time, and despite it taking me only 5 hours, what an amazing 5 hours they were. The storytelling in this game is beautiful, the gameplay is absolutely 10/10, the parkouring and acrobatics of the way you move through the various amazing looking areas throughout the game is just incredible. 

God damn 69/10 for this game, loved it, would whole-heartedly recommend for anyone looking for anything at all, just get it and play it, you won't regret it. ;)"
13348,An immersive game with fantastic scenery and a killer story. Highly recommended.
13349,Not a long game but it doesn't need to be. Love games like this. It has a wonderful story and left with a great closing. I would buy more like it.
13350,"a really fun game, wish it was a bit longer 8/10"
13351,
13352,"I bought this on a sale. Did it in one sitting. What can I say? The graphics is beautiful and surprisingly well optimized, ran perfectly well on my 4 year old laptop. The voice acting is ok. The story is nothing grand but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It's also quite short but for the price it's perfect. Gameplay is fun (mechanics are a bit wonky sometimes but that's forgivable) and the levels are interesting except the last one, I think it got stretched for way too long (had some cool moments though, especially a certain room at its beginning that was AWESOME). The difficulty varies, it took me lots of trial and error (mostly because some of the checkpoints are very far from each other) at a few parts but it's not unbeatable. I didn't get any achievements because I don't care but they are all challening ones so people who like that can do them. Doesn't really have much replay value apart from finding hidden stuff and doing the time challenge but with VR on the door it can be a way better experience if you can afford it. Overall, it was totally worth it."
13353,"The one complaint I have with this game, is that it is a bit too short and ends quite suddenly without an equally satisfying conclusion. That aside, the level design, world building, characters, puzzles, etc are all fantastic. The developer has managed to make the movement of your character into a puzzle in an of itself. Think of portal on steroids, without the humor and add an amazingly detailed little world to enjoy.

Pour yourself a few drinks, spark a bowl, and prepare for one hell of a game experience.

9/10"
13354,This game was great. At times it had me f***** up and others it was super chill. The enviroment and the way you interact with it was awesome. A beautiful game overall.
13355,"Ok so, this game is pretty cool, nice storyline, OK graphics, cool puzzles. Which would be really great- if the game didnt freeze for 1 second while holding right click to charge your tether hand. In addition to some bullshit perception jumps, this game is honestly a randomized-hope-you-make-it! Game."
13356,"Long Review:
""A Story About My Uncle"" is a great game. The mechanics are fun and interesting, the visuals are beautiful, and the story is intriguing. While I don't know if I would pay the full price for this game, I got it during the Steam Summer sale and it was well worth the $2.50 I spent. While I enjoyed it overall, it is a bit on the short side and is honestly a little too easy for the majority of the play through. Unless you spend time trying to get all of the achievements, you'll be able to run through this game in 3-4 hours; I also did this while finding all of the optional story objects, completing Maddie's game, and finding a majority of the Collectables. Most of the achievements are difficult to get though, a nice touch considering how many games give achievements for simply completing a level. There are also certain mechanics that are introduced that I wish were either more challenging or simply used for longer durations. The Eye Serpent that you face at the end of the Chasm is easy to avoid and poses no real threat, and nothing like it is seen for the rest of the game. The falling boxes and stalactites which appear during a portion of the Ice Cave level appear briefly and could provide an extra challenge which isn't really exploited by the devs. All in all, however, this is a fun and interesting game and I would suggest giving it a try.

Short Review:
Pros:
-Fun and interesting game mechanics
-Beautiful visuals
-Great voice acting
-Intriguing story
-Challenging achievements

Cons:
-Short, only 3-4 hours
-Not all that challenging
-Certain gameplay elements aren't used to their full potential"
13357,"Good game, the story is about 2.5-3.5 ish hours long. 
You pretty much play as spiderman with rocket boots. But instead of uncle ben dying, you try to find him with his infinite amount of flares. All jokes aside, the story is pretty good for how short it is."
13358,When I saw this game I just had to pick it up. I am excited to say I was not disappointed one bit. This is a game I could not put down because it is just too beautiful and full of fun. IT'S A MUST BUY!!! I would love to see this company do more. Best of luck.
13359,"This is a really good game. It got a great lvl design scenery and interesting storyline.

The only downside with this game is that the storyline is a bit short(as you can see on my played time) and the character models could have been executed a bit better.

But overall i really enjoyed it and really do recommend it :)"
13360,10/10
13361,"     Beat the game in less than 3 hours.. I must admit, it is a very beautiful game! But it is also quite short, to be honest the title fits quite well with it. The story is absolutely amazing, it is very entertaining, fun, and it has also  a bittersweetness to it. I knew once I had reached the end of the story, I didn't want to finish it. If this game was longer I would have enjoyed it even more! But it's satisfying the way it is now for me. If there is some sequel being made to this, then I'd like a longer story for sure and maybe the main character can be someone familiar from this one... I mean our main characters daughter! Also, maybe a touch of multiplayer can be added to the game as well!

     Anyways, I had a great time with this game and I'm sure most of you would too!"
13362,"Game is awesome. It you are a fan of modern platformers like the Portal series then this is a great game for you. It is a perfect combination of puzzles and story the Portal brough us combined with the running, jumping, and move combs that Mirrors edge brough us. Combine that with the suspenseful story of trying to find your uncle Fred that drags you deeper and deeper into the game, a sound track that surrounds you in the eerie adventurous emoitions that you yourself might have had exploring new places as a kid, and beautiful enviroment that can be viewed in 1080p you get a game that is as much a must have as Fallout, Team Fortress 2, or Bastion."
13363,"The graphics are beautiful, controls simple, relaxing gameplay, and new elements are introduced at well placed intervals.

All in all
10/10 IGN"
13364,"8/10 Great platforming Good story, Great voice acting, Lackluster end but overall great game, worth every cent"
13365,"My favorite First-Person Platformer to date.
This game lets you fly through the sky at fast speeds, the grapple is fun to use, and the enviroments are beautiful.
The only problem I have with it is how short it is, taking me around 3-4 hours to complete (played some offline)

I would say if you are a fan of First-Person Platformers you need to try this game"
13366,"Really really fun game with great gameplay. It has a good story and it's not a cheap, short indie. Very detailed with great quality!"
13367,"such a good story, wish it was longer"
13368,A fun and good game based on movement with a grappling hook and super jumps.  A few tricky sections but deaths are quick and painless.  The plot hits like a truck out of nowhere at the very end.
13369,Amazing game that I finished in 5.4 hours. Good if you have little spare time to play games!
13370,"A fun and beautiful, and very challenging, platforming/momentum game.

Can be meditative, but at times it's also often very frustrating.

I have mixed feelings about the game; I love the gameplay, but in some of the trickier portions it can be very difficult to be precise and quick enough to make it through a section. Particularly when I have to turn and ""grapple"" a recharge crystal, and then turn back to try and keep my momentum going. The game supports gamepad, but at the more difficult bits I have to swap for keyboard and mouse, as even with those I'm struggling to be quick and precise enough. This detracts from some of the enjoyment for me. Still glad I bought it.

There's a story, but so far it doesn't seem to be anything particularly wondrous or unique. The NPCs are fairly minimalist as well. But none of that really matters too much, it's the platforming and grappling mechanics that make it fun."
13371,a really decent game! i would recommend it to anyone who are looking for a nice and entertaining game! good story too.
13372,"An awesome and highly enjoyable game if you like high speed jumping and swinging your way through multiple levels. This game has a very cute storyline, but is on rails. However this game was a bit short for me, it was perfect for the summer sale price. I highly enjoyed it and I'm sure most of you will do too!"
13373,"A captivating First-Person Platform game, following the tale of a young boy as his navigates through a fragmented, mystical world in search of his uncle. Using prototype inventions left behind by your uncle, you find yourself flinging across chasms using a grapple glove, shooting across great pits with rocket boots and leaping great heights in power armour. A non-violent alternative to traditional puzzle adventures, which focuses on a touching narrative and visually engrossing environment."
13374,"Boring story, [spoiler] Uncle ran away, kid gets into machine, gets superpower, frog comes, becomes best friend, frogs father is a king from a sh'tty group, frog hates father, stopped playing after that.[/spoiler]
Not worth the 2,59‚Ç¨.
Buy CS:GO guns instead"
13375,"nice little indie 3d-platformer that plays neat

+ nice visuals of the world
+ flawless gameplay
+ neat mechanics
+ great price tag 2,50 on sale

- terrible visuals of the characters
- random checkpoints
- super short (took me about 3-4 hours on one play)
- 0 achievements from the game itself (time trials, etc)
"
13376,"Woaw, just woaw.
This game is not a major title, but it is greatly undervalued.
The story is not great and is rather short, but where this game shines is in level design and overall mechanics, which makes this game one of the most enjoyable game i have ever played. You will soar through the sky with no care in the world. It is not a hard game, at least not if you have just a bit of understanding of the mechanics and puzzles, but it is most certanly not an easy one either.
My only complaint is the one boss battle which seem awkward and the boss it self is not nicelly designed.
"
13377,"What an amazing game. Honestly the first thing i noticed were the absolutely stunning graphics and textures used in this game and the game play makes me think of a more mature mix between free-roaming a spiderman game with a dash of portal trial and error and quick thinking. I love this game to bits, finished it not but 2 minutes ago.  Hope one day it can be extended because i need more!!!!!!! 9/10 Please pick this up"
13378,"I have only the higest praises for this game, although short in length, it has an oddly compelling story. The gameplay is fantastic, you'll never get tired of how to grappling mechanic works, it's all tight and responsive and feels really organic and fluid. There are a few bits here and there that can get frustrating *cough* maddies challenge *cough* but none of them impact the game too harshly, and it wouldn't be any fun without the challenge."
13379,"Gives you a fantastic head spin on jumps and falls.
A beautiful and kind story, definitely recommended."
13380,"Nice and Beautiful looking Game.
Sometimes realy difficult parcouring parts but never get frustrated.
Realy good Game.
Recommend it. Worth it."
13381,"I just beat this game after 3 hours of solid gameplay.  I only spent $2 on it, and at that price it's a great value.  It has really fun and unique gameplay that is easy to recommend.
 
That being said, I don't think I'd buy it at full price.  It's pretty short, and the voice acting is REALLY bad.  I loved all the parts where I was actually playing, but any time I had to listen to someone talk I just wanted to laugh.  The game is in English but the voice actors are very obviously not native English speakers.
 
Long story short, buy it on sale."
13382,"An incredible experience.

I didn't know what to expect from this. The trailers weren't exactly gripping, and I wasn't aware that there was much more to it than just some parkour. There's a world, here, though. An intricately crafted one, full of surprises. And a narrative with the kind of warmth you'd expect only from a talented author. It's foreign and exotic enough that it may throw those with limited tastes off, but I found it an incredibly comfortable experience.

In a world where everything is about dramatic, stone-faced grimdark brain rot, overly dramatic negativity, nihilism, or just being a sociopath/murderhobo? This is a bit different. How often does your entertainment make you smile? That's the magic, here, and it's what I look for in my games. When I think of games that have made me smile, I look back on titles like Portal 2, Ori & The Blind Forest, and Gone Home. Yes, very separate titles, but with everyone straining themselves so hard to be Mature (not mature, that's something entirely different, and more in line with this game, interestingly enough) that they probably look like they have constipation?

It's different. It's nice. It's a representation of what you should like about humanity. It's creative, it takes your inner child by the hand and drags it through a world of wonderment and awe. If you're like me and this world hasn't chewed up and spat out every last shred of humanity you have, you'll smile. You'll smile a lot. And you'll be happy.

It's worth it, just for that.

This isn't your usual game, no. If I had to describe the mechanics as anything it's probably Mirror's Edge by way of Spider-Man with a sprinkling of Portal 2. Considering how much I enjoy that method of travel, I had a blast. It's got that sort of pull to it, the desire to explore the experience, understand it, and master it. It's thoroughly engaging, but not in a [i]heart pounding, adrenaline-soaked, blood pumped, testosterone-laden x-treme[/i] sort of way. It's oddly more cerebral than that. Yes, it requires reflexes, but it also dares to challenge you to think a bit, and that's where I feel the mild Portal 2 sprinklings flavouring it. It's a joy to just [i]be[/i] in.

You'll like it, it's as simple as that. Unless you're a cynical beast, devoid of any emotion, and you actually enjoy every story being nihilist with a miserable ending, filled with suffering? You'll love it. I mean, I'm not that. And since I'm not that I end up just rolling my eyes at most of the 'entertainment' out there. You'd think we were all crazy, backstabbing sociopaths. It's cathartic to have something like this, something that's just this different.

It's a story. It's a [i]good[/i] story. It's a story... told well, to a child, about wandering through an alien world in power armour that grants super powers.

It's the story your inner child has longed to hear."
13383,"Fun, easy to get into, and short. Worth the price."
13384,"A Story About My Uncle tells the fantastical story about a boy's journey through an amazing new world searching for his uncle. Albeit it was a rather short game (approx 2-3 hours) it tells a good story. The gameplay was rather repetative, including no more than 10 truly unique mechanics, although the narrative story telling was enough to keep me engaged and curious to find the truth about the world in which the game takes place. Overall, I left feeling satisfied with my experience and would highly reccommend this to anyone who is looking for a good story with a bit of a challenge."
13385,Beautiful Game. The scenery is some of the best I've seen and the story even better. It is very short (2 hours) but the fun you'll have is worth it. Would play again.
13386,"This game was an awesome surprise. It has an engrossing narrative flow, which feels a lot like a storybook or Pixar movie. The gameplay is a lot of fun, but never really stressful. It kind of reminds me of Portal in the way you have to use the tools you're given to get from A to B."
13387,"I am not a big fan of platformer, but i liked this one. Even at full price it is not too expensive and it is, artsy enough to suplement its storytelling. The game main gimic is that you platform both using your jumping abilities and a grappling hook of sort, and must use the momentum of your speed, direction and gravity to suceed on some jump. It is a relatively short game, but enjoyable nonetheless. The presence of collectible adds some replay value and can be used to unlock some features like different color beams and such. All in all a pretty looking, short, mechanically fun game. It ended at the right moment for me, I had my fill of the game platforming but it did not force itself on me further than that.

-Lost"
13388,"I liked this game a whole bunch. I managed to finish it in one sitting. Its challenging, has a very well put together story,  beatiful and for $3 (sale) it is well worth the pick-up. 
           There are some parts of the obstacles that arent so obvious to solve and you might find yourself hooking unto random things and barely missing your goal, but you'll use your boost and get it anyway. And it kind of feels like cheating in that sense. I also encountered a few moments where i accedentally land on a foregin object and it refills my upgrades. But apart from those minor (slightly game breaking) flaws. I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for a platformer/ puzzle. 
             9.9/10 would tell my child ""I fell into an abyss"" in a bedtime story again."
13389,"great game, intensely challenging and incredibly interesting story. 9/10 would play a third time
"
13390,Story is easy going and I enjoyed every bit of it. Gameplay was the most fun i ever had. always on the tip of my toes to see if i hit the edge or fell off it. tho... the Npc models could of been done a little better they look rather low poly... for a beautiful game.
13391,"I beat this game in 2 hours and i absolutely loved it and would recommend developers to bring the grappling hook controll into their own game, 10/1"
13392,"i have not finished it but i has a hella amount of duct tape vans and chloraphorm ..........
i was uncouncous for the story and started seeing frog poeple 

i think my uncle wasnt my uncle at all 

he just said to call him that 

still waiting to go home ...............the story hasnt ended"
13393,"Was quick to beat but has much replay value with all the colectibles, replaying now!"
13394,"Honestly this game was worth what I payed and if i remember I got it for ~$7.5. It is genuinely great, and I would recommend it to anyone. (Also it runs great on old computers which is nice)"
13395,One of the best games I have ever played.
13396,"your wasting time reading this just buy it, buy it now!"
13397,"Although short and not very challenging, it is very immersive and well-made. Recommended when on sale."
13398,"For 2,59‚Ç¨ is worth it! It's a platform - let's say - with a mixture of portal and mirror's edge, where you have a fixed steps route to follow solving some ability puzzles. 

I had some problems with my laptop, where even with low specs it goes to 14 fps (quite low, but still enjoyable).

Speaking about audio side, the third person narration is nice, it's a sort of stanley parable, but I don't want to tell you something about the story because I don't want to spoil.

I just say that with this price I would buy it again! But I wouldn't pay the full price, in 1h I think that I'm far after the mid of the story."
13399,"I wish it was longer I need more of this game, MOAR, GIMMIE MOAR"
13400,A great game but a very short game completing it in just 3.2 hours but the story is a great one i really recomend playing it through + the physics are great i hole heartedly recomend this game
13401,"I found it a suprisingly good and relaxing game, a bit short but it was good while it lasted :)"
13402,"An awesome game. A very interesting and consistent story, and it kinda feels like Portal styled physics which I really enjoy. It's basically a 3D platformer. It has captivating and alluring visuals, overall good game, 10 oudda 10 *New York accent*."
13403,was actually a phenominal game. simple but pleasent graphics and gameplay.  Nothing to hard to learn and just enjoyable.  well worth the buy granted I only paid 4.75 i beleive its deffinitly worth that much but can be rather short.  Nice little story though *thumbs up*
13404,"This is one of the best platformers I have every played. The graphic's are beautiful, the story is amazing, even though it took me a while in some parts of the game I never got frustrated enough to quit because this game is just so good. 
"
13405,A story about getting lost
13406,"I've had a Portal itch that needed scratching and ASAMU popped up at the right time. Its a great little platformer with beautiful enviroments, and despite not having any real enemies, it can get intense pretty intense with sheer kinetic speed and air."
13407,"Only get it if its at a lowered price, Although it was a very fun and addicting game, the amount of gameplay was slightly saddening, would be much better if it had DLC's or additional content."
13408,"""A Story About This Review"""
13409,"One of the best Adventures I`ve ever played! 
If you like Jump n Runs and 3D Adventures with a nice Story This Game is made for you! 
Highly recommend it!"
13410,"I highly recomend this, It has to be one of my favorite games."
13411,","
13412,"Really good game. Loads of fun, and also somewhat challenging."
13413,"Just bought this game, and what more can I say ?
Love it!
Harder than it looks as well.
Buy it."
13414,"A truly astonishing game, the graphics are mostly targeted at the effects of the glove but also at the scenery. The npcs graphics are a little outdated but the amazing story makes up for any flaws in the visuals. i finished the game in 3 hours of non stop playing, and i reccomend you play the entire game in one sitting. A Story About My Uncle is, hands down, one of the greatest games i have ever played. 11/10"
13415,Great story but having only 3 grapplings really grinds my gears. 8/10
13416,Woowww an amazing gaming with great story.
13417,This game has a really great athmosphere to it. I really enjoyed the movement-feature. The voice actors pull you further into the game (good headphones recommended) and make you love the characters and the world they live in.
13418,Pretty fun. 8.5/10.
13419,"If lord vivid colours had babies with Shingeki no Kyojin's Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear, you would get this stunning game. [b] 10/10 [/b]"
13420,an awesome game with great story and mechanics with a high replay value 9.5/10
13421,"Seriously, don't buy this game full price. A two hour game isn't worth 15 dollars. Get it on sale. It is a great game with an interesting story. It's just very lacking in content."
13422,Its  a good puzzle game with a light story.
13423,"A beautiful and deep game, that guides your imagination through a wonderous journey. For those who do not like ""art games"" such as the Stanley Parable, then the parkour is still an leading feature. However, those of you who do not want to appreciate it fully and just play it for the parkour, it is not terribly long and can have some frustrating parts that take a while to pass. Overall: if you want to like this game, you will fall in love with it. Otherwise you can go back to playing CS-GO."
13424,"Short and to the point
Fun mechnics
Beautiful locations
good voice acting


A bit repetative
Little replay value"
13425,"Game is visually amazing along with a nice little story/plot.
This game will not take you weeks to complete and is nice to play over and over even after finishing the first time.
You will spend countless hours getting lost in the world in which the story is set in with the mechanics available."
13426,"EDIT: Completed the game. Pretty short, but still well-worth the sale price.

I don't write very many reviews and obviously don't have much time into the game yet but this title is absolutely phenomenal. The price of $4.41 is so ridiculously generous it's baffling. About 2 hours in and I have already experienced and had more fun with this game than most of the things in my library. I bought this just after watching the trailer, and have not regretted it for a second. If you're on the fence about this just buy it. $4.41 is insane.
-Solid platforming and physics
-Intriguing story with a Quantum Conundrum sort of feel (which I love)
-Beautiful scenery
-Overall wonderful gameplay
Buy it. Please. Support these devs and do yourself a favor.
$4.41."
13427,"It's frustrating to repeat easy sections every time you make a minor mistake in a difficult spot. The story is cute but superficial, and I found myself wishing that I had something to do during long character conversations.

Very short game. Probably has more replay value if you enjoy the time trial aspect, but I did not."
13428,"From the videos and screenshots I was not expecting the game I ended up with.. Significantly deeper than I was expecting-- Right in the feels, good job on this one!"
13429,"The game is quite short, has a nonsensical plot with several really heavily hammered in aesops and, honestly, isn't that great at doing movement either.

It's worth buying at a heavy discount just for the novelty of it, but it has no replay value or memorable moments."
13430,"This game is about as good as first person platformers are gonna get. The controls are tight, and the movement is very fluid. Some of the puzzles can take a lot of deaths to figure out, so I wouldn't recommend this game for the easily frustrated. I swore more than a times while playing it, but it was never the game's fault, I was just trying to brute force through the game instead of finding the correct path. 

Most of the game centers around the grappling gun mechanics and that's where most of the challenges come from. It's a lot of fun flying through the air, and taking multiple paths to get to the same destination. Though I did have occasional trouble telling the difference between large objects in the background and small objects in the foreground. The game is reasonably forgiving with lots of checkpoints and I feel like the game gives you quite a bit of leeway when it comes to some of the momentum puzzles. The character animations were a little clunky at times, but the background scenes and stages were absolutely gorgeous. 

I'd recommend this game if you enjoy games like Gone Home and Dear Esther, but wished that a couple minutes in you could swing around at hundreds of miles per hour like Spiderman."
13431," I LOVE IT! <3 
It's challenging and beautiful :) 
"
13432,"Beautiful little gem with simple gameplay and lovely artstyle, music and straightforward yet interesting story with ending you can think about. Those few hours spent in world of frog people were amazing and I will surely play this game again sometimes."
13433,"A georgious, thrilling adventure through floating islands, and caves. Worth a couple hours of your time."
13434,"Tbh a really good game. Extremly fun, entertaining, and has a create story line to it that will make you want to finish the game in one sitting, as I did. Enjoy, recommend it."
13435,"shit/10, three hours in, still no uncle. 

It's only an awesome platformer with beautiful visuals, pretty good narration, and crazy movement options."
13436,"Amazing game, fast flowing responsive movement. <3

10/10"
13437,"Very nice adventure game with good graphics.
"
13438,"Very enjoyable, beautiful graphics, comforting storyline, slightly eerie, strangley nostalgic. Reaaly fun mechanics, not particuarrly difficult if you're used to first person shooters but definately requires a little more ""skill"" than puzzle solving. Took around 2-3 hours to do the main sotryline in no particular rush. I'd definately recommend this game if you can pick it up for <$10. Underated 8/10."
13439,Great game. Powerful story line. Perfect and odd characters 10/10 i absolutely loved it.
13440,"It's pretty fun overall. If you're only interested in completing the story, it's only about 4 hours. 

There are also a bunch of challenges, but I found that the grappling physics was too awkward to make them fun. For the main story, the physics are fine and there is enough variation in the environment to keep it fun, but if you're stuck doing the same area over and over, the physics quickly get infuriating.

I'd recommend waiting for a sale and getting it for under $5."
13441,The game has an intense gameplay and it is realy cool i loved the ending. So well worth its money and i hope to see future parts or other games.
13442,"Horrible character animations and designs. Voice acting feels like it's from an indie title, which is fair because it is. It's brief; I finished it in 3 hours. Now that we've got the bad stuff out of the way, here are the good points.

The character animations aren't what you should be focusing on anyway, especially seeing as everything else is amazingly beautiful. The scenery, the textures... Everything. My girlfriend walked in halfway through a session and said it looked like a AAA title. In regards to the voice acting, I know I said it sounded like it's from an indie title, but for indie game voice acting it's damn good. Not the best, mind you, but better than the average by far. I also said that it's brief. I won't take that back. 3 hours is really short. But the replay value of this game is immense. Sure, there's only one route through each level, but you can always do it faster; Make better grapple swings; Find shortcuts; Search for the collectables. It's the kind of game you can occasionally go back to, load a level in the middle of the game, and pass the time by flying through the air amongst floating islands and through dark caves.

Long story short... Definitely recommended. I'd get it on sale though if you aren't a fan of platforming, but if you are, get it now. You won't regret it."
13443,"A lovely little, over-looked gem of a game."
13444,"Amazing history, graphics and gameplay.
This is a true game and you should buy it on promotion!"
13445,It's a pity it's not longer because this is a really really solid game. Slight design flaws at times (mostly areas where it's a bit too dark to see) but the way the game is designed really makes you feel like you're exploring in a bunch of dangerous caves and discovering a new world. Absolutely loved it!
13446,game is really short but one of the best platformers i have ever played!
13447,grapple hook platformer. my hands were cramping up from some of the harder areas where you need fast reflexes. very fun game!
13448,Breaking Bad Easter Egg! 10/10
13449,"Simple concept, Easy to get into. Very fun."
13450,"This game is truly phenomenal. Seriously. Everybody needs to play it. Such smooth gameplay with amazing visuals/atmosphere and an incredible story. Only thing that would make it better is if it had like 50000000 levels so you could play forever. As is you could still spend countless hours traversing the hidden areas that you missed while completing the story and also complete the achievements. Gone North Games kicks @$$$$$$

"
13451,The frog people look out of place
13452,"A fun and relaxed platformer with some excellent mechanics and amazing environments. Probably a little too short for the pricing, but definitely one to get on sale.

+ Simple yet fun game mechanics
+ Beautiful environments
+ Levels are diverse and interesting
+ Nice story and characters
+ Very smooth gameplay
+ Feel like spiderman

- Story ends somewhat abruptly
- A little expensive for about 4hrs of gameplay"
13453,"6/10. I gave this game a 6 mainly because of its plot and lack of gameplay time. This game took me ONE HOUR to beat. In my opinion, not worth the amount of money this game is sold for. Second is the plot. It didn't really make me WANT to finish the game. The only thing motivating me was the ""parkour"" style this game has."
13454,"Very well made, it is definitely good for a bedtime story for both regaling and experiencing. Great Job!"
13455,"A heartwarming story mixed with nice graphics, atmosphere  and game-play mechanics. Definitely worth a play-through."
13456,Beat the main game in 2 Hrs and most of that time was spent looking at the amazing surroundings. A game well worth the $2 spent on it.
13457,"Sorry, but I simply did not enjoy it. It seems fun at first, which it was, but this is really just an interactive novel. There are no alternate paths, no different ways to do things. There is a specific way the devs want you to play that is essentially forced, and while I did enjoy the story, I was unimpressed by the end of it."
13458,"While this game is short (I got in 2.6 hours through the game) and there are only a few mechanics which you will use throughout the game, it is a game that definetly should be played by anyone. It's storytelling is unlike anything I have seen before in any game and it's visuals are so fitting. The game has a soundtrack, while it's not much, it still adds depth to the game. I would recommend this game if you like experiences from games while not spending too much."
13459,"This game is visually very pleasing and the game play is somewhat unique and fun, especially when you get the rocket boots.

I personally really enjoyed this game however do be advised it is incredibly short, just when I was really getting into it, it ended.

Overall though, It's worth a tenner but I would recommend buying it on sale due to the short story.

"
13460,"Stays charming and cute just long enough to keep you going into needlessly exacting jump challenges. How can we make third-person platforming where you can't actually see your body more obnoxious? How about by refusing any alternative solutions the player might find? Sorry, jerk. That rock you landed on wasn't part of the intended sequence, so your grapples aren't actually going to recharge. Have fun being stranded until you give up and respawn!"
13461,"$1.50AUD well spent.

Fun first person platformer. Good story, sound & flow/mechanics. Great visual aesthetic and art style in between levels."
13462,A DELIGHTFUL way to get my swing-like-Spider-man fix.
13463,"This game is beautiful, I found myself wishing for more once it was over. Yes its a little short but you feel like a child in a beautiful dream."
13464,"This game looks absolutely beautiful. Possibly the prettiest game I've come across in a while with a wonderful environment to jump and fling yourself around. Voice acting is good and generally the mechanics are quite nice. The only real issue I'm having is with the grappling mechanic. There are a few points where you are required to use the electro grappling hook thing to fling yourself across spaces and land on a fairly small floating rocky island and getting the timing right to let go of the grappling hook is rather tricky.

I'm enjoying it though. Solid game. Challenging. Lovely to look at. 

"
13465,"Short version:
--------------------
+ very much fun to ""fly"" through this nice looking and interresting world
+ I like the way the story is being told (like a bedtime story)
+ nice visuals

~ sometimes hard to find the right way
~ the story itself is ""ok"". Not bad, but also not great

- playtime (about 3h - 4h)


Long version:
-------------------
This is one of my favourite games. To be honest the title of this games does not sound that interresting and the graphics might be a bit outdated (but still very nice in my opinion), but it's really worth it to take a closer look at this game. 

The story is being told like a bedtime story. The character you play, tells his daughter the story about his journey when he was searching for his missing uncle and discovered a different world.

You'll find a suit invented by your uncle that lets you jump high and far through the scenery. Also included in this suit is some kind of grappling hook that you can (or better have to) use to swing through this new world (and to use this, is SO MUCH FUN!)
So now you start your journey, discovering this world on your way to find your missing uncle.

The playtime is really short. I finished the game in about 3 ¬Ω hours.
And if you don¬¥t fall in the ground as often as I did, you can finish it much faster. But you will fall in the ground very often ;)
Like I said it was a lot of fun ""flying"" through this world, but there are many places where you don¬¥t see where to go next at the first time. So when I was wondering where to go next, what I did was to jump in a direction and try if I can grab a rock or something else nearby. Aaaand.....what a surprise.....I fell in the ground ^^ But even if you see where the right way is, it¬¥s often not easy to follow it. That can get a bit frustrating after trying the same thing over and over again.
But this is the only thing that makes this game difficult, because you don't have any enemy to fight. And that's a good thing in my opinion, because that way you can really enjoy discovering this beatiful world and the feeling to ""fly"" through the air.

So would I recommend this game?
YES, absolutely.
BUT: Considering the playtime of only 3h - 4h I would wait for a good discount to buy it."
13466,"This is the best game I've ever played.  Would reccomend.

Pros:
FUCKING GRAPPLING SPIDERMAN MOTHERFUCKER!
Cons:
A slap in the face for graphics."
13467,"This game is really really fun but really really short. I beat it in about 2 hours or so. The story is awesome and the visuals are great. When ever I got outside the caves, my mom saw and said it looked beautiful haha. Well anyways, after I had finished it, I wanted to start over to miss anything that I had passed. I looked around the Uncle Fred's house and I looked at a bunch of stuff. Especially the papers, I found some really easter eggish things. Like if you look around, you'll find this link: youtube.com/watch?v-Eu2AIxkxiwg . It has nothing to do with the game unfortunately, unless I typed it in wrong. This game has so much good stuff in it, I hope they make a sequel or just another game."
13468,"9/10 game honestly. Extremely responsive movement, nicely fast-paced, great visuals, and a pretty interesting story. The voice acting was a little iffy but it was more humorous than off-putting.

only reason it's not 10/10 is because it took 2.5 hours to beat (without going for achievements) and at $13 that's a little high. I did get it for $2.59 at the Humble Bundle Spring Sale so that's worth it to me."
13469,"I judged the game by the title and only discovered it through a discount coupon.

A truly beautiful game with a great narrated story that doesn't hinder gameplay with cutscenes.

Short as hell though. I rushed through. 4.4 hours and I've completed the game. If I had known how short it was, I'd have slowed myself down to take in more of the beautiful world.

Replay? Yes! There's secret items and unlockables.

Casual!? Casual my arse... I've played my fair share of twitch-fps arena shooters in the past and I assure you, some of these levels were damn hard.

Achievement hunters best stay away from this because after completing the game, I guarantee there is no chance in hell I'd 100% this game without some serious practice. Maybe after watching a few good vids though."
13470,"These are the types of games worth buying and playing. I never say if a games ""worth"" its cost, thats dependant on the player and their situation, but personally im so glad that I did, or I would have missed out on a gem among the roughs.

A Story about my Uncles a 3D Adventure Platformer with a short game (I finished in under 3 hours) length and little in the way of puzzles, though its gameplay itself can be quite challenging, with some sections leaving you frustrated at every death, and the achievements are even more challenging. That said, in terms of story, its what I regard a masterpiece, and there are few like it. It tells a story through the game medium, not the other way around where most games have the ""story"" just as a means for the game itself to be what it is. You dont see the whole story, it wont say it to you in black and white, but it leaves just enough to be understood, with so much to be interpreted that if you want to put the thought into it, (or just cheatingly check its forums) you'll have that much more understanding and appreciation of it as a game.

Visual: 8.5/10
Its truly a beatiful game in some parts, and should definitely be appreciated. That said, some parts of it do look repetitive and similar to the last few platforms you crossed, but thats more due to the game being what it is, you can only arrange a straight path of blocks so many ways. Otherwise, its intricate, and quite artistically put together.

Gameplay: 7.5/10
The gameplays not difficult to learn, but so very difficult to master. The grappling line will leave you raging at yourself in some sections with a  ""I was sure I would have made that"" moment, and do expect to die allot to some sections before you can figure out the best path to take. It doesnt become painstaking or labourous though, and offers just the right degree of challenge without becoming overbearing. (I do have to admit though, I wish there was a faster way to redo a section then waiting for myself to fall far enough or go ""restart at last checkpoint"" through the menu)

Audio: 7/10
Dont expect symphonies or musical peices to bring you to tears, but you can count on it using its narrative mechanics to tell its story quite perfectly. I think it could have used more music for ambience, but It does what it does well.

Story: 9/10
Its got a beautiful story, and is worth playing for it. I wont say much because I dont want to ruin it, but it does tell itself well. Only thing it misses is that little extra ""something"" to make you emotionally invest into the game, leaving you ""watching and playing"" the story rather than being a part of it"
13471,"A better than average quality indie game.  It centers around the super suit, which along with some very powerful jumping has a Spider Man like grabby beam which you use to swing around.  A simple physics engine the programmers let loose for mostly good effect.  I really do love pretending to be Spider Man.

Simple story, but emotionally affecting for all that.  Clear graphics assembled into some really beautiful environments.  I took a LOT of screen shots with this one.  

Solid game, bit on the short side.  And PG, which I consider a plus.  As much as I like murdering aliens or nazis by the millions, sometimes it is nice not to for a while."
13472,"Excellent platformer! Truly beautiful environments to fly through with some very tight and well executed controls.

Graphics - Amazing! Art direction is really good. Environments are beautiful and inviting and glow with light. Quite spectacular. Also ran quite well with no problem keeping the framerate up at 60 on max everything which I find helpful for platforming.

Story - Not really that great. Voice-acting is also so-so. The narrator who speaks the most is actually the worst voice acting in the game. Serves as a justification for the excellent platforming.

Level Design - Almost entirely excellent. There are only a few parts where you have to wonder which of a couple paths to take and only a few where it takes a while to discern where to find a path.

Difficulty - Not overly challenging. I am not a very good at platformers and clocked in at about 6 hours with only a few areas with numerous repeat deaths. Of those I only found one area to be actually frustrating vs. challenging. There are a few spots where it seems like you have to go too far before the next checkpoint, but most checkpoints are after around 2 sets of actually challenging maneuvers.

Controls - This is really a big part of the game. The controls are very responsive and work really well. You really feel (with a nice big monitor in a dark room) like you are hurtling through the air almost wildly out of control at times barely escaping death but touching down to safety. It is one of the more exhilarating experiences I have had in a game.

Overall, excellent game and definitely worth the few bucks this will run you."
13473,"Probably the best indie game I've ever played. Well-written, well thought-out, and well-executed, the entire game is an astounding surprise of excellent platforming, mechanics, and story-telling. Both feels and fun were had. I am recommending this game to all of you, not because I made it, but because everyone should play it."
13474,I will Give This Game 10/10 Good Ending And The Makers Some have Made It should Really Be Proud To making this Game Becuse all The Crystal And The Missing Island It's just So Perfect (y) Thumbs Up for this Game If you Ever Crate a new Game like this I'm gonna Def Buy it :)
13475,"This game is so much fun, although it can get challenging towards the end, it will give you about 3+ hours of enjoyment if you aren't trying to get the achievements. I loved it so much, I would give it an 8/10. Recorded my full gameplay for YouTube!"
13476,"Great little game, with a cute story and interesting game mechanics. 

It can be a bit hard at times to see what you need to do, and in the start of the game I can recommend fiddling with the gamma settings (Video -> extra settings I think it was)."
13477,"Great platforming, heartwarming story, and awesome art style. Make a sequel!!"
13478,What if this is actually the story of an adventure the creator of the game actually had and he knew nobody would believe him so he made this game so others could experience the wonderful journey he had. And it is all a big thank you and goodbye to his uncle?
13479,"Very awesome, and a perfect length for what it is. Would rate it slightly under DeadCore, which is probably my favorite platformer at this point. Retail is a little high for the content, but if you can grab it on sale it's a no brainer."
13480,"Finished the game in about 4h, taking my time. Absolutely loved it. The story telling is great, the world is really immersive and the gameplay mechanics interesting. Really enjoyed flying through the air.

Thank you devs for making this little piece of art."
13481,Very fun.
13482,Great game and story. I wish it was much longer though.
13483,"A fun and thrilling story where you are a boy searching for his missing uncle. The Swinging never gets old. However, even with my beastly PC and all graphical settings on low, It still crashes on the star haven. Also, beware 100%ers! this game is insanely hard to 100%"
13484,"This game is amazing in more ways than one. The gameplay reminded me of a combination of DMC5 and prototype (without the fighting, of course), and the freedom you have is downright amazing (apart from a few invisible walls in areas you're not supposed to go to, but they aren't a bother in any way!). The graphics of the surroundings are really gorgeous and although you cannot interact with a lot of things in the environment, there's a lot to look at. Most of the books and letters and emails that are scattered around are readable, if not for the fact that some of them were in latin and my latin is rusty to say the least. And once more: the gameplay. It's so cool!

So to narrow it down:
Pros:
- great gameplay
- Beautiful scenery
- Nice storyline, not too fascinating, but the mystery of everything around you rescues that fact
- Great general pace of the game too

Cons:
- the voice acting is pretty shitty in general, but meh, ok.
- it's SHORT. Very short. I'm a slow, SLOW gamer, but I could finish it in around 4 hours.
- Hardly any replayability: you do have some unlockables that I didn't find in the first try, so you could try and find them again but other than that, there isn't much to do in a second playthrough."
13485,A nice story with a jumping puzzle. Worth the 13 euros!
13486,"I topped off this game in about two and a half hours, maybe three, and I was going at a semi leisurely pace. Occasionally I'd hop around a whole course if I saw an opening, but I fell off the map more times than I can count, so I guess that balances it out.

All in all, I loved it. The mechanics seemed tailored to my style of movement (Long hours of Titanfall, CoD: AW, Mirror's Edge and such) and the learning curve/time to get used to the controls was almost non-existent. The controls themselves are well placed, with left click being your grapple and right click being your 'booster' ability charger, either jump or sprint jump. Jump at spacebar and, later, jet pack when airborne. I had more fun playing around bouncing off walls with the grapple than I did actually doing some of the puzzles.

Bringing me to the puzzles, I found a few that were frustrating, namely the one where Maddie challenges you to go through a whole course without using your grapple. It's possible, fun even, but I must have tried thirty times before I figured it out and quit derping. I'm not one for puzzle platformers, though, so ignore that particular bit if you have experience.

Final conclusion: grab it if it's on sale, as thirteen bucks is a bit much. I got it on humble bundle and can honestly say it was worth paying over the average for, including all the other games I got with it. I'd say eight would be the most I'd pay for it, knowing what would be waiting for me. The story is a touch shallow and the voice acting isn't stellar, but for a simple indie game it's far from terrible.

TL;DR: Buy it on sale, blitz it in one go, come back on occasion if your internet craps out. Solid recommendation."
13487,"Really enjoyable first person plaformer. Little bit on the short side and I was nervously anticipating this difficulty spike towards the end but before I knew it, the game was over. So it's a little on the short side. However, it's clear a lot of love went into the game and it shows via the beautiful vistas and the feeling of soaring whilst in the open areas. 

8 and a half/ 10."
13488,you will hope you dream about this game. This game is such a pleasure though its very challenging. the gameplay is totally unique and fun. the story  is a great soft story you wont be asked to kill one guy.
13489,"Altogether it was a fun little puzzle game. Much like Q.U.B.E, the story to me was lacking. Nice, intimate plot with only a few characters and a great setting for a short story but there wasn't enough development. I didn't feel for the characters the way I wanted to.

Gameplay is great, just the right amount of frustration for a puzzle game. Somewhat unique mechanics as well. I'd recommend it for the puzzles and the environments."
13490,"TLDR:  This game had so much potential. Unfortunately, I felt let down at the end. Only buy if it's on sale.

Pros:
-Fun, challenging first-person 3D puzzle platformer.
-No ""training wheels."" This is a subjective pro/con, but I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that this game simply introduces mechanics then throws you to the wolves, making you use your head (and much trial and error) to solve some of the puzzles.
-Setting and environment is amazing in this game. The various levels feel alien, yet vaguely familiar.
-The introduction and setup to the story was amazing and very poignant. I'll get to the rest of the plot in the cons section.

Cons:
-EXTREMELY short game. I finished my entire first playthrough in just over two hours, and I have archived stream footage to prove it.
-Horrendous voice acting. I've heard better speakers at third-grade Thanksgiving plays.
-Character models are sub-par by most standards.
-Taking the last two points into consideration, I feel as if the devs concentrated all their effort on level design and completely ignored the characters. Which is a shame, because the story suffers greatly from flat, boring characters, visually and vocally.
-Back to the plot: it starts off very well, and just gets increasingly worse from there. I know many people writing reviews about this game loved the plot, but honestly I found it mostly un-authentic and cheesy. 

Conclusion:
A Story About My Uncle tried to be the next Portal or The Talos Principle, and it got half-way there. The game did have some very fun, challenging puzzles and great, atmospheric level designs. However, it missed the heart and soul that a good game should have. The devs didn't spend enough time on the plot and on the characters, and the result was a game that had a short, cheesy plot with an abrupt ending, and flat, boring characters. I recommend this game, but only barely. Only buy if you can find it on sale, because it's definitely not worth its current price of $13."
13491,"A sweet sweet mechanic but entirely too short. You can stretch it out with replays and get those acheivements, and lends itself to speed running (time trials). Pick it up on sale, but I don't recommend on full price."
13492,"It's rather short and the plot is fairly thin, it would have been better if they had invested more time into developing the characters and added a few more levels. That being said it's a great game, fun mechanics, beautiful landscapes, and fairly interesting idea for the world. over all I'd probably rate it 3/5, it's a good way to spend 2-3 hours as you play through levels that seem big and well done though unfortunately fairly linear."
13493,"Very fun game, nice story, good game if you want to relax. Welp, really fun."
13494,"Quaint, super pleasant on the eyes and ears, but the greatest achievement is in how tight the controls are; it's possible to flow through each level beautifully if you can get the hang of it. Possibly the smoothest 3D platforming since Mirror's Edge."
13495,"This game feel more like an experiment in game mechanics and story telling than fully fleshed out game. That's okay though. You start as an unnamed protagonist telling a story to your daughter, and you tell the story of the adventure you had chasing your Uncle. From there you are shot from a pad into a different world where crystals power everything, frog people are everywhere, cities and homes float on rocks. You have to grapple jump, rocket your way through area to area. Grappling from flying rock to flying rock. Jumping from cliff to cliff all in the search. You meet a companion along the way who will taunt you with a little game. 

It's fun, short, and things just kinda work. They also have a time trial thing after the game if you are into speed running. It's well worth the pickup if you find it on sale some place. Oh I have not seen another game with achievements so damn hard/annoying to get."
13496,"This game is a lot of fun. And there needs to be more like it. 

The gameplay is speed and soaring galore. The story is good and has a nice light feel to it. The visuals on the environments you traverse are great. Vast, beautiful. Huge spaces and distances. I love the game's atmosphere.

Aiming while moving can be hard though. I can't count how many times I missed my grapples and fell into the misty abyss. But I usually didn't mind. It just meant it was time to go soaring again. After two or three seconds of freefall it resets you to your last checkpoint, which is generally right at a ledge, so downtime is very short. You can even charge your jump before the reset. A few spots proved annoying to continually fail and repeat, but they were few indeed.

The only real shortcoming is that the game is...short. But it's easily worth the full price."
13497,Short fun platformer in first person camera :D Cool mechanics and interesting character design :) I recommend this game! 8/10
13498,"reminds me of my uncle bob, who was married to a fishwife who made apple pancakes with cinnamon every sunday afternoon"
13499,"Pretty short game, but i enjoyed every second of it. I haven't seen such an amazing atmosphere in a game in a while. 
Sequel pls"
13500,"A Story About My Uncle, while $12.99, is well-worth the money. (More so if you get it while it's on sale.)

It's a short, sweet story. You are the father, and your daughter wants to be told a bedtime story. You decide to tell her about your uncle, Fred, and how you followed him into a strange world for an adventure, after Fred had been gone for some time. You find a suit he had made to fit you just right, but never got around to asking you to come on an adventure with him, as he had stayed on his latest adventure for a good while, which is what prompts you to go find him.

You meet this species of frog people, later revealed to have been created by your uncle, who accidentally sent them to the world, and that is why he went on an adventure; to retrieve them back, but by the time he had gotten there to collect them, they had already grown. You meet a girl name Madeline (Maddie). She joins you for a while to help find your uncle Fred. She accompanies you for a time, until you find the 'Strays' which were people who originally lived in the village of the frog people, but moved out of the dark, damp caves and moved to a place called 'Star Haven' and created a new, prosperous village. Once you arrive in Star Haven, Maddie decides she wants to stay there with the Strays, and wishes you luck on finding your uncle, but she has one last request; If you do find him, have him go back to visit Maddie in Star Haven.

Jump forward a bit, after going through the trecherous Ice Caves, at the end of the final tunnel, you find your Uncle Fred and some of his equipment laying around. He hears the footsteps, and turns around calling out ""Hello?"" to which he is surprised to see you. He comments on how you're wearing his suit, and asks what you're doing there. You comment on how you found it in his Workshop, and came to look for him.
Unfortunately, your Uncle wanted you to go back home. You reluctantly agree after wanting to stay there with your Uncle Fred and Maddie, but your uncle insists you go back to the real world and find your adventure there. You step on the pad, and your uncle activates it, which launches you back to your world, out of the cave full of crystals. That was the end of the bedtime story for your daughter.

While you don't know what happened to your uncle, you know no matter what, hes on his biggest adventure yet. You go back after telling your daughter your story back to your uncle's house. Things are packed up, cleaned up. There's also a small memorial with a picture of your uncle, who has not returned from his adventure since you came back. You came back every day, ocassionally remembering your uncle's voice asking for you to get him this or that tool. Unfortunately the closet where your suit was is locked up tight, and you can't get in it. You head upstairs to the Observatory one last time to find the pad that originally sent you there presumably still there, but not funcional and covered in snow from the open window.

[b]Pros:[/b]
Amazing, colorful graphics.
Music and sound effects that match the atmosphere through the entirety of the game.
Interesting storyline.
An interesting platforming-challenged game.
A sense of freedom.


[b]Cons:[/b]
Voice acting could have been a bit better.
Can get repetitive after you die in a certain area over and over (Mostly Ice Caves level)
A few tedious levels.
The game was actually shorter than I would have liked.

I would give A Story About My Uncle an [b]8/10[/b]."
13501,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilzo7T70H9M
13502,Story well told and really fun gameplay.
13503,"This little 3D puzzle platformer is quite the gem.  The art is gorgeous, the music that accompanies you on your adventure is soothing and the mechanics, which are simple to use, are introduced to you at a perfect pace. I'm only about twenty minutes into it and I can already tell some of these puzzles are going to stump me later on.  I'm having a lot of fun flying around.  No complaints as of yet.


UPDATE: Now that I have played more I have realized that each of your grapples and jumps must be perfectly timed, especially in later levels where you must be extremely precise.   It was quite frustrating as the simplest misstep resulted in missing the target completely.  It's also important to note that if you're going for the achievements, be patient because if you make a mistake on a level, you will have to restart that level entirely.  An example is the ""no fall"" achievements. Personally, I am not a fan of these sort of achievements, including the time trial ones, but that's just me.  They're stressful and don't involve much fun.

UPDATE #2: This game could have used a few more save spaces like on the final level... Very frustrating."
13504,Frog people have british accents. 10/10

13507,Play it!
13508,"Love this game!!! 
Pros 
- Amazing textural environment 
- Campain where I was never bored
- Realistic movements

Cons 
- Some textures look cluncky (Only in like 2 objects throughout the huge environment)
- Short Campaign (2-3 hr.)

I recemmend this game if its on sale because it is fun but it is quite short, don't get me wrong, this is a total underrated game, will give you jaw-dropping moments, and will be in your memory for a while :D

"
13509,Really fun first person platformer.
13510,Got on sale for like $2.50. Well worth!!!
13511,"Wow.  I just finished ""A Story About My Uncle"" less than 30 seconds ago.  This game is fantastic. Its only 3 hours long, but the replay value is great. This game is very difficult near the end, but I don't see that as a problem. I've also seen a few people complain about the ending, but I actually really like it. This game is a hidden gem.  I highly recommend playing it with a mouse and keyboard, as the controller I was using was fine at first, but very difficult near the end. Buy this game, play it in one sitting, and then come back to write another review praising it's awesomeness!  -PR0XIDIAN"
13512,"Pros:
-Short and cheerful game.
-Controls on keyboard and mouse and perfectly fine.
-Art style is amazing and its obvious that the developers put a lot of effort into the presentation.
-Graphics is great and it often reminded me of parts from Bioshock Infinite.
-Satisfying platforming.
-Lots of easter eggs and things to collect

Cons:
-I noticed that reticle does not always identify surfaces that you can grapple on to immediately. This small pause can throw off your timing on jumps.
-It can be very difficult to determine depth of  platforms in some places as the background would be skybox with very little movement. 
-I had an issue with double tapping left mouse button, and thus using up 2 out of 3 usable grapples during a jump. It would be awesome if some kind of detection can be added to avoid double taps.
-Not much in terms of replayability

Overall, I enjoyed this game a lot and there were a lot of places where I would just pause to take in the view. I never ran into any crashes or game halting bugs, and the cons I have listed above are just minor issues that didnt hinder my enjoyment too much. Definitely worth picking up on a sale."
13513,This game is fascinating from many different perspectives. #1 The graphics are beautiful. #2 The story is intriguing and interesting. #3 There are no cutscenes or long talking sequences. #4 It is very immersive and touching. #5 The game runs smoothly and virtually glitch free. #6 Parkour is fun but hard. #7 Would recommend to basically anyone looking for a fun story rich game.
13514,"This game was soo damn amazing, I compeletely loved it from the get go.
The story was great! It made me wanna keep playing it!
The ending kinda had me choked up not gonna lie!
If you wanna see more on this feel free to check out my youtube channel where I've been doing a kinda walkthrough to it!
link is in my name!
Also this game is on offer for $1.99 on humblebundle 09/05/15, google it!
Would totally recommend this game if you are looking for a storytelling kinda game!
"
13515,"[h1]Intro & Summary[/h1]
This is one of those little hidden gems that nobody talks about because it's not incredibly new or unique, it's just very well done and good fun. From the team behind Goat Simulator, it was one of their earlier titles and it flew under the radar for most. [b]It's a relaxed, sweet story world to explore [/b]which doesn't do anything special, and that's fine.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer that isn't anything special, it's not unique, it doesn't have a new incredible story, it doesn't go above the norm on any of it's design choices. But it's great fun, the story is interesting, the characters and atmosphere all work and [b]it's just a good honest game[/b].

* A compelling enough world and story with enough lore to go back and look harder on a second playthrough.
* Absolutely gorgeous artefacts and atmosphere.

[h1]Mistakes[/h1]
Surprisingly, there are very few faults with this title. It lacks the polished feel the triple A's command, but that adds to it's charm.

* Some annoying level design problems from time to time.
* Collectibles are pretty bland and boring.
* Plot/story is great, but runs thin at times.
* Far too easy overall.
* Short play time, even for it's low price.

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]
It clocks in at just 4-5 hours play time and doesn't have much re playability, so getting your moneys worth matters with this one. At ¬£9.99 or $12.99 at the time of review it's not going to break anyones bank, but like most games on Steam, it's probably worth picking up on sale, perhaps at -50% or less. I haven't seen it in any Bundle deals so don't wait for it to appear on HumbleBundle et al.

* Gathering the collectibles will lead to unlocking Goat Mode, a reference to one of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Coffee%20Stain%20Studios]Coffee Studios' other titles[/url], Goat Simulator.
* This game uses the Unreal Engine and includes console access to modify/play with your world including [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435446127]flying, and taking better screenshots[/url]."
13516,"A fun ride!
The enchanting story told over 2-3h really captured me, and i miss this fantastic little world already.
The art-style grabbed me instantly, the voices and the music are really fitting.
The games mechanics (jumping, grampling, rocket boosting) are overall fun to use, but have their problems. The games length helps though, to not make it really frustrating.
If you want to get more out of the game, there are Time Trials (apparently just the same levels as the Story though) and collectibles to be found.

A little tip: Increase the FoV (i played at 110, option available ingame), apparently it helps a lot with depth-perception and the lot."
13517,Dope game puzzles get harder with each level.
13518,"It's short.  It's fun.  First person platforming with some responsive and fast moving mechanics.  Flinging yourself around the environment - ones that are generally pretty for a small indie game - will keep your entertained for the 2-3 hours of play involved.

The story isn't anything astounding, but it's a emotionally touching little tale."
13519,"Absolutely adored this game, from the story told to the daughter to the gameplay itself. I wouldn't say it was hard, but it was challenging. I think the achievements would be quite difficult, I only got the one Maddie's Challenge. The environments are beautiful, as well as the music. Some of the voice acting was only passable, but some of the other times it was pretty good. Definitely enjoyed this and would probably complete it once again in the future. Plus it was inexpensive."
13520,"it have very nice graphics and very good looks of the place u can see how much work they have done with the maps
but it wasn't so long so that's a little bad but else it's a very good game"
13521,"It's a great game if you are just chilling, although it is pretty short (I completed the story in ~2,5 hours). The story isn't really catchy, but you will know soon know why it's called a story about my uncle :)"
13522,10/10 would repeatedly die over and over again in an ice cave again
13523,"Linearity and sometimes lack of lights and colours are biggest issue of this game.
I like although exploring, voice acting. And whole concept for story and simple gameplay. Thats all what matters to me.
Grab it on sale. Especially if you are fan of Portals and other jumpy puzzle games. But dont expect too much."
13524,It's a really good game with a simple story. You can upgrade your suit and stuff. 10/10 game. I would recommend buying it.
13525,"Excellent Gameplay,
Beautiful Scenery.
Intriguing Story.

A well crafted game and worth the Money."
13526,"Whip, lash and guide your way through a maze of rocks!!!
This is the best game I ever got, and by far the best money I ever spent.
I got this game while it was on sale for around 7$ in the hopes that I would be able to sell it for some Team fortress 2 keys. Today I was bored as hell so I was going through the games in my inventory and this one was appealing to me, I downloaded it and within 5 minutes of the game I was already satisfied, As if the parkour part alone isn't enough it follows a interesting storyline that keeps you eager to continue playing so you can hear the whole story part by part. In addition to all of this the game has the best graphics and awesome land feature, though the game can get frustrating if you can't get past a certain ""area"" it is definetely worth it to keep playing.
Definetely buy the game
"
13527,"Atmospheric and very cute game with comfortable gameplay. Story will tell you about a young man who went to look for his missing scientist uncle. At each level we are getting a small surprise in the form of various stories that make the game even deeper and more interesting. There is no dungeons like Skyrim or logic tasks like in a portal but I promise that you will admire the level settings.
8 \ 10"
13528,"GUE SUKA INI GAME APA LAGI GRAFIK NYA MUANTAPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
INI MISSION NYA SEMCAM FISRT PERSON KARENA GUE TERTARIK AKHIR NYA GU EBELI NIH GAME

NILAI:8/10"
13529,"Pick it up on sale, short and sweet adventure."
13530,i like flow of the puzzles.
13531,great stuff
13532,Fun game.    I enjoyed it.
13533,"The story is ok. Basicly,[spoiler] the uncle is a piece of shit. He left his wife and family to mourn him, while he is banging frog chicks in some alien caverns. what a douche bag![/spoiler]

The gameplay is very challenging and it just gets tougher as you progressive throughout the game. The game is a bit short so expect maybe 3 to 4 hours, 2 if you are good. I was ok to say the least. It's a good gaming if you are into platformers.

Overall, I probably rate this a 7/10."
13534,"I had fun playing this game. I bought in onsale for just a few dollars, and I couldn't be happier about it. At $12.99, ehhh i dont know, but im still giving this one a thumbs up. I only have 7 hours on record at the time of writing this review, I have beaten the game (earning a whopping 1 achievment in the process) and it has been left on pause for atleast 3 of those hours (i have kids and you never know when your game will get paused for long periods of time... get off my back). There is not a lot of depth or stuff to interact with, the controls are super simple and yet the game still manages to be pretty fun. What you see in the video is pretty much all there is to it, but the scenery is quite beautiful, the gameplay is slightly addicting, and the story is pretty neat. Be warned, the voice acting is sub-par, but ive heard worse.
So in summary
Pro's:
Beatiful scenery
smooth and somewhat addictive gameplay
no bugs that I personally noticed (and im not hearing about any from anyone else either)
fun adventure for kids and adults alike

Con's:
iffy voice acting
not alot of depth or stuff to interact with
very few achievments (most of which will require you to go back and play through the same levels repetatively)

Im giving this one a big thumbs up
"
13535,"This game is absolutely amazing! The plot is fantastic  and the graphics is also wonderful! So, I recomend this game to everyone who loves a good story. By the way, the process of playing is not really complicated. Enjoy and have fun!))"
13536,"It's an incredible little game, and for a more than reasonable price. The mechanics work smoothly, the story is done very well, and everything is well polished in general. My biggest regret is how short it is."
13537,"[b]Gameplay:[/b] 
It is a very short game and not particularly challenging unless you aim to complete all achievements. The mechanics are simple and easy to pick up and could have become boring had the game been longer.

[b]Story:[/b] 
The voice acting is a bit sketchy at times although the main narrator has a relaxing voice. The whole story can be summed up as a relaxing slice of life story with little danger driving it, which is a nice change of pace from most other games.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
Both meshes and textures are fairly low resolution and there are not a whole lot of special effects going on. Despite this, I find the game very pretty. In fact, I see the environmental art as the strongest part of the game and I replayed it just to experience Star Haven again."
13538,It's a straight up good time.
13539,"200/10. Just finished it *cries in a corner* I want more of this game!! It was the best game I have played in a while. Worth the money!! Good job on this. But it could also pe improven a bit on the storyline, specially the end. The eyes were present only 2 times in the game, so not so much difficulty. A fighthing system would have been great."
13540,A nice short platformer with a interesting story line.
13541,"Short and sweet, A Story About My Uncle combines scify fantasy with an incredibly satisfying spider-man mechanic that aids your traversal of a handful of gorgeous outdoor settings. The story is a little heart-stringy for my taste, but the game as a whole is well done (and so damned pretty!). 

One sort of interesting feature which may just be a peculiarity/brain tumor of mine: the voiced narrator (speaking for you, the protaganist) has a distinct accent, which (as someone who doesn't share that accent) served to slightly detach me from the character while the immersive gameplay tugged me back. The result was a role play experience that felt incredibly authentic by the end - this person was not fleshy me; couldn't have been, but I was definitely that person. Really neat."
13542,Really Nice Adventure Game :)
13543,"great gameplay 
amazing story with real charecters 
u dont need more then that"
13544,"Awesome artwork 

9/10"
13545,"Fantastic game! This game has some Incredible scenery, and really densely detailed environments. The gameplay is also a lot fun, and it feels great just soaring through the air without a care in the world. The feel of the game is really well done as well, like I actually got a knot in my stomach once or twice when falling from a REALLY tall height. Overall, this game was a breath of fresh air and has to be my favourite platformer to date."
13546,Amazing
13547,"I don't know how to adequately review this game. In short it was visually stunning and challenging at times.

Pros:
-Great graphics
-Good story
-Cool mechanics

Cons:
-BS deaths
-Too damn short*

*The average play time I see in the reviews is about 3 hours. This game is not very long and can be completed in one sitting. However, I don't think the length really deters from how much I liked this game. It just doesn't help it's case at all. I would definitely given this a better score if it was longer.

75/100

"
13548,"Short but absolutely ravishing.
A beautiful fairy tale with stunning visuals and very tight gameplay.
Finished it in one sitting."
13549,"I like the  ""speed"" portion of the game :D Rushing though the air is awesome, Achievments are nice, can be a little hard ones though.
I liked the village, would have been better if you could interract with random villages and they said something about their lives.
It should have VR option."
13550,"Just started playing it and I really like it sor far, the jumps etc but also they way they tell the story of the game. and a really good looking world"
13551,"I would say 7-7.5/ 10.

Lets start with the Negatives first, because I like to end on a happy note.

Cons -
> Game Time
I beat the main game, not including time trials, in one sitting (a nice sitting, but 1 none the less)
Has 5 levels (7 if you include the story's prologue and epilogue)
> Navigation 
Sometimes I did not have a clear heading of where I was going (But that is because of the ""one way obvious point to current objective with arrows / indicators "" that games of our current age have gotten us used to)
> Goats
Not enough Goat. Needs moar goat.


Pros -
> Story
You start as a Nephew reliving a past experience, for the sake of telling your daughter..........
A STORY ABOUT YOUR UNCLE!!!!!
> Music
Had a calm and soothing tone, and matched the scenery for each level quite smoothly
> Graphics
Has a Mirrors Edge - ish like feel to it, but with  actual levels you can enjoy and almost fully explore.
> Gameplay
1. Spiderman  the game on PS1
2. OP Grappling Hooks from Terraria
3. ""Gone Home"" Feels

Overall-
You start as a Kid. You quest into the unknown
But Going through the game has you curious about.
What is this other world?
What cool gadgets do I get to play (erm I mean) Use?
And most importantly
WHERE THE HELL IS THIS UNCLE OF YOURS?!?
It may be short, but Its pretty sweet.
With nice music, and you can take your time exploring,
Its overall a good game.

I bought it when it was on sale for 97% (I didn't even know they did that)
But I would spend maybe 5-7 dollars on it, due to its overall short gametime.
So I recommend putting this game into your wishlist pile, and picking it up when it goes on sale,
You'll be glad you did."
13552,"


Overall it was a really nice game that wasn't too long and leaves you with a good feeling. Alot of people are complaining about the difficulty but if you're a natural at fps games its not too hard. The only complaint I have about this game is it causing disorientation at times with some of the map design and trying to figure out which direction you need to go in. Other than that the game was solid."
13553,"Very good but surprisingly short game. It's nice and relaxing and has a really good narrative, a narrator I didn't mind (I usually prefer silent protagonists..) but it has sweet moments for being such a brief game, and some great-looking vistas. Kinda feels like they developed this as the concept to a larger game... But better it be short and sweet than become longwinded and overstay its welcome."
13554,"Great game, but there is a massive gpu leak, the longer you leave it open, the more intensive it is on your computer. Other than that, great story, amazing parkour mechanics, and overall definitely worth grabbing a controller and playing. Although at times the native canadian accents do get annoying."
13555,"A quaint little story about some dude's uncle. Also floating rocks.

For gameplay, I'd call it Bioshock Infinite with no shooter mechanics and more advanced platforming. The mechanics are easy to understand but tricky to master. 

The levels are very wide open and allows for a LOT of agency while playing, perhaps more than the game intended though because there was many a time where I landed on a surface with no collision detection.

The story is told mainly through narration and downtime between gameplay is minimal. It only takes about 3 hours to beat so if you're consious of money-to-time ratios, you might want to wait for a sale to get your money's worth. But either way, the game is super fun and an absolute pleasure to look at."
13556,"A playable bedtime story. The story is intriguing, and the platforming is super fun. Only gripe is the high price tag for a 2-3 hour game."
13557,"""You're little,but desperate to find your uncle. Plunge into this faschinating story and discover beautiful locations,landscapes and friendly creatures around you. But  be sure to have some dangers ahead of you. It takes an evening to complete this game. The adventure is really short,but exciting with lovely ending..."""
13558,"I'd recommend this game for platforming fans, anyone who likes challenging jumping/swinging/flying puzzles. 

The grapple works well - there's some confusion over what can be grappled at times, and sometimes aiming while flying through the air feels clumsy, but these improve with familiarity and practice. 

I've played once through the story, and found several of the collectibles (I was exploring), so the game is ""short"". However, it has a set of achievements which are ideal for extending the game - all focused on playing faster, safer, or more efficiently. They're also hard, by my reckoning - you're unlikely to get them on your first playthrough. This means that the game is [i]perhaps[/i] too short for the main game (though it's quality all the way, which I think is far better than ""padding"" or ""levels""), but by no means short in terms of mastering it. 

I bought this game because I loved ninja ropes in worms (:D!), and while it wasn't quite the same, it did hit many of the right buttons. 

Overall it was a high quality, pretty looking, occasionally challenging experience."
13559,"10/9
good story"
13560,"""A Story About My Uncle"". Is a phenomenal reminder that very short, very easy and very Indie games can be deemed worthy as gems. 

In all honesty, I am not to big a fan of puzzle-ish type games nor to large on adventuring, however this game changed that opinion, it has opened my eyes to the genre. I really must say this game is 100% worth buying it, even if not on sale. Great gameplay, a surprisingly good story (howevershort). A Story About Mu Uncle also has the oh' so very important replay value. 

A gem. 

10/10. Would Take Care Again."
13561,A physics based action puzzle where you'll be grappling and super jumping across a variety of environments. It's short but long enough to explore all the options available to the mechanic. Some of the later stuff does get a bit difficult but it's still a  great way to spend an afternoon.
13562,"Bought this game on sale for 5.50 and man was this a steal! Think of this as a 3d platformer adventure game. Physics are rather interesting and the story being as short as it is is actually really intriguing with a ton of depth if you dig long enough.

SPOILER in this steam thread

http://steamcommunity.com/app/278360/discussions/0/522729358374450914/

I reccomend playing through once garnering what of the story you can then reading this thread about the story line and what others have uncovered. Rather sad, heart warming, and in an odd way relieving when you watch the epilogue."
13563,"I didn't have very high expectations for this game. I downloaded it because it was on sale, and I thought ""why not"". After playing first person shooter after first person shooter or other violence based games, it was nice to play a game that emphasized the other aspects of what a game can be. Although the story I think the [b}story could have had a little more meat[/b], it was interesting enough to keep you playing on. The [b]world was very creative[/b] and the [b]art has a style[/b] that gives the game a uniqueness to it. The [b]gameplay itself was very well done[/b]. The controls for the grappling hook and any other mobility aspect were relatively easy to grasp. The biggest thing that made this game for me was that the game [b]almost never gets over repetitive[/b] (in my opinion). Every time in comes close, a [b]new dimension or obstacle is added to the game[/b]. All in all, I think this game was wonderful and highly suggest that you get it.

Also, if any of the devs see this:  I don't think I stand alone when I say that I want to see a sequel to this game (maybe make the sequal longer).
"
13564,"Smooth, fun, beautiful, engaging, addicting gameplay really makes this game awesome. The story was a little shorter than what I would've wanted, but the ending was great. One of my personal favorite games!
10/10!"
13565,"I just finished the game, it took me about 4.5 hours. But I will play the game some more to find the hidden ""story elements"".

It is a short game, but It was really great, not only the story but also the gameplay. It was hard at times but always manageable.

Also I was sweating a whole lot just because of this game! It gavce me a shudder. (I am bad with hgih places and yeah this game was quite challenging for me).

I would everyone suggest to try this little jewel!"
13566,short but awsome
13567,"The game itself is very enjoyable but the only thing i didn't like was the main characters dialogue, he sounded so incredibly monotone it made listening to him very boring, there was just lack of emotion in every word, he just droned on. The game though is very enjoyable, don't think i could recommend it at it's full price, but worth the sale price for sure :)"
13568,A lot of fun. Something different to play. Original and exhilarating.
13569,"Short but sweet, a charming first person puzzler, with an incredibly pretty aesthetic."
13570,"This is possibly the best I have ever played that was created by a coffee stain.
10/10 would make stain again"
13571,"A really fun first person platformer that requires quick thinking and gets really difficult near the end. Story is decent, character designs can be grotesque sometimes, but I found myself constantly being introduced to new ways to propel myself through the level. Did I mention you spend most of your time flying through the air? It's great fun."
13572,"Ewnjoyable and somewhat challenging game at an excellent price point. It would be good if there was more interactivity with the natives, but still very enjoyable. Nice graphics."
13573,"Beautiful graphics and an interesting story, but I was surprised by the shortness of it. Pick it up on sale unless you really love puzzle games with a unique atmosphere"
13574,"Really nice little platformer. The mechanics are very smooth and everything runs very well.

Pros:
Graphically beautiful
Responsive controls, very easy to use. (Keyboard and mouse)
Great story.
Audio, backround music is wonderful.
Price. Picked up on sale for less than $3

Cons:
Short. Beat the game in around 3 hours and thats with getting stuck for a while on some parts.
Voices are pretty monotone and empty
Achievements are, to say the least, hard.
Unless you want the achievements, there's little replay value.

With all that said, very much recommend this game to waste a few hours. *Thumbs up*"
13575,Lovely little story wrapped up in some speed running-style first person platformer. Enchanting atmospher and interesting world. I haven't had this much fun since speed running/sqeuence breaking Metriod Prime 1 on the game cube.
13576,"An amazing game that uses the unreal engine. This game uses boost, grapple and glide mechanics, these mechanics are well used and make the experiance really good! Thi sgame is amazing and I want a second! ^_^ *****"
13577,"Fantastic game, really gets you emerged in the story, although it's only short I really enjoyed playing this."
13578,"A Story About My Uncle is a really nice game and I do recommend it.

The graphics, the atmosphere, the story and especially the gameplay is nice.
What's bad about is that it's way too short and the frog models are shit. I didn't really take time doing the time trial and achievements but it only took 3 hours. The ending didnt really feel good enough. But the 3 hours gameplay felt like 10 hours. Tottally worth the but though."
13579,"beautiful to look at, interesting story, fun gameplay, so far really awesome game :3"
13580,"Dank game. 8/8 m8, no h8"
13581,"This game is short you will most likely beat it in about 2 hours give or take depending on your skill but you will beat it in one sit down. For some that could be a deal breaker. The Enviorment is simple but satisfying it ranges ice caves and caverns with glowing plants to floating towns. The story is told by the protagnist to his daughter wanting a bed time story which helps you really get immersed into the game. Now the goal of the game is to find your Uncle who went missing so being curious you stumble accross his lab and get to sent to a different planet. You then swing grapple and jump accross vast distances in order to find your uncle who has a habit of leaving things everywhere he goes. My only downside was when I got to the ending I was like ""Wait what? Thats it? I just got the mechanics down now its over?! awww man I want more."" Now there are collectables and sometime the narrator will tell you a little piece of the story for each one you find. For you speed runners out there, there is a timed trial which can add to the replayability."
13582,"Hey you! do you like grappling? well do you like sci-fantasy stories with low gravity and challenging platforming? and what about flying through the air at intense speeds? if you answered yes to any of these question then you should consider playing this game. a bit short but definently a great game thats pretty solid! like really solid, has 0 glitches, and is pretty well built. but short. like hella short. definently a pickup but i'd buy it on sale(like i did).

so do i reccomed it? HELLZ YEAH!"
13583,A Story About My Uncle is a phenominal story driven game with mechanics that will leave you longing for more well after the game ends. The story behind this game is well written and would be a great addition to any games library.
13584,"You know how Gone Home could have been a better game?

If it was called Gone Home: A Story About My Uncle.

Well why am I lumping them together? Because they are both short, walking-simulator type games? Well... For me, Gone Home had such a dissapointing payoff for your investment in it that I just like to think, what if instead of finding a letter from [spoiler] your sister that ran away because her parents wouldn't accept that she was gay [/spoiler] what if you spent an additional 20-30 minutes at the beginning of ASAMU looking around the house for him, before stumbling into the observatory and beginning the adventure game that was made?

Well, I thought it was a cool idea.

Anyway, I don't know that there's a lot to say about this game, it has been reviewed by many, even featured on Steam Train.

It is an indie gem with cool 3D platforming mechanics due to your Spider-Iron-Man glove.

Pros:
Voice acting is not terrible
Story telling goes on through the background mostly
Plenty of places you can branch off the beaten trail and explore
Beautiful 3D environments
Full controller support - and by full I mean you can remap buttons, and controller is definitely the preferred way to play
The game's length of 6 levels doesn't count against it, it's a good thing to just enjoy the experience in a couple of hours, get all the acheivements, and pass it along to a friend

Cons:
Voice acting is not spectacular either
Not always that clear on where exactly to go and how to get there, leading to repeating some parts many times to figure out the solution
Less beautiful 3D elements such as the models of people
Some of the more difficult platforming sections can be especially frustrating, due to the character's tendency to bounce off of things
Some glitchy physics from time to time can send you flying

Final verdict:
7/10 Beautiful dreamlike levels with collectables and an entertaining story. Definitely one to own, but it has wildly varying difficulty and lack of some polish for a few things. This indy game is one of the best, but one you have to treat like a different kind of beast. Goes from relaxing adventure romp to frustrating physics hell often.

[spoiler] Fred fucks frogs. [/spoiler]"
13585,"Great looking game, kinda like glowey temple run in real life."
13586,"So, i played the game and i have to say this is one of the best indi games i ever played (so far).
This games is a beauty, the art style, the way of thinking, THE STORY, and every minute of gameplay is gold.
And its makes you use your brain!
10/10 T√ºrkRuss Achived"
13587,"This is a great game to play, its the money worth :D"
13588,"Really fantastic, honestly. The way your character slides with momentum when you land can be a little hard to handle and get used to, but otherwise the game has a pleasing aesthetic to it, and the controls are pretty fun once you get the hang of everything. The simplicity of the game is something to be admired as well, showing a game doesn't have to be particularly fast paced off the bat to be interesting. I would definitely recommend grabbing this game on sale, it's worth it for those interested in this sort of game."
13589,"I enjoyed this one. The story is nice and simple and the gameplay is smooth. There's hidden bits to look for if that's your thing and the mechanics are simple yet really effective. And rocket boots saved my life on more that one occasion.
The only drama mechanically I had was the grappling hook hitting the windmills. It's not overly clear as to which bit you're supposed to hit.
Apart from that the only other downside is it's quite short. There is a time trial mode but that doesn't really do it for me.

Overall a very good game and I'd reccomend it for anyone looking for a story platformer. There's no real puzzling and is more of a tarzan/walking simulator. I look forward to seeing if the team come up with anything similar but with a more puzzle aspect."
13590,10/10. One seriously amazing game.
13591,"Although I didn't play much of this game only a few minute......I'm already amazed of the gameplay and enviroment. I'm not a graphic needy gamer but this game do have amazing graphic

I highly recommend people buying this game.....
I enjoyed it since it is not even stressing like most of the game I have this is the game that cools you down"
13592,Beautiful scenarios
13593,"A nice little game about a nephew looking for his uncle (pretty self explanitory). Not very long, took me 3 hours to beat, but its a very aesthetic game. Sorta like if Peter Parker had a baby with Tony Stark, and made some kind of Spider Suit.

10/10 would struggle with ice level again"
13594,This game makes me feel like a kid again.
13595,Bought this game when it was on sale because it looked really good. It was. The art and music was good and the gameplay was quite enjoyable. I wish it was longer than a 1 hour game play through though. But still you can always replay it.
13596,"I bought this game when it was on sale for roughly 2.00$ and played it. 
Started the game and played it.

The music was great, environment is unique grappling are easy to use but a little hard to actually use properly. Overall it is a good game, well made.

The story is a little short ( only a bedtime story) and can be hard sometimes as the grappling, high jump, dash and rocket booster could make you fall if slightly miscalculated."
13597,"As much I loved this game i cannot recommend it buying it at full price. The Story and the graphics are very nice indeed, but my biggest problem is length. It only took me 3 hours. Buy it only on sale. If you would buy this at full price you would very dissapointed."

13599,"First person physics platformer with amazing atmosphere and a cute story. As you progress, it does get ridiculously hard, but it's always rewarding enough to keep going, even after you have fallen to your death over, and over, and over, and over... I very much recommend it! And it's from Swedish developers, so that's cool!"
13600,Afteer playing just a bit of it I must say that I thrughly am enjoying it! Love the challenge of trying to use the movement system to move around and how well the movement system is actually done!! The graphics and stuff are also pretty good and I think the story is really interesting!!! Will probably update this review once I finish the game!!! #AwesomeGame #SuperFun
13601,"So far I'm really enjoying this game, for the price it is a must buy!"
13602,"Well, the first thing I have to say about this game is it left me with kinda mixed feelings. It was definitely fun, but VERY short (finished the game in 3,5 hours including the time I left it running to take a shower, cook breakfast and drive my girlfriend to work which leaves cca 2 hours for the game itself). 
Also most of the game is extremely easy. The rare parts that are not so easy are only challenging because they force you to fly around in mid air rotating a lot...that tends to be disorienting.
The gameplay is very straightforward. You learn almost everything at the beginning (only one ability is added a bit later) and use that all over again for the remainder of the game. The only reason it doesn't become all that dull and repetetive is the fact that the game is so very short.
The story is like a fairlytale. The MacGuffin narrative style. Nice, simple. 

And that's exactly what the game is...Nice, simple...and short. Fun for those 2 hours, worth the 2,59‚Ç¨ in sale. Definitely not worth the full price though."
13603,"A Story About My Uncle is one of those games i call ""steam gem¬¥s"" the colors, npc¬¥s, and level build is simply beautiful and amazing, for me...this game is something for itself, there are no games like this one, at least not that awesome, whenever i streamed horror games on Twitch tv, i had that feeling of getting sucked into the game and i couldnt handle that, for the first time i had that feeling in a game where i didnt got scared at all. so for me this is one of my most favourite games i have ever played! If you are able to get it GET IT, you will like it if you like all this ""fictional stuff"" or stories like The hobbit, Spiderwick or Avatar then the game will totally suck you in.

im from switzerland so please dont complain about my english, im tryharding right here!

------------------------------
pros
------------------------------
-Amazing graphics
-Awesome Design ( colors everywhere *.* )
-nice mechanics ( Smooth movement, nice Fly-Mechanics )
-cool story ( Adventure )
-runtime of 4h ( if you do a speedrun ) 
------------------------------
cons
------------------------------
i honestly didnt find cons yet."
13604,"It's a good game with basic platforming, get's pretty interesting/challenging towards the ending. I wished it was more story-drivin though. If you like Portal you will probably like this game, get it on sale!"
13605,"Just finished this game.

Are you tired of violent games and want to just have something nice for a change? ASAMU does just that, and it is really nice - the story is intriguing, environment is fantastic, gameplay can be very challenging but fun and it is overall a very pleasant experience. Can only recommend, best played with X360 gamepad.

9/10"
13606,"Buy this game. Seriously, it is approachable for almost everybody and one of the best games i've ever played in my life, and believe me, my library is just a tiny fraction of the things i've played. 

The game feels very natural, and its a shame its so short. But the replay value is great since you can go back and do time trails or try to gather all the collectibles in the game. The story is extremely well done, although the ending is pretty anticlimactic. The game is also very forgiving. There were 2 checkpoints that were a little too far back, but overall you get put back in the action almost instantly after you fail a certain part of the level. The flow of the game is great and the story is engaging and lighthearted, yet it still manages to creep in a little sense of uneasiness from time to time. It shares the style and feel of phychonauts and it is a great example of narration done right. 

I don't do reviews or recommendations for games very often, but this is an overlooked masterpiece that everyone should have played, and I believe it came out at the wrong time. If this were published around 2006-2007 i believe this would have taken off like a rocketship.

""A great experience and a nice escape from the AAA games that dominate the market. Content-wise it is worth 5 bucks, but experience-wise it's a priceless piece of art."" 9/10 - MrMeasa aka Watermelon

"
13607,"Grapple, super jump, rocket boots, and carrying a mutant frog girl on your back = Perfect combination.  4 hours to beat, challenging but not too hard.  Charming story.  Highly recommended!"
13608,"Nice game!!
You should totally buy it."
13609,"Relatively short game,
However one of the most unique and refreshing I've played in recent memory.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would highly recommend to anyone looking for something a little off the beaten path..  I hope to see more from these guys in the future!"
13610,"A very short game, but honestly some of the most fun I have had with any game on steam. 
I recommend this highly, espically if you catch it on a sale, but don't pay full price unless you want to fully support this team haha :)"
13611,"Nice graphic and impressive game experience, but the achievement design is distressing, though I spent 6 hrs to finish this game with hundreds time of falling, I could not even get any achievement, that kinda upsets me."
13612,"So far I've played three and a half levels, and there isn't really anything that makes me want to keep playing. The story is almost nonexistent and there's no soundtrack to keep you fixed to the objective. Really, I was expecting at least SOME storyline to this game, but I can't find enough of one to enjoy this game.

END GAME:
Now that I've finished the game I can write a full review on it. The gameplay is largely repetetive with little in the way of new puzzles or new terrain styles. The objective is sometimes very difficult to see and even harder to reach. The difficulty of this game is for well-skilled gamers, which conflicts with the story. The story is something really best suited for a kid in single digits, and most kids that age don't have the skills necessary to complete this game. More than that, most kids that age play on consoles and not Steam."
13613,"This game feels like a child of Portal and Fable. It's beautiful.

Nice poignant story, stunning scenery, pretty convincing physics and tight controls.

A solid first-person platformer, it gets everything right. Recommended if you like non-violent first-person games."
13614,"If it's on sale, I highly recommed getting this game.
Its short, but well worth it.
2 Hours of gameplay or so.
But the story is interesting, the voice acting is weird, but unique.
The gameplay is fresh and entertaining.
The art style is pleasant and fun.

Really the only down side is how short it is. Everything else about the game was amazing."
13615,An underrated piece of art.
13616,"Such a lovely game.
I see a lot of people giving it grief for being ""short"", but if you ask me I think it the perfect length for this game. 
Especially if you think of it like a kind of bedtime story. Amidst all the other Hardcore/Lengthy games out there, this felt like such a nice relaxing break, not that it doesn't have it's difficult sections, but you never feel rushed or hurried to tackle obsticles. It felt calm, well thought out, and not to mention beautiful.
When the thing people are dissing your game most for is it's length, then I think you've made a pretty damn good game!

Well Done!
"
13617,There is something magical about this game. The sense of freedom and exploration brings nostalgia. I think everyone has to experience it.
13618,kinda tricky to get the achivements but i played it for the great graphics and adventure packed story line
13619,"Loved this game. Only a few euro to buy, it's got a nice story and doesn't hold your hand. You're given basic direction on your abilities; the rest is up to you to work out. Playing time is about 6-8 hours if you don't spend time exploring the world or looking to complete the games achievements. The game mechanics reminded me of Rayman mixed with Portal. The only thing I disliked about the game was I found it rather dark and hard to see sections of some of the world I was interacting with and sometimes it's awkward to work out the intractable models within range but this only delayed me a minute or two at a time.

Really recommend this for a casual game. 
"
13620,"I loved almost every minute of my first play-through of ""A Story about My Uncle.""  It's an incredibly well-put-together platformer with beautiful environments, a great array of platforming puzzles, and a fun premise.

I can't say enough good things about the sights and sounds of the game.  The environments were always fantastic to look at, and the sound effects and music are equally beautiful.  Put simply, it's a game-world that made me want to  be in it, for as long as possible.

The story arc is simple and kind of secondary--most of the interesting parts are revealed by finding ""optional story objects"" and I actually almost forgot I was looking for my uncle, despite the title--but I would highly recommend trying to find the extra objects, because the ones I did find were worthwhile and I will definitely be going back to find the rest.  As for having forgotten about the uncle, that might be in part because there is another character that, if you're a sap like me, will steal the show and make up for it.

I finished my first run-through in about 6 hours, so the game is pretty short, and might be shorter depending on how much better at puzzle-platformers than I am (probably a lot) and how much you care about getting the story objects (you should).  There were a few segments that I had to try several (dozen) times to complete, and a few places where some extra checkpoints would have been nice, but on the whole the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the puzzles sport a solid variety."
13621,"I picked this game up for about $2.50 on sale, and I must say that this game did what I have been wanting. I wanted a game to take me to a new world and give me a new story. The challenge along the way was good, but not so hard that it frustrated you, especially when you are focused on the beutiful atmosphere created within this wonderful piece of art.

Pros
--------
- Beautiful game
- Fair challenge with a few mechanics that are easy to master.
- Story is nice and pulls you in (even though it is simple)
- Brings you to a different world

Cons
--------
- Relatively short game
- Not much replayability, but it's not really a game that was designed for replaying much

"
13622,"A simple, short, fun game. The graphics aren't AAA, but the devs certainly know how to use what they've got; the game looks beautiful. Game mechanics are incredibly fun and controls are fluid. The story's a little bland, but being a platformer, the game doesn't really suffer. Except for one or two sticky spots, the levels are very easy. Depending on how cheap you are, it may or may not be worth full price. If you're just looking for pure content, you should probably wait for it to go on sale. I definitely recommend this game."
13623,"Very fun game. Platforming is awesome. The jet-boots are one of the best power ups I have ever used in any 3D platformer It's so much fun. The game is pretty hard but it's fair for the most part. Story is interesting but that's about it. Voice acting is OK it's not the best but not the worst either. Graphics are beautiful and unique.
Overall 8/10 great game for a great price (It's like $2.50 right now) I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun 3D platformer. If there was one thing i could add it would be native support for occulus rift.That would look Fucking amaizing"
13624,"Nice, nifty game. Short, but I had fun with it. I like jumping puzzles and swinging around on a big grapple thing."
13625,very addictive game and the quest are very clear.
13626,"It's a short beautiful game with a very, very beautiful story. 

I just can't say no more, because that would just spoil the short and beautiful game that it is."
13627,"If you are looking for a game that is fun and enjoyable this is your game. Its short but it will give so much enjoyment. Its story is little to non exestant, but the gameplay is wonderful and adventureus. Well worth the buy if you have the money!"
13628,Very good game. Enjoyable single player adventure. =)))))))))))))
13629,"Interesting gameplay, nice graphics."
13630,"This game is quite enjoyable. However, my opinion is mixed.

Pros:

1) Fun puzzle game (plays a bit like Portal)
2) Good visuals

Cons:

1) EXTREMELY Short (Finished after a few hours).
2) Childish dialouge.

Despite it's pretty big downfall of being too short, this is a great game to buy on sale. It's relaxing, challenging (but not too hard), and nice to look at. A good game to have to kill a slow evening."
13631,I fell in love with it. Amazing graphics and music. Gifting to all my friends.
13632,Such a great game. Wonderful story as well.
13633,"While it only takes a few hours to play to story completion, A Story About My Uncle is one of my favorite games of the last few years.  A really interesting physics puzzle game in the same vain as Portal, it's also got a neat little framing narrative about a boy going on a surreal adventure.  Even at full $12.99 retail price it's worth a look if you're into physics puzzle games, and if you see it on sale it's definitely worth a buy."
13634,"this is a realy good game for people that like sci-fi 
but i think it is a very great game and a good story.
:D"
13635,"A Story About My Uncle is very addictive game and the quest are very clear. The game has lots of puzzles and challenges. One of drawback is the narrator‚Äôs voice; it‚Äôs not the type that attracts your attention. In matter of fact sometime it‚Äôs kind of annoying. Another downside would be, you might lose focus of where to go from time to time, but in an overall I would recommend the game, maybe it reminds me of Valve‚Äôs game Portal in some way."
13636,JUMPY PLATFORMING IN FIRST PERSON IS LIKE GIVING LEGS TO A FRIDGE AND TELLING IT TO PERFORM A HIGH WIRE CIRCUS ACT.  COME ON WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THIS IS SORT OF GAME MECHANIC ONLY LEADS TO RAGE !!!
13637,"Great gameplay, probably one of the best platformers I've played in terms of mechanics.  The story is alright, the setting seems a little too empty (though it's beautiful).  It would help a lot if some more of the NPCs had lines rather than just ignoring you.  Definitely worth playing though, it's really fun to soar through the air."
13638,"Buy this game even if you dont know me trust im my humanity that you will enjoy this game
"
13639,"I wouldn't recommend it. These are pluses of a game:

- Kind of new idea.
- Beautiful world.
- Beautiful music (although you won't give a damn about it in short time).

And these are minuses:

- Not comfortable physics. Usual jump carries you to Jupiter.
- Boring. It. Is. Really. Boring. Especially aften an hour of playing. Very repetative.
- Not clear in places. I still think I did half of the levels the way they shouln't be done. And that million of little alike islands, I couldn't understand if I was going in right direction for like 50 times. It results in my inabiluty to fully explore the world. ""Oh, that island looks interesting, maybe there is something in there? Let's tr- Damn. Start from the place 200 miles away. Cool"". After 100500 tries of fucking with it I gave up.
- Dark in cave-levels. It just pissed me off. It's not a horror or some RPG where you have to kill the monsters in black dungeons, so why the hell is it so dark??? It's supposed to be interesting to search for Uncle's notes in the darkness? Well it wasn't. I didn't feel the strong atmosphere either. [spoiler]And no I'm talking about the places where there weren't the light-flowers and my monitor settings are okay[/spoiler]
- Achievements. For harcore nerds. Um, okay, but what about some usual basic ones?
- DAT ENDING. Are you serious?

To conclude I'd want to say that it is one of few games I wanted to end as quickly as possible. Disappointing."
13640,Simply awesome! I am expecting more journeys like that!
13641,"The full price is propably too high for a game like this. 
Although it's sweet and charming, it has very little replay value. It has very nice graphics and the general peacefullness makes it great for unwinding but still...

Wait until it's on sale and you will be content with both the game and the price ;)"
13642,"Recommended with a 'but'.
It's a nice little game with a charming story. It's nice and short which help keep it's focus, which is always a plus. The level design can be a bit confusing, but the lack of handholding is actually pretty great. It helps the game feel more open than it really is, since you feel like you can go anywhere. And you want to explore this fantastical world. Once you do, however, you will soon find out it's barren and quite devoid of (non-plant)life. Some ambient creatures would be great to make it feel less empty.
All the mechanics are revealed pretty early on in the game, so it loses some of it's momentum later on. The grappling system is pretty one dimensional. It's more of a harpoon than a  grapple; so no swinging (would be a great mechanic to switch between the two), unfortunately.

The story was why I bought this game though: and it's really charmingly told. If you got 5 bucks to spend you can't really go wrong, in my opinion."
13643,"Amazing story line,Good graphics,Love it"
13644,Hands down the most beautiful game I have ever played... cant fault one thing about it!!
13645,wow. i'm speechless. :o
13646,"This is a really good game if you want to relax. Its just for relaxing. No more. I wanned to, so i had lot of fun.."
13647,"Short but sweet. I really liked this game a lot. The challenge was enjoyable but never got to be too much. Controller play was good but I would probably have to recommend keyboard and mouse for the later parts because  the left joystick just doesn't get the job done in the last area. Overall if you like first-person platformers then I think you will, at the very least, get your money's worth on this one."
13648,Pretty good.
13649,"A good little platform game made by a small team on UE3. Poetic, pacific, this little gem will entertain you for about 6-7h and more if you want to take on the time attack. Lots of easter eggs to spot too !"
13650,"ASAMU is a game with great movement mechanics and wonderful environments.

The game plays as an older you narrates your younger self as you go on an adventure to find your uncle. The narration, and in fact all voices in this game, are very well done.

The game is played using a series of jumps [with jump boosts] and grapples to navigate floating islands. Think of it kind of like mirrors edge with a grappling gun. The level design provides enough of a challenge for the game to not be boring, but not so difficult that it gets in the way of the story. However, If you are after something trickier, then see the achievment list for some harder challenges.

I played this game with a keyboard and mouse. The store says it supports controllers, but I seriously wouldn't reccomend even trying that, as this game will require very precise movements that will be impossible unless you are very skilled with a controller.

The graphics on the environments are wonderful in this game, and the accompanying soundtrack adds lots to the experience. The vistas in this game are also beautiful, especially the ones where you can see the landscape with the sky in the background. The character design of the ""frog people"" is a bit questionable if you look too closely, but frankly I don't see any way that you could make ""frog people"" look nice. The developers did a good attempt at it, though.

I didn't have any trouble installing or running the game, but I did find that in certain areas of the levels, it seems as if the designers didn't realise you could reach there and you kind of ""shift through"" the environment. Luckily, you don't fall all the way through. Most of the game is linear, but in such a way that it looks pretty open, and you wont encounter this problem unless you go right to the edge islands of the levels.

The only major gripe I have with this game is that it is very short. I wish they had perhaps extended the story somewhat, rather than ending it where they did, but that doesn't affect my enjoyment of the story that there is in any way. You should buy this game if you like parkour running styles [albeit with a grappling hook], and you'll get a nice story narrated while you play."
13651,"Really incredible, challenging platforming cut short and drowned by an awful story with terrible voice acting. I would have preferred that they made this game a series of puzzle rooms with no story whatsoever rather than shoe-horning in a mediocre story with one of the most unsatisfying ""conclusions"" in gaming. It all just ends abruptly and leaves you feeling empty and let down. That said I will probably return to play the time trials as the platforming is really awesome."
13652,7/10
13653,"a damn good game,a must play.
"
13654,Fun game play but it's really short.
13655,god damn it fred.
13656,"Every time I load it up and get in the game, I instantly start to spin to the left.  No problems with any other games but this one can't be played since I have no control or way to stop the turning that I can find."
13657,"this is a fun story and puzzeli based game where you jump from cave roof to flying rocks over a nice looking world,
thier is no combat is this game and that is fine.
only bad part.....it is sort"
13658,This game is so frustratingly addictive.
13659,"I really liked the game. The plot is quite interesting - definitely original as I haven't seen such a story in any other game - and the game leaves that nostalgic sensation after you finish it. Visuals are on a high level and so is the soundtrack. At the begging the game might seem a little bit difficult. But this level is kept through the whole game. It's a casual platform game with an interesting idea of using the grappling device as well as boosted jump and rocket shoes. What differentiates this game from majority of others is also that the environment is just beautiful. A few times I even stopped moving forward to just look around thinking ,wow'. The game is neatly made. I haven't encountered any bugs (you can eventually get stuck if you keep straying form the path but then you can just tap F7 to go back to previous checkpoint). There are some collectibles which unlock some options in the game and achievements here on Steam (they are very difficult to get though).

Ok. What are the cons then? I have found just one: the game is too short. Therefore I wouldn't really buy it for 13‚Ç¨ but as soon as it gets cheaper I totally recommend buying it. The game is one that you can replay several times and after first time it's a relaxing experience."
13660,"Great fluid and responsive platformer. Fast paced, nice gameplay and good visuals. This all with an amazing story. It is a short game though. But i would recommend it to anyone if you got 3 hours of spare time."
13661,"YOUR DAUGHTER ASKS YOU FOR SOME LUNCH CHANGE FOR SCHOOL, AND YOU THEN BEGIN TO TELL HER THAT YOU ALONE TRAVELED TO AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE TO MEET AND SAVE FROG PEOPLE AT HER AGE. THAT YOU ALSO TRAVELED HUNDRED OF KILOMETERS UP HILLS, BOTH WAYS, WITHOUT ANY PARENTAL SUPERVISION WITH LASERS COMMING OUT OF YOUR ARMS AND HAVING DANGEROUS EQUIPMENT ON WHILE ALSO CARRYING A FROG PERSON ON YOUR BACK. YOUR DAUGHTER HAD NEVER SINCE THEN ASKED FOR ANY CHANGE FROM YOU AGAIN."
13662,"like this game, you can free your mind here, you can go whereever you want, anf this game so good with 
HD. i really want the next chapter in this game. i will wait. Pretty well game"
13663,"Loved it. Very Portal-esque, with grappling puzzle mechanics rather than portals. It's pretty simple, but a very beautiful game. Being able to explore through such a pretty and immersive fantasy world was nice, and some of the other minor visual effects like cracking the ground after a long fall were enjoyable, too. I'm 99% certain this game was made in the same engine as Goat Simulator, cause boy could you make yourself go FLYING sometimes. Some parts of the game were incredibly frustrating (ice cave, pls) although I think it would've helped if my hamster wheel computer could run it more smoothly. Also, if you're one of those people who just has to get every single achievment, well... you'll be in my prayers. Most of them require playing the game with near perfection, while the rest will require you to explore every pixel of land you can stand on. Nevertheless, frustration aside, I thoroughly enjoyed ASAMU. Look at that, I even called it by its abbreviation.


Overall, 9/10 would laser grapple after my uncle again. Every time."
13664,"I don't really care much about stories or even jumping platformer mechanics. This game was a good experience none the less. The mechanics are the best part of the game where the main mechanic is the grappling hook used to jump/hang around the ""puzzles"". They then added jump boost, higher jump and so on which compliments the core game mechanic, which is the grappling hook. A very smooth and well thought out design from a game design perspective. It is also a very solid game mechanic which was used very well from a gamers perspective.

The story itself was interesting enough. Frogs, portal, crystals, hovering islands, uncle and so on. But the context it was used in was again very well done. Everything in the game makes sense with the story. The mechanics, the elements, the environment, the npc, the architecture choice and so on all complimented the story and mechanics. Nothing felt out of place or randomly placed.

The level design might be flawed in some areas for some people, as it does require you to look around or boost jump to find out where to go next. Besides that it was a good level design too but not the best part of the game.

All in all a very good game but the closure of the story could have been better."
13665,10/10 would bang
13666,Addicting gameplay- felt somehow similar to Mirror's Edge (which I loved). Highly recommend.
13667,"A Story About My Uncle is a truly charming experience. The game's settings are absolutely goreous, and the gameplay is really fun (think first person Spiderman in a fantasy setting... with jet boots!). The music is wonderful, though the voice acting was nothing special. The story to go along with it, considering the game is called ""A Story..."", is not bad, although it is rather short and will probably leave you wanting more.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game and I really loved using the grapple to swing around like Spiderman. It's just unfortunate that the game was really short and the story didn't really compensate for it. Definitely get it when it's on a sale.

Enjoy! :D"
13668,"This game is gorgeous, fun to play and exciting. I absolutely love the challenges it poses, especially all the optional additional ones. A must have if you enjoy rpgs and flying through the air."
13669,"I can fully recommend this game! It's a cute story and really exciting gameplay. 
Also kinda cheap for the fun I had. 

Sadly a not too well knoen gem..."
13670,"Fun little 5 hour game. Totally worth the cost I got it on sale. I found the difficulty curve just right. Nothing was terribly hard for too long, but it was challenging enough. Story is cute and enjoyable. Game has very polished gameplay and smooth relaxing graphics. Excellent job of making the world feel huge after traveling long distances through the levels. It's a lot of fun soaring through the air on long stretches."
13671,Original and stunning adventure game.
13672,"I usually don't make reviews, but I really enjoyed this game. It had a decent story and beautiful environment, and the platforming was entertaining. Definitely worth checking out if you see it on sale."
13673,It's a short but very beautiful game.
13674,"[h1]  Introduction            [/h1]     
	A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer. The game slowly works the various mechanics into the game and I found this very refreshing. The game was never insanely easy or difficult, the devs got this perfect. Even if you mess up there is most likely a check point very close by. The story is interesting, but sadly it is insanely short. I was able to finish it in under 3-4 hours, and the ending is very abrupt. Along with that, the models for the frog people are very odd looking and awkward. Other than those complaints the game is very enjoyable.

 	A Story About My Uncle is an enjoyable experience, until you reach the end and realize how short it is. The gameplay is very fun and the story is rather interesting. There are issues with this game, but it would be 100% worth it to pick this hidden gem up on sale.

13675,"A very unique and interesting game with a great narrator and story. I won't go into detail in the story but i will say it is very charming. The few characters that are in the game have the perfect voice actors! But the gameplay is what makes the game so unique. You have a suit that allows you to jump to great hights, run really fast, and grapple on rocks and other materials pulling yourself towards them. The suit makes the movement very enjoyable and i haven't seen such a movement system before. The game maybe a little short for some people (I finished it in about 3.5 hours with a lot of exploring.) but think it was just perfect. If it had been any longer i think it would have dragged on. The game is super polished and shows some great level design and almost no bugs. The graphics are overall great with some really good lighting effects and texture work. The soundtrack fits the mood and and has some really great ambient tracks to portray the mood of being alone in a huge environment.

Overall a great adventure worth playing trough. It's also a bargain when it's on sale. I think i got it for like 2 or 3‚Ç¨."
13676,"3.2h... as of writing, that's exactly how long it took me to finish it.

Pros:
It's fun,
graphics are decent,
‚Ä¢ Mechanics are nice.
‚Ä¢ Reminicent of Mirror's edge, without the violence. You're like spider man, but not a spider. and the scenary reminds one of an old school game RTS where you would have floaty islands that would fight each other... 
‚Ä¢ It has repetability but I'm wrtiting this just after finishing it, so idk when and if i'll play it again. I'm curious about the time trial. (it has time trial)
‚Ä¢ They did a nice job with the story, and the world is something new.. (well unless you played that RTS I mentioned above, or if you played Trine2, the goblin area is floaty stuff as well but that's an screen-crawler fantasy RPG)

Cons:
‚Ä¢ It's short... as in done in 3.2h short... it might take some people even less than that...since I looked a bit for some of the colectables, once I noticed them.
‚Ä¢ You have to pay for it. (but that kind of goes for any game) so get it on sale if you can."
13677,"A nice, short, little game. Very nice and fun gameplay, gets harder and harder to the end. Gorgeous settings, awesome soundtrack. The voice acting was kinda weird because the narrator and his daughter are clearly European and have an accent, so speaking to each other in English was kind of off-putting. Another thing is that there are too many damn dark, cave levels and not enough ones with those endless skies; I'd like to see more of that.

The gameplay was original (I think), it gives you a certain satisfaction of freedom when you leap forward and going at catapult speeds.

However ASAMU has a weak story, especially the ending. The premise was pleasing, and the epilogue was memorable; but overall it's not a solid narrative. I don't think I'd recommend this for full price, but go ahead, it's quite fun either way."
13678,By far one of the best non combat games I have played. So happy to be able to play it.
13679,"This game was published by the same people who made the pile of poop known as Goat Simulator.

Pros:
Quite a nice story
Mechanics are pretty fun to play around with
Only a very small amount of bugs and glitches in the game
Jet boots

Cons:
The ending feels super sloppy and rushed
The mechanics are fun, but feel like a rip-off spider man swing
Character models are really ugly (Both humans and the weird smurf type people)
2 specific levels are really frustrating
Hidden collectibles which half are in plain sight and the other half of them is impossible to find
It's only 2 hours long and it's $13 dollars which is ridiculous for such a short game


Overall I rate this game a 5.5/10 at best, maybe pick it up when it's on sale but for full price it's not worth it."
13680,Please make a 2nd game!!!!!
13681,10/10
13682,"This game is fantastic it has amazing visuals, gameplay is addictive, and the story is touching as far as games go. The only negatives about this game are its short by the time you get proficient at the controls your halfway done with the game. But if they make a sequel id buy it release day just because of the story. Ill close by saying, dont buy this game full price its amazing but not worth it, get it on sale, but eather way this game is a fun way to kill 3 hours."
13683,"short but good. This game has a interesting way of story telling, unique mechanics and a nice looking art style. altho I played through the entire game in just 2 hours I do not regret my purchase. I bought it when it was on sale for about ‚Ç¨4. I would recommend buying on sale because of the shortness."
13684,"An interesting game.
If you see it in a bundle get it , this is good one time play blast.
"
13685,"All i have to say about this game is great gameplay, amazing scenaries but too short."
13686,"A casual and relaxing 3-D platformer, the movement is fun and the controls are easy to master.  A great game for your kids or if you aren't looking for anything too engrossing but just need to unwind.  
"
13687,"Like Mirrors Edge but not
"
13688,"7/10, the game is great but i want more achievements. There are like no easy Achievements and i don't like that."
13689,"an OK story, more of a filler for the gameplay, which was really fun. This game is definitely a physics grappling hook simulator. sort of cut-the-rope-3D."
13690,"Fun for the grappling hook mechanic and first-person platforming. Short, less than 2 hours, but a fun distraction when it's on sale."
13691,Solid grapple hook platformer in pretty environments. Having a good story is a plus also.
13692,"Pros: Amazing visuals, mechanics work flawlessly and are  crazy fun, nice story, loveable characters, good difficulty curve as levels progress

Cons: Background characters are bland and expressionless, levels can get difficult for someone not into first-person puzzlers (although if you weren't, why would you play this?)

Loved this game, I don't care if it was short. One thing that would greatly improve this game would be some sort of sandbox level to grapple around in as it's very satisfying to be Spider-Man"
13693,Great puzzle-platformer. Intuitive controls and nice graphics.
13694,"It's an original and lovely game, but keep in mind that it can be beaten in 2 hours. Althouth it's a really short time, that feels just enough. Not too long, not too short, if you ask me. Why? Because this game is about jumping ... that's all. Yeah, it sounds really boring, but once you start playing it, you won't be able to stop it. 
It has really nice graphics and wonderful environment. Voice acting could be better, but there's nothing serious wrong with it.

Should you buy it? Kind of. For a couple of bucks, sure. It's great fun! What about for more than $10/10‚Ç¨ ? NO!"
13695,"I really enjoy the game and would give it 5 stars. the only problem for me is that after a little while into the ice cave scene, It's just to laggy to play on my computer."
13696,"Really fun puzzle game. The mechanics are simple, but not something I had seen before. The game is very short. Voice acting is ok, not great. Story is only there to convince you to keep moving forward, but nothing memorable at all. Gameplay is fun, and pretty challenging at times. This took me about 3 hours to beat maybe. I also did not find all the collectable items, there seems to be a few in each area. There is about 3 different ""worlds"" or areas in this game.

It is worth the playthrough. Not sure if I will go through it again, but it was definitely worth picking and playing it."
13697,"this game is shit the ice part fucking bullshit!!! play this and you will want to kill yourself! i hate this game so much, fuck this game fuck fuck fuck iiiitttt!!!!!!"
13698,ONE OF THE BEST STEAM GAMES EVER!!!!
13699,"Is and always will be my favorite 3D platformer game. The game slowly increasing the diffeculty, just enough to keep you engaged but not so much to make you sweat over it.  Casual to a fault, and in all the right ways. I love this gmae"
13700,I like this game a lot. I can see it going somewhere. It is just plain old beautiful
13701,"I got this game for free off IGN and I didn't think it was going to be good but it was amazing. I only wish there was more content because the game is very short, but it's still very good."
13702,This game was utterly beautiful. The narration style is really sweet and the gameplay itself is relaxing yet challenging. You meet very interesting characters and explore a truly fantastical and stunning world. The whole things wraps up in a really sweet and heart warming way. Playing this reminded me of my very first play-through of portal 1. Truly a masterpiece.
13703,"[b][h1]SHORT VERSION[/h1][/b]
A Story About My Uncle is a fantastic First Person puzzle game. It has excellent story, the 
graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is challenging, but fun. The ending is a cold hard slap
back into reality, and every part is fantastic. Long story short:
""Oh, there's a huge gap! [i]energy grappling hook go![/i]""
[b]Fwoosh[/b]

[b][h1]LONG VERSION[/h1][/b]
Graphics: 9
Gameplay: 9
Story/Lore: 10
Controls (Keyboard) 10
Controls (Controller): 8
Total: 9.4

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics on this game are downright amazing. This has to be one of the most beautiful games 
I've ever played.  From the caves. to the stars of the floating rocks, to that weird worm thing. 
What [i]was[/i] that thing? Anways, graphics are a 10. I had to remove a point because of a key 
factor this game needs: [b]Oculus Rift support.[/b] This game would be absolutely amazing with it. 
They are running on Unreal, so they should be able to do it.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay of this game is amazing as well, giving the perfect blend of difficulty and fun, while 
also allowing a bit of roaming. There are hidden collectables that unlock unlockables, like 
changing your beam color, to turning into a goat (yes, really), and story collectables, which add 
extra narration. Removed a point for shortness, maxing out my run at around 5 hours, and the 
replayability isn't that great. So, 1 point off there.


[b]Story/Lore[/b]
The story of this game is fantastic. It is narrated by the protaganist, telling the story as a 
bedtime story to his daughter. The story is amazing, and the ending is absolutely fantastic. The 
hidden story collectables really add on to the story, making it a lot better. What this game lacks 
in game time, makes up for in story.


[b]Controls (Keyboard}[/b]
I find this game best played with a keyboard, which is  a rare thing for me. You need to react 
fast, and sometimes you can press your mouse faster than compressing the trigger, so I have to say 
keyboard is better, neither set of controls are bad, just personal prefference.


[b]Controls (Controller)[/b]
[i]Played With Wireless Xbox 360 Controller[/i]
Like I said before, faster to click than to compress, so I really don't have much to say here. Both 
controls are great, neither one is bad, and both can be used. There is a bit of a delay with 
wireless 360 controllers, so I removed 2 points."
13704,"This game is really good. atmosphere of this game is amazing, story line seems good too( i havent finish this game yet). 
the idea of this game is the thing i praise the most, that first person adventure is quite amazing. 
well, if you are going to compare with mirror's edge or dying light, go ahead play them. but for something very indie, and something casural. choose this one.


but sometimes, you will feel like you are getting a cancer. this game  is a headache production. 

"
13705,"This is a game targetted at children, lovely story and nice gameplay.

But i can't recommend it because it TOO damn hard!

my 6 year old gave up after just a few moments on the first level and my 14 year old rage quit in the caverns.

I gave it a go myself and found myself rage quitting several times, there are just some jumps that took well over 10+ attempts to get.  Too hard, not relaxing."
13706,"Ok Jump puzzle game. Some of the links are a bit narrow to judge and the further you go the less the levels visually guide you. If you are looking for a game with a grapple and have a few hours to see how a developer plays with the mechanic,  you should spend sometime looking at how they do it in this game with out the restraint of grapple points that are seen in other titles."
13707,"Very unique game with a great story. It felt like playing a movie, if that makes any sense. From the very begining I was fully immersed in the game, and towards the end I really felt connected to the characters and story. Highly recomend!"
13708,"Pretty good game. Too much unskippable cutscene, but the gameplay is awesome. 8/10 only 2 hours tho

After reading other reviews, I'm surprised that people found this game hard. I am way below average in intelligence, but I finished this game without finding it hard at all. Sure, it's ""puzzle-y"", but there's really only one way to go, and you can pretty much always see where you need to go by the blue markings. They even tell you right where to grapple most of the time..."
13709,"A good game and really fun when playing for the first time especially, Also buzz off /r/ShittySteamReviews"
13710,"Even though I haven't finished yet, this game is outstanding by delivering everything I expected from it and a bit more. Like Steam cards :P . In Garry's Mod you can have this grappling hook crossbow which also shoots arrows which seemed a lot of fun if there was a map where it were useful. This game is as if someone played with that and tried to make a proper videogame about it.
The game tries to immerse us in a bedtime story context to which it pays quite attention to detail. When you press the ""Exit to Desktop"" button, it has the father figure (the narrator and, supposedly, player character) suggesting that maybe it's too late to keep telling the story and we can continue next day. Usually people complaint about child actors, but this game doesn't bother me in any way about it. Plus, there is piggybacking involded. You know... like that level from Metro2033... But piggybacking with an EXOSKELETON!

Some levels require a good framerate to get thorugh properly, but even then, the game is very tolerant on which route or methods one takes to complete the level. So, there's quite a room for mistakes most of the time.

I could critique the fact that sometimes there seems to be terrain collision issues, but quite minor ones. Maybe related to my computer being really slow. When hitting the head  on ceillings, I could glimpse outside of the level and if I forced the character moving through terrain the screen would start shaking as when you press the mouse for powered jumps.

There is also a problem in conveying the Crystal's game mechanic. There are crystals on later levels that grow from walls and ceiling which can be used to refill the number of grapples available in mid-air. Problem is that I would spend a lot of time failling to use them repeatedly until it became frustating. It turns out that you can only use these crystals while the grapples aren't depleted. So they can be clicked when there's one grapple left, but not if your out of grapples.

I'd like to add about something that I found really inspiring in this game which is very interesting to try in future games. There are characters which use a weird writing system. So one of them travels with the player and translates some inscriptions. But when that character leaves, she lets you know (if I recall correctly) that their writting transcribes easily to real world writting, so it is let up to the player to remember how the translations work to be able to read further inscriptions. I'm sorry to tell that I failed this challange as I thought that the writting was fictional and didn't bother to pay attention to when it was being translated. It's unusual for a game developer to trust the player's intelligence so much!

 42 out of 10 - Would enter a quantum garbage collecting dumpster again."
13711,"- Long enough
- Fun mechanics
- Great music
- Interesting story

Worth the price it's being sold at.
Outstanding for the very first game of ""Gone North""!"
13712,"Beutiful, charming, and more inportantly fun. A Story About My Uncle combines very unique and fun game mechanics with a charming storyline to make one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. It's over very quickly, but I enjoyed every moment of it."
13713,"BEWARE OF SUDDEN DIFFICULTY CHANGE TOWARDS ENDING!  Wait for sale!

I didn't expect such sadistic level design =>
Ice cave level: Game mood shifts suddenly to hardcore
I just somehow finished the cubes level, and now I see everyone's complaining about the level right after that. I am very much not enjoying the game now. Goes to show that steamers should read community hub before buying game. 'Glad I bought this beautiful game on sale, 'cause now I imma watch the rest online. :(

I'm extremely biased towards exploration, having grown up with Myst games."
13714,"I loved the game its fantastic and the enviorment is so well created and beautiful while i am still stuck on the puzzle's i personaly think this game was worth the 20 dollars i payed for when it first came out
"
13715,"Very good gameplay ideas leading to clever puzzles, with many ways to solve a problem. Controls soon become completely natural, and it feels pretty awesome to fly around. Quite a Spiderman simulator, really. And a very pretty one at that."
13716,"Great game. It's basically a 3D platformer game, with an awesome storyline, and great naration. The mechanics are awesome, and it is mildly challenging. 10/10 Should be something that you can say ""I played that"" to."
13717,"it's an awesome game <333 
love it so much"
13718,This game can be very frutrating at times. I have wanted to give up many times. It is very atmospheric and has a great story. It is about a boy in a story looking for his uncle.
13719,"I don't even have an uncle. 
10/0 Uncles"
13720,pretty cool platformer
13721,"It‚Äôs amazing that such a short game could have such a powerful impact in terms of both gameplay and story.

This game has an amazing environment and visuals with a progressive story. If you‚Äôre looking to buy it it‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre interested in the grapple mechanic, and that is quite well done, unique, and very fun for sure.

Not too hard or too long, but overall a very atmospheric and unique game that is well worth a play through if you can get it for a good price.
"
13722,"Super fun parkour 3d platformer, with grapple mechanics. Little frustrating to start with until I got used to the movement and controls. Overall graphics are very nice, not to complicated or distracting but can be dazzling at certain points. Difficulty ramps up slowly giving you time to learn over time, and will test you towards the end a lot with some really difficult chained jumps.

My biggest gripe is with the grappling hook itself. While you have an indicator when it can latch, it's difficult to figure out how close you have to be to the object for it to trigger. This is mostly evident later with larger objects you want to grapple on which may trick you as being close enough when in fact you are not. Only other lackluster detail is that there is no map, so you might be lost trying to figure out where to go next. While the path is not linear it nearly is so, it's just the matter of figuring out how to proceed, which may have multiple options in immediate vicinity. 

The story is fairly simple but charming if not satisfying towards the end. If you enjoy platforming, decent story and up for some challenge, do get this.

9/10"
13723,"Great game for just chillin, a few bugs here and there.
6/10 storyline

8/10 total, grab it on sale :)"
13724,"Beautiful game with a fun story. I love the aspect of telling his daughter a bed time story though I wish there was even more dialog, maybe some more types of puzzles like using the grapler to move things. All things aside though the game was great, this is a game meant souly for the frustrating, and momentum puzzle player.  If you like mirrors edge you will enjoy this, every puzzle is with in your grasp but sometimes your missing that one step to victory but makes it fun to play. Need's a replay value gaame mode. Beautiful and intriuging thumbs up."
13725,"A Story About My Uncle:

Pros: Brilliant Parkour
         Story

Cons: Short

After all, a story about my uncle is a fine little adventure that lasts for only 3 hours but 3 wonderful hours. Only buy on sale though because of its shortness."
13726,"So far xbox controller not working, not happy"
13727,"Short and sweet. The gameplay is phenomenal, displaying the essence of adventure and excitement, which makes up for its short storyline."
13728,"TL;DR: 7/10 - decent game, do not recommend (unless you're a sadist)

Do you love the jumping puzzles of Guild Wars 2?  Do you wish there was a game of nothing but that?  Do you actually think GW2's jumping puzzles require a little too much thought? Then buy this game.  Otherwise, buy at your own risk.

My biggest complaint about the game is that the jumping puzzles, (which is all this game is, btw) don't really feel like ""puzzles.""  It's not about finding the correct route to go in an environment - there's only one linear path, through pretty much the whole game. The puzzle part comes into play when you realize you have to jump at JUST the right angle, swing to JUST the right arc, let go at JUST the right time. That's not a puzzle. That's just a bunch of linear jumping that's annoyingly hard... And that's not fun.

I almost rage quit on three different occasions, but didn't because, to my suprise, I wanted to know how the story ended.  The story ended pretty much exactly how I expected it to end - no shocking twists - but I was still happy to finish it.  I want to say it's a bland story, but I cared (tho I don't know why), so I guess it wasn't.

The environments / scenery are very pretty.  It's all floating rocks and gaping holes, but they're very PRETTY floating rocks and gaping holes. And you'll die often enough that you'll have plenty of time to admire the scenery.  It took me four deaths to notice the washed up whale, but the game made sure I kept dying until I friggin' noticed it. (Which was a nice break of levity from the repetitive death-thing.)

The game is also strangely forgiving AND sadistic.  Dunno if I've explain this well enough or not, but you will die.  A lot.  And I thought it was really nice of Coffee Stain Studios to not draw out the death scene. No screaming or thrashing arms at the empty unforgiving space through which you are plummeting. Not even punishing death music.  Just, ""Oops, I missed"" and then you fall; cue quick fade out, you're back at your checkpoint.  Which is another thing the game was very kind about: checkpoints. There are LOTS and LOTS of checkpoints. Don't think that makes the game too easy, tho. Those checkpoints are there because you need them. Because, did I mention this?, you will die. A LOT. For stupid reasons, no good reasons, because friggin' MADDIE challenges you to something stupid that kills you both. You know, lots of reasons to die. Only one way, but lots of reasons.

The music adds well to the atmosphere of the games and works well with the scenery.

The characters aren't very high-speed in the graphics or voice acting departments, but it doesn't matter and won't detract.

The only complaints I have about the gameplay are platform edges and grappling issues.  The game seems to have a problem dealing with the edges of platforms. If I'm cutting a jump close, sometimes I will land on them, sometimes I will fall right past them. If I'm standing on an edge, I can't WALK forward and must JUMP towards the center of the platform instead. And if your line-of-grappling (that's the science term for it, really) runs through a platform's edge, it's anyone's guess whether or not the game's gonna let you get away with it.

Similarly, I had problems with the grappling hook and crystals.  [spoiler]Often, while swinging through the air, I would try shooting a crystal clump to recharge my hook and it wouldn't register, at which point I would go plummeting to my death. It led to MANY frustrating deaths.[/spoiler]

Overall, I give this game a 7/10 because for what it does, it does pretty well.  Points off for its limited definition of the word ""puzzle."" I absolutely do not recommend because it wasn't fun, and unless you're looking for a game of jumping from one obvious platform to another (and nothing else), you probably won't have fun playing it either."
13729,"Challenging, but not frustrating 1st person platformer.  I don't really understand the reviews that complained about the supposedly unclear level design; I thought it was brilliant.  Not once did I feel like I wasn't sure where I was supposed to go next.  I honestly found this game as fun as Portal."
13730,"If you like engaging story, challenging gameplay and puzzles, tight controls, new ideas and characters actually worth giving a damn about, this is the game for you."
13731,"The experience was very pleasant and I had a great time playing through the game in a few sessions, it left me wanting more!"
13732,"I saw this game on sale for about $4 and after completion I regret not paying the full price. I got through the game in just under 4 hours, but I'd have paid more than the original price for it. 
This game reminds me of why games used to be great. It's story is sweet and flawless, there is no overcomplicated or boring plot. It uses simple yet brilliant mechanics that are slowly built on through the game and they never get boring.

With all of the content that big name game creators are putting out, sometimes games either aren't completed before release or simply aren't griping enough to play all of the way through. I'd play this game for hours and I already know that I will replay it later.

This game was well made and I hope there will be another."
13733,"Interesting ideas and beautiful enviroments are what make this game worth playing. Some of the level design is questionable and whilst the story is okay some pretty aweful voice acting ruins it quite a bit. It's the very definition of short and sweet.

There's no deneying that flying through the air in an awesome super suit is fun. You get a really sence of momentum as you whizz past floating rocks and giant wind mills. Jumping is satisfying and grapping (whilste sometimes annoying) is also fun). The levels are quite varied but there were also some missed oppertunities. Perhaps the most annoying part of the game is the fact that you'll need to use trial and error to progress in some parts. There are often rocks that you need to grapple onto the you can't initially see. This can be very frustrating and makes perfect runs on your first playthrough almost impossible.

All the levels are tied together with a basic story, which is quite interesting. Your basically the nephew of a scientist/inventor who went missing. And so you set out after him, following the trail that he left behind with the help of some of his inventions. You'll meet a couple of charatcers along the way to keep things interesting, and basically fill the silence. The story itself is interesting but is ruined by some terrible voice acting.

All in all this game is fun (although occasionally frustrating), has some nice ideas and a decent story. The eviroments are always pretty, and some of the outdoor areas are just plain stunning. Wouldn't say it's worth the full $13, so wait for it to go on sale. 

Like I said: short and sweet (ie: only took me 3 and a bit hours)  7/10

"
13734,"Short and sweet.

Very fun, nice graphics (except character models, which I didn't care for), a bit too easy for the tools you are given (grappling hook could be shorter [or jumps tighter], rocket boots save many otherwise failed jumps), length of around 3 hours and the story is average imo. If you've ever played a Spiderman-game and thought ""this swinging around-business could be a lot more fun if I had high- and long-jumps and rocketboots!"", you will like this game a lot.

Hoping for DLC/workshop levels- there's a lot of potential there. Got the game during a sale, definitely worth it."

13738,great game
13739,"Everything about this game is so so cool it looks awesome, the story telling aspects are awesome, everything is easy to use, I really like it. My only issue is that sometimes what you're supposed to do is clear and you can tell there's one and only one way to do it but you have to do it over and over and over because it's very exact, throughout the game you use something similar to a grappling hook to grab onto floating rocks to move along, your path is set out but if you don't place your hook in just the right spot, you have to start over. And typically there's a save right there (it's only in some spots, usually if i see a save spot in front of a new area I know I'll end up spending some time on it) but it can be very frustrating to have to do it over and over again. I do really like the game but it can be frustrating."
13740,Great adventure game
13741,"I have a couple of minor criticisms - the game was a bit short, and the story a bit odd, but the game concept was excellent, and the art very well done.  Highly recommended - I was on the edge of my seat for most of the game, and I had moments of sheer terror and exhilaration while flying through the air.  The game felt actually quite difficult, while not being as difficult as it felt.  Very good balance, in my opinion."
13742,"I enjoyed playing this game.  The ending needs a little work tho. It would be nice to add an extra lvl in there where you get to adventure around with Uncle Fred help him finish whatever it is he working on at the time. I liked the end clip after the credits, it was a nice finisher, but i still think you need and extra lvl or two after you meet up with Fred.  I play on the highest graphics and the game play looks amazing. Story line was nice, easy to follow and enjoyable. The first run took me a little bit trying to make sure i find everything. The second time is fun you get to go faster :)"
13743,"This is very good! but also pretty hard....  I recommend this game it is very fun! I like the adventure, really."
13744,"A quick, but fun, puzzle platformer. Light on story and light on content. The story that it does have didn't affect me too much and the gameplay was fun for the first of two hours it took me to finish the game. <$5 feels like a right price-point.  Maybe this game really touched some people out there, but it didn't touch me."
13745,"It was fun and nice little story. It's fun to play, jumping from platform to platform with the gloves. Very short, but nice game."
13746,i completely recommend this game to mostly people that want to put alot of hours into a game. its complete adventure and so far i've seen no gore or blood. i mainly a family game i would say. I'll give a 10/10!
13747,"A really splendid and interesting story. I've played throughout the game and was very pleased with its phantasy world and challenging gameplay. It's rather short, very short indeed, but it is very well-made and interesting, like watching a tiny cute phantasy animated film. Take it while it's on sale and you won't regret that for sure. What more to say - a really good story which is interesting to explore :)"
13748,"This game is a masterpiece, it's the combination of a cute story and great gameplay. If you can pick this up like in the current sale you absolutely have to, this game is just too beautiful to NOT play"
13749,"The gameplay is amazing, I've always wanted to be spider man :P
The story is somehow pulling and strangely affectious
Overall 
Graphics : good
Gameplay : amazing
Story : good"
13750,This game reminded me Portal 1 ... Mind blowing but short like 2 h max time to finish the game . All in all awesome game
13751,DA FEELS :(
13752,"This game was very fun, however is very expensive for a game that took me only slightly over two hours to beat. The story was okay, and the gameplay was great. I got the game on sale for $3, and I think it was worth it but I would not buy this game at for anymore than $5"
13753,"‚ÄòA Story About My Uncle‚Äô is a first-person platformer that doesn‚Äôt mess around---at all. Thrown into foreign terrain both expansive and picturesque, the player is tasked with traversing landscapes littered with floating islands and rocks inscribed with way-finding glyphs. 

Flying through the air, with minimal time spent grounded, feels great. Gravity seems skewed in this universe, as if the air is more water-like or dense. Options for movement include: jumping, using a laser-like grappling hook, and rocket-jumping, all of which have specific uses. While movement isn‚Äôt light-speed, it‚Äôs certainly alluring enough to warrant repeated attempts at manoeuvring through harder sections---some of which will test both your patience and alertness!

The narrative, while minimal, is charming; it‚Äôs a wondrous adventure recalled fondly by a feather to his daughter, which makes the entire experience all the more endearing."
13754,"It has a nice little story too it, and is a very fun game that gets quite challenging towards the end, but overall, really fun and worth picking up. The only problem I would mention is that it's fairly short"
13755,"Really enjoyable and innovastive take on platforming.  Youll love it if you played portal games and liked those. It is really short. But if they added workshop content it would be perfect! 

10/10 for frog people"
13756,"When I had first saw the store page I didn't know what to make of it. It looked like a first person platformer, which is something I never really saw completely done right. But I was curious and bought it and it was way better than I thought it could be.

The closest thing to compare this to be Portal mixed with Jack and Dexter. The game is a first person platformer that doesn't suck actually. There are a couple reasons for that. One is a lot of air time, the game gives you plenty time to land your jump and gives you platforms large enough to land on. Two and the more important thing is the grapple beam. When you point it at a surface it will bring you to it, this includes floor to so landing trick jump becomes a lot earlier then you would expect. 

Another good thing about this game is its presentation the art is beautiful the not Bioshock level beautiful but man they have some great looking vistas. The animations from good to though the faces not as much. The music fits the clam tone of the game and voice acting isn't bad either. The story isn‚Äôt anything amazing but it gets the job done.

One thing you should know is that it is short I beat it in under three hours. So I guess the Portal comparison was better than I thought. 

So does thing game do for the first person platformer like Portal did for the first person puzzler. Not really it's really good just not that good.

In conclusion I would recommend this to anyone who is already curious about it. And to those looking for something new and original.

13761,"Having completed the story in little under 3 hours, I feel that the story is a unique one that you don't see in every modern game. There isn't some huge villian or something, it's just there to appreciate the ambience of the world and the soundtrack is equally fitting.

tldr; I am bad at writing reviews, this game is nice, no boom-boom bad guy, good world, good soundtrack
9/10"
13762,"First i shall start off with the essential points about this review that you will want to know if you buy this game. First and formeost this is a very short and sweet game, all in all it took me about 3-4 hours to complete as a casual playthrough, secondly, it is probably best to pick this up on sale for a cheap bit of quality entertainment this is because of the time it will take you to complete therefore yo do not want to spend full price on something that is very short.

Overall the game leaves you with some very enjoyable moments, you play as the nephew of a famous explorer that has gone missing, and the game is about your journey through a strange new world that your uncle has discovered in order to find him. The game itself is narrated in the form of your future self telling a bedtime story to your daughter about the people and experiences you met and had during your journey to find your uncle, this in itself adss a noce feel to the game that makes you want to finish your journey and complete the game.

The mechanics are rather unique and intriquing, simple to grasp and rewarding to master, i did have some annoying times with the sprint jump (occasionally failing to work) that led to more than a few deaths but apart from this one minor problem manouvarability is smooth and enjoyable allowing you to progress easilly through the levels.

Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a quick, easy and cheap (when it is on deal) adventure game that does not require you to think too much about what you are doing and allowing you to just enjoy the simple storyline and gorgeous landscapes that surround you and change as you continue throughout the game.

"
13763,"Really cool game. The story can be beaten in ~2.5h but there's a bunch of time trials and items to collect that will keep you busy if you're willing to come back. The movement is fun, although bumping into things you just grappled tends to send you into deathpits which can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Not sure if it's worth the 13eur, but it's definitely an easy buy when it's on sale."
13764,"Real time when you can finish the game without wondering around and not much messing puzzles - 1.5h + Messing around it's up to 2-3h. I really liked the story and control mechanism was pretty uniq - Grappling hook was the best on this game. Location, Star Heaven is absolutely amazing - Wait all locations are amazing! :) 

<Spoiler in short>
Basically you are a boy discovering a new world populated by a frog people and with your amazing suit you are traveling through it and trying to find your Uncle. You have normal jump, boosted jump, speed and grapple. From the beginning to the end you are finding clues about your uncle (Some are pretty funny).
At the end you will find out your uncle and he will tell you that basically he made this population and that he is staying and help them out, to survive and evolve. After that he sends you home, which would be the last possible trip to the Earth...
</Spoiler in short>

My whole gameplay... Hope you will enjoy it! :p

Rating of the game:
11/10"
13765,"Very fun, a little short but is very replayable and is an awesome time to play."
13766,"So, i never heard of this game until it just got a sale on Steam. With no expectations what so ever i launched the campaign. 
The story is driven by ""The nephew"" narrative who tells a bedtime story to his daughter about when he went looking for his uncle fred in a fantasy world full of friendly salamander people. The gameplay itself is a relaxing 3D platforming where you use a grapling hook and rocket boots to get around and it all feels tight and flowing and occasionly reminded me of  the Portal games.

If you are looking for a cute, relaxing, mildly challenging game to play an afternoon i do recommend this game, especially if it's on sale.

The game took me about 2 1/2 hours to beat but if you are a speedrunner and/or achivement collector the game has some replay value with a time trials mode and challenging achivements basicly consisting of completing levels without falling down and to use your grappling hook as little as possible."
13767,Cozy.
13768,"For being on the Unreal Engine, this game is great with a controller because it feels very responsive and in my opinion, PLAY IT WITH A CONRTOLLER! But, get it for $3.24 USD."
13769,"A great little indie game. This game reminds me of all the platforming goodness of Bioshock Infinity. It's amazingly crafted. The story is sweet and simple, as a father tells his daughter a memory of adventure. This game is definitely a much check out, especially if it's on slae. Definitely worth the $3.24 I paid for it. I've completed it and one achievement in just at 2.7 hours. Now to check out some more. I highly recommend if you enjoyed Portal or Portal 2."
13770,"A Story About My Uncle is rather short I Agree with that, but I have to say i still don't regret paying a little bit of money to encourage the developers to make more games with this spirit (and yes i know sometimes those guys throw out stuff like the goat Simulator). If you are looking for a fun little first person Platformer with neat mechanics and a heart warming (although not very complicated) storyline, you should give this game a try.

Just one last tip: Get it when it's on sale. Even though I had a blast with this game I would have been really disappointed, if i had payed 13 Euro for it.

Oh and also: Games like these with great virtual reality would possibly be the most awesome thing ever...It would give me a heart attack but still...Awesome!"
13771,One of the BEST games i ever played. good graphic and design. the little frog people is creepy when I zoom on their face which is funny. Its a little hard and it wont take your really long to finish the game. I taked 3-4 hours. I think the best part was the story. The story was beautiful. I mean it. It was amazing to me.
13772,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! Really good game!
13773,"Putting the TL;dr at the beginning for you lazy folks out there.
Tl;dr: [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is an excellent first person platformer with just enough fresh ideas to fill a 2 - 3 hour time period. Fortunately, it lasts exactly that long, and never outstays its welcome. It also has an interesting world and good, if not great, visuals and art design.

[h1][b] Full Review: [/b] [/h1]
[b]Some context for the game[/b]
[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] opens with a girl asking her father, an unnamed character, to tell her a bed time story. He thinks back to when he was a child, and tells her the mystical story of the time he spent tracking down his uncle. This is where you come in. Playing as that father back in his childhood, you quickly find a suit, and through your uncle's observatory, you are flung out into space, where you land in a crazy and creative world... somewhere.

Obviously, the game requires a little suspension of disbelief. Now, I don't want to spoil too much for you, because I'm going to recommend you to buy this game knowing as little about it as you possibly can. [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] has a fantastic world, and it's beautifully realized in the Unreal Engine. Gone North Games have done a phenomenal job of creating the 6 levels you play through, and the surprise of going through it the first time is probably the best part of the game. Now, lets get down to specifics.

[h1]Gameplay: 9/10[/h1]
I'm a sucker for first person platformers, or more specifically, games that do first person platforming well. Mirrors edge was one of my favorite games of all time, so I'm a little biased coming into this. But if you're someone who enjoys Mirrors Edge or the parkour of Dying Light or anything like that, you'll love the parkour here. The grappling hook coupled with your huge jumps gives you an exhilerating sense of speed, and the levels are very conductive towards letting you have these awesome moments of just flying through the air nailing every hook well. New tools and abilities are thrown in to mix up the platforming a little bit, and there is just enough variety in the gameplay to keep you hooked for the length of the game. Checkpoints are often enough that you don't get frustrated with a death, but still spread apart enough to provide a challenge at certain times and also give you great joy when you get past a particularly hard section. The only gripe I have with the gameplay aspect is that sometimes you fail to hit jumps, not out of your own failure, but out of the game not really helping you know how far away things are. This doesn't happen often, but occasionally you'll jump out for something, and just never get close enough to grapple, and only after death do you realize that it was actually 2-3x further away from you than you thought, and also 2-3x larger than you expected. Speaking of death, though, that's another thing that [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] gets right. When you die, you're almost instantly plopped back to the last checkpoint. No loading screen, no punishment, just right back to playing the game. It does an awesome job at never frustrating you all that much, because even when you misjudge a distance, you're back on the right path a couple seconds later.

[h1]Graphics: 8/10[/h1]

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is beautiful. The environments, especially, look fantastic, and the lighting is particularly good too. It isn't very taxing on the system, on my i7-2600 and gtx 680, I maxed out every setting, including 8x AA, and got about 120-180 fps on average. The only issue I have with the graphics are the other characters in the game, they look neat and stylized, but their models are both not that great looking, and don't really fit the environments all that well. It's not a huge deal, but it was enough to make me knock it down two points, so take that as it is.

[h1]World: 8/10[/h1]

The game world of [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is probably one of my favorites out of all the games I have played. It's so strange and new, and doesn't seem at all like something rehashed from a billion other games and pop culture. In addition to that, the level design is pretty damn good. It's not very open, in fact, it's very linear most of the time, but I think this is in line with what the developers were trying to accomplish, and I didn't mind it much. Some of the levels just give you an amazing sense of scale. Often times you'll see something really far off in the distance that looks beautiful, and then a couple minutes later you actually get there. A lot of the pretty things that seem far off in the game aren't just skybox art, but are actual areas you end up going, and its something [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] does that most other games don't. In addition to the main path you go down over the course of the game, there are 25 collectables hidden throughout the world that end up unlocking some neat bonuses. There are also some other partially hidden locations that unravel a little more of the story, over the course of a conversation from the character and his daughter. Ultimately, the world just feels very interesting and fresh, which is something almost every other game can't say about itself.

[h1]Story: 4/10[/h1]

I understand that it's supposed to just be a story told to a girl to put her to sleep, but they didn't have to put me to sleep along with her. As you can probably tell by now, I really love this game. So, it pains me to dislike the story as much as I do, although I don't think its all that out of the ordinary. The game's story is just very weak and boring. This is probably in part due to the voice acting of the protagonist and his daughter, which I'll get to in a bit, but it's not all that. It's starts out very interesting, and continues to be interesting through the first 3 levels of the game, and I kept thinking about all the questions I had and was excited to find out the answers to those questions (""What's up with maggie? Who is my uncle? Why am I going to these great lengths to find him? etc.""). But, the game doesn't really provide any conclusions to any of these things brought up in the game. It brings you in to this fantastic and interesting world, with one character in particular, maggie, that I found interesting, but you never really reach any meaningful conclusion with any of the story arcs opened in the game. I still recommend the game, so you'll see what I mean when playing through it, but god, it's really tragic that they didn't expand on her story more. It just ends so abruptly that it ruins all build up the story had.

[h1]Sound: 6/10 [/h1]

While the sound effects are pretty good, the voice acting, at least for the protagonist and his daughter, is really not. Both daughter and father have voice actors who are not native English speakers, so it sounds a little off at first, but the way they speak to eachother and the writing is just really not good. Fortunately, Maggie's voice acting is a bit better, but it seems like the best voice acting just went to waste on two of the other characters that you meet once and never deal with again. It baffles me how the developers would skip over having good voice acting for the characters, it would have added a lot to the game. Fortunately, as I said before, the sound effects are pretty good. They're not fantastic, but they do sound appropriate for the world, and the music is good, if forgettable. The best part of the sound design is probably the whooshing you hear while you're moving at high speeds, which is damn exciting.

[h1]Conclusion: 8.5/10[/h1]

While the story and the voice acting brings the game down, [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a fantastic first person platformer, and something I would recommend to most platforming fans. If you're not the hugest platforming fan, I would still recommend it, on sale that is, because of the interesting and gorgeous world, and the exciting gameplay that doesn't overstay it's welcome."
13774,i wish they didnt add a my little pony refrence
13775,"This game has a breath taking Level-Design 
Well developed characters 
and a Story you can follow easily
In total it took me exactly 2 hours to finish it. 
8/10 would play again"
13776,"I just trying to describe this game now, but I barely can form my thoughts in an apropriate review. Cuz' there's no thoughts. There's just feelings. When I want to describe this game Ireally want to use a word ""Best"". But best - in what? 
Best game ever? No, I don't think that it's sounds like that.
Best in its genre? Maybe, but it still doesn't suits.
I think, I just want to name it ""best"". And it's all. Just because of those feelings, that joy this game gave me during this few hours of playing. 
I was sitting at home, bored and I didn't know what to do or how to entertain myself. So I just opened Steam and my eyes fell on ""Weekly sale"" banner. So I just scrolled down the list of cheap, short and joyless games and I've noticed one long and interesting name - A Story About My Uncle. And I made a decision that less than a dollar won't hurt my pocket much. So then I bought the game and started to play.... few hours left, and now I'm writing this review. And this review is all about the feelings I gained from this short but beautiful game. Thanks, uncle Fred, thanks."
13777,"thats relly good game alittle bit hard, its like an parkour game and worth every dollar 9/10"
13778,Short but good.
13779,"Beat the game under 2 hours, but had a lot of fun doing it! The voice acting was amazing, the music was just perfect, and the storyline was interesting! I definitely recommend you to get this game if you're into adventure type of games. This is a perfect first person parkour/puzzle game if you're just looking for something new. 

10/10."
13780,amazing puzzle game with a cool story!
13781,This game is beautiful and brilliant.
13782,"This is a hard game to describe sometime it is fair other it is not the stalactite part feels paticulaurly unfair as it is a mutiple swing segment which you must complete in one try or repaet at this point it becomes cheap and stray from the good gameplay that came before it. 

One final note the level degin is pretty but confusing i found my self often looking for where to go next it only take 10 seconds to get your bearing but when you do this multiple time in a level it is not a good thing.

My verdict is this is not a bad game it could use a little refinement is all i wouldnt pay full price wait for it to go on special"
13783,If your thinking about playing it you should. The whole time I play this game my hands are sweating and I love the artwork in this game.
13784,pretty alright game that manages to make first person platforming work (for the most part) thanks to generally forgiving level design with a lack of precision platforming. there's a few aggravating sections in which this is not necessary true but for the most part it's a very enjoyable platformer with fun grappling hook mechanics that doesn't overstay its welcome
13785,"I'd like to request a new keyboard as I broke my own in rage while playing this game. Although the game is amazing, there are parts where you just want to murder everyone in the world out of pure anger. Yes, it is a fantastic game with great mechanics. But this game is also the bane of my existance. R.I.P Razer BlackWidow Chroma. I'm sorry I snapped you over my knee. You will be missed. Coffee Stain, I'll be awaiting an email to talk about a new keyboard."
13786,"This game is one of the most beautiful games that I have ever seen, the story is short, but great if you get the game remember to explore the first area you get into before you get any items."
13787,"A great platformer, not too bad of a story. I got engaged in the story, but that's me. Worth the money."
13788,"Good game. Short, but good."
13789,a good game but nat worth my $14. i wish to have my money back or at least half of it.
13790,"the game was a little short imo, but EXTREMELY challenging at times. The landscapes are beautiful and the story is rich, despite it's length. I could play this game again and again and still never be bored. Fantastic ending and a fantastic job!"
13791,"Awesome game, super fun!"
13792,"[Edit: Maybe I just suck at 3D platformers more than I realized.  So keep my warnings of ""difficulty"" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]

It's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. [Update: okay, I probably died more in Ori.]  Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section; I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  ;-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.

Some folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the ""Casual"" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.

If you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.  They are all actual *achievements* in the true sense of the word-- and I earned none of them...and that's okay with me.  I'll let the whizzes take on those challenges.

Other than the occasional clipping issue, I only encountered one bug (which actually made one section of the game slightly easier as it turns out).  So all-in-all an excellent effort from Gone North Games-- let's support them and hope they make more!"
13793,Great game. Story is well told. The game is beautiful and runs great on my budget laptop.
13794,A decent story with cool first-person platforming. Can be rally frustrating at times but overall satisfying.
13795,"The premise of this game is sound - grapple over chasms to pretty islands. The story is daft, but that doesn't really matter. The visuals are lovely, and the game seems well optimised to run super smooth.

But I just couldn't get to grips with the silly controls. I love to play with a controller, and an hour in there was a section with circling boulders where no matter how many times I tried (OK, it was at least 10 times) I could not get a lock on the first boulder, and I could see there were two more I had to get after that.

I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this game to anyone (like me) who hates twitch gaming.

Sad face."
13796,Mirror's Edge with the grapple from Just Cause 2. Just 'cause. Goat Mode was not what I thought it would be.
13797,"I enjoyed the game, but it could definitely get frustrating at times. The environment is gorgeous and the story is charming. I really liked how to game subtly plays with the idea as to whether or not this is all just a made up story to entertain a child.

The achievements are for the most part a focus on frustration, forcing you to accomplish levels without ever falling etc. Something for the uber-masochists maybe, but they're not going to be a fun way to get more out of the game.

Definitely recommend anyone who likes supporting original ideas picking this one up. I'm looking forward to seeing what this developer comes up with for their next release."
13798,Overwhelming! Awesome! Amazing! Epic! Marvellous! Everybody should play this game! 1000/10
13799,"A Story About My Uncle has all the elements needed for a great indie game - not only some vast, stunning settings, and a very unique gameplay concept, but a decent amount of challenge and a decently-written storyline. Tethering around is loads of fun at the game's more challenging sections, usually rewarding precision and timing more than frantic movement and reflexes. When it loses its appeal, the game adds a new mechanic, and appropriate challenges to go along with it. The game is relatively short, and doesn't have any kind of ""hugely epic"" climax, but I think that's appropriate.

It's also one of relatively few 3D games I've seen to make a decent effort at getting lipsyncing and facial expressions to look right. That's not to say the game's characters are super-realistic, but at least their facial muscles are."
13800,"A Story About My Uncle is a 3D platformer where you take on the role of a child who is sent to a mysterious world full of floating rock as he attempts to find what has happened to his Uncle. The gameplay entirely consists of platforming, with various powers available to the player as you progress (floating, swinging multiple times between different points, power jumps).

It's relatively short, taking about 2-3 hours to complete. It does have the benefit of having achievements for completing different segments without dying/under a certain time/under certain constraints, which allows for a little replayability, but those are obviously not for everyone. Graphically, the world is excellent but the character models can feel a little rough. Voice acting is mostly hit or miss, but typically above average for this sort of budget game. The gameplay itself is excellent - very responsive, and the level design is relatively straightforward for how wide open the areas tend to be - I only found myself feeling lost one time and that's ASTONISHING given how large some of the areas are.

All in all, I'd say this game is well worth playing if you enjoy 3D platformers - you may just want to wait for a sale depending on what price you're interested in playing for a game which can be completed in a rather short time."
13801,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person exploration story that unearths the secret life of a young man‚Äôs Uncle as he transverses a strange new dimension. Equipped with a suit and the ability to grapple to practically anything, a Story About My Uncle allows you to take your time and experience a well crafted world, its majesties, and challenging adventuring gameplay that is a nice touch to the genre.

13802,"Gameplay: The 3D Platforming is very fun and challenging althogh sometimes not quite as fluid as i would have liked the addition of the grapling glove, super jumps, and rocket boots certainly spice it up and give the game some unique variety 

Story: While not incredibly original gives the gameplay an interesting enough backdrop to make sense of the surroundings and gameplay mechanics 

Visuals: While the textures arent exactly lifelike the backrounds are stunning to look at and offer an immense sense of scope. when lokking at the whole picture whether your swinging through an icy cave or jumping from islands to floating windmills in a peaceful village you will always be saying to yourself ""Wow this game looks great"" 

My only negative is the voice acting isn't exactly stellar but its easy to ignore 

All in all i would definetley recommend this game. I just finished this game and i have to say it's become one of my all time favorite Indie games. 

TL;DR 9/10 would buy again"
13803,"6/10 because:
So frustrating swinging through levels over and over and over and over again. Getting soooooo close only to slide off the surface. Story is cute but scripted lines feel awkard. Steam achievements insane (as in probably not possible). 

10/10 though because:
 I felt like Indiana Jones meets Tarzan meets Robocop."
13804,"Yet another indie puzzle platformer with a gimmick and a gravelly narrator. However, this is game is the reason so many indie's go this route: it can lead to a fabulous game. The gimmick, using a grappling hook to soar through the stunning levels, is really fun. The story and world building are great for a small game. For an indie title, the graphics are sometimes breathtaking - largely because of the design rather than huge textures. The narrator is great here too. Hearing him tell his daughter a bedtime story was much more interesting than pure exposition. The game does well there too - there are no audio logs or pages of books. Just a simple description from the narrator and the player experiencing the world. You can get pretty much everything you need from that. This isn't a game trying to be a movie or book, it's a game using game  mechanics and techniques to tell a cool story. 

A fantastic, short game that anyone should like."

13806,Love it! I want a sequel or a prequel to this game. maybe something about previous adventures with Fred or maybe about the nephews other journeys after that one with newer technology and different types of it. I thouroughly enjoyed this game.
13807,"This is a nice speed-run game for kids, with a nice story for kids and appropriate graphics. The game i snot hard at all, there are no hard puzzles, just attention and conrol.
Overal this is a good atmospheric game for kids.

13808,"First review for a game I've made and it should be this one.

It's a great game for it's value and if it was priced higher I would still probably buy it.

Not to say that this game had no flaws but the goods over shadow it.

What I liked about this game:
 - It's a platforming game with a good/unique(at least in my opinion) mechanic
 - The story is good though could still use some work
 - Taking all the hidden stuff is quite challenging (I still haven't done that)

What I didn't like about this game:
 - Voice acting was meh, (I like animated movies and anime so this might just be me being picky)
 - The platforming was sometimes wierd, (there were times I can't grapple surfaces and even if I landed on some rocks they didn't have colliders so I still fell)"
13809,"Four hours of entertaining gameplay for 4 dollars, can't complain."
13810,I loved it! Very short 3D platformer. The tools they give you make the levels too easy but because you aren't constantly frustrated it gives you plenty of time to play with those items. Beat it within 2 hours and then spent some time messing around.
13811,yas batch i love graops
13812,"Really good game. Decent patformer/puzzle hybrid-type challenges and charming (albeit poorly voice-acted) story. 

Unfortunately, they made a reference to My Little Pony. 

-9001/10"
13813,"A difficult game that rewards curious players.

A Story About My Uncle is hard. The devs have patched it to be easier, but it's still hard - I often missed a jump by just a few feet and had to try it over and over again. Sometimes it was hard to tell where to go next.

In return for my efforts I saw some creative environments and a warm and touching story about the narrator's missing uncle.

It's definitely worth playing, but I'd only recommend it to you if you like weird\indie games, can appriciate finding a secret even if nothing pops up to tell you it's a secret, and you're OK fighting through high difficulty sections."
13814,"It's worth playing if only for the breath-taking aerobatics and beautiful vistas.  That being said, I found the responsiveness to be less than advertised.  Often the grapple wouldn't connect.  It's hard to tell whether this is due to framerate issues, or the game not registering my button press.  Either way, I'd recommend with the caveat that you may encounter some unnecessary frustration, especially given the precise timing required by some of the courses.  The game could have done with a bit more play-testing, but it deserves most of the praise it's receiving."
13815,"What can I say. The game is amazing the colours the scenes and the story is so emotional. If you like adventure and indie games this game is for you. The story is short but worth all the time. There also lots of easter eggs so try to find some you will not regret it. I give this game 9/10. 
Thanks for reading my review and have a nice day!"

+Wonderful Visuals
+Interesting mechanics

-Frustrating sections with sparse checkpoints
-Achievements designed by sadists
-Very short if you're not interested in the challenging achievements (5 hours)"
13817,A game with a very interesting story and a bed time story like narrative. Also the title of this game sounds like a rape story.... 8/8
13818,"Quite pretty with a forgiving level design that you can usually negotiate without having to be millisecond perfect in your timing. Quick reloads and regular save points mean you don't suffer for your mistakes until you ragequit.

On the downside, it's very short and unless you're into speed runs and the like you'll be done in a couple of hours.

I liked it, but I'm glad I got it on sale.

"
13820,"So what is ""A Story About My Uncle"" (ASAMU)?

It is a nice little first person platformer indie game with interesting mechanics, like the use of grappling hook, a powered jump and a jetpack.

The story is quite simple and follows your character telling a bed time story to his kid which involves the narrator's youth existence and his admiration for his uncle. Much later, he tells that his uncle left and the narrator's character tries to find him! Quite basic isn't? Yeah, quite average!

The game is somewhat short if you just go from A to B without much exploration and collectibles gathering but I'd say it was long enough (got the game done in 4 h) as it is especially that the last level is bitchy at parts, where you have to combine every mechanics at your disposal!

PROS:
+Good visuals, the environments are well done and impressive!
+The game mechanics are interesting and gives you a sensation of ""flying"" at times.
+Decent ambiant soundtrack and voice acting.

CONS:
-Minimalistic story.
-Controls are unresponsives at time.
-Last level is challenging until you figure out where to go since the path is unclear.

OVERALL:
It is an enjoyable game until you reach midway, then it get's frustrating where you have to figure out the path the game wants you to go while making ""grappling hook refueling"". Aside for that irritant, the overall game was a fun experience!

RECOMMENDATION:
I'd recommend to anyone seeking a fun, short first person platforming indie game. The story is the weakest link of the game but I still prefer a story in a game than no story at all!

RATING:
7.0 / 10

PS. A suggestion... crank up the brightness of the game since it is very dark midway into the game till the end."
13821,A short but fun first-person platformer with cute frog waifus.
13822,"If there was an award for the greatest story told in a shortest amount of time, this game would get it.
That being said, this game is short but despite that, it's incredible. It's amazing, the story is magnificant and it even made me a little teary at the end, (no spoilers) 

I loved it and reccomend it, My only gripe is that I wish there was soem sort of level editor, the levels you get are amazing and beautiful beyond words, I just wish there was more to this game, but that's just my opinion."
13823,"You know that dream you always have where you make one small misstep and plummet to your death, waking up a split second before you hit the ground?
Thats this game."
13824,"Although some of the character models are odd looking, the voice acting is edging on annoying, and the physics sometimes doing weird things this game is lots of fun. The grapple mechanic works great and gives you a fun and energetic feeling. Thes tory itself is simple yet heartworming. Short but sweet is what I'd say."
13825,"A short, but sweet story with excellent gameplay mechanics."
13826,"I thought it was fun, untill i kept falling down and respawned again and again all the way back at a checkpoint. that moment a game turns from a dreamstate right into a nightmare continuously failing jet expecting different results is madness.

It was fun for howlong it lasted, but im done"
13827,"OK story, nice environments, and the sensation of flying through the air is great.  It's enjoyable at first but gets frustrating towards the end where you have to make in-air ""refueling"" shots and the path you need to take is not clear.  I'm not a fan of repeating tasks over and over again until you finally get it right."
13828,"A Story About My Uncle is a first-person platformer with some good ideas and beautiful environments. The indie game uses a Portal-/BioShock Infinite-like layout and seems to become a fantastic experience, but then suddenly is out of levels. Because of the strongly varying difficulty and a story focuses on kids, we wonder what age the game is actually meant for."
13829,"Nice game, especially if you wanna get stuck every 5-10 minutes because of the level design. Also f*ck those windmills."
13830,"This game should have DLC.
I WANT TO PLAY MOOOOORE!

This game is great! It's fast, fluid, and fun! The world you explore is epic and beautiful. 
You are a child trying to find his adventurous uncle in a seemingly different world. The challenges are fun and can be kinda difficult at times. It's pretty short, only about 2-3 hours but it's a fun 2-3 hours. I hope they do release more levels and/or I can find some custom levels on the internet. I recommend it!"
13831,"Beautiful game, you play as a kid trying to find his uncle in another world. The game is narrated by the kid as a adult telling a bed history to his daughter."
13832,"Short but sweet, A Story About My Uncle is a touching tale hidden beneath an excellent Spiderman-esque grappling/swinging mechanic. The game is, at its core, an excellent platformer with some truly challenging sections. Soaring across the gorgeous environments with grace and poise right before you miss a grapple and plunge to your death (A.K.A, the last quick checkpoint) is just as enjoyable a few hours in as it is when you first begin. 

The game slow adds new fun mechanics that only add to the complexity of the platforming, and the game will occasionally remove pieces of your tools or challenge you to only use certain aspects of the sandbox in order to heighten the difficulty.

All in all, I can't recommend this game enough."
13833,"[h1] A Lucid Dream? [/h1]

Do you remember a story of a forgotten time? Perhaps a children‚Äôs bed-time story or just a passing glance at a stranger‚Äôs story? 

Stories whether we like them or not are an innocent perhaps childlike innocence that breaks the boundaries of reality and replaces it with something else: Something magical, something fantasy, something beyond our wildest dreams! 

Lands unknown beyond the scope of the eye, a never before seen place. Waiting to be discovered...

It‚Äôs an interesting avenue to take into perspective, whether willingly or not we often don‚Äôt realize perhaps it just takes a bit of imagination, a skill of technology, and the courage of a brave heart to venture in search of an uncle.

[h1] I Fell Short! Just A Bit More![/h1]

In A Story About My Uncle (SAMU), you will find an uncanny similarity to living and enjoying your Tarzan like skills not with vines oh no! But rather an ingenious little device to grapple onto nearly any surface and jump, leap, dive, and fly to the next place with your grapple device. 

I will admit I had a lot of fun jumping around the areas in the game, testing the limits of where I can grapple and flying in midair (not for long! Gravity hates me) only to grapple onto the next surface to stay afloat. It‚Äôs a mesmerizing experience to feel you lost in the air without care or worries about lives. 

The game is comfortable to the point as if it makes you just want to grapple toward any high place and just have some fun! Though, I must admit I did have a lot of falling to my deaths because I couldn‚Äôt grapple endlessly. 

Ya got to be smart with SAMU because you only get a limited amount of grapples to hold onto so you can‚Äôt necessarily fly forever. I found this mechanic to be balanced or else the game would be too easy in your search for your uncle. 

You will fall. I guarantee it! But! You can always get back up to grapple again. Try different ways to grapple or handicap yourself by jumping platforms to get to the next area. 

For such a small indie adventure first person platforming game I will again won‚Äôt focus on spoiling the story other than you the new Tarzan with grapple hook must search to find your lost uncle! 

By no means is the story boring, heaven no! Rather it keeps you engaged with its narrative of a simple quest to find your uncle. In my experience the game didn‚Äôt feel tedious or long because there were new puzzles to keep my grapple skills in shape. I found it quite challenging to limit myself to certain grapples to reach my destination then going all in a grapple spree.

13834,"Alright, This game was 50% off with my coupon from steam but had i known that it was this good of a game I would even go so far as to pay full price The graphics are great and the story is phonominal. 

10/10 would play again!"
13835,"I actually expected more from this one than it actually delivered, especially with it being published by Coffee Stain Studios. Well, let‚Äôs get going.

I ‚Äì Story [5/10]

A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer from Gone North Games. The game unfolds as a bedtime story told by a father to his daughter. The story is about the father (as a child) who wanted to go on all his uncle Fred‚Äôs adventures with him and how one day Fred disappeared. He had been transported to another world and the father had gone to find him.

The way the game was set up story-wise (an interactive bedtime story) was pretty unique and rather cool in and of itself. The actual plot of the story though, wasn‚Äôt all that thrilling and only took about 3 hours to complete.

II ‚Äì UI [10/10]

The user interface in the game was incredibly minimal, which is always a good thing when immersion is your goal. It blended well with the game and was easy to keep track of. Sleek, smooth, simple.

III ‚Äì Gameplay [8/10]

Gameplay in ASAMU was very unique. As much a connoisseur of platformers as I am, I had yet to play one in such medium as this. First person was, for me, a whole new take on the genre. Not only this, but the means of exploring the in-game world was rather fun.

You‚Äôre equipped with a sort of plasma grappling hook with which you will be swinging and pulling yourself around the alien planet. Also, later into the game you get a nifty pair of rocket boots which can aid you in crossing longer distances while airborne. Mostly, I used the rocket boots to correct my screw ups and over-shoots.

Sometimes though, it was a bit difficult to figure out where you were supposed to go next.

IV ‚Äì Content [3/10]

ASAMU was a fairly short game and it had a decidedly small amount of content. The only two items you get the entire time are the grappling hook (and attached adventuring suit) and the rocket boots. While this was really all you needed to get around and complete the game, I feel like have additional options would‚Äôve made it more interesting. The lack of content made the game feel rather small on the whole.

V ‚Äì Visual [8/10]

The graphics of ASAMU were pretty good and I had a lovely visual experience for the most part. The world was very detailed and looked beautiful. As much as I wish I could say the same for the NPCs, I cannot. The NPCs, I felt, were poorly animated and poorly rendered. There animating wasn‚Äôt very cohesive with the rest of the game and their movements were overly stiff. Similar to Batman in Batman Begins, only not as cool.

VI ‚Äì Audio [6/10]

What little music there was in ASAMU was really good. I enjoyed it, however sparse. The sound effects were even top notch; from the grappling hook to environmental ambiance.

Once again though, the NPCs (and this time we add in the voice acting) fell much too short of the mark. The narrator (the father) sounded very unconvincing throughout the story. The NPCs (the frog people who inhabit the alien planet) sounded like a bunch of middle school students reading lines off of a paper. A few of them even had terrible, terrible accents. The only person who sounded mildly into their job was the narrator‚Äôs daughter.

VII ‚Äì Overall [6.7/10]

Overall, A Story About My Uncle wasn‚Äôt a bad game, but it wasn‚Äôt a great one either. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs good for a play-through (maybe two at the most) and I am happy that I got it during the Steam Holiday Sale rather than paying full price."
13836,"While this game plays through fairly quickly if you're good at figuring out puzzles and the jumping/grappling mechanics, it's a lot of fun to play through in general.  The environments you move through are aesthetically pleasing and the game is a relaxing step away from a lot of the fps, hardcore survival, zombie, etc games that are littered throughout my library.  I wouldn't pay full price for it, but it was definitely worth picking up on sale."
13837,"Such a *wonderful* game!

A great adventure and story, well presented, with gameplay being a jumping an grabbling-hook game in the ego perspective.
The atmosphere is great. I was repeatedly astonished at the size of the world I was moving through.
The story is well very presented in well lit environments, changing lively happy places with darker, lonely parts. The narrative voice is great.

A few minor things could have been done better, but those are nothing to skip this game for.
* Having *more* of a body would have immersed even more (legs).
* Although the (first) town was beautiful and fun to explore, the inhabitants were often misplaced, in unnatural body positions.
* On the cutscenes I often wondered if leaving me full control would immerse me more - in most of the cutscenes you *are* still in control of limited movement mind you. Probably a good tradeoff.

Really, thank you so much for this game. A great experience.

A 10/10 for a well told, immersive and interesting adventure. 2 hour play-through.
If you like story, beautiful environments, and a bit of jumping parkour, get it!"

13840,"A nice puzzle-platformer that leaves a sweet and warm aftertaste. It's not a masterpiece, but if you're into this genre, you'll most likely enjoy it."
13841,A Story About My Uncle was a fantastic game! It's a great platformer and puzzle game and if there was a prequel or sequel I would play it!

13844,"A Story About My Uncle is a non-violent First-Person platform adventure game.
The story starts with you in the present day, telling your daughter a bedtime story about an adventure you have experienced when you were a child. 
In the meantime you relive your memory and the story begins. 
You start at your Uncle's workshop but there no sign of your Uncle, is Uncle Lost?
Not much later you find a suit that is special made for you and decide to wear it. 
As you wander through Uncle's workshop you find a strange teleporter pad.
Because of your curiosity you decide to stand on it and got launched to a different dimension.
From this point, the search for your lost uncle starts!
If you like puzzles, challenges, grapple and fly from platform to platform with a rocket suit on, then this game is a must buy for you!
When this game is on sale, i definitely recommend buying this game!"
13845,"This a great game!

It has great controls and mechanics, that give it a unique feel. It has excellant graphics that clearly shows how much effort the developers have put into it. Impressive story with likeable characters, which draws you into the game more. Very difficult in some areas, but still very fun. Now for for the Cons: Its really short! but it has lots of replay value. The physics are sometimes strange. For example, if you fly at a rock at a certain angle, you can skip halve the level! Otherwis amoung my favorite games.

9.5/10"
13846,"I preface this a disclaimer: this isn't the worst game you could buy, and the ending is rather nice and poignant.

However, the flaws with the game are numerous. I can only manage to run it for brief periods of time before it starts to overload my disk drive for reasons unknown, even though all the settings are at their lowest levels. The controls are not always responsive, and often I would find it activating moves when I didn't tell it too. The level design is, overall, dull and the 'puzzle' system is a very lacking, hit-and-miss experience. The voice acting is an extremely mixed bag: for the most part, it sounds like the actors weren't trying or didn't know how they were supposed to feel about their lines, but at times they deliver them on point, with the very last character in the game having flawless voice acting.

The game is occassionally fun, but the frustrations involved are plenty and the story just isn't special enough to warrant living through the torment. Overall, 4/10, won't play again."
13847,"Very refreshing. Short, simple yet challenging mechanics, and beautiful. A game where you arent this great hero, saving the world. just a kid, trying to find his uncle. nice."
13848,"Though this game is very short, story alone is only 3-4 hours long, but this is still a well worth game to get, it was atmosphere, drama, and challenging story telling like i have not seen in years.

The NPC models could have been better... (They are kinda ugly...)
Okay story, kinda dissapointed i never got to pull things to me.
No puzzles.
I recommend getting it on sale. but not full price."
13855,funnest game ive played all year
13856,"This game is surprisingly good, it plays like a cross between ""Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons"" crossed with ""Portal"".  The game weaves a touching but simple story through the gameplay.  The gameplay focsus on the use of a grappling hook mechanism, which is well implemented, and gives the gameplay all the of the potential complexity that the orange/blue portals have in the game Portal.  There is a pretty hefty difficulty spike at the end of the game, but rest assured, if you are observant and a little patient, all of the physics puzzles are more than solvable.  I finished the game in about 10 hours.

Interesting trivia: made by the same team that made ""Goat Simulator""... go figure!

Highly recommended!"

13861,"Decent all ages 3-d platformer wtih puzzle mechanics that feels very 'portal-esque' in design and execution.  

Stopped playing after one needlessly difficult room where the floor and ceiling are falling.  Decent all around game from the makers of goat simulator.  Feels like it was design to be a console release aimed at young teens, has a kind of psychonauts vibe that goes along with the art style.

Not sure if I would recommend this one very strongly."
13862,"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way: most of the voice acting is laughably awful, especially the narrator. He sounds like he doesn't know what he's reading. The grappling mechanics can be frustrating, full of needless falls and spikes in difficulty. Someone on the internet has already said that the story requires a child's mind, and the mechanics require an adult's reflexes, and that's pretty accurate. Read their newsfeed and you'll see that they're STILL tuning up the movement mechanics and adding boosts, months after release. But it's not a bad game overall (certainly not Goat Simulator) so if you get it on sale, you'll find it's about worth what you paid for it."
13863,"A story about my uncle is a very good game. 
It has top notch first person platforming, a veriaty of gorgeous enviroments and a simple but sweet story to back it all up.
The only problem is that the length of the game is tiny and for ¬£10 it most cirtainly is not worth the while, I would reccomend that you buy this game on sale."
13864,"""A Story About My Uncle"", or rather a ""A long run after someone's uncle without much of a story"".
The first contact with the game is great, after a short introduction, you arrive on some islands floating in the sky, with some superpowers allowing you to make big jumps. Jump from rocks to rocks, gliding, using grapling hooks feels incredible. Graphics are also impressive, all the small islands forming a path, surrounded with massive rocks or caverns; art desing is beautiful, especially 'exterior' maps.

But desptie all the above point, the game is a disapointment. While you get super powers early on, you don't really get get anything else to play with. There are small variants (rocket boots, recharge cristals), but it doesn't feel different. Grappling is fine, but you always ends up banging your head on the rock you're grappling, losing your momentum in the process, and falling to your death, Except in a few areas, the game is nothing but a long corridor without any real incentive to go on.
The game tries to be story driven, with a narrator and a few characters, but it doesn't work really well. Despite beeing gorgeous, the world, is not credible, there are only a few 'floating islands corridor' to move in the world. You fall and die so many times when going from one village to the next, even with all your super powers that you can only wonder how the inhabitants can survive (the only one you see outside of a settlement just disappears or climbs on your back when she needs to move on). Moreover, I don't think that a story driven game works fine when the gameplay is based on die and retry mechanics. 
And finally, what does the story try to tell us ? It's about a boy who goes after his uncle because he misses him. [spoiler]On the road he meets strange creatures but he doesn't even try to  understand them and goes on after his uncle. And finally, when he reaches his uncle, he is just sent back to his world, the reason for his quest left behind.[/spoiler] What did the boy learn ? Is he a better person at the end of the game ? The whole story feels completely anecdotal and emotionless.

+ Artistically, the game is great
+ There are some good idea for the gameplay
- very quickly repetitive
- unexploited and not creadible world
- pointless story"
13865,"It's funny that first person platforming is such an oddity that people cannot help but be intrigued and try it out: an hour into the debacle and you begin to see why third-person or side-scrollers not only make more sense but are far more fun.

A Story About My Uncle is a cute, if predictable story with serviceable first-person platforming. While you can jump, power jump and long jump to make your way around you are eventually given the power to grapple from surface. Wisely enough this power is not infinite and has a charge system to prevent you from gliding through the scenery too easily. At first it's incredibly fun and feels rather nice, but the game eventually introduces another mechanic along with more complicated pathing and numerous leap of faith type situations.

Perhaps that was my own issue though since by the end of the game I never had a good feeling for either the jumping or grappling, particularly jumping which I could never judge the distance properly leading to some embarassing deaths or having to re-climb sections. Grappling later on requires you to release yourself at rather precise moments during your arc and then keep your cursor trained on the next object waiting for it to light up for barely a second and hoping you have the right angle to get onto the next object, that is if you make it.

Which is unfortunate because the set pieces are genuinely beautiful and well-detailed but are enjoyed only briefly as you search out the next path or as you're grappling with the poor controls. The story is simple, cute and very child/family friendly which would make the game a potentially fun gift for a younger sibling or relative. I would very hesitantly recommend this to anyone else though, while the unique platforming may be intriguing it quickly devolves into a a frustrating chore."
13866,"I don't write reviews often but it felt nescessary. A story about my Uncle is an incredible little game, it's about as difficult as a Kirby game,giving you more than enough resources to get through the levels, but the story is incredible, albeit short.

All in All, the game is really good, but really short, and it will leave you with a lump in your chest made of various feels."
13867,"This game is really fantastic. It has a really good story and an appropriate narrator for the story. The mechanic of attaching and gravitating towards something is really compelling. I made it through about 1/3 of the Ice Caves before I have to call a break/quits. They added a really tough mechanic of charging the device you use (which has three shots max, 2 before a recharge). Add to that precision platforming and charging while gliding by the crystal (which charges you) in mid jump, and it takes a better platformer than me to finish the game. I did however, what Thesparrowsjourney play the rest on Youtube to get the rest of the story, because it was so compelling. I really enjoyed the game.

I would suggest that maybe the devs add an easy route to the final stage, which would ignore the charging crystals, for those who are not good at platforming games. Just so we could experience the story on our own, without going crazy."
13868,"Very cool game.

Cute story, cool artdesign and a fun gameplay.

You have to play it. :>"
13869,Maddie makes a bet with you that you can't get through a section without using the grapple.  Don't take that bet.
13870,"A great little indie game with a fantastic atmosphere that just begs to be played with an Oculus Rift.

-A tad glitchy sometimes but nothing major
-Too short, need more!!!!

13871,"This game...where do i start. The first part was 2spooky4me, but after reaching star haven i realized how much work, and effort went into that beautiful world/level. The storyline was one of the best ive ever played(and ive played very notable games), and following it was very amusing and gave me almost a child-like wonder. 

Now where do i begin on the gameplay, though you may get stuck sometimes, and clip through walls like i said before; it is a game like nothing else.

([b] SPOILER ALERT!!!! [/b])

The story, it was short but explained more than enough. It brings you on an almost emotional journey where you discover you helped create a whole civilization/world, and discovering it for the first time. Though it is short, and does come back around on itself, it is a very good storyline that left a lump in my throat at the end. I can almost imagine telling my son/daughter on the adventures that ive been on, and the people ive met; but i cant imagine telling them a story such as this. 

This game is highly recomended. and props to you if you read all of this. :D"
13872,"Great short game. Even my short attention span was enough for this game. I was able to finish it in one sitting! 
Gameplay is fluid, story is 'ok'. Only negative I could find is that humanoids models are a bit caca (doesn't matter though).

13873,"(9/10) I love the look of this game, but the game is very short with 2/3 hour game playand if u speed run it might take 1 hour too finish it, but i love this game and hope more (dlcs or updates)come our"
13874,"I had SOME fun with this short game.  The platforming, while frustrating at times, was surprisingly tight and well done which is good considering that was the core of the gameplay.  The other draw of the game is the narrative - which is unfortunately lacking.  I finished the game knowing that I was supposed to be feeling....something, but I found only that feeling of accomplishment that comes with finishing any game.  It's mainly just another notch in my gaming belt.  I don't think enough time was spent in developing the characters.  This could be budget-based, and likely is; but that doesn't change the fact that I just didn't care about the uncle or his story, which seems sort of important considering the title of the game.  It also didn't help that the voice talent was severely lacking - lines with obvious weight to them were delivered with a droll monotone, and the narrator would consistently pause in inane spots.  This only helped to lessen the effect the story had on me, which was struggling to begin with.  I'm going to recommend this only to gamers looking for at least one of the following: eye candy, or fun trial and error platforming.  Steer clear if you're looking for much beyond this.  It's a solid attempt, and could be great with a longer development cycle and more production values, but ultimately fades where it should shine."
13875,"This is a very lovely game.  A great way to relax an afternoon away.  I do wish there were more levels, but it this game for a time it took me to beat it was my favorite game.  10/10"
13876,"This a very cool game. It has a unique story, with amazing gameplay. Your main mode of transoprtation is a suit that you wear. It has many mechanics like a grappling hook and super jump technology. You may find this game challenging but I got hooked on it all the way through. You face danger, happy moments, and sad times in this game. But it is fair and is one of the games that are worth your while to enjoy. It might not be as replayable as other games. But I found it amazing to experience."
13877,So much fun!! Highly reccomend. I sat down to give it a quck try and ended up not moving until i was done with the game.

13880,"Short, sweet, and fairly to the point.

A Story About My Uncle is a game you'll likely beat in a few hours, but you'll most likely have fun with it. The gameplay is sort of hard to explain...like...a simplistic Mirror's Edge with a grappling hook, rocket boots and a super jump.

Graphics are actually fairly gorgeous. Character animations might be a bit clunky, but you'll barely ever see other characters in this game anyway.

In ASAMU, Gravity is your only real enemy. Be prepared to fall and spawn back at a checkpoint fairly regularly. Luckily, however, respawning has absolutely no loading screens, the screen simply fades and you are deposited right back at the last checkpoint, which in most areas is never too far back to warrant frustration. The platforming puzzles in ASAMU aren't hard to understand, it's more about the timing or judging the distance of platforms or grapple spots that's going to lead to mishaps.

Voice acting is decent enough, though script reading could've been better in some places. Some of the pronunciation was off in places or words were flat-out stumbled over, and a few times was certainly not as spirited as the situation should've warranted.

The story is fairly simple, though at the very end of the game you're left wondering about the events.

All in all, I'd give ASAMU a 6.5/10. If you've got a few bucks to spare, it should be good for at least a few hours of enjoyment."
13881,"First-person platformers are rare and with good reason, precision jumping in an environment where your feet only exist hypothetically usually ends up in frustration. However, this is one of the very few games where the mechanics not only make a game entirely based on first-person platforming feasible but extremely enjoyable. The grappling hook is a fantastic way to get around and the excellent level design absolutely makes the best possible use of the mechanic. Come to think of it, I don't think I can remember a game where a grappling hook wasn't a ton of fun to use, so really every game should have a grappling hook in it, because it's just awesome. In any case, yeah the game is really just about jumping form place to place with the hook and later on some rocket-powered boots that have a single charge per jump you make, so you can't use them indefinitely, but it can serve as a one time get out of jail free card. 

As mentioned, the level design is great, which obviously means that all the levels are absolutely massive, and that's quite a feat considering the very short loading times and the gorgeous visuals the game boasts. It's realized in this very stylized, extremely colorful way that somewhat reminds me of Bioshock: Infinite crossed with various Tim Schafer games and there are tons of ways you could screenshot this game and hang up every single one of them in an art gallery.

Surprisingly - because it's totally not given away in the name - the game also has a story. It's rather simplistic really, just a boy who misses his uncle and as such chases after him. There are no secondary objectives and the goal really never changes, which is weird because the game sort of contains an alien alphabet similar to FEZ and being the massive nerd that I am, I immediately figured out how it works (the game gives you clues along the way), however this knowledge is never used in game, it's purely to flesh out the world, but not tied into gameplay at all. The story is told as a flashback of the main character telling the story of the game to his daughter, which is really nicely realized. And even though the voice-acting is a bit spotty at times, the writing is top notch, it really gives you this impression that this guy loves his uncle and desperately wants to see him again and be with him. And by the end I couldn't deny that the story did resonate with me a lot. Not quite a tearjerker, but I definitely felt something by the end of it. 

The only thing I can criticize about the game is - as is so often the case with good indie games - that it's simply too short. They demand $13 for a game with less than 3 hours of content. I bought it during this years sale at 75% off and I'd say that was money well spent, but four times as much for 3 hours simply is too much to ask. I get that you can't endlessly pad out the story you want to tell here with additional levels because at some point it becomes impossible to tell such a simple story in a longer format and I know the Unreal license didn't come for free, but in that case you expand the story to begin with, make it a bit more complex and add in some more levels to justify the price you're asking for."
13882,"A Story About My Uncle is a First Person Platforming Adventure game that features a very nice, albeit short story... about a young boy's uncle, and his quest to find him in a strange new enviroment. This game is about movement and precise aiming, I played through the game using a DS2 controller and found it a good fit most of the time, there was a couple moments when I needed the accuracy of my mouse however they were few and far between. The game features a beatifully created world that goes from the brightness of the sun to the cool darkness of caves, the work was done well however the character models are [i]disgusting[/i]. There were a few times I wished for more checkpoints but that might've unbalenced the game. Overall I very much enjoyed this game, the gameplay was great, the story was short but sweet, and the conclusion was satisfying. 7.5/10 and I am looking forward to more from this team."
13883,"Great game, I really enjoyed the journey !  A must buy during these sales."
13884,"Short but oh so sweet.

The tale of one young boy's search for his wanderlust uncle through a majestic land. First person platforming is hard to nail down (hah) but this game does it in a way that's enjoyable. That sense of flying, leaping, launching, plummeting, and flinging through the air is all present.

Visuals: 8/10. 
While not -super- detailed the game looks well polished for the most part and has a very pleasant aesthetic.

Gameplay: 7/10. 
Floaty controls help give this partially weightless game a lot of possibilities but can require some practice to learn the timing.

Story/Immersion: 8/10.
A sweet tale recanted from loving father to daughter brings up moments of wonder, joy, fear, sadness, and longing. A little nod towards the non-traditional relationship idea is a nice but subtle touch.

Overall: 7.5/10.

Would easily recommend. Take a few hours or play sessions and really enjoy your search for Uncle Fred and the freeing element of bounding through the air."
13885,"This is a fun little game that you'll probably beat in just a few hours, The game runs well on lower end hardware while still looking nice, and it's a lot of fun to play.  The difficulty in places isn't really that bad, especially with death never really setting you back that far.  Pulling off a tricky maneuver and feeling the satisfaction as you touch back down to solid ground is a pretty good rush, and this game definitely has that in spades.  Because of all of those things, I do recommend that everybody play this game.

However, I do have a couple of gripes.  For starters, the voice acting was really, really bad and most of the dialogue was pretty cringeworthy.  I get that it's supposed to be a bedtime story, but even a kid would agree that this was pretty awful.  Every time they started talking I wished they hadn't.  I also disliked the ending, which didn't really feel like an ending at all and more of a place where they ran out of ideas.  I also think that it was a bit too ""on rails"" with only a single way to get where you need to go more often than not.  I would have liked if it felt more organically designed instead of giving you exactly what your suit is capable of doing.  It makes it feel more like a game and less like an experience, and breaks the immersion for me.

Despite those gripes, this game is a must play and worth the price, especially if you can get it at a discount."
13886,"It was a fairly short adventure, but it was one that touched me on a level that video games havent done in a long time. The world was beautiful, organic, and felt real in every way. The game's grapple mechanics were very fun and unique, though mildly frustrating at times. The context of the story helped to pull me into the world, and feel immersed, like I was the boy on this grand adventure. All in all I had a wonderful experience with this game, and I hope to see more like it in the future. Keeping my fingers crossed for a sequal, or a spiritual successor. Definitely giving this one an 8.5/10 :)"
13887,"This is a fun, story based puzzle game.  I really was into it and was really trying to find out what happened the main character's uncle, but I feel like the story doesn't pay off in the end.  During the course of the game there was a lot of good and intriguing clues to what happened to his uncle, but by the time the credits roll I didn't feel like it lived up to what it had set up.  

I would still recommend the game especially at the regular price.  The swinging does feel like a spiderman simulator and the jumping has a lot of momentum that feels really good.  The very first time I was thrust into the air I got butterflies in my stomach."
13888,"Platforming and adventure games have always been my cup of tea. This one, however, has some pros and some cons.
First, the scenery is beautiful, from the caves to the floating villages, everything looks gorgeous.
Second, the mechanics are interesting and quite well-used, the game gets difficult towards the end and at times frustrating, but it was still pretty enjoyable.
However, that's about it for the pros. Onto the cons.
1. The character models don't look and act very natural, not even the one and only human character - your uncle - can escape from this. Looking at them just sends chills down my spine.
2. The story is a mixed bag. [spoiler]Up until Maddie and I arrive at the village, it still has quite a natural pace, however everything afterwards is downhill. She suddenly wants to say goodbye with me, even though she has good reasons, it still feels abrupt. And at the end, after you meet your uncle, you are told to leave without your uncle. The epilogue is touching, but still doesn't make up for the fact that you leave immediately. Oh, and that cave you visited earlier? Nope, you're not going back there.[/spoiler] What did the two-hour story build up to? Hint: It isn't satisfaction.
At full price, $13 is just too much to ask for. At $3.24, it's barely worth it unless you're a platforming fan."
13889,"Great little game, had a blast playing it, nice touching story. Over all it was worth the buy."
13890,"Only 10 minutes into the game, and the atmosphere and storyline so far are great.  However, there is already a hefty problem.  The game describes being capable of much more than is promised: an environment in which you can ignore the world's laws and use a suit of protective gear to soar through the air in any manner you please.  But, the reality is that the game tricks you.  Instead, it decides when you are able to grapple at your destination, rather than leaving you to your promise.  If this was fore-warned, so be it, but there is no warning, only repeatable trial and error.  I can already tell, this game will be more frustrating than it is worth.  Still, I congratulate the maker on a superb attempt."
13891,"EN/PT-BR
I'm glad I got this on sale, because I'd regret (even more) paying this game its full price. Two words could describe it well: boring and enervating. I really gave this game a chance, even though my final impressions were obtained on the second level. I'll try not to be long here (well, I tried).
The controls follow a simple scheme, but it doesn't help. They're sometimes clunky (and this is unforgivable in a precision-based game) and even unresponsive - boy, did I hate having to redo so much stuff at the Star Haven and the Ice Cave! Also there were parts in both these stages I only got through thanks to glitches (such as invisible unintended platforms and forceable pathways), and while I do love to explore development gaps in great games, I hate to have to use them to finish not-so-brilliant games.
The music is completely forgettable, and this is also inexcusable in a game that wants to invite you to explore the field. As for the visuals, they're unappealing. The colour scheme is pretty ""meh"" and the landscape is tiringly repetitive - to be fair, though, the colours composing the sky in Star Haven make for a quite gorgeous combination.
Another mistake is the terrible placement of the stones you have to grapple to. Sometimes they are so random that it seems like the gaming is forcing a hard learning curve at an extremely unnatural pace. That combined with the forceable pathways makes for a playthrough full of tedium sighs. You don't feel rewarded for having been able to proceed.
And finally we get to the supposedly valuable gem of the game: the story it tells. Nope. Just forget it. The story is just thrown at you. You don't connect to any of the characters - even your sidekick simply comes and goes away. There's no emotion. You don't feel like you have nor like you should find your uncle. You don't feel like you have a real purpose on this world. It tries to be touching at the end and cute from the beginning, but it also fails at that mainly due to the bad voice acting (bad enough that you don't even care about what you're being told after some time).
Yes, there are good parts, but they don't make up for all the bad ones. And yes, I get it that the game is short and maybe they didn't have a big budget, but that's not an excuse: Braid and The Stanley Parable are also short indie games that are excellent at what they're trying to do. ASaMU is not. It had a greater ambition than what it was able to deliver. Bottom line is: don't buy it, there are plenty of other great games on sale and you don't want to waste your money on a short unpleasing experience.

Edit: Many years later I decided to give this one a go once more. Maybe I was too young or my old PC sucked. Nope. This game really isn't good. Strongly recommend you to skip it.
Score: 3/10

Que bom que eu comprei esse jogo na promo√ß√£o, porque eu me arrependeria (ainda mais) de gastar nele seu pre√ßo total. Duas palavras o descrevem bem: chato e irritante. Eu dei V√ÅRIAS chances ao jogo, mas minhas impress√µes finais foram as que obti j√° na segunda fase. Vou tentar n√£o me alongar (bem, eu tentei).
Os controles seguem um esquema simples, mas isso n√£o ajuda. √Äs vezes s√£o meio desajeitados (o que √© imperdo√°vel em um jogo que se baseia em precis√£o) e at√© mesmo irresponsivos - voc√™ n√£o tem no√ß√£o do quanto eu detestei ter que refazer tanta coisa em Star Haven e em Ice Cave. Tamb√©m houve partes nessas duas fases que eu s√≥ consegui passar por causa de glitches (como plataformas invis√≠veis n√£o intencionais e caminhos for√ß√°veis), e apesar de eu amar explorar falhas de desenvolvimento de jogos √≥timos, detesto TER que us√°-los pra completar jogos fracos.
A m√∫sica √© completamente esquec√≠vel, e isso tamb√©m √© imperdo√°vel em um jogo que quer te convidar a explorar o mapa. Quanto √† parte visual, n√£o √© convidativa. O esquema de cores √© bem mais ou menos e o cen√°rio √© cansativamente repetitivo - mas tenho que ser justa: as cores que comp√µem o c√©u em Star Haven formam uma combina√ß√£o linda.
Outro erro √© o posicionamento terr√≠vel das pedras √†s quais voc√™ tem que se agarrar. √Äs vezes s√£o t√£o aleat√≥rias que parece que o jogo est√° te for√ßando uma suposta a aprender coisas dif√≠ceis num ritmo nada natural. Isso causa, combinado com os caminhos for√ß√°veis, uma jogatina cheia de suspiros de t√©dio. Voc√™ n√£o se sente recompensada por ter conseguido progredir.
E chegamos finalmente √† suposta pedra preciosa do jogo: a hist√≥ria que ele conta. N√£o. Esquece. A hist√≥ria √© jogada pra cima de voc√™. Voc√™ n√£o se conecta a qualquer dos personagens - at√© sua parceira simplesmente chega e vai embora. N√£o h√° emo√ß√£o. Voc√™ n√£o se sente como se tivesse ou devesse encontrar seu tio. Voc√™ n√£o sente que tem um prop√≥sito real nesse mundo. O jogo tenta ser tocante no final e fofo desde o come√ßo, mas tamb√©m fracassa nisso, principalmente devido √† dublagem ruim (ruim o suficiente pra fazer com que voc√™ deixe de se importar com o que est√£o te falando depois de algum tempo).
Sim, h√° partes boas, mas elas n√£o compensam as tantas partes ruins. E, sim, eu entendo que o jogo √© curto e talvez eles n√£o tenham um or√ßamento grande, mas isso n√£o √© desculpa. Braid e The Stanley Parable tamb√©m s√£o jogos indie curtos que s√£o excelentes no que se prop√µem a fazer. ASaMU n√£o √©. Teve uma ambi√ß√£o maior do que foi capaz de entregar.
Minhas palavras finais s√£o: n√£o compre. H√° v√°rios outros jogos √≥timos em promo√ß√£o e voc√™ n√£o quer gastar sua grana numa experi√™ncia curta e desprazerosa.

Edit: Passados v√°rios anos eu decidi dar mais uma chance a esse jogo. Talvez eu fosse muito nova, ou talvez meu PC antigo fosse muito ruim. Me enganei: esse jogo que n√£o √© muito bom mesmo. Recomendo fortemente que voc√™ n√£o o compre.
Nota: 3/10"
13892,"This game surprised me. I wasn't expecting a pretty exploration game to have webslinging!
The puzzles are easy, so it's a good thing that the exploration bit keeps being interesting. You're basically flinging your way through an underground cave with talking frog-like inhabitants, looking for the mythical figure of your Uncle and retracing his steps in the world and the impact he has had on it.
Leaping around is great fun, and admiring the cave and the pretty shiny lights from the small frog communities here and there gives a tremendous sense of freedom, despite all taking place in a cave. It's spacious enough to feel like a great big world.
Best played with a controller."
13893,"I couldn't not recommend ASAMU because the story, the world in which it takes place and the way you navigate it are MAGICAL and I loved those parts immensely.

There are 2 caveats to my recommendation tho

1 - it's not a long game - someone who's good at it will probably complete it in 2-3 hours
2 - there are a couple of sections where the difficulty spikes quite a lot 

Credit to the developers, they have changed the hardest parts to make them easier - but one part (the Ice Stalagtite Corridor near the end) remains punishingly difficult compared to most of the rest of the game.

It spoiled the game a bit for me - you get frustrated with the controls when you should be enjoying yourself as you fly through the air etc. etc. - but I still recommend you try this if you have the remotest interest in it.
"
13894,"I just can't recommend a game that has such broken mechanics as this one. The guy's momentum is super inconsistent, with the speed just stopping once you let go of the ""ropes"". Then some other time with exactly similar moves there's too much speed and once again the guy falls down to the darkness It also looks like the length of the rope is determined by the developers for every single jump so you can never be sure when it reaches and when it doesn't. Than if it does, whoops, it still doesn't activate on clicks. And then there's the monster segments that just reek of garbage with the monster being awake when you come round a corner and have no chance of knowing that. Oh well, pass this one."
13895,"Just amazing! The puzzles are really fun and the more you play, the more the story get better ! The graphics are also really beautiful. I love this game so much that i would like to remove my memory of me playing this game so i could play it again and again. :D"
13896,"Great little gem! 
Totally worth checking out! 
Good swinging and jump/boosting mechanics, solid story, short and sweet. 
I LIKED IT!"
13897,"A very short, but nicely put together game. The story is fairly inconsequential but light and childish. The main draw is the platforming mechanic which has power jump, grapple, and rocket boot moves designed to get you through. Very clever and pretty level design makes getting through the world delightful. Also, I liked how, while some sections may leave you temporarily puzzled, it's not a puzzle game. You can get past most sections in a number of ways. For example, you may just jump, or rocket boots followed by grapple to get to the same place, and most surfaces will allow you to grapple, meaning you're not aiming for one specific grapple point which would have been the only way to get where you're going.
Play this with a mouse though."
13898,"The only things i ever expect from indie titles are a descent story, usable game mechanics and a compelling graphic design.
However i got a nice surprise when i started playing this game.
it's got a nice creepy/innocent vibe to it which is really great when you add it to the plot of finding your lost uncle.
The parhour mechanics with grappeling and leaps are really compelling to any gamer with a soft spot for acrobatics, the world in which this game is set also contributes to the parkhour elements of the game, concidering the maps consist of islands made out of rock floating over void, which means that you need to act with precision when jumping around (which is see as a plus)

I feel comfortable recommending this game to any gamer who likes a well crafted and executed indie game."
13899,"Sigh. This is a game that I'm just... really disappointed in. It's not even that bad, it's only just in the negative category, but I can't really say I enjoyed it enough to give it a positive.

Mostly, the game is just... confused, a lot of the time. Baffling game design choices like forced cutscenes in most levels with no way to skip them, which would be fine if you were only playing levels once, but the game encourages replayability with two achievements per level as well as three more achievements spread across all five. This is most problematic in stages 2 especially as well as 3 and minorly in 4, but it's a really huge oversight in my personal opinion; even just replaying the levels normally, some of these cutscenes drag too long a second time through.

The game also can't decide if it wants to be a challenging platformer or a story-based game with gameplay filling in the gaps. The aforementioned achievements plus the levels being generally designed okay enough seem to make it more on the gameplay side of things, but then there's weird stuff like rough terrain, random atmospheric objects that only serve to get in the way, and a lot of other things that throw a wrench in that whole level design thing. Plus, the abundance of cutscenes does abruptly halt the flow of the game far too often.

There's also some kind of cruddy level design choices at times. Most of the time you won't have to be too perfect with your momentum to land a jump, so when the few instances where you do have to be relatively precise come up they become infuriating quickly (especially with the challenges for each level, often forcing you to have to restart and subsequently rewatch cutscenes each time). The level length is also horribly imbalanced, with the first three levels combined being shorter than the fifth level (and the fourth being twice as long as any of the three before it). This isn't just a rough judgment either, just going by the speedrun times for each level. Which also vary in leniency; of the ones I attempted, the first level's was oddly strict, while the second and fourth level's not so much. The first two levels have a high reliance on cycles, as well, which are very anti-speedrun (oddly enough this mostly vanishes for the last few levels though...)

The real breaking point for me though is just how inconsistently the game behaves. The physics and controls don't feel consistent enough. Long jumps have varying distance some of the time, occasionally one will be much shorter for no apparent reason. Other jumps have weird momentum, sometimes I'll have enough speed in a jump, other times I won't; regardless of whether or not I was running prior to the jump. Occasionally the sense of scale is also screwed up such that something that looks like you can grapple onto it is actually farther away than it looks (stage 4 has this in spades, for whatever reason). Plenty of times the controls just outright fail, too. I'll start a jump charge but it won't work. I'll try to long jump but I got a high jump instead, even though I didn't let go of the run button. I'll try to long jump and not jump at all somehow??? The lack of consistency is what really kills the replayability factor for me here, it's not fun to replay because I'm never sure when I'll get screwed over by something not behaving properly.

So then, the game is probably fine as a casual experience. If you plan to play through it once and then never touch it again, most of these problems are utterly irrelevant to you. That's fine. However, it's not a particularly lengthy game and I'd expect the average player to clear the entire story in 2-3 hours, and the asking price is a bit high for that amount of gameplay. Get it on sale if you want to play it that way and you'll probably have a fun enough time. For the people who want to replay and get achievements, you'll probably get your money's worth a lot better, but the cracks in the game really show when it's played this way and make it an unpleasant experience. The latter is the experience I've had and it has pretty thoroughly convinced me that I dislike this game. It can be fun when nothing goes wrong, but I can't trust it enough for it to stay fun. I think with a little more polish and a few aletered levels this could be a really good, fun game, but as it stands it's not quite there yet, in my personal opinion."
13900,"One of the best games I've had the honor of playing with the story and platforming, all and all it is amazing.
Jesus Aproves"
13901,"This is a visually beautiful game with lots of heart.  The gameplay mechanic is unique, and presents a reasonable challenge.  (Think Spider Man meets the Gravity Gun.)  It isn't always 100% clear where you need to go, so sometimes you have to experiment and fail in the process - but you don't lose ""lives"" or have to restart the level, so the cost of doing this isn't too high.  (You just go back to the last checkpoint - and while sometimes I wish they were a little more frequent, I've certainly dealt with a lot worse.)  It isn't a long game, but every inch of it is covered in gorgeous detail - it's like wandering through a fantastical painting.  

You play through the narrator's memory as he tells a story to his daughter - a story about his uncle.  I think this is a story very much worth playing through.  I really do enjoy those type of games that are artistically beautiful, but a bit short as a result of a small team or highly concentrated resources (like Mind: Path to Thalamus, for example) - and I have to say, I enjoyed this one more than most for a few reasons:  There isn't an ounce of pretention in this game - it's all humble heart (with the occasional clever joke) - and there is a fair amount of fun, unique gameplay to be had.

9/10 - Highly recommended."
13902,"Verdict: A Story About My Uncle is a neat non-violent game involving jumping and pulling onto rocks. I strongly recommend everyone to play this game for about 30 minutes, then delete it. 

GOOD AND BAD - RELAXING

The journey has a very calming ambiance, which is very nice for winding down after a long day. Unfortunately, this is offset by repeatedly failing to make particular jumps, or by repeatedly trying to beat your own time or # of jumps. 

BAD - VISUALS

Low resolution texture, but especially poor facial rendering makes it hard to connect to any of the NPCs. Most of the environment is just rocks. Brown rocks. Occasionally some green plant. 

BAD - STORY

The plot is about your pedophile molester uncle who crafted a suit that fits your body contours precisely while you were asleep in his house. Then he turns frog fetuses into little girls and moves into that world. You try to find him by pushing a lever for garbage disposal that sends you into a world where you resurrect forever whenever you fall into some weird abyss. 

OKAY - GAMEPLAY

It's fun for a bit, then gets boring really quickly. 

CONCLUSION

This is not a bad game, but definitely comes nowhere near the fun and replayability of Sanctum 2. So get it when it's super cheap, and play for 30 minutes. 

Rating: 6/10"
13903,Monkey swinging first-person puzzle platformer with pleasant scenery and half decent voice acting. Short but sweet.
13904,"This game is the entire embodiement of a reccomendation (Keep in mind I just cleared the game). This game provides 2+ hours of hand-crafted and very atmospheric, calming yet very action packed jump and running puzzles. Please do not judge this game off of ""Running Simulator 2014"" because it is a amazing experience if you like singleplayer games in the slightest, the enviorments are very diverse holding their own challenges and even though you don't know that characters long you learn to love them fast and as the story unfolds you learn more about each character and how they are as a person. Side note: Great job with mattie she was my favorite character. This game is in my mind a 10/10 simply due to the very atmospheric puzzle based nature of it and it is backed up with a universe that really compliments the creatures that live within it. And who really know the story of my uncle?"
13905,"This game is Amazing... If you love a Great story, good Gameplay and an amazing story, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. I could go on forever of how much I love this game but I'm not going to do that.

Story 18/20, Could have added just a little bit more to the story to make it just a little bit more interesting.

Gameplay 16/20, If you love parkour, you will love this game although the only bad part about the game play is minor glitches that you can easily change just by reverting to last checkpoint which are frequently place throughout the game.

Graphics, 18/20, for being a low budge game this games graphics are Amazing and even slightly note worthy, I was even pretty supurised myself.

Parkour 20/20, Amazingly Stunning!

OVER ALL; 18/20, 
Note: Game got 12/28 game finnished 12/28 but easily replay-able."
13906,"A truely wonderful game. Beautifully setout and great storyline!

The ending was worth every fall and moments of rage! 

The jumps were phenomenal and really made my fingers, eyes and brain concentrate to make sure you grab at just the right moment! 

I really really recomend this for everyone!"
13907,"Another student project magnified to full release status, and, as is often the case, not necessarily justifying it. An awkward narration frames a one-note piece of gameplay which only has one moment of excitement amongst a few hours of feeling like Wile E. Coyote frantically scrabbling for survival and plummeting to his death over and over and over again. Fortunately the restart cycle is fast and the checkpoints generous, and some of the platforming-as-such verges on exhilarating. More polish could have made this good of itself; as it stands it's a workable idea which would fit into a bigger game, which perhaps they'll go on to make next time."
13908,This game feels as if its's a triple A title though its short and fun enough for it not too be.
13909,Absolutely wonderful game needs to be experienced by everyone with mild interest in puzzle games.
13910,-Beautiful 10/10
13911,"It was a really short game (around three hours, and I took my time) but it's a very fun experience. The feeling of ""flying"" all over the place along with the stunning visuals was relaxing and fun, and the story was pretty cute. 

My only complaints about the game are the ending and [spoiler] the fact that the rocket boots could have been used to make puzzles more intricate instead of being used as a crutch after missing grapples. [/spoiler]"
13912,"A Story About My Uncle is a short and very enjoyable experience. Not only is it pretty, its gameplay mechanics are innovative and work well. I like the ambiance, although I wish the story was more developped. The game is often available at a reduced price but is worth the full price. Great indie game!"
13913,Very fun game. I'd recommend getting it for all platformer games fans. The voice acting is great and the mechanics are innovative.
13914,"This game is amazing. Beautiful story line, gorgeous atmosphere, and detail was surely put into it. This game is worth having and I recommend it to anyone. I hope to see more works like this from the developers in the future."
13915,"I could describe ''A Story About My Uncle'' in one word: Adventure. Because that's what the game is, and adventure. The mechanics, the enviroment, the soundtrack, everything is beautiful. It runs really smoothly even on low end PCs, even though the graphics are gorgeous. The difficulty of the game is not very high and also not very low, there are obviously parts where you will get stuck and take a good 5 to 10 minutes to do something you could have done 1 or 2 minutes, but that happens in every platform game. It is not flawless though, some times you have to do something like press a key, and the game gives you no clue for that, and you just go around for 2 minutes thinking about what to do, and then the information just pops up on your screen, the textures sometimes bug and get green or purple and start flashing which ruins the immersion. The game is also very expensive for what it offers, I finished it with aproximately 70% at around 2 hours, but even then I'd say it is a very unique experience and worth every cent. Overall it is a fantastic game, I'd give it a 9/10 just because of the bugs and the price, I recommend buying it on a sale, I bought it for 3 dollars and it was completely worth the buy. It is a game for all ages, with a great level of difficulty, and very smooth running all though amazing graphics."
13916,"beautiful! imaginative! Great story line! The beauty behind this game is that it is one of a kind, unlike most. its extreeeeeeeemly fun"
13917,one of the best games i played you should grab it in a sale 4.5/5
13918,"A wonderful experience, a quick, but deep story. If you enjoy a good narrative, play this. Thank you devs, for this awesome game."
13919,This game is beutiful fun and very good story line also very short but i think theres a nice bit of replay value due to the simple yet fun mechanics of the game. the story is simple but realy awsome and i realy wish they would make another game of this i loved it and asuming they make more of these games or give addons i will be an avid follower of this company.
13920,"A simple, charming, approachable first-person platformer. It ended rather abruptly, and I felt like there could have been more meat to the story, but it was quite pleasant nevertheless; it had a fairly simple, fairy-tale-for-children feel to it. I'm no expert at platformers, but I didn't get overly frustrated by anything. The grappling hook physics are a little airy, but still feel pretty good overall.

Get if if you're up for a few hours of relaxed grappling-hooking."
13921,"I Would love to play this game for 20 more Hours , beautiful story , a bit short but wourth any second , highly recommended !."
13922,"Great game. The graphics feel a little dated but they weren't too bad. Controls are smooth. Gameplay is never too hard but is still a lot of fun. the story is very well written. The best part  of the game is definitely the environments, they just feel so big and wandering. You never feel like you're being forced to go in a certain direction likesome games do.
It does feel super short though, I don't think I would have bought it at full price, but the 75% off holiday deal is more than worth it."
13923,"So far I'm about 1.5-2 hours into the game and I am really digging the charm and ambiance of the locations and the narrative. It's not 'The Last Of Us' in terms of storyline, nor is it what I would necessarily call a ""AAA"" title, but in this case that's a good thing. It's obvious that the developers just wanted to tell a cool story with an interesting platforming/puzzle mechanic to help get you through it. The puzzles (so far) are not brain-twisting, but require some good timing and dexterity. The characters you encounter extend the game's charm and a sense of wonder - you truly feel like you're discovering new territory. Right after your uncle, that is. I am becoming more a fan of games that forego violence for an exciting, but serene experience. I've had enough 'kill streaks' and 'headshots' for multiple lifetimes. I still enjoy those games, but I find myself lingering in the indie section more than I used to. 

I'm giving this game a 8/10 at this point because they did so much right. The -2 is just because I can't justify giving a full 10/10 for a game I haven't fully completed."
13924,Really Neat Thinking Game! I Enjoyed Every Minute Of It! [b]10/10![/b]
13925,"Pros- 
-The feeling of speed and acceleration in this game is fantastic.
-In terms of story it might be simple but its cute.
-Visually stunning
-Fun

Cons
-Huge difficulty spike in last level (far from impossible but still seems a bit out of place)
-Fairly short (sub 3 hours)

Overall I think this game is a nice pickup and i would highly reccomend it."
13926,"i want to like this game, i really do.

The grappling and platforming physics are really nice.

But the game falls when you put in a giant fucking hole that you can't do anything about, ANYTHING!  Am I forced to look up a walkthrough cause a developer decides to make an impossible obsticle? No. I shouldn't have to.

This game is the reason why most of this indie story garbage games are fucking stupid."
13927,Fantastic game! Definintely worth playing!
13928,"Nice game really nice graphics and smooth controls, Once you get the hang of grappling and evnetually using your boots its really fun. not a very long game and I didnt find it too hard, unless you are going for the achievments. which at this time I only have one and its most likely the easiest to get. Overall a good looking fun game with a decent story."
13929,"This game is just brilliant for anyone that likes first person puzzlers such as Portal, QUBE and Quantum Conundrum. The diffeence with this game is the main focus of a narrarive told in the first person with the games events being told as a story to the protaganist's daughter. It's a wonderful little tale about a boy looking for his eccentric, adventurous, ingenious, inventing Uncle whom has been gone sometime from his workshop/laboratory, Upon steeping into his lab, the boy finds a suit just like his Uncle's exploring suit and accidentally sends himself to where his Uncle has been during his disappearance. 

The gameplay is mainly first person twitch platforming, using precisely timed jumps and the use of an grappling hook ray fired from your suits glove, level by level, various ways of traversing are introduced such as a charged jump and a rocket boost. The game becomes almost rhythmical with it's perfect timing of using each ability clinking onto rock to rock and reaching platform to platform.

The story is a sweet, otherworldly little tale about the boy's adventures in living up to his Uncle in trying to find and/or rescue him, meeting characters along the way. Halfway through, the story goes through a 'buddy aventure' kind of phase, but then lets the boy fend for himself. 

You'll get about 5 hours out of the game and some occasional frustrating parts with checkpoints about 3 platforms ago, but the whole art and sound design is beautiful, the levels have such a sense of scale with perfect draw distance teasing you what puzzle is next. It really does feel like you just sat through a whimsical little tale about a boy's enchanted adventure in uncharted territory using his Uncles inventions."
13930,"Graphics 8/10 - Story 6/10 - Gameplay 5/10 - Controls 7/10 - Overall 6/10

A Story About My Uncle is first-person platformer that adds interesting and unique ways to traverse obstacles by using an energy-like grappeling-hook (much like Metroid Prime).

I must've spent hours trying to cross the falling cube area until finally cutting my losses. The random factor, for this area in particular, is garbage. The cubes are too far apart, and if you get lucky enough to reach the other side, there aren't any cubes to grab. I, unfortunately, lack the necessary vocabulary to describe this, but take my word for it, it sucks.

This game's controls are decent, but lacking. The graphics are not bad. The story is simple enough, although, I couldn't finish it. The main problem here is the gameplay."
13931,"A beautifull story driven platformer unlike any ive seen before. Its pretty solid, though the platforming is easy. The mystery surrounding the dissapearance of your uncle was all worth it. If you like mystery, adventure, exploring and beautifull landscapes, give this game a try. :)"
13932,"This game is jaw-droppingly beautiful and very well executed.  The story is light but deep and fantastic, and players are rewarded for exploring outside of the main path.  I've gone through this game twice and watched another friend go through it, and I'm still not tired of it."
13933,This might be one of the best 1st person platforming games I've ever played. The controls and ability's all flow so well and the narrative of the game adds a very nice touch that helps really draw you in to the story.
13934,"I have a love/hate relationship with this game, but the love side is just strong enough to earn a recommendation. But first, the hate: so f'ing frustrating at times. I wanted to finish the game before doing a review, but with how the final level is going I'm not sure that will ever happen. The platforming difficult jumps randomly from comfortably challenging to annoying, sometimes within the same segment between checkpoints. Which is one of my other main gripes, the checkpoints are occasionally too spread out, which means constantly repeating an easy section (which was fun at first), because of failure on a difficult bit. This also makes it harder to get into the rhythm necessary for the more difficult area. My final complaint is that some places make it hard to tell where you're even supposed to be going. Trying to find our destination while flying through the air is not a good time.

On the plus side, most of the areas are gorgeous, and it's a pleasure to traverse them. The story is interesting, if not exactly mind-blowing. And the easier platforming sections are a joy to swing through, even if they take a few attempts. All-in-all, if you have patience and good hand/eye coordination, this is a small gem that's worth your time."
13935,Gameplay is alot off fun and the story was really touching. Great game!
13936,This is my new favorite game of all time. EVER.
13937,Beautiful 2 hours! :D
13938,"Good game. Very Pretty. Mechanics are very fun. Tries to get a little to crazy mechanically at the end, still very fun."
13939,Play this like you're a futuristic tarzan
13940,Good game challenging at times.has a good story stunning visuals...
13941,Motherfucking rocket boots. 'Nuff said.
13942,"I found the story of this game very well done. I loved every second of it. the platforming puzzles aren't very difficult, but the story is really what sold me home and I really enjoyed it."
13943,"A really fun and well-designed game. The central mechanic of grappling onto surfaces is an interesting one and is rarely ever done well, yet A Story About My Uncle pulls it off flawlessley. The environent is beautiful and completely out of this world. The only gripe I have with the game is the voice acting, but seeing as it is an indie game it's easily forgiven and you do get used to it rather quickly. Overall I'd give it a 9/10."
13944,Jump and leap and fly and grappel and FALL.
13945,"A Story About My Uncle is a very decent game. The visuals in this game has landed it as one of the prettiest and dreamlike 3D games I've ever played. There are certain shots and levels that are so vibrant and colorful that you really can't help but appreciate the amount of work put into making the environments look so awesome. A game like this would be excellent on the Occulus Rift.

Platforming is the core gameplay, and it can be as fun as it is frustrating at times. The grapple beam, jumps, and boosts are exciting mechanics, especially with the scale of the world your make you way through.

That said, this -is- a first person platformer and there -are- definitely those sigh moments when you miss certain landings. But I didn't find it too difficult, and I enjoyed the ride far more than I was annoyed with it at certain points.

Story wise, it's not all that complex. That isn't a bad thing at all, and despite how linear it is, more narrative and story is available to those who take the time to explore and examine, and that's a major plus. There's a lot of heart in what it presents, and I thought it was really cute. Voice acting is okay/could be better, but it's not awful.

This is definitely a shorter game, and while that's nothing to really fault it on, I still feel like there was the potential to get more for it to get across than it did. The conclusion is nice, but it's a little too sudden for my taste. There isn't a whole lot of closure.

Still, I vouch for this game. It's fun, it's pretty, and it's a running blast through a dreamy world. Check it out when it's on sale."
13946,"This is one of the best game i ever played seriously. Dont miss this beautiful designed, awsome and relaxing game, just dont >_>
Just came here to update my review for the steam awards nomination 2021 badge!"
13947,"Platforming with heart and cool mechanics.

Awesome and intuitive mechanic.
The right amount of dificulty and challenge.
Beautiful art across all levels. Kind of reminded me of Psychonauts when you're in the villages.

It's short.
Story was intriguing, but could have had better background and development.

I'd say it's a must have on sale."
13948,"Simple and nice, a good little game"
13949,"I got this game based on the other reviews for it and the fact that I love taking gambles on little indie games, especially if they're cheap. And while this game is pretty and sounds good, it has no depth. The story is basically non-existant, and what there is just amounts to literally moving from point A to point B, and that's it. Period. Nothing else.

I was expecting a lot more.

What exists is simply a puzzle platformer, where the puzzles are not intellectually challenging: most of them are just plain easy, and the rest are frustrating and just require repeated attempts until you get them right."
13950,"This game is about Adventure, but it does not have a combat system. It has a race game. Another game that is similar to this that I can think of is Mirror's Edge. Story is not as engaging as I wanted it to be but over all its alright. 6.5/10"
13951,"This game was well worth the hours I played it for.
Is it worth playing? YES IT IS
Is it worth finishing? YES IT IS
This game is a short but execellent journey through a beautiful alien world. 
The levels are well designed and fun to traverse.
The story is basic but does its job well.
Game mechanics work well and are uncomplicated.
9/10 - Better then I expected"
13952,"SPiderman
10/10 IGN"
13953,This was a very well made game with a great story and beautiful narration i would like to see a similar game or something kinda like a sequel.
13954,"Bought this on sale. Never had heard of it, but it looked interesting enough.
It's simply a very nice looking game with a fun mechanic. Honestly at times, I thought it was a bit rough and unfair. I died quite a bit! It reminds me a bit of Portal so if that's your thing, go for it.
The story is nice. Nothing earthshattering, but it's a nice little adventure. 
Lastly, it's a bit short, but I think it was well worth the money.
Have this game a gander."
13955,"fun platformer with a pretty cool story, wasn't expecting it to be as short as it was so the ending felt a little abrupt but not a big deal. the tone of the story feels unusually somber for a game about leaping and swinging around, not really complaining but it does feel kind of strange. regardless, a good game, recommended for sure"
13956,"love the story and universe and hope they expand on it in the future it's a nice game, fun but can also be quite frustrating like all momentum platformers it's short but i would say it's worth it so if you like platformers give it a try"
13957,"A story about my uncle is one of the best games i've played. a simple story and a great adventure make this game just so much fun. the great fun of this game lies in its simplicity, you have a very limited amount of abilitys to get trough this 3D platformer: sprint, jump, grapple and rocket boots. the game make you combine these in more than ways then you expect! but as any game it does have a downside or two. the voice acting was pretty stiff and the game itself was somewhat short! conclusion if you get it in a sale as i did dont doubt best 3 bucks ive ever spend! i would even go as far as to go against my policy of dont buy when its not in sale on this one!"
13958,"One of my fav games of the year. Although its short, i got alot of time out of it with finding the secretes (Havent found them all yet), translating all the text with my friend, and trying my best at time trials (my best isnt that good :\).
What amazes me the most is that the makers of Goat Sim made this game. I would have never thought they had it in them to make a serious game, but they actually pulled it off and I'm very proud of them.

I want everyone to at least have a quick look at this amazing platformer because it is well worth your time."
13959,"Beautiful enviroment, challenging plattforming, no violence, good story and neat unlockables. It really tests you to what you could do with what you have, changing up what you're able to do, challenges you and makes you wonder ''Can I jump that far? Huh guess I couldn't that way''

These are the people who made Goat Simulator in the past, I must say they spent their money very well in the development of this game(It may have not financed the game but it probably gave the company a good push towards getting this game released).

Are you the kind of person who likes references and shit? There's Naruto, Astrid Lindgren, MLP, GoT, Mass Effect etc!

Did you enjoy swinging in Trine 2? The realistic feel good gravity/mindset to Portal (1/2)?

HATE GRAVITY? *Tosses copy in your amazed-colored face* 

If you like plattforming I'd probably not let you leave without forcing you into buying a copy!"
13960,"This is a short but fun game with a quaint storyline. I really enjoyed this game. It requires some patience at parts, and while the story isn't anything revolutionary, I enjoyed it. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for something a little lighter to play for a few hours. Enjoy it for what it is - it's quite good."
13961,"amazing game! really worth buying even if it isn't on sale

Pros:
awesome story
challenging achievements
unique gameplay
very few glitches discovered (just a few camera wall clips here and there)

Cons:
can be repetitive

8/10"
13962,"While short, I found myself having a fantastic time.
Everything is very fluid. The jumps feel snappy, grappling feels smooth and rocket boosting is just a ton of fun. 

The story itself is rather ""cute"". As told by a father to his daughter while reliving the story first hand as the player. 

For extra replayability there is a time trail mode which I will be happy to play time and time again due to the wonderful platforming. 

All in all; I would have paid full price for this one had I known it would be a great little story wrapped inside of an awesome gem of a game."
13963,"[h1] Overview [/h1]
[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is an adventure puzzle platformer game developed by the same people who brought us Goat Simulator. It shows much of that indie aura, as it is centered around a simple but nicely told narrative. The game's setting is future you telling a bedtime story to your daugher about your unfathomable adventures as a 10 year-old on his quest to search for his Uncle.

[h1] Graphics - OK[/h1]
The game's focus was obviously not the graphics, but the simple yet catchy gameplay. While you won't have any impressive textures, the game makes up for it in ambient. Lots of light sources and a colored evironment will keep your eyes entertained during playthrough, however if you are a graphics elitist you might be set off by some, but few lowpoly models. The character animations are pretty lifeless, however they are mostly there for decorative purposes. Overall, I wouldn't complain about the graphics, since they look decent and not the focus of the game.

[h1] Gameplay - Fun but Frustrating [/h1]
This is another easy to play - hard to master game. It involves you wearing a power suit that alows you to jump high, run fast and grapple via an energy beam to different objects. The goal is simple. Get to the end of the level. However, doing so won't be that easy, and you can easily find yourself repeating the same sequence over and over. A warning for completitioists: [b]the achievements are bloody hard[/b]. They involve completing levels without dieing or using a limited ammount of grapples. A very hard thing to do. The game isn't so lenghty campaign-wise, but trying to complete these challanges will surely keep you busy.

[h1] Sound - Soothing Ambiental[/h1]
The sound is very nice in this game. Not intrusive, only calm music to serve as background stress relief, along with narratives at certain points. Decent voice acting, a nice touch overall.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
- Interesting Story
- Simple but fun gameplay
- Relaxing Atmosphere

[h1] Cons [/h1]
- Hard to master

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
The game isn't much for replayability, however given the price I would easily recommend it as a casual experience."
13964,"""A Story About My Uncle"" took my breath away. I am starting to black out from suffication. I need that breath back. Please send he"
13965,"A Story About My Uncle is a platform game where you guide the protagonist through another, alien dimension in the search of his adventurer uncle Fred. You can take advantage of a power suit to navigate the five bizarre areas the story will take you to in the roughly four hours of gameplay.

The main beef of A Story About My Uncle is indeed Fred's power suit and the various moves you can pull off with it: you can jump to greater heights, sprint, resist great falls, dash in mid-air thanks to a pair of rocket boots and use an energy beam to hook upon certain surfaces and cover large distances. The game makes a good job and introducing the different mechanics gradually and offers a steady increase in challenge as you go on.

While the title does have a story of its own (and a rather good one at that) and introduces few characters to you, the interation with the NPCs is minimal (save for two major characters): what really drags A Story About My Uncle is the platforming and the tale is told mainly in-between the various sections. The game primary appeal is the scenary: the environment is especially rich in design and always plentifully detailed, reaching scenary porn more than once.

Apart from the main story, you are given a time trial mode and a hunt for collectables around the areas you visit, which unlock mainly cosmetic goodies.

A Story About My Uncle is a little gem of a game, both very entertaining to play and plesant to look at that. It's definitely worth its price"
13966,"This game is incredible ! 
It was soo good felt like an interactive graphic novel storey book thing and the mechanics are so smooth and keep you interested and on your toes throughout. The whole game is well done and is so short, simple and sweet its super easy to get in to, cant wait for my friends to play it and to play it again myself, deffinitly worth the purchase."
13967,"There's no story about Uncle Fred. There's no story at all.
The only good things of this game are the environment and the evocative views.
The gameplay is too simple and the upgrades for the suit don't bring anything new to the gameplay at all.
And the whole game is too short.
I can't recommend this game, especially for this prize."
13968,"This game isn't that rich in story, but still it's quite touching. How the story goes on is also nicely done, with the narrator and the script. 
What is the best, it's the gameplay and the visuals. Everytime I was enjoying flying through the sky I couldn't help but notice how beautiful the scenery were. This is game is quite short, nevertheless, it's an awesome experience. Totally worth it."
13969,"Great art, really interesting grappling mechanic that makes this platform game truly unique.  It was really fun despite there being several puzzles that I had to attempt 10-20 times in a row simply because they required split-second timing or they had really long sections without a save point. It has a bit of a story, which isn't really very good and it probably could have done without it. Still, a pretty good puzzle-platformer that I would probably play again."
13970,"This game is pretty cool, nice graphics, nice story... Rate 9"
13971,I LOVE THE STORY !
13972,Unquestionably beautiful and solid fun gameplay.
13973,"Voice acting really ruined it for me, story was ok, overall a short and easy game with some interesting elements. Would recommend it if it's cheap otherwise I'd stay away."
13974,"Woahhhh, what a great ride it was! Seriously, for a game made by students, this game rocks!
The A-W-E-S-O-M-E feeling of ""flying"" through each level is just too awesome! (I know, I've wrote awesome 2 times in the same sentence, it was on purpose!) And that's without speaking of the feeling of you, getting better at controlling your suit...

The game isn't perfect, (like all game, no??) but i'm pretty sure you'll have plenty of fun with that game! That's why I highly suggest that everyone buy this game, at least, just to support those guys and maybe, someday, have another good game!

Congratulations guys!!"
13975,"Just finished A Story About My Uncle and what a fantastic game it is, pretty short but really well written and well executed, a must buy."
13976,"Nice little game. The beginning was a wonderful start, full of details and thick atmosphere. The game develops a simple but nice story since the start. The problem is that the mechanics (although there are some changes through the game thanks to powerups or new tools) may become a little repetitive. The scenery changes for every chapter though, and there can be many good moments, just looking at the view or some accurate level design. After all, a good game, but not really a precious gem. 70/100"
13977,Want an example of an engaging game with a nice story and a fun physics concept? Here you go.
13978,Great little adventure story game.
13979,"Great music, voice acting, graphics and idea.

Gets repetitive and can be frustrating at times.

Sometimes I get a bit lost since it doesn't really show where to go (I usually go back to my last platform because of this).

Great game overall. I give it a 7.8/10, and I'd say it's worth $11.

PROTIP: GET IT ON SALE!"
13980,awesome
13981,"If you're expecting super fantastic amazing awesome fun times! - this will disappoint. However - it's a really fun game once you get used to the controls. I picked it up on sale, not sure how much it is normally - but it's a good couple hours of fun, more if you're all about getting all the achievements. It's fun enough that I played it all the way through in one sitting. Would recommend to those who just want a casual afternoon's worth of pleasant game experience.

Pros - Interesting game mechanics, fun figuring out different ways to get stuff done, cute story.

Cons - The ""Let's play a game, I bet you can't do this without the grapple"" (note, you can do it with the grapple - her voice saying ""told you so"" was enough to make me do it without it) bit. Voice acting's a little stiff - but from what I can tell, it's like their second or third language so not really arguing it here."
13982,"INCREDIBLE. Very heartwarming and challenging, highly recommend if you're a fan of the Portal series."
13983,Seriously one of my favorite Adventure games / Story book games. It's so wild it feels like a dream but it feels real at the same time! It's a must play and I absolutely recommend it if you've played and enjoyed Portal 2 and/or Mirror's Edge
13984,"jumped into a bottomless pit with a child on my back 

10/10"
13985,this game was overall an enjoyable addition to my library.  If you put aside the less than desirable voice acting and story this is a great game with lots of potential.  Good gameplay but i would suggest getting this on sale ( I paid $3 ) because i don't feel that it is worth $12
13986,"It had very fun gameplay, a okay plot with a good ending. The only problem with the game is that it is extremely short. The whole game can be beaten in about 1 1/2 - 2 hours."
13987,this is a very good game i really love it i think everyone should play this :) thank you
13988,"I highly recommend this game for the $3.24, sale price, I paid for it...  The Pros - The game has a great storyline, a interesting, challanging, and new kind of adventure game that requires procision, very quick reflexes, a strategic mind, and repetition until you get it right.  You will not want to stop playing this game, because it's very addicting.  Also, it's very nice to have the X-Box Controller option!  The Cons - The game gets increasingly more difficult, so much so that I just couldn't finish towards the end, and that is very disappointing.  And there are no difficulty settings, so you play like everyone else, whether you have the same set of skills or not... I know there are a lot of braggarts that will tell you the game isn't long enough, they finished in 6 hours, and it is just too easy of a game.  HA!  

My experience with this game - I've played around 9 hours, and I consider myself fairly well with what is expected of me in this game, and still couldn't finish.  I just couldn't get back across these floating block things, in the frozen cavern, that fall at different rates, to fast, with a very narrow window or space to cross, and with no rhyme, rhythm, or reason to how to accomplish that task at hand.  It would seem that it is all about chance or luck, and not about any skill set, so I lost interest and left the game unfinished!... ***Overall, it's fun and a cheap game so game so I'm not complaining. ;)"
13989,"A very simple yet fun first-person platofrmer.  This Indie game has very good graphics (except for the character models), simple and neat gameplay with so much potential (reminded me a lot of the Portal games without the puzzles), but a weak story and characters.
Even though the story lacked significantly, the game made up for it in gameplay and a beautiful world.   7/10  :)"
13990,8/10
13991,A challenging puzzle platformer that's just flat out fun to play. Would love more.
13992,"I recommend playing this game just for the couple hours of gameplay, and the visuals. It's story is lacking and I agree with others who've said the NPC models are lacking. I, too, was disappointed in the very rushed feeling ending.

I'd give this a 6.5/10. Some of the environments are just so gorgeous I wanted to be able to explore more - I wanted to see more of the world and the people. I'm not sure what the story behind the game development is but it's weird; the levels are beautiful and some of the transitions are really cool (I loved the one when you leave the caves - WOW) and this game would be a mind blowing Rift game were it ever to get supported, but on the other hand, the NPCs really feel like an afterthought and the story comes to a very unfulfilling end, which is too bad since there's a LOT of potential here.

I'd say, play the game, knowing that you're gonna be going through, exploring and wondering at each level until very abruptly the game will end without answering anything about most of what you just went through. If these guys made a sequel, and put more effort into finishing the story and making a complete game, I'd definitely buy it."
13993,"I meant to go to bed last night, but i made the mistake of booting this game up. The first time I've ever played it, and I couldn't stop. I just finished. 4.7 hours. 10/10 will have to play again to collect everything next time."
13994,"Awesome platformer.
Short game :(
Get it on sale."
13995,This game combines platforming from Mario and Donkey Kong with beautiful map designs AND IS IN FIRST PERSON! 10/10
13996,"A story about my uncle, though it only takes about four hours to beat, is a very impressive game visually and gameplay wise. The story is mysterious and even though the ending isn't very climactic, it is still a very impressive story. The amount of hard work and detail that was put into this game is incredible and I would recomend this to anyone who is looking to relax or even have a little bit of a challenge, or enjoy a fantastic story."
13997,"Beautiful scenery, excellent gameplay, deep story. 10/10"
13998,"This was the first time I've bought an Indie game only because of the trailer, and I regret nothing. This game is worth every cent (though I DID buy it on sale).
The gameplay, plot, audio and atmosphere are amazing. Jumping high, running fast, and laser grapling platforms- all I need in a game.
I deeply recommend it."
13999,"+ Beautiful Scenery
+ Great mechanics
+ Fun gameplay
+ Hilariously Questionable ""Eye Monster"" 
---------------------------
- No reset key
- A few VERY FRUSTRATING puzzles
-  Bad Character Models

Verdict: Like Mirror's Edge without the city, or the police, or any violence, but with soothing swedish voices."
14000,"I would definitely recommend this game... If you can pick it up on sale.

I really don't think the game is worth the $13 that it costs normals. I picked it up on sale for a little over $3. Don't get me wrong, I loved the game, but it's really short. I beat it in 2.5 hours and that's just because I was doing stuff on my second monitor while playing. I wish it was longer because I really did enjoy it. I was a bit disapointed when it was over.

Now lets talk about the gameplay. I loved it. It's a platformer, so if you aren't into that kind of stuff, don't buy it. I really like the design of the world. Okay, so since it is a platformer, with your character swinging around with a grapple device and jet boots, you have to have your timing down. The being too late or too early will kill you. I've read some people saying that the jumps are nearly impossible, but I didn't find that to be the case. There were 2 jumps total that took me a lot of tries and got me a bit frustrated, but that's all. The rest are just fine.

The game has a time trial mode, which is kind of a dead giveaway that it's not a long game. But if you're into trying to beat your personal best time, that would be for you.

So in conclusion, this was a great, short game. I wouldn't mind paying like 5 bucks for it, but I woulnd't pay any more. It's just not enough gameplay to be worth more imho."
14001,"This game is glorious, I bought it out of the blue with some extra cash not knowing anything about the game and I didn't even read the reviews. I love this game to death, the levels are challenging, the story is good OH MY GOD THE FEELS. But it's kinda hard to get attached to characters because it doesn't last long, but I guess you get what you paid for. I highly recommend this."
14002,"One of the Best Adventure Games I have ever played ! The scenery is breathtaking, the effect are so beautiful I had to take a lots of screenshots of them.
_GOOD:
-Awesome mechanics, like grappling, superjumps, boosts, etc.
-Cool storyline. It can hit you right in the feels sometimes.
-Beautiful graphics, effects, animations.
_BAD:
-Very short. I could play a game like this for days, but it only lasted about 3 hours :("
14003,"This game is amazing. Though, it's a bit short... The storyline is fantastic as well as gameplay. Truly a unique game that I enjoyed every minute of."
14004,"This game is the most calming Beautiful Game i have ever seen and perfectly demonstraits how wild the human imagination can go and how amazing jumping around can be

8.5 / 10
one of my all time fovorites."
14005,"Like some said before, a simple yet challenging beautiful game. Grab it you surelly won't regret. Very nice, thanks yo guys and congrats. Hopefully we'll have a second one coming! who knows :)"
14006,"Great game. It's like somebody reworked Myst and Amerzone, and added zelda grappling hooks. Amazing."
14007,"[h1] A very worthy game (9.5/10) [/h1]

For a game that wasn't too long and with subtle story it is well worth. This would specially be very educational for young minds with a sense of adventure and puzzle solving with a hint of daring persistent personality. I throughly felt contempt after finishing it and I don't mind playing a sequel as well. The graphics weren't the best (needs more polishing) but for the budget the developers have done exceptionally well (quite beautiful and I love the feeling of looking into abyss). Also the control mechanism is absolutly flawless. The best aspect of the game is, it made me feel like a kid again.

I'd pledge in a heartbeat if there is a Kick Starter for a sequel. Having said that, please maintain the originality and the adventurous nature."
14008,"If you like jumping puzzles in lush environments, I would be hardpressed to find a reason to not pick this up during a great sale."
14009,"This is a really really well made game. A rich story that sucks you in and has you wanting to find out how it ends. Game mechanic of flying around makes you feel like a boss. I also appreciate the length - long enough to get very difficult, but it does not wear out its welcome. 

I would totally pay full price for this."
14010,"A story about my uncle first came to my attention when I noticed two things from the trailer. It was a first person game without a gun in anywhere in sight, and  is that platforming? Usually when you mention Platforming,  you think of games like Mario, Mario, Mario, and Mario. Alright there's plenty of other platformers out there that aren't mario. Without mention mario again, there's Little big planet, supermeat boy, freerunners, Fez, Limbo, braid and ""I wanna be that guy"" take the cake for this generation of modern platformers. And fangames, can't forgot those.

Games like these usually get one simple idea in your head in the first few minutes. ""I'm dying alot..."" Skill is the one thing  games like these demand, and of course trial and error. Which is what most games lack now a days, inorder to help sell their products, and I don't really blame them, but doesn't mean I have to like it. I expected more from an indie title and  unfortunately this is where ""A Story About my Uncle falls victim to right off the bat, with the first and second part of the story. The game holds your hand as you try to complete the next jump, making it rather unchallenging about going through the first few levels. The idea of a well structed level design is there, its just excuted poorly, making me think either it was because they were lazy or in a rush. Or perhaps it was purely intentional, Because in the last act and level of the game, things finally do become somewhat challenging which I'll get to later. 

I'm a little kid again... thats what I first thought of myself as I was jumping and swinging around in the first few levels, but then the main characters narrative kept reminding that I'm in the past. I'm consstantly reminded that he's just telling a story to his kid inorder to help her fall asleep. The beginging of the game excuted my imagination as a kid fairly decent, only to be ruined by the questionable plot points in the story where things start to get a little ridicdious once you start to think about it, and the constant cut scenes where the main character starts talking, ruins and breaks the illusion that I'm playing as kid, when they could've just mentioned that part in beginging, only for me to forgot about it later. 

The story is okay, nothing too complicated, it's simple and obivious by the beginging, and by the title of course. However towards the end, I felt alittle cheated as if I had gone through all that for a simple pat on the back, with some small uninteresting dialouge and being rushed home. Basiclly like having sex, and the person you're with telling you get off because they already finished before you and thus satisfied. 

Now I did enjoy the game to a degree, it was admitly fun having the ability to reach long distances with this suit that grants you Tarzan parcoring abilities without the climbing portion. The game failsto change things up enough with  the exception of one or two occasions was this idea taken further, the potenial for an even more fun and enjoyable level design was missed, you can only jump and swing from rock to rock for so long, While the setting may change, the basic simple now jump on this wall, now swing off these rocks becomes too repetitive, where at least in other games, the frequent  challenging levels is what keeps me or anyone coming back. And it finally did, in the third act. So much I almost raged at certain parts, but I was also happy because now they finally make it harder, more difficult. and  rage indusing. I remember remember dying a number of times at one point where I was asking myself do I suck or is the game finally starting to wake up. It had earlier but died down.

You only fight one boss in the game, which was a breeze, but I loved how it finally through me off from the repeititve level design that I had to endure until then. I would've like to have seen at least one or two more bosses, but one could suggest the final act was final boss. 

In the end I feel the game could've had more to offer, but it just offered below my expectations. The games has achivements and side challanging yourself scenarios, but I could myself ask to make things harder on my own without being asked or suggested to.  I really appericate the developers and the folks behind this game for their effort and I wouldn't mind at all seeing what they come up with next. Hopefully next time it won't feel rushed, and it'll be game I and many other will always remmeber.                         3/5

I'm neutral about recomending this, if its on sale get it, if not well there's other games out worth your time. Portal, Portal 2, the talos Principle and the much anticipated game from the creator of Braid, which I forgot the name of."
14011,"Glitch with the audio, I adjusted it for one time and it kept moving whenever the mouse is moved. Even when you shut the option, it still moved with the mouse. After closing the game and returning, it still had no music even though its max. All that happen when I started adjusting the freaking music to hear the freaking collecting items. Solved the audio probrlem when I had to restart the whole level.

The rock edges are my wores enemy in this game. Sometimes you reach them and mostly you don't. Found myself stuck between rocks from time to time and used the grab or the boots to release myself.

Midcore game with mdicore story and some glitches, nothing interesting. Pick it up on sale only ONLY, if you wanna try a platforming game from a first person prespective."
14012,"Short game, but fantastically done. There's no real violence in the game. Just you, some beautiful and imaginative locations, and fairly good platforming. It's a nice change of pace, and I can't recommend it enough."
14013,I'm 2 hours in and still loving this game. The envirnoment has a very stylish and colorful charm around it. The platforming is very smooth and enjoyable.
14014,"""A Story About My Uncle""  is a very short indie game, about 3 hours long, but it does not dissapoint during that short durration.  The game has you grappeling fom point to point, going at fast velosities at times, and solving the platforming puzzles while going at those speeds, which was a blast (Don't worry, like ""LIMBO"" it's a trial and error game, meaning that you can restart at the last checkpoint if you mess up.)  The graphics are an artform in of itself, and the story got me right in the feels.  The only thing I would dislike about the game was the voice acting of some of the characters are bad, ,and some character models aren't really moving around that mutch when on screen, but dosen't in any way affect the gameplay.  Overall, I enjoyed the game, and recomends to anyone who wants to play platformers like this.

NOTE 1: Haven't Tried the speedruns just yet, but I will soon enough.
NOTE 2: (+) means that the Pros/cons outway it's counterpart

8.5/10

PROS (+)
+Graphics and Level Design
+Heartwarming/Amazing Story
+Platforming Gameplay

CONS
-Voice Acting can be a bit Iffy at Times
-Character Models not Really Life-Like at Times"
14015,AMAZINGNUSS. MUST HAVE!
14016,A story about my uncle has a great storyline awesome graphics a cool art style and is overall amazing 10/10
14017,"I don't usually bother writing reviews, but I just had to say something about this game. 

It' not very long (easily completed over the course of a couple of hours), however it's an absolutely beautiful game, and a genuinely challenging platformer. The story is charming, as are the characters (brief though their appearances are), and the game play gradually shifts and changes from level to level, keeping things interesting without throwing too much at you at once.

I'm not sure I would have been as pleased if I'd paid full price for the game, since, as I said, it's not very long- But if you happen to see it on sale, it's definitely worth picking up."
14018,"I Loved the story of this game, but it was a bit short.




My Name Is Jeff."
14019,GRAPPLE ALL THE THINGS!!!!!!
14020,"wow what can i say about this game well theese things 
PROS:
- An intruiging plot. Good, I repeat GOOD characters. 
- Breathtaking visuals
- Imaginative world.
- Not a big learning curve.
CONS:
- Physics takes some geting used.
- Animation in the villages isnt the best. For instance lip syncing and the walking of the villagers could be better.
-TOO SHORT took me a little less than 3-4 hours to beat. THIS GAME IS TO GOOD TO BE THAT SHORT!

The price is extremely reasonable. And although I bought it on sale I would drop 13 dollars on this game in a heartbeat."
14021,"So glad I got this when it was on sale for $3.24. I played for about 5-7 minutes then got stuck when it wants you to power jump while sprinting. I keep getting close and can't do it. Tried for 30 minutes and even watched some walk throughs to follow them. I'm convinced it's nearly impossible. If it's this hard and frusterating in the begining of the game, I don't think I'll like the rest of it IF I can even get past that part. Def. not recommended if you don't want to get really frusterated."
14022,"This isnt just a game its a jurney. I spent over 3 hours finishing this game and it was the best time i had in a game for a very long time its sorry driven and its emotional beautiful and simple finaly no killing no shooting just an amazing fun experience. A must try
"
14023,"Short but fun. There is a story and narration, although pretty bad, but without it the game would just be too silent. This is the game for people who want freedom of movements, levels are linear but have slightly different ways to go forward.

The most fun aspect is simply going wild and running/flying as fast as possible. Beautiful scenery and fun challenges and level design. Great casual game, but may not be worth the full price"
14024,"I saw this game on the weekly sales, and I had heard about it before, so I thought I would give it a try. ¬£2.49 for such an excellent game was definitely worth it :) love the gameplay, story and mechanics. 10/10 would buy again"
14025,"This game is so awesome,the story was great and the weird frog people and the suit and and the crystal.But there's some raging moment when you can't swing to certain parts but all in all it's a great challenge.I hope there's a sequel i wanna see how the frog people have developed and what happen to maddie:3"
14026,it is an awesome game totaly worth the money ƒ± love it. recomended for all you will love it.The gameplay the story is just awesome
14027,NOICE!
14028,"The Good: The story is great, everything looks magical and beautiful, and the gameplay is actually challenging. Overall, one of those nice, single player games that you can get easily get hooked on.

The Bad: While the game little by little introduces new stuff for the player to use, it's not enough to make a game of 'The Floor Is Lava' interesting for 3 hours. The last level felt the worst, I was dragging on just for the story at that point.

The Ugly: Now that I've finished the game, there's something to said about unlockables in single player, story only games. UNLOCKABLES =/= REPLAY VALUE. Going through a story, but only scouting full levels for collectibles, or following along wih a youtube video for a good hour isn't fun, and in no way encourages anyone to replay the game. 


7/10, take the platforming with a grain of salt when it becomes too much."
14029,Very good Gameplay
14030,"A pretty heartwarming puzzle-platformer that I would describe as short, but sweet. You can finish this game in under 2-3 hours. The platforming takes getting used to, but it's relatively easy to learn within a few attempts at it. It is priced well, but when it goes on sale, it's definetely a steal."
14031,"A very short game; about 2.5 hours for a full playthrough of the story.  Very beautiful environments, good narration, touching story, and a unique take on the puzzle platformer.  Includes unlockables and time trials which I'm sure are meant to extend the playtime beyond what the main story brings.  

Overall well worth the money.  I do not regret my purchase."
14032,"A first person platformer with low gravity, long jumps, and grappling-hand-laser-beam where you jump, fly, swing, and grapple between floating platforms. The environments look beautiful, taking you into caves, over botomless pits, and through wide open skies. The platforming is a lot of fun, with only a handful of frustrating parts. It's a little short, and the few NPC animations and models look pretty amateur, but that's unimportant. The bedtime-story plot is cute and the gameplay itself is great.

Oh, also the Achievements are actually difficult. No handouts here. Good luck with those perfect levels and speedruns. I love the game but I don't have the patience to try and chieve it out."
14033,"The graphics are so beautiful, the music score is humble and delicate and filled with emotion. The story, maybe a bit brief, was very emissive and compelling, it really made you want to go further. The puzzle solving and platforming is challenging but not at all frustrating. Truly a game worth owning, and a bit of evidence making Coffee Stain one the best indie dev's out their."
14034,"Great game, it has better potential for its mechanics and design. Hope for a sequel. 
A must have for who like Parkour with jumping and flying through a beautiful world.

+ Good mechanics, jumping, grappling hook and flying.
+ Solid gameplay, animation and great graphics.
+ Good level design.
+ Nice unlockables, Goat mode.
+ Very good atmosphere, you feel like you are part of the world.


- It get frustrating sometimes, but its part of the challenge point.
- Its very short, only 6 beautiful levels.

here are some suggestions for the game:
http://steamcommunity.com/app/278360/discussions/0/619573787333625038/

there is a Reset Button, F7 rebind it to R ,so you can restart faster if you fail.
I will update this review later with more details."
14035,"A neat little physics based adventure story. A little short, and not much replayability, but still a nice little game. 

8/10"
14036,"It's a short and sweet game in which you explore a fantasy world by grappling around floating platforms.

Gameplay:
+Unique and interesting.
-Difficult and awkward to manuever.
-Bad pacing. Some levels drag on too long and begin to feel tedious.
-Bad level design. Many platforms like very similar and it's easy to get turned around.

Story:
+Simple and pleasant.
-Anticlimatic resolution.
-Bad voice acting."
14037,"This game is amazing,  it provided a challenge but a challenge that wasnt too hard. the story itself is amazing and the mechanics work very well. the controlling is good. the entire game itself is, once again, amazing. highly reccomend it. buy this shit"
14038,"This is a game with a few simple mechanis quite well put together, if you want to master all the levels it can be quite challenging. Recommended if you like platformer puzzlers as it does involve some twitch elements"
14039,"While a fun foray into an imaginative world, A Story About my Uncle didn't go the distance for me. The mechanics were interesting, to say the least. The gameplay itself was the main reason I was so interested in purchasing it. However, the story was so amazingly short that I completed the game in 3 sessions or less, if memory serves.

Pros:
+ Very fun exploration mechanics.
+ Beautiful Environments, highly immersive
+ Dat eye monster tho

Cons:
- Pretty darn short.
- Some areas are very annoying in terms of difficulty (this may or may not have been addressed by updates from Coffee Stain)
- Ending could have been more interesting. 

If you really love atmosphere in games, and you don't mind the price for the time you'll get out of it, A Story About My Uncle just might be right for you. 

Final thoughts:
It could have more replayability if you're a gamer who loves to collect secrets, or obtain some hard-earned 'cheevos.

8/10 wish it was longer."
14040,"This game has an atmosphere that makes me want to play right after a warm shower with a glass of hot coacoa during a winter night . It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling on the inside , and has a nice storytelling type thing going on . Idk has a lot off people that dont like it but for me its just relaxing and comfortable. might not like it as much as i did but at least give it a try."
14041,"wow.  just wow.  an awesome game with unique way for flying between playforms.  11/10 definatley worth the money.  i feel like they could get more games out of it, in the froms of prequals and i would buy them all.

good work dev's 

the voice acting was awesome but i felt like the carecter animations were a little off but that is the only bad thing i have to say about this game.  it is quite short though it is worth it."
14042,"A fun and heart touching platforming game. Not much in intricacy but has flowing/forgiving platform mechanics and an amazing atmosphere via the ambient music, immense game environment and interesting visuals. Definitely worth the pickup if you're looking for a relaxing game that you can just sit down and enjoy."
14043,"I'm not sure how long this game is, but from what I've played so far, I've enjoyed thoroughly. Sort of puzzle and platformer based, and the story is pretty interesting. When you get stuck in certain areas due to missing a grapple (which happened easily with me) the narration stops for a while until you reach a new location. Overall, I found the game mechanics to work fine. Definitely worth checking out."
14044,AIGGHTY.....FOR A GAME THAT BARELY CLEARS TWO HOURS.
14045,"One of the best indie games I've played. Fantastically fun game mechanics, decent story line,  and a wonderfully weird world that is visually pleasing. Well worth the 15 bucks imo. Far surpassed my expectations of it ending with my character confused and scared in the corner of a dimly lit game room."
14046,"8/10

worth taking a look at,
sometimes really hard levels  
beautiful soundtrack"
14047,Overall a great game.  Little bit short but beautiful and simple game mechanics make this game a fun and relaxing way to play some of your day away.
14048,A story about my uncle is a beautiful first person platformer. As you jump around in the world you get a real sense that you are moving to great heights.
14049,Great atmosphere and really addicting story. It's an indie platformer with a new cool element.
14050,.
14051,"A fun little game that unfortunately got overlooked by most.  It's a solid first person platformer with a neat gimmick (a grappling beam) and a fantastic visual style.  It's a little rough around the edges and parts of it definitely feel amateurish (particularly the voice acting), but it's also clear a lot of passion was put into this game. Definitely worth the $3.25 sale price."
14052,"BEST BEDTIME STORY EVER!

This game is a wonderful story with touching dialouge and a cast of sweet characters. Combined with fun swinging mechanics and beautiful scenery this game is a great joy. I reccomend it to those looking for a fun game with a great story."
14053,"ASAMU is a tale of loss and coping, wrapped up in a bedtime story. The protagonist, as a little child, creates an entire imaginary universe with floating rocks, beautiful landscapes and even frog people! As he is telling the story, you get to play it out in this universe with a suit that lets you grapple and jump to go vast distances.

The game might be a bit challenging but never to the point of frustration; It always manages to be fun. My only complaint is that I wanted to keep exploring the world *so much*, yet it was over in ~3 hours."
14054,"A Story About My Uncle is a game like never seen before for the ''love'' story about what adventure is LIFE...4 hours of pure atmospherical and intense gaming.

7/10"
14055,"A wonderful world and platforming system rife with potential is ruined by bad voice acting, poor writing, and above all, a platforming system that is finicky, inconsistant and simply frustating to use."
14056,Heart warming.
14057,"Short, sweet, and definitely on point. I've been waiting to pick up A Story About My Uncle for some time now, and I'm glad to say that I finally did. For what you pay for, this game is immensely engaging and has tons of replay value. Anyone who enjoys perfecting platforming runs will be sure to be at this game for a while trying to gather all of the achievements for efficiency.

On top of that, it's got a good, heartfelt story that is a sharp contrast to the cookie-cutter narratives that plague Indie games nowadays. By the end of the game you love the characters and don't want to see them go.

And lastly, this game is downright gorgeous. Coffee Stain knows what makes a beautiful environment and they took that and ran with it when they published A Story About My Uncle. It is optimized and smooth, and won't disappoint you.

Overall, I highly recommend this game for fans of the indie and platforming genres. It's well worth the price you pay."
14058,"welp, it took me two hours to beat this game twice, once normally with exploring and the second time speedrunning, fun gameplay and good visuals but falls a bit short"
14059,"It's a short game. And I looooove short games! 
But it isn't THAT short, if you like the amazing landscapes just stop and enjoy. 
You can play it in 1 day and rush it yes.. But it is not made to rush it, you've to enjoy every second of this game.
Also you have to rember it's an Indie game that was only made by 12 people, they made it so detailed and good, 
how could you ever expect it's more than a week of gameplay?
There are many full price (around 50 ‚Ç¨/$) that I enjoyed less than this.
Sould you buy it?: 
If you like jump-and-run, breathtaking amazing landscapes and a beautiful nice story that is not too long: 11/10
If you only love jump-and-runs: 8/10
If you like short games: 9/10
If you like beautiful landscapes: 10/10
If you only focus on the story 6/10 (it's good but short and not really ground breaking)
If you like high end graphics 8/10 (it's not high end, but it's detailed and beautiful)
For an Indie game it is absolutely unbelievable good, my rating: 98/100"
14060,"Overall this is a really good game, it has god beatiful environments and the concept is brilliant. However the game is a little short (3hrs played start to finish while taking my time) and the game needs to have its difficulty smoothed out a bit, with a more progressive difficulty (too easy in the first 3/4 of the game and then the difficulty jumps up a lot in the last part of the game). Another thing to note is though the overall story is very nice, the script/narrative feels forced with phrases that are unnatural.

Overall Game: 8/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Difficulty: 3/10
Sound/music: 8/10
Story: 6/10
Controls: 10/10
Length: 4/10

14061,A pretty unique story and gameplay/mechanics that are quite captivating.
14062,Short but highly enjoyable game !
14063,"This game is amazing. Great story, amazing graphics that can run even on my shitty laptop 610m, there is nothing bad about this game!"
14064,"I just finished the story for the game, it is fantastic, it is short, but towards the end it is a little sad. I have played it almost non stop since I got it

Published by the creators of sanctum 1 and 2, as well as Goat simulator. It gets harder towards the end, but never enough to quite frustrate you. I have yet to try for some of the extra challenges and time trials, but I imagine those are reasonably difficult, especially the later game sections."
14065,Awesome platformer. It has a kind of odd story but the environment looks great and the gameplay is fun.  definatley worth it.
14066,"A beautiful woven sweet if yet short game that seems to bring a sense of amazement and wonder to these fingers and these eyes as I play this. Honestly it feels a bit too fast and too short, it would be great to expand more upon it story wise. Overall, it was a lovely enjoyable experience filled with puzzle solving, adventure and fun filled amazement! The game also pits you into finding details to piece together to get much out of the backstory and the relationship between the uncle and the nephew. Eitherway, its an experience you must try at least once! Think of it as an interactive film which doesn't let you move at a snail's pace."
14067,"Fun little platform puzzler. Some nice graphics. Frustrating at times. Soaring through the air is great fun once you get the hang on it. Especially the outdoor level has a great feeling about it.

In relation to the rest it's getting kinda hard at the end. Do you remember the people complaining about the difficulty of Psychonauts' Meat Circus? Like that."
14068,"This game is visually pleasing, and all around has a nice feel to it. The game play is fun, and the over all mechanics and presentation is very nice. The only complaint i have is the ending. I'm not gonna say what it is, but it's not great.

Over all, a good game to play if you're into movement based games."
14069,"Lovely little game, it had its frustrating moments but well worth a look into. It's quite relaxing just soaring through the air grappling, jumping and running from one platform to another. It has lovely graphics and felt quite magical"
14070,Beautifully frustrating 10/10
14071,"Pros: 
Great Visuals 10/10
Fun/solid gameplay
simi difficult levels
Unique 

Cons: 
VERY SHORT! (33mins took me to go through)
Fish People are fucking stupid
Ending gave me cancer
"
14072,"My Experience with ASAMU is not the first time, as I remember playing the old free to play thing from their website. Due to the lack of any game that resembles ASAMU (at least that I know of), I'll compare it to the old ASAMU.

The first thing that I notice is the change of story and the cutscenes. They don't have that stuff back in the day, and I personally welcome the addition. The only thing that kind of disappoints me is the lack of emotion during the story-telling of main character to her daughter. I get it that story was never the strong part even in old ASAMU, but if they really want to take the game into storry-telling direction they can at least make the story-teller a little bit more... Expressive. This doesn't affect the natives as they are not human to begin with, so I give them a benefit of the doubt by assuming they have different culture.

The second thing that is noticeable is the change of maps, which is pretty minor. They also make the town a lot bigger and vibrant than the old ASAMU so there is that.

As far as music goes, I think they are hit and miss, the music in sanctuary is really good and fit the atmosphere while the city didn't.

The biggest upgrade is probably in the graphical and setting department. This is welcomed as setting is non-existant in the older one. As far as graphical update goes, it is really good. The saddest thing that comes to my mind are several graphical glitches, which are more prominent compared to old ASAMU.

The question now is should you buy this game? Yes is my answer. It brings something fresh to the whole first person gaming market and as one of the pioneer(?) it is pretty impressive.

ALSO IT IS THE CLOSEST FIRST PERSON SPIDERMAN SIMULATOR THAT WE CAN GET UNTIL MARVEL SOMEHOW DOES THAT-

i cri evrytiem"
14073,"I am torn between recommending this game or not. It's a real mixed bag. Incredible graphics; reasonably fun first-person platforming with some nice mechanics (although rather limited in variety); and ok sound design. The story and the voice-acting are just HILARIOUSLY bad though. If there was an option to disable all dialogue, I would have used it."
14074,"A nice, if short game.

It's got great grappeling machanics, and the scenery is gorgeous.  The characters are modelled rather poorly, though.  Everything else is great.

The story was a refreshingly positive affair.  Perhaps a little simple, but I enjoyed it all the same.

Worth picking up."
14075,"Disclaimer: review copy provided by the developer.

This is a first-person platformer about exploring fanciful environments by making epic leaps and swinging through the air with the greatest of ease. The bedtime story style in which the game is presented allows the developers to create imaginitive settings that are a joy to explore. The main path is linear, but there are secrets to be found, some of which add little tidbits to the story -- the daughter asks about some side detail not related to the main storyline, and the dad answers.

There's no fighting in the game. Instead it's all about enjoying the scenery you're traveling through, while traveling in ways impossible in real life. It's a fantasy in every sense of the word, and one that I really enjoy."
14076,"This game was quite fun. I enjoyed it, it's impressively-scaled jumping puzzles, characters, and amazing environments. However, the game was quite punishing of mess-ups with it's high-momentum formula, and it was sometimes very hard to get it right, especially in later levels. Some of the final challenges took me FOREVER to beat, and they were so frustrating. There was this EXACT way you had to go about it, and I couldn't quite get the timing of the grapples right. However, when I finally did beat it, it felt SO GOOD to know I'd never have to go through that again. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, too. However, I still enjoyed the game enough to reccomend it, even with it's few end-game frustrations."
14077,"Beautiful Scenary, beautiful soundtrack, great story. Overall it's a great game that can combine relaxed gaming session with a puzzle."
14078,"A really nice little game, that doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Essentially a first person platformer with a grappling hook, a jetpack, and a simple story.  Worth a look."
14079,"An enjoyable, albiet short, bedtime story that a father tells his son. The story is about the Father's Uncle, who is an inventor/scientist. You don't have many options, but the game is fun mainly because of the originality of the story. 
7/10 would play again."
14080,"its a good experience. All be it a short one.  But i am not sure i would say its a good game. The world is pretty but the people models look mediocre to say the least. Some of the challenge comes from the inconsistency in the physics but its a fun kind of challenge most of the time. The way you move about feels good and the overall Storybook feel to it has a ton of charm. Rich and vibrant colors and good sound design leaves you with a good feeling all the way trough as well. Or well that is untill you get stuck at a part. 
You also have the ability to try speedrun versions of the stages and there are collectibles to find in each part of the game, that unlocks things for you to play around with. Which gives it a little bit of replayability.
All in all i would say its worth the money, i got it on a sale myself and i almost felt bad about it after i finished it."
14081,"The game is rather fun. It gets a bit tedious, though, because most of the environments just feel like they put a new skin on the place you just came from. The voice acting isn't very good but I enjoyed the story and the point of view was interesting. It's a very fun and enjoyable platformer that I think is worth the price, just add some variety in any future installments. Putting inexplicable floating rocks from the dark cave into the ice cave doesn't make the ice cave feel unique, and putting said inexplicable floating rocks into the inexplicably-floating city made of trash doesn't make it feel unique either."
14082,"ASAMU is wonderful to put it bluntly.

Puzzles feel well thought out and challenging without being overwhelming, I found myself trying over and over to do what seemed relatively easy at first glance, and the rewarding feeling after you figure it out is amazing. I spent 2 hours playing this game, and I definitely feel as though I got what I paid for and then some."
14083,"good game overall. The platforming mechanics work very well and are not overly punishing. The story is well written and the sceneries are gorgeous. Only thing is the main story is a little on the short side but there is tremendous replay value for the speedrunners and achievement hunters out there.

14084,it's close to as good as Portal 1/2 i think i dont need to say more so buy for it's really AAA and fun too
14085,"-* 7/10 *-

It's an interesting game, with innmersive mechanics and playability. A First Person Platformer, with a great effect for speed and vertigo, and it keeps you hooked. The story is a bit short but very engaging. For an extra challenge you can try to get the achievements wich will keep you playing for some time."
14086,"Yeah the game is a great expirience if your loking into wacky games like i do. Its graphics are nice and the plot is set quite nice. Frustrating at times but a very nice game. The 20% Cooler refrence kinda put me off about the game now knowing that the game creator is a brony (no hate) but the game is really good but there was one million other jokes you could have made for that moment you had to make the 20% cooler reference XD or perhaps it was a coincidence. But to be honest i wouldnt have got this game without the coupon, even if i noticed it and it was kinda cool the 66% off was what made the game nice. And dont hate on the game too much it seems like it had alot of effort put into itand is a game that steam gives free coupons for it. 

10/10 -IGN Would drugs again"
14087,"Most fun I've had in hours!

14088,"This game has a captivating atmosphere that sucks you right into it. The environments are beautiful, however the animations and NPC:s leave much to be wanted. The game took about 2 hours to play through but offers a few extras such as time-trials. I really liked this game and will not forget it any time soon, but I would recommend you to wait for a sale or something since ‚Ç¨13 is a bit beefy for a short game like this one."
14089,"Hmm, I have mixed feelings about this game.
The visuals are stunning (I play on max settings so don't know what the graphics are like on low/medium). The world is just beautiful (the foliage in particular) and as far as platform games go, the idea of this game is quite fun.

However, there are two main downfalls of this game:

1) It is extremely short! With only six levels taking approximately 15-20 minutes (if that) to complete the first time round. The majority of people writing reviews have completed the game in just 2 or 3 hours.

2) The game gets VERY repetitive very quickly; the gameplay is almost (if not) identical in each level and there isn't a large enough variety of modes to support more types of gameplay, multiplayer for example.

So if you love games made to look beautiful, by all means try this game out, but don't expect to ever play it again after your first completion of the game (I who have OCD about getting every achievement for every game am even struggling to find the motivation to play this game again for as long as it takes).
But if you want a game you won't get bored of easily, has masses of content and you'll want to play for more than a few days (which is the majority of gamers), I wouldn't recommend this game."
14090,It was fantastic in alpha and it really shines after release. This is an amazing platform puzzler with varying challenges ranging from the tutorial simple though to expertly weaving through multifaceted puzzles. Highly recommended!
14091,"""Something, something about an adventure.""

The dialouge doesn't lie, this game is an adventure. A beautiful, well made adventure, however short it may be.

I've spent quite some time with the game, doing three full runs and looking in every nook and cranny for any optional story tidbits and seismograph-things, and I have to say I've come out feeling like the game was worth my money.

The gameplay is enjoyable and new, (at least for me) and I love the first person perspective's way of making me feel like I'm at near cruising altitude while swinging over the cloudline, or a dark cave's unknown depths.

The story is quick, but then again the game is as well. I liked the co-protagonist's personality. Adventurous, fearless... or at least we're told.

She even is okay with risking her life to challenge you to try to get through an area without using the grapple device. (And while I'm on the topic she's also quite annoying on telling you that she ""knew you couldn't do it"" when you fail to complete the challenge without saving her life as you fall to your doom.)

While I won't elaborate on the features of the Unlockables that you get from collecting all twenty-five seismograph-things, I will say this; the last one is AWESOME.

If I had to point out some negatives, the character models can be sort of weird to look at sometimes, and during the parts when you have to watch them talk you can just wander away and not look at them and they don't care in the slightest. I sort of wished I could skip the interaction sections while trying to go for the flawless run and the grapple challenge achievements for the areas. 

There's also the MASSIVE difficulty spike in the final level, which I was not expecting, but the hardest challenge there has been patched to let people flow through it easier. (Lifesaver for the low framerates I had been dealing with from time to time.) But that's really all I can remember that I straight-up disliked.

A Story About My Uncle is one of the best platformers I've played, and a good change of pace from the standard formula. The ending left me wanting more, and believe me, going for gold on the time trials?

I'll be with this for QUITE some time.

8.7/10"
14092,A very fun platforming game with a cute plot and *mostly* non frustrating gameplay.
14093,"Great Game!
Amazing Story!
Got it for 60% off!

10/10 Would play as Spidermans son again!"
14094,"A Story About My Uncle was a great, short, first-person platformer that was an absolute blast to soar through. Check out my full review on [url=http://epicbrew.net/2014/10/31/a-story-about-my-uncle-review/] Epic Brew. [/url]"
14095,"This game is great.

Sure,it was a PAIN going through all those challenging levels,all those falls , all the frustration.
But I've come to realize that it's probably reflecting use on the story of our lives.
Just like in the game,we can have no perfect runs,we have our falls and our sucesses.
And I recommend this game because of the little boy's journey to find his uncle,of the otherworldly places he has traveled ,of him having shared this journey with his friend.
The ending was sad.I really didn't expect something like that to happen.It leaves you wondering.Did that really happen or not,this great journey?
It's hard to say.

This was a great journey, a great story. A Story About My Uncle.
"
14096,It's such a great experiance. Thank you Coffee Stain.
14097,"This one is for the 1st-person platformer masochists. You know who you are, you don't deserve clear level design."
14098,"4 out of 5

A Story About My Uncle is a first-person sci-fi fantasy platformer that focuses on simple yet enjoyable mechanics: run, jump, grappling hook, and rocket boots. The player is placed in the shoes of a father telling his daughter the adventure he had as a young boy in search of his uncle, an adventurer who had gone missing. The young boy came upon a intriguing mechanical suit that fit him and a launch pad that propelled him into a world full of wonder, intrigue, and a lot of floating rocks.

The good:

The environemt is really well-made and offer enough variety to let you forget that you are in caves 80% of the time. There were standard caves, dark menacing caves with glowing plants, ice caves, caves of floating villages, and caves of artifacts from another time. All caves were enormous, big enough to contain a whole city and then some. 

The art style leans toward cartoonish but fits quite well with the fantasy setting that requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (floating rocks, duh). 

The sound and music were well-done and serve the mood of the game nicely. 

The dialogue, though few, was quite decent and the voice-acting was excellent. 

And the mechanics are very polished and together the setting, the art style, the music, the sound, and the gameplay made up a very immersive experience. It is hard not to feel the pounding of your heart as you run, jump, grapple and slinghshot yourself through various terrain with incredible speed. The rush is there, but gravity never did forget you. I remember countless times where I miss the right timing to connect my grapple then look up as all rocks around me shoot up, the wind swoosh by. and everything fade to black.  

The bad:

While the mechanics were quite good. There were definitely a few places in the game where I felt there could be more  cues as to what can be connected with the grapple. In one instance I was supposed to connect to the stalacites on the cave ceiling to swing myself across, but no sound or environmental cues were provided. And I felt frustrated as I tried to super-jump myself across but inevitably fell to my miserable death every time. At another time, there were these glowing crystals where the player is supposed to use in mid-air to charge the grappling hook and further the swinging distance, but for a quite a few of them no matter how close I get no charging was possilbe. And so I had to plan my route not using them. Note that these frusrating intances are far and few in between, and the developer are still releasing patches, so I remain hopeful that they will be fixed in due time.

final words:

If you are looking for a neat game you can enjoy in an afternoon, and the idea of being Tarzan swinging in fantastical caves intrigues you, then consider ""A Story About My Uncle."" It is an atomoshperic, narrative-driven experience that takes you away to a different world one swing at a time."
14099,"I LOVE this game. Soaring through the sky for miles at incredible speeds is incredibly addictive. Unfortunately it's VERY short, but maybe that's a good thing? I didn't get bored of the great gameplay, although the cave level near the end wasn't quite as fun. The controls are kind of strange at first, but you get used to them quick. One of my favorite games for sure!

Also the story tries too hard to be emotional sometimes, but whatever. The concept and gameplay is great, so forgive the cliched story-telling."
14100,"So relaxing, yet challenging in its own way. A boy searching for his uncle that has been gone for months. open environment and breathtaking leaps and jumps. Fully voiced story and beautiful colors."
14101,Really a nice (short) game: for me a welcome uplifting adventure and a fantasy world worth dreaming about. Both the setting and the gameplay I would love to see in a larger game.
14102,"Gameplay was great.
Story was a bit childish, but that was the point and it was still pretty well written.
It made for a good game that I could play on my work computer: low requirements and no violence.

I would definitely recommend it for it's unique game play."
14103,"A Story About my Uncle is an unpolished gem among the Steam Library. Though short, poorly textured, and horrible voice acting, the mechanics, scenery, and story outshine all it's flaws.

When I first played through the first level of this game, I was hooked on the grapple system. It was so similar to Spider-man's web-swinging, but it didn't feel as clunky or hard to control as it though. The way it works is you can click any surface within range and draw yourself to it. In addition, you can grapple multiple times before landing, which allows for some interesting parkour throughout the area. Each stunt I pulled with the grapple system /never/ failed to make me feel like I just did something impressive. In addition, the only way you can really die in this game is by falling into the abyss, which I thought made the game that much more relaxing. There were times in the game where it tried to feel a little more dangerous, and beckoned you to move quicker, but it offered nothing to back these claims of urgency up. Just move at your own pace and you'll be fine. Don't get me wrong though, this game has flaws, and lots of them. 

The voice actors are hilariously awful. Hard to listen to at first, but then you start giggling at how terribly they deliver certain lines, and wonder to yourself how they even got into this game. Either the designer didn‚Äôt care, or they must have been personal friends of him/her. Either way, they were difficult to ignore throughout the entire game. In addition, the game‚Äôs graphics are not the best. Minimally-rezzed textures scatter this game‚Äôs landscape, which look really good from a distance, but up close you are painfully reminded this is still an indie game. In fact, some textures in certain parts of the game feel so out-of-place that you end up stopping to tilt your head at it before moving on. (you‚Äôll understand what I mean if you play this game). Luckily, the player models and textures are alright, though some background characters aren‚Äôt even animated, which also makes you tilt your head as you pass them. None of the background characters have any sound either, which is a little creepy. (Or, should I say, none of the background characters have sound that you can understand).

The one thing that really saved this game for me though...was the story. A Story About My Uncle follows the nephew of an esteemed scientists and inventor named Fred (not the most appropriate name, but after remembering this is a children‚Äôs story, you eventually allow it). The nephew, or ‚Äúprotagonist‚Äù searches for his uncle who has been missing for months, only to be thrown into an interstellar adventure to another planet of some kind? What really perplexed me about the story was that the game itself couldn‚Äôt seem to decide whether the events that transpired actually happened... or were purely fictional. The story is told in a hilariously false manner, purposefully stretching the truth left and right only to cover its tracks later to try to pass itself off as a true story. Despite this though, the story was endearing, and left me with a fuzzy feeling inside as I reached it‚Äôs conclusion. The only character that sticks around long enough for you to care about (and the only one that sticks around for more than 90 seconds) is Maddie, who is relatable enough to get attached to through the story. In addition, the lore objects found throughout the game give all the main characters enough depth to care about as well, which I thought was a needed touch.

Overall, A Story About my Uncle is a game that you have to take the good and the bad with. It has just as many flaws as it does strengths, but I loved the grapple mechanic, I loved the concept, and I truly believe this is an indie game worth the money it‚Äôs asking. In addition, I happily await a sequel. (so long as they don‚Äôt use the same actors >_>)
"
14104,"The Game is absolutly fantastice! Not hard but not easy as well! Grab it with the first chance and explore an ""other world"" in a jurney to find  your uncle! It is a bit short (If you dont fall at all , the game is 3 hours around) but still enjoyable !"
14105,This game was an overall fun game with a nice heartwarming storyline and a very ambient feel to the the game. The voice acting was decent but it didn't really take anything away from the game. The music was nice and relaxing as you played through the puzzles and swung from one plateform to another. The style of platforming was something new that i haven't played before and it felt nice and unique to play this game.
14106,"let me get one thing straight...I...LIKE...THIS...GAME!!! if I were to pick just one word to describe this game, it would be: Beutiful...just...the soundtrack, the enviorment, the story, I highly reccomend this game to anyone that knows what a good game is just...not at it's normal price...don't get me wrong, its an amazing game just...its so short...but still, its really amazing...oh...and also there is a goat mode.



8\10"
14107,"It's a very beautiful game. The locations are incredibly good-looking though maybe not that refined, while the story is simple yet touching. The game mechanics is a bit frustrating at times, but when you get the hang of it it becomes really natural - some parts are OHMYGOD so hard that they're going to make you want to bash your head to the screen, but luckily there are only a couple of those.
The achievements are REALLY hard, and they make up the only replay value of this title. Well, if you really want to replay it to admire the lushious environment. All in all, worth a discounted buy."
14108,"This game is a story-driven first person platforming game with super jumping, a grapeling/pulling energy hand, and rocket boots.  The story and art direction is fantastic (differentiated zones and good use of color, lighting, and detail), the platforming is fun, feels like flying, and is challenging at parts.  I stopped playing all other games until I finished this one because it was so good."
14109,"*SPOILER FREE*

The reveal after the caverns:

All I can say is WOW.

Seriously, well done -- that was definitely a well-crafted moment."
14110,"A very unique game that was enjoyable to play while relaxing after class/work. ~4hr completion. The controls (using an xbox controller) were well done, although there was one spot where I switched to mouse/keyboard to get more precision with aiming. The music and level design are really well done, both immersive. The character models are a little mediocre, but there's little interaction with characters in the game anyways.

Ultimately, the end of the game was a little bit of a let down. Would have been cool with a big reveal or twist or.... just something more than what we were left with.

I'd reccomend getting the game on a sale, but probably not at full price."
14111,"Great narration and voice acting, great platforming in general. There's a little spike in difficulty at the end, but it's worth the effort. Overall great game!"
14112,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is an indie title that boasts a magical art style and a simple yet poignant bedtime story format, as told by a father to his daughter. You play as the narrator, a young man who traverses across space to find his uncle, who is presumably doing some sort of insane experiment. Throughout the story, you come across a race of alien people and use your uncle's space suit to explore worlds in a sort of parkour format.

While this game doesn't have so much in terms of puzzles, the challenge lies in being able to catapult yourself across vast spaces using a grappling device and some rocket boots that can be helpful in a jam. While playing through the story, you may find some hidden objects tucked away, which trigger more storytelling opportunities about the backstory of this  man's uncle.

As an indie game, this one fares very well. It has a short story, a handful of different environments, and new powers and tools are introduced in each one. Details are thoughtfully put into all the landscapes you come across, even if they serve no purpose aside from aesthetic appeal. That being said, the game can be a little glitchy. The problem with giving the player so much jumping power is the fact that you can sometimes skip necessary paths that are needed to trigger events, which can lead to some backtracking. Likewise, the freeroaming you are granted is sometimes overwhelming. Grapple points and ledges may be few and far between, leaving you with little knowledge about where to go or how to get there.

Overall a great concept with a solid execution. The sheer abundance of power the player has sometimes allows them to plow straight through important areas without even realizing this, and the development team should have fixed that. Voice acting sometimes gets lazy, but the budding complexity of the characters helps make that. I would really like to see how this game would be improved if it was made by a bigger developer. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes casual games, adventure games, fantastic artwork, and heartwarming stories."
14113,"Pretty good game, addictive , Its so much more better than it looks like( looks pretty fine to me tho)20 hours to pass through the game ,  it is  worth the price. Even if it was the double for the cost I would still buy it anytime."
14114,"This is a really beautifully crafted game.  The story pulls you onward and the environment is intriguing and stunning at the same time.  There's enough challenge navigating your way around plus the bonus unlockables and achievements make this a really fun experience.  Not a game to rush through but one to explore and investigate and generally mess around in with the unique ways of travelling.  Best game I've played for a while for overall enjoyment, 10/10!"
14115,This game is really good in my opinion. It has a peaceful environment and the story is quite decent!
14116,Too short!! too cool !!
14117,Incredible.
14118,"Combine Just Cause 2's gameplay with Dear Esther's breath-taking environments and you get something like A Story About My Uncle. 

The story isn't quite as spectacular as you might think, but it still manages to hold your attention throughout the length of the game. It's very simple and whimsical, like a children's fairytale.

It's incredibly satisfying to swing and leap from one platform to another at high velocity, like a mechanical spider weaving a complex web in the sky. Once you begin playing, you'll lose yourself, mesmerized by the game's beautiful environments and excellent pacing.

This game can be beaten in about 3 hours. There's a time trial mode you can unlock, but that's about it. $12.99 might be a little steep for how short the game is, but I feel that this is definitely a case of quality over quantity. The overall experience of this game is so finely tuned and well-crafted, that I'd find it difficult to justify spending any less for this gem. 

If you're looking for a first-person adventrue game that's different and unique without sacrificing any of its gameplay elements (i.e. Gone Home, Dear Esther) A Story About My Uncle might be just what you're looking for."
14119,"This game is a masterpiece, I haven't completed it yet, but the storyline so far is enjoyable. The graphics are clean, the scenery is beautiful, and the movement is smooth, definitely worth the money.

9.5/10"
14120,"Fantastic and original indie game that brings peace to the soul. These developers deserve a LOT more money for this beautiful creation. What might help make this game more famous is an online racing mode where players compete to reach the end, and whoever falls down gets disqualified. 

The ability to mod maps would also keep me playing forever... and ever... and ever.

It's an idea."
14121,"I wanted to like this game, but it's just lame. The story tries to do about a billion things at once, and none of it really works because of the clunky dialogue and voice acting. 
Swinging around is fun at first, but the level design never really evolves past a bunch of debris floating in a void. The game tries to shake things up near the end by adding a few new mechanics, but by then it's too little too late. It just kinda stops after two hours with a really anti-climatic ending and without any kind of final challenge or buildup. 
Though the environments look nice, even if they're mostly just rock textures floating in the air. But the character models are the stuff of NIGHTMARES!"
14122,"Wow.
Just wow.
i abosolutly love this game.
  ^spelled wrong
Worth every penny."
14123,"A Story About My Uncle is a challenging platforming adventure with tight controls, interesting mechanics and a pretty cool graphical style. While the title might lead you to think this is a story driven game the game's strength is definetly in it's mechanics. There is a story there and while it is an interesting tale I feel like it takes itself a bit too seriously at times and never really uses the setting and premise to it's full potential.

If you want a solid platforming challenge in a cool setting then stop reading and start playing. If you're looking for a masterfully crafted story with bits of gameplay inbetween then you should probably look elsewhere."
14124,"I was attracted to the game because who doesn't love soaring through the air in a beautiful 3D setting? But this is a game that requires two key things for you to master beforehand: your sense of timing and <i>very</i> good depth perception. The platforms' position on your screen can be very misleading and sometimes you can miss your next anchor point in the blink of an eye.

That being said, it's a creative game, even if the story is a bit flat. It's more linear than I would've liked and I feel the game engine even advanced me to one hard-to-reach point out of sheer pity, but it's worth a try at the end of the day, my own frustrations aside."
14125,"amazing game 9/10 great phisycs, some glitches here and there. but over all, its a teriffic game, and i recommend to all."
14126,This game has unique and fresh game mechanics mixed with a charming world. Definitely worth buying.
14127,Awesome game but too short.
14128,"If you like portal, buy this game.

Simple exploration based puzzle game, with a grapple hook mechanic for navigation. It's fairly short, like portal, but I feel like they took advantage of pretty much everything they could do with their puzzle mechanic so it feels complete. The level design is also well done, you always seem to know where to go despite feeling completely lost.

As a bonus, it has a uniquely presented story that creates a world worth checking out that contains characters and life. The voice acting, while not stellar, is pretty good for an indie title."
14129,"I really enjoyed this game and I recommend it to anyone. This is why :

-There are no enemies to kill so hardcore gaming skill is not required. You play to enjoy the experience.
-The graphics are gorgeous and a joy to behold. You visit many varied and creatively built locations, like a dream.
-The controls are really good and easy to understand and learn. My girlfriend has almost zero gaming experience and she could easily play and have lots of fun.
-The game has good flow. It sees you flying through the levels with athletic jumps and swinging with a sci-fi grapple beam. You could build a racing game built around this. The game does slow down for some story though.
-The world really feels alive and its really fun to explore every nook and cranny. There's even secret collectibles that unlock extras! Its also very detailed and you'll be able to get up close to examine or read things.
-The story is good! Its a bit childish and unrealistic (its set up as a bedtime story, after all), but its heartwarming and cute. You can examine certain key objects and you'll get narration about it. The ending was also good and worth the travels. 
-Goat mode. That's right! They made Goat Simulator after all... there's also other unlockables!

The cons :
-Pretty short. I finished the game in one night. However, if you're not used to first-person shooter games (you shoot rocks) it will take you longer.
-The characters are really creepy looking. This is of course a limitation of technology, but since they're like aliens the effect can be seen as intentional. You also cannot interact with any secondary character, breaking the immersion somewhat.
-Very linear. The only side-paths are for secrets. At least you won't get lost.
-Fake areas : in the distance you may see lights and houses, but often they are just decoration and try as you might, you won't reach them. Don't be fooled, this ain't no Skyrim, the world is much smaller than it seems, and its quite disapointing to leave so much unexplored.

Here's hoping that we can revisit this world again in a sequel.

I hoped you enjoyed this review. I give this game a 9/10.

Have fun!"
14130,"I usually don't write reviews, but this game deserves one because I was positively amazed by it. The story is good, the graphics are good, voice acting is good, the environments are awesome, movement is smooth and the game mechanic is very original. It is very nice to fly around with your grapple.

The game is not very long (may be a little longer than Portal), but that's fine, otherwise the game mechanic would get repetitive. The puzzles (actually action puzzles) are not very difficult, so may not appeal to hardcore gamers, but as a veteran casual gamer the difficulty level was perfect for me.

If you like games like Portal, Quantum Conundrum and QUBE, get this game."
14131,"Great game, not that hard but still a really fun game"
14132,"Very unique game. I would also say it has a bit of a puzzle aspect to it, as getting around involves a bit of thought. Haven't finished the game yet, but initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are great; the movement is very slick also. If you are looking for something a bit different, for the price, you can't go wrong with this game. :)"
14133,"Cute story with an interesting framing device. The problem I had was with the controls and the grappling hook mechanic. It is way too clunky, with not nearly enough air control during the pull phase. This becomes a huge problem in later segments of the game and frankly I just gave up after 30 minutes in one single section. Sadly this is the only gameplay this game has and therefore I really can't recommend it. It's a shame too since I was looking forward to this game having played the demo build some years back. It looks like they didn't really know how to develop and tweak their mechanics beyond making everything harder.

Unless you enjoy extremely frustrating first person platforming, avoid this. If the setting/story still interests you, look at a lets play or something, you're not missing anything by actually playing it."
14134,"Good looking, interesting.

Solid mechanics, nice story.

Go play this game.

Jonah Hill"
14135,"Great Game and story, Controls are a little clunky and physics can be a bit weird, but this game is a must own very fun and enjoyable!"
14136,"A Story About My Uncle is a short but literally breath-taking first person platformer using gadgets to your advantage. Nice, relaxing story, amazing visuals and challenging platforming make this worthwhile. It is short, but if you strive for getting all of the achievements I'm sure it'll give you many hours of gameplay."
14137,"This game sounded like everything I could imagine and more- a story driven, relaxing, and touching first person platformer based on problem solving through movement puzzles in a violence free environment. It sounds phenominal, but... doesn't succeed.

Firstly, the game is not story driven, it's a rage game. Later levels are unforgiving and seem designed for the singular purpose of having you die multiple times so that your time in game expands from the hour of actual gameplay there is. That's right- four out of my five gameplay hours were me dying- and I couldn't even finish the end of the final level before shutting off.

Allow me to explain. You have three grapples- no more, and no less. You have to grapple to falling stalagtites- but once you're down to one grapple, you have to grapple one of the crystals on the walls of the hall- this will give you three grapples. However, this means that you fly free for a few moments before you manage to aim at the crystal- many of which are blocked from some angles by objects that'll take your last grapple attempt and allow you to fall and restart the section. After you've refilled the grapples, you have to continue. You have to do this with pinpoint accuracy six or seven times before you land on the ending platform. However, the challenge doesn't stop there. Stone walls lie in your path, forcing you to go higher or lower in relation to the ceiling. Finally, the stalagtites are far enough apart that, unless you launch yourself perfectly from the last grapple, you'll die.

That's the entire game in one paragraph. It's frustrating, and the story is overshadowed with frustration. Not recommended, sadly."
14138,"Uber fun and graphically beautiful. Ranking among the Portals in enjoyability of game-play. Cinematics can feel awkward at times, story is good exuding its delivery. Overall score 93/100."
14139,This a very good story game is rather short but definatley worth the money
14140,"This is a very fun and challenging game that's worth the sale price of 5 dollars. The visuals and game mechanics will keep you entertained but the short game will leave you disapointed if you buy this for 15 dollars. (Canadian $)

Enjoy :)"
14141,"First impression: being beaten about the head and face with delicious mid-'90s Sierra-point-n-click nostalgia by the graphics. The world is beautiful. The mechanics are amazing. I haven't gotten far enough yet to see much of the story (though the ""frog"" egg anecdote is not to be missed) but it's got me hooked. It takes a special platformer to keep me from ragequitting after the 10th time I missed that jump by ~*THIS*~ much, and this is it."
14142,"Quite a pleasant little experience, no real complaints. It's real short, I beat it in under two hours, but it's a really delightful journey, basic writing but utilized well, great mechanics that I only wish they'd delved deeper with. 

If this game had replayability, or some sort of New Game+ which gave the player a new mechanic to experience, it would be completely worth the 14$ price tag, but for what you get, I'd say look for it on sale."
14143,"Very interesting game! This well-designed short game is an excllent platforming game. Using a few simple controls, the game includes somewhat difficult levels that are very well designed for the length of the game. The game's graphics are not demanding on the system and are not high end, but are still brilliantly done and excllent and better than an average short game (however there could be more improvement in character design). Because of the peaceful nature of this game, I'd say it's appropriate for anyone at any age. This game provides a basic story that would appeal to very young gamers but the game itself is great for older gamers as well. I'd reccomend this game to just about anyone who likes platforming games. To sum this up, think Portal but with a grappler and no hostile computer."
14144,"So, I first saw this game a few months ago on Game Grumps/Steam train, and thought it looked pretty cool, but never picked it up. It was on sale a few days ago, so I thought why not. I started it up, it ran great :). The mechanics are super fun, and give you a very good amount of breathing room in the begining to get used to the controls (a weird super jump thing on right click). The story is cute. Its about a kid who went on a huge adventure to this other world to find his uncle, but he is telling it to his daughtor as a bedtime story as an adult. Ocasionally they have little nods of diologue such as her asking about something you've found in the game, like your uncles favorite food. I would have to say, this is the best first person 3D platforming I have ever played. It get a bit challenging in the end, but it's all doable with a few tries. The hardest time I had was getting somewhat lost in a few sections, but each autosave point gives you a general direction to go. Some of the landscapes suprised me. Everything felt huge! In a good way. The ending left me satisfyed and a little sad. It is a very bitter sweet ending that made me even shed a tear or two. If I had to give this game a score, it would probably be 9.5/10. Yes the game is short, and maybe they could have explored the mechanics a bit farther, but what they put together was a beautiful experence that you can have in about 2 hours."
14145,Fun and innovative.
14146,"Great concept, great game-play, good but somewhat childish story. excellent music, beautiful environments and good level design.
The game is a bit on the easy side, and, without rushing, taking my time, I finished it in around 2 and a half hours.
Due the the shortness of the game, not worth 13‚Ç¨, but definitely pick it on sale with a 50% discount or more if you like portal like games."
14147,"I finished it in 2.5 hours. And there were sections I had to replay so it wasn't a speed run. In any case, it was worth it. I got it on sale. It was enchanting. Get it."
14148,"Awesome little game ! I am a fan of first person platformer, and this game does it well !
A graple hook ffs !"
14149,Great game but too short.
14150,"Did you like Portal? Do you want something that makes you forget how weird The Ball was? Have you always wanted to be both Spider-Man and Iron Man at the same time? 
Then do I have a game for you.
Framed as a story being told to the hero's daughter at bedtime, you take control of a memory of a young man searching an alien world for his uncle Fred. Meet cool aliens, swing from rocks, strap on some rocket boots, and eat some tube food! You won't regret this. 
It is a little short, but there's also a Time Trial mode to make up for that."
14151,"amazing game only issue is that there was not more to play 
very easy to be immersed in as well as having some good puzzles to solve 
and an inventive storyline and way of telling it"
14152,"Best game ever, Shutup Haters"
14153,"Game can get so frustrating when you can't solve ""puzzles"". But, it's a beautifully made game and beautiful story. 
Game mechanics very similar to portal minus the gun. And uses the hand device like a grappling hook, so you can fly through the levels like Spiderman.
Wonderful characters and beautifully drawn maps and backgrounds.
Awesome ending. Almost shed a tear. 5/5"
14154,"This game is amazing when i bought this game i knew I was going to like it, I had seen the game grumps play the first level, but I didn't know exactly how much i was going to love it.
This game is a defiant 9/10 the story was excellent, the visuals where gorgeous the only fault was that it ended so quickly.
Needles to say I'm definitely glad I bought this game.
"
14155,This game is kind of amazing. The sheer mechanics of the game are ridiculously fun and the atmosphere is spectacular.
14156,"A relaxing an acoustic game. If you enjoyed portal and you want a similar game to wind you down then this is for you. There isn't much value in the game itself though so make sure to buy it when it is on sale. The biggest problem with this gamis that the narration is done so poorly, like the way fred.... well I can't actually give any examples since it would spoil the whole game but the story should have been told better."
14157,"I came for exploring surreal environments with my grappling hook, but all i got was this lousy puzzle platformer with bad level design (where the fuck do i have to go??), trial and error platforming and upgrades that weren't really exciting at all because the jumping puzzles they are meant to be solved with would only get more annoying."
14158,"Basically it seems to be a Grappling hook driven, racing accross levels with no enemies or fall damage 
Just you and your grappling hook suit, looking for your uncle in these huge beautiful sandbox levels. 
It manages to be enchanting and sublime somehow, like grace made tangible. 
I put in 3 hours before i even knew what was happening! 
The grapple courses are more than just insane.  You need twitch skills on par with Quake 2 just to get through most places.
example:  Grapple 300 feet, turn in mid air, shoot some crystals on the wall to repower your grapple, then turn back and hit the next target with your hook. All within a second or two before you fall into the abyss forever. Good times!"
14159,Beautiful!
14160,"Finished the game without getting a single achievement.

Swell/10."
14161,"FIVE FUCKING LEVELS

JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE"
14162,A neat little narrative platformer that's about the journey rather than the destination. It's less than three hours long but worth picking up in a sale.
14163,"
Fun platformer with a cute story. If it's on sale, I would recommend picking this up."
14164,"This was an awesome game.  Although it was really short (won't take more than 3 hours) and the story/voice acting was pretty terrible and ends rather abruptly, the grappling hook gameplay is incredibly original and I haven't seen anything quite like it before.

If you enjoy first person platforming games like Mirror's Edge and can handle some of the presentation issues that come with an indie budget (mainly just the poor voice acting), this is absolutely up your alley."
14165,A story about my difficulty spike
14166,"OMG, this game is so amazing! I absolutely love everything about it; the artwork and graphics are INSANELY gorgeous, gameplay is fun and challenging, and the dialogue is fun to listen to. If you are a fan of the portal games, you definitely should check this game out. If you like puzzle/platformer games, also way worth your time. By the same guy who did Goat Simulator, btw. Another amazing, out of the park game!"
14167,"Fuckin play this game.

Much,much MUCH better than the shite that we're being bombarded as of late..
"
14168,"Great for anyone who likes a shorter, indie-like story. The game plays really well, looks great and who doesn't love feeling like a year 3000 spiderman?"
14169,Best game I have played this year. Amazing platforming and a story that literally blows away any AAA this year
14170,"This game is absolutely incredible, another game that deserves a place in my 20 favorite games ever, the third from Coffee Stain Studios. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
14171,"Truly a masterpiece, wonderful ambience, good story and great gameplay mechanics. I really recommend buying this game."
14172,"Didn't grab me at all sadly, and this shares may of the hallmarks of games I like: an interesting presmise, lots of exploration and a unique idea. However, the exectution isn't all that polished in my opinion. And while the settings is interesting, the voice acting is pretty abysmal, which takes me completely out of the experience. What should be a curious journey is rendered completely inert by dialogue which sounds read off a page. Disappointing for me, but if that's not something that bothers you, you may find something to enjoy."
14173,Short but very fun first person platformer. If you liked mirror's edge and spiderman you'll probably like this.
14174,Like Spiderman with the slingshot gadget from Ratchet and Clank. 10/10
14175,"Best game I've ever played. Seriously, awesome music, very detailed and high-quality graphics. A good story. Wants to play again and again. Looking forward to continue the story. 

10/10"
14176,"I did a lp of this blind and how i played it I thought it was fun. Until the end, for some reason the end got stupidly hard and confusing. But the story makes up for it, i continued playing because I fell inlove with the voice acting and the story. I highly recomend it if you like story over game play."
14177,"This game is AMAZING the sense of freedom you get while jumping and the grappling is extremely fun, this is one of the best platformers I have played,the story mode was short but the time trials are very fun, this game will last you probably around 10 hours and for only 13$!! absolute steal definitely recommend it
"
14178,"A Story About My Uncle‚Äôs disparity between kid‚Äôs bedtime story and advanced-user mechanics raises a question in my mind: ‚ÄúWhat would a game look like that was less about a dad‚Äôs power-fantasy and more about his responsibilities?‚Äù And more importantly, ‚ÄúWould anybody want to play it?‚Äù

If you're looking for a game safe to play with your kids watching, this is it!

14179,"This game is a hidden jewel on Steam.  The scenery is beautifully done, combined with mellow music and an intriguing story telling style.  Though short for a play through of about 2 hours, worth many replays and unlockable options for finding secrets hidden throughout the game.  

For anyone wanting a cheap yet fullfilling, non-violent game I would highly recommend.  This game was a much needed mellow out from the others I tend to play.

14180,It's a 3D platformer with a grapple beam and rocket boots. 10/10.
14181,"Fun, challenging and fast. This game is a great first person parkour kinda game.

14182,"Long ago I posted this review, and decided to redo it completely. I have mixed feelings about this game, but it really is mostly a positive experience. I have raged A LOT playing this, and frankly, I feel it ended too ubruptly. Overall, though, it is a BEAUTIFUL game and the story is INCREDIBLE. The grappling mechanic is a very cool feature to add into a game, but to make it the sole mode of transportation is something else. This game really makes you feel like you are indeed on another world, and it makes you feel like you really are flying through the air. Once you get a hang of the grappling mechanic (it honestly took me to the VERY end of the game to realize that if I used all three of my grapples, the crystals would not recharge my suit) it was a very easy and enjoyable style of gameplay. I highly recommend this game. Anyone who's a sucker for a good story and a fun game would surely fall in love with this. I'm just sad it ended to soon."
14183,"is a good game untill the ending, it is just too sudden and out of nowhere. But the idea of the game is fun but did not last long because i completed the story in about 4 hours

"
14184,"Got it on sale for about $3, it was worth it. Takes about 2 and a half hours to beat. Story is simple & intruiging, and the game doesn't try to be something that it's not. Definitely recommended to anyone who has just a couple hours to spare."
14185,"A fantastic first person platformer with amazing gameplay, beautiful environments, lovable characters and a heartwarming story.  You play a young boy thrown into an unknown world in search of his uncle who has gone missing.  

The main feature of this game is, of course, all of the jumping puzzles.  You use a unique suit to launch and grapple your way through the beautiful caves and islands.  Even though you will fall countless times, all of the puzzles are very fun to navigate, and they often include many surrounding areas that can be explored.  This element of exploration is one of the greatest features of the game.  Even when there are not extra areas to explore, there are always fascinating environments to observe, which, at times, easily resemble Terry Gilliam or Studio Ghibli films.

There is no violence, no language and it is not often aggravatingly difficult.  The story is fantastically well written as well, and even though it is not terribly complicated, it is very relatable and interesting.  There are few characters in the game, but the ones that are present are very easy to get attached to.  The game would certainly still be functional with no characters at all, but if that were the case, this game would not be half as good as it is.

[u] A Story About My Uncle[/u] truly has something for everyone.  An overall job well done."
14186,"Bought the game on sale yesterday (cost about 4 euro) and played it to the end in one session the same night, which took about 4 hours in total. Even if I had paid full price I think it was an appropriate length for the game. It finished its story before it had time to become repetitive and start to feel filled with unnecessary stuff. Great graphics and environment combined with responsive and quite simple controls. Although I got stuck at one part near the end where using a controller showed to be less than optimal (managed it on the first try with mouse and keyboard, however then I had played that section for about 30 min so I knew path). Other than that I would definitely recommend using a controller. Overall I really like the game and the feeling of it, it felt a little like Mirror¬¥s Edge which is a good thing. In retrospect I would definitely say that it is worth its full price! Play it!"
14187,"Suspected working title:
[i]A mildly interesting Story around unpredictable Slingshot-Physics[/i]

http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086429431/recommended/278360/

As long as there are no lock on's this game is pretty much impossible to play as a relaxed exploration platformer with a controller. Also just can't get other the dichtomy between story (nobody dies, as far as I played it) and gameplay (you ¬´die¬ª a LOT)."
14188,"It‚Äôs a beautiful game, from start to finish. I don‚Äôt think I can remember anything that so perfectly captures the sense of nostalgia, love, wonder, and loss of childhood memories. If platforming and beautifully crafted worlds and stories are your cup of tea, I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough."
14189,"A Story About My Uncle is a beautiful story and it's one of the best games of its kind; first-person-not-shooters. While almost everybody is saying this game is too short, I really had hard time completing it. It doesn't have challenging puzzles that you have to solve in order to move forward, but there are many things to explore on the way. I liked deciphering the codes, finding eastereggs, collectibles, secret areas etc. And in some parts aiming and timing can be really hard.  I think it is certainly worth its price."
14190,"Beautiful environments and music with awesome, thrilling gameplay.  The game is pretty short (~2 hours) but well worth the experience.  If the trailer makes you excited about it, then you will defintely be satisfied playing it through.  Thank you to the small team who created this piece of art!"
14191,"A great game in the vein of PORTAL and Quantum Conumdrum!
(More the latter.)

Tells the tale from a dad telling his kid a story about his grand adventure to find out what happened to his Uncle Fred, an inventor, who's missing.

An interesting world, very good musical score, but young ones might find the challenges hard (or I'm getting old! LOL).

Tongue in cheek review: Salamander Simulator 2014! 10/10!"
14192,"""A Story About My Uncle"" is a  decent platformer with some refreshing innovations. The story is charming, the gameplay is original, and the backgrounds are gorgeous.

However, the game has some serious flaws. The character models came off as cheap and cartoony and seemed out of place. Up until I encountered one of the frog people I felt pretty immersed in the game... but they kind of pulled me out of it. Also, and this is probably my biggest issue with the game, the difficulty comes off as artificial. I like platformers that require quick reflexes and I also like games that require you to think through puzzles instead of just rushing through. This game unsuccessfully mixes the two. Progressing through the game requires a lot of trial and error. I found myself taking a lot of blind leaps just to see if I could grapple to an object in the distance. Some places that look accessible aren't. Some areas are hard to see and only become obviously visible after messing up a few times. So even after getting through a tough area...it just doesn't feel all that rewarding.

Even with these flaws though, there's something about flying through giant glowing caverns that makes the game appealing enough to play. And like I said earlier, the story is quite charming. It's innocent without being childish or trivial. I probably wouldn't recommend it to the average gamer, but for those who enjoy platformers and are looking for something new, I'd say give it a shot."
14193,"This indie title is the bomb man. Like seriously, this shits amazing. With a good story lin- oh but who gives a shit about the story when this game is like a first person spider-man game. Swinging around and all that, it's gr8 m8."
14194,"Personally can't recommend this game. Thought it is a fast paced game. Got it with a 66% coupon so i'm happy I didn't pay full price.
Its completely the opposite from fast paced, the player will consistantly have to stop before full running leaping (Shown in the video) through levels as you will not know which way your going and have limited grappling hook (3 Maximum) which doesn't let you grab ahold of all places only certain area's. 
Sometimes you land just like an inch away from the platform and fall to your death, where's there should be an option to grab on the ledge with your HAND
Around 90% of the time you will fall Because of either not knowing which way to go once your swinging or you run out of grappling hooks. That or you just didn't jump high enough or leaped closer from the ledge.
Would recommend it to people who have alot of patience and like beautiful views."
14195,"Coffee Stain studios has done it again. With breathtakingly surreal landscapes, strange machines, and odd characters, A Story About My Uncle could be compared to a visual poem. I also liked the challenge of it: the character uses an energized grappling hook to swing from one floating platform to the next, and this proves to be quite hard later in the game. The voice acting is a bit awkward, but this is extremely minor and in no way diminishes the overall beauty of the game.

On a side note, possibly the one way this game could be made better was if it was compatible with Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. THAT would be fucking AWESOME."
14196,"A Story About My Uncle,

A game filled with emotion, adventure and fun times to be had.

I played this game through in about 4 hours, and I tried to explore around to find collectables, turns out I missed most of them but I ended up wanting to play the game again and finding all collectables which I have now done for the two first levels. 

The game has an amazing story, especially if you find all the extra storyline places. 

The gameplay was good in general, I did experience some issues getting stuck between rocks at some points but that was easily fixed with the help of the grappling device.

Overall I would say get the game cause I had fun flying from rock to rock while admiring the views, this game has pretty awesome graphics and scenery. :)"
14197,Probably the greates indie game I have ever played! 5/5
14198,"This game makes me smile :) 

It has such wonderful colours and smooth gameplay.
The story is so sweet, yet it seems alike an interactive movie.
It's wonderful how a game can seem like someone is reading a 
story to you, and moreso being pulled into that story yourself.

I have enjoyed every moment in playing this game, the sounds,
the music, the scenery and the gameplay. Has such a wonderful feel to it!

I would love to see a second version released in the near future!
9/10, all up beautiful game

"
14199,"A Story About My Uncle is the first game from Gone North Games, a small indie studio based in Sweeden. According to their website, Gone North Games was founded by 9 students who have a passion for making games. Since it's advertised all over their website and apparently important to the developers, I'll repeat it here - A Story About My Uncle is a completely non-violent video game. This isn't really an entirely novel concept for a game, but it is unusual I suppose. For better or worse, most games do rely on some sort of violent combat as their main game mechanic. I do think it's cool that games like Gone Home or To The Moon are using video games purely as a story telling medium. But unfortunately, A Story About My Uncle doesn't tell a very interesting story. It is a pretty fun platformer though which is really what this game stands on

The game begins as you, the narrator, are reading your daughter a bedtime story. The entire rest of the game is played out as a flashback as the narrator recounts how he, as a boy, used to play with his uncle at his uncle's house. One day, the narrator's uncle went missing and you soon find out that he was transported to a distant magical world through some transporter device that the narrator's uncle invented. The game is a little vague on the details of how exactly this transporter was invented or how it works, but the narrator of course uses it to travel to this other world in search of his uncle. That's pretty much all the exposition you get. I mean that's it for the rest of the game. You meet some other characters and go to new locations, but the story never really progresses at all. You're just searching for your uncle the whole game. That's it. And then (spoiler alert) the game just kind of ends abruptly at a certain point and the credits roll. Nothing is really resolved and nothing really changes, just ""The End"". It was very anti-climactic and disappointing. It almost seemed rushed, like they might have been trying to go somewhere with the story, but had to cut a lot of it to meet deadlines or something like that. In any case, I somewhat ironically found the story in A Story About My Uncle to be underdeveloped and uninteresting.

Near the beginning of the game, the narrator discovers some magical super-bouncy boots and some magical grappling tether thing which serve as the game's platforming mechanics. I can't remember what the game actually called the boots and grapple device and I'm too lazy to look it up, but these definitely are what make this game fun and interesting. The boots allow you to jump crazy high and crazy far and the tether allows you to pull yourself closer towards certain parts of the terrain. Most of the terrain in the game is made up of small chunks of floating rock as shown in the cover art above, so the platforming can be kind of challenging in certain areas. Quick props to the graphic artists for this game, I found a lot of the floating terrain and world design to be really interesting from an artistic point of view. Very cool and imaginative artwork.

I prefer to play games laying down in my couch with a controller as opposed to sitting forward with a mouse and keyboard, even while playing PC games. So I'm not sure if it was just because I was playing with a controller, but there were some parts of this game that were really tricky to pull off. And I'm usually quite good at platformers. And that's fine, I enjoy a good challenge, but the difficulty curve with this game was a little wonky. There was one particular section near the end of the game that was insanely difficult, it probably took me 30-40 attempts to finally do it right. And then the rest of the game was mind-numbingly easy. My only other complaint, from a gameplay perspective, was with the level design. It was quite often not very clear where the game wanted me to go next, especially in the later levels where the terrain is separated by great distances. I had to jump around and try to grapple to things trail-and-error style until I finally found something that worked. The difficulty curve is forgivable, but in a linear platformer like this I feel like the player should always have a pretty good idea of where the game wants them to go next.

It is definitely a flawed game, but if you like 3D platformers, you could do worse than A Story About My Uncle. It's got some really cool art design and fun platforming, but it has some design issues and the actual story might as well not even exist. It was also kind of short, I finished it in about 5 hours, but I found that length to be appropriate. All in all, not too bad for a small team making their first game. And as its developers insist, it's completely non-violent, if that's a selling point for you.

14200,"Worth playing! Pretty short, takes about 2-2.5 hours to beat, so a better deal if you pick it up on sale. It has pleasing graphics, its not quite amazing in terms of voice-overs and its no epic when it comes to story, but the first-person platforming is definitely fun and it keeps itself fresh by constantly introducing new mechanics and challenges."
14201,"Pretty neat first person adventure/platformer game. Very short though, only took ~3 hours to beat the story. Definitely worth a playthrough for the gameplay alone."
14202,"Every once in a blue moon, a game comes along that totally blows your mind. This is one of those games. From the moment it starts it grabs you by the horns and leads you into a fascinating world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPdUjgb6MGo

You know the feeling..... it's the moment in Portal where you first pick up your portal gun. It's the moment in Mario where you 1st jump into another dimension. You see where I'm going here.. right?

This is the only time in a video I would strongly advise you not to watch.... instead get the game and discover it's magic for yourself. I have not felt this excited in a video game in a long time. Now if you will excuse me I need to go back to playing, I've got new realms to discover and frog people to help. - Enjoy!"
14203,"There's no question that the game's beautiful. The gameplay, however, is a bit frustrating.

The mechanics are very cool and in the same breath a bit confusing sometimes. The range on the grappling hook seems to change as well as how far you can jump. At the point where challenged to not use the grappling device I found that the jump distance varies from time to time on the long jump. Sometimes for reasons I can't fathom it launches me twice the normal distance or halves itself based on reasons I can't figure out. Also the platforms are sometimes JUST out of reach.

If you're in it exclusively for the story, be warned: There are hoops to jump through.
Still pretty."
14204,"I recommend this game but not without some big warnings, namely that if you get frustrated easily you should stay away. The dependency on the grappling hook glove is a very novel twist on the first-person platformer; however, some areas are beyond frustrating, particularly the ice cavern level later in the game. In one particular section, I spent well over an hour trying to get past it and I definitely felt my blood pressure rise after continued failures. There are also several areas where the next location is not readily apparent.

Additionally, the voice acting for the most part is horrible, especially by the man and girl who do the primary voiceovers. The voice actors for the NPCs do a good job, especially for the one girl who accompanies you for a while, but she's unfortunately a bright spot in a whole world of vocal darkness.

But even with those negatives, the game as a whole is overwhelmingly positive. It's bright and colorful, focused on the story, non-violent, and gives a significant amount of exploration possibilities. It really is a fun game. But thanks to the difficulty of some areas, you might want to take this game in steps instead of trying to knock it all out at once."
14205,"At the end of the game it got me puttin' out the tears, man! I recommend that every single one of my friends play this game and experience it for themselves! Good Luck!"
14206,"Unless this game is on sale and you're only spending a couple bucks on this, don't bother.

The game wants you to see it as a story-driven exploration game, but it doesn't really do to well on either account.

The story components are all a bit screwy. The script itself is awkward and the voice acting doesn't help. None of the voice acting sounds natural.  The movement of the characters also look rigid and un-natural. The full story just felt uninspired as well; not bad per se but it felt like they just had a vague idea and just built off of it, as is evident with Maggy (one of the three characters in the whole thing) just being a huge stereotype. Overall, the story and all things related to it just make me uncomfortable and detract from the gameplay. 

So what about the gameplay? ""Eh."" Jumping around and grappling from flying rock thing to flying rock thing is fun. There is no getting around that. The big problem is some of the parts seem oddly unforgiving. Jumping from thing to thing is fun, but once you start falling down again and again... Well it loses that simple style of fun flying around gives you.
And although the game is based on exploration, it's super linear. Which isn't too bad until you realize that going off the beaten path just means death. The worst part is they have hidden things in levels to encourage exploration, but once you try to explore that flying mountain you'll realize it's impossible to stand on, once you try to escape the giant creature in the cave by going into the river that's resting under it you'll realize that there was no river. Only lies. And you'll fall through and die.

So what is goo about this game? the environments. They're pretty, memorable, and look unique.  I feel like this is the part they put all their effort into (and I mean all of it) and is the sole reason I can't completely bash this game, because I did enjoy looking at all the different areas. I just wish the villiages/towns were more... Fleshed out. They had some stuff that was pretty to look at, but it had no depth.

So in conclusion, the story and characters were a let down; the gameplay is frustrating, linear, and frustratingly linear in spite of good ideas; and the environments almost make it worthwhile.

This is basically that pretty yet shallow girl you dated that one time, but in video game form."
14207,"A Story About My Uncle is cute, simple, fun, and is a good ol' feel good type. I definitely reccomend. My only complaint is it's a bit short. Otherwise, very good."
14208,"I love everything this game is and stands for- at least, I did for about two and a half hours.
Everything about this game is amazing: the gameplay is fresh, fast paced, fun.
The story pulls you in, making every room you run through have a satisfying piece of narrative at the end.
The visuals are a great companion to the story and gameplay.

The game is two and a half hours long, though.
As amazing as it is, I wish there was more to do, maybe a hard mode or a community level builder? Something other than seizmograph hunting. I would love to see more done with it than just a single-shot narrative that leaves you wanting more.

All in all, great game. Just too short."
14209,"Amazing game. The story/narration through the whole thing was great, challenging game play and amazing visuals. If you watched the video and said hey the grapple looks cool than you might aswell buy it because you will fall in love with everything else too."
14210,"This is one of my favorite games. I love how the game revolves around a story that hasn't been overused in the media. (such as zombies, war, and so on) These graphics are the most beautiful that I've seen, making it even more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys casual gameplay, especially those into art for the beautiful backdrops in the game."
14211,"It was surprizingly amazing game for very cheap price. I liked the design of environment, puzzles and overall atmosphere. I was falling so many times, so I could get rid of my fear of heights. 

Love it! Worth every penny spent on it. Highly recommeded."
14212,"A combination of nice artwork and graphics, some really inpired level design and some of the best gameplay i saw in an indie game, A Story About My Uncle delivers a fulffiling experience and a heart warming story with more than meets the eye.

The game starts off with you telling your daughter a bedtime story, of how you went to meet your uncle at his house as a young boy, just to find that he was nowhere to be seen. What you do find however is the special suit he built, a suit that let's you fall from any height without taking any damage (think Portal), execute some really long or high jumps, grab onto any surface and proppel yourself to it and (later on) use rocket boots to extend your air time. And that's what most of the gameplay is about: air time.

The gameplay is really fast paced, with you moving like the wind in a number of different locations, making use of speed and momentum to keep going forward, hoping the next jump will take you closer to your uncle. It's a really fun combination of plataforming with some puzzle elements that works wonders and there's really nothing out there quite like it: it's simple, but requires some degree of skill to move on quickly (especially if you're trying to beat the time trials). It's also a breath of fresh air that there's absolutely no kind of violence of any kind in the game. Not even singing turrets of doom.

The game is also worthy of praise regarding the design of the levels. They are really, really huge and open but you will never feel lost or need to stop to look arround and find your way for more than 5 seconds. It's mostly linear when you come to terms with how the game was designed, but it doesn't feel like you are being ""forced"" to go somewhere, but rather right. That's where uncled Fred went, and that's where you are going.

However, the game is REALLY short (probably arround 2 hours for one playthrough), with low replay value, but there are the extras of the Time Trials and collectibles to be found in each level (some of wich add to the plot), if you're into that.

Bottom line, a different game that does what it set out to do very well, but goes by far too quickly, especially for a 15‚Ç¨ game... but it's still a worthwhille game that deserves to be played."
14213,This game is absolutely beautiful! The scenery and gameplay is fantastic and the fact that there is a great story behind it just makes it a great experience all in all.
14214,"The gorgeous scenery and fluid mechanics make this game a joy to play with. The story is creative and the narration make it a quite charming game.

The game is rather short, with me finishing at right around 3 hours, the replay potential is absolutely there and plan on playing through again."
14215,"Over all good solid game, just the direction on where to go next is abit complicated even right from the start of the game, on the plus side nice graphics fun powers, enjoyable."
14216,"I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of puzzle, first-person platformers such as mirror's edge. although short, This game has an amazing atmosphere to it filled with beautiful landscapes and very like-able characters, with some very sad scenes that just make you want to replay to re-live those moments. again, I highly recommend."
14217,"No fighting. narrative driven platforming. Might be in my top 5 list for 2014. It's that good.
"
14218,"Now  this game is good, if u want a good game with a nice ctory highly reccomend this game!
-unless u dislike parkour and games with a nice story-
so all-in-all what im saying in a nice short review is if ur lookin at this get it! because it is great!"
14219,Game is frustrating and not enjoyable.
14220,"A Story about my uncle was amazing, even for a game mainly focused on the graphics and story. it provides a fresh take on the grappling mechanic, and with added rocket boots, it gives you more ways to take on the level. i couldnt recomend this game more. good job gone north and coffe stain, good job."
14221,"I haven't played it for more than an hour but here goes...

This game is amazing, it requires almost nothing spec-wise but it looks freaking fantastic!!!
The story absorbs you the minute you start playing it. I love the way how they put effort in making those villages, giving everybody a place in society, not really important...it's a nice detail i love about these games.
Everything feels so smooth when you play in the beginning, almost too smooth. O_O
The Grapple mechanism is very limited (1 use per jump) and has to be timed perfectly to...well... GRAPPLE!!
This becomes less of a hassle after you find a blue crystal thingy, virtually an upgrade, which make you swing like tarzan yelling ""OOOOhooohooooooo!!"" throughout the level, with a big ass smile on your face...you get the hang off it eventually....yeah!

Like I said, I only started to play this game, and i don't regret buying it. You should really try it out if you're bored of your regular FPS-, RTS-, RPG-games or whatever y'all play...

Euhm...Peace out?"
14222,UNCY
14223,This is a fantastic little game.  The amount of detail in it really shows that the developers really loved and cared about this project.  The mechanics are fun and well implimented.  It's a really really nice little game.
14224,"I can definetely recommend this game!  
The story is simply amazing, i really really loved the story.
I really felt the emotions of maddie when i left her.
The gameplay is really smooth, with some minor bugs, but all in all its great.

I definetely recommend this, if you are a fan of a good story, and good gameplay -

the game is worth it's money"
14225,a story about my uncle is a great game with a good story line and amazing graphics. :)
14226,"Fantastic game with gorgeous visuals and chock full of popculture references.

Pros:
Fun environments to vault around in.
Excellent story telling.
Secrets to find.
Unlockables.

Cons:
A little clunky and hard to get used to at first.
Controller support isn't as smooth as most other games with controller support.
I had to quit for a moment after getting the rocket boots because of the My Little Pony reference."
14227,"This game serves as a perfect example of how we can use video games to become fully immersed in a story. It's so beautiful and wonderful, and you honestly feel like you're living out the bedtime story he speaks of. It's Amazing. If you haven't tried it yet, just do so."
14228,"A small but highly enjoyable game. I wouldn't buy it unless it is on sale, but fun nontheless. The graphics and atmosphere are absolutely gorgeous, and the narrator is fantastic to listen to."
14229,"A Story About My Uncle is a neat action platformer. The main story is rather short (roughly 4 hrs), but there are time trials, challenges, and collectables that will be occupying your time once you complete it.
I bought the game when it was half off, and I thought it was well worth it at that price- enjoyable gameplay, pretty sweet visuals."
14230,"Compleated the game in 3.5 hours.
But it has good pacing and a sweet story.
All in all, if you have a few hours, go for it.
"
14231,"A story about my uncle is a great game, and I loved every second!

Pros: Breath-taking atmosphere, Great story, Loveable characters, and Great platforming segments!

Cons: I felt that the game was kind of short, some of the platforming areas were a bit too challenging, and the fact that the frog people looked like they were high... :(

Overall: the game was amazing and what lost in length, reformed in scenery and gameplay!"
14232,A MUST HAVE GAME!
14233,"Colourful, intriguing, lovely characters and wonderful backgrounds, I really enjoyed this first person platformer, it has something new that I personally still had to see in other games. Sometimes, though, I ended up in rare, slightly frustrating parts, tricky, but with good will and a nice strategy they revealed to be pretty fun, and it was very satisfying to pass through. 
It may be a short game, but I believe it has a huge potential. I give it a nice 9/10."
14234,This is a cool game.  It's all jumping puzzles but in a good way.
14235,"It's OK.
As you can see from the playcount, this game can be beaten in ~3 hours.

It's infuriating at times, but all platformers are.

The biggest issues of the game are hugely oversized environments and absence of physically-authentic momentum conservation:

Your equipment can get you up to ludicours speeds but because everything is so far apart and huge, you do not see it in any way. Your grappling hook lets you swing and pull to object fast, but dampens velocity severely whenever it connects. Your rocket boots can give you a huge boost of speed, but they will completely kill all accumulated momentum at the time of activation. As a result you feel more like danelion seed, floating about in a huge world, faintly being blown at from the sides every time you use one of your platforming mechanics. I had hoped to feel more like Spider Man or Iron Man. Too bad for me.

Other than that the game is really pretty, though what little animation there is, I wish there freaking wasn't, it's so ugly. It's a fairy tale in it's full meaning, so graphics, storyline (it's a bedtime story, basically a dad tells all this crap to his daughter before bed, that's the whole premise of the plot), soundtrack and dialogue are all attuned to that. Personally I couldn't give a toss about it. But if you have little kids, it's definity a game I'd recommend for them to either play or watch over your shoulder instead of hooking them up on CoD, some MMO or GTA.

A good game built with taste and care. It doesn't really give the feeling of speed, but it gives you enough of pretty visuals, varied platforming mechanics and ""candy-world"" setting supplemented by a good soundtrack to warrant a purchase. Especially on sale."
14236,"I just finished it and this game was great, it may have been short but I didnt mind at all, at time I tend to get a short attention spam out of games and having it short and sweet is nothing but good to me.

The graphics are great, the style is fantastic and the story I loved and at times this game reminded me of an original xbox game called Azurik. This will be able to run on some but not all lowish end computers, mine is I think 5 or 4 years outdated and this ran fine.

The bedtime story aspect was nice and the narration was good and kept with the bedtime story feeling. the idea of the game in phenominal (sorry if I spell things wrong) and I couldnt see this idea be preformed by anyone else, the way it is is fine and dandy to me (some of the animations for the AI's and the fires are sort of weird and dodgey but its not that bad and I thought it was funny and it doent need to be perfect) and the frog people are one of the reasons it reminded me of Azurik because in that game the inhabitants are blue people but they look human and all the floating rocks and spinning windmills in mid-air and alot of other things, it just made me feel at home.

Although for the people that think its ridiculas that its too high of a price then just get it on sale, the game is great and give it a try. on my opinion, 10/10 for this game and I wish for a sequal, unless the way it ended is the way its supossed to be, then I'll let it be.

I look forward to the games to will bring us next, thank you"
14237,"Story wasn't that good, but god I had a great time playing this game challenging and fun!"
14238,"Interessantes Gameplay und Design, dass leider durch schwammige Steuerung, schlecht positionierte Checkpoints und sehr frustrierende Passagen ruiniert wird. Im Sale kann mans sich mal anschauen, den Vollpreis ist es nicht wert."
14239,Awsome really good looking game!
14240,"Great story, A little too short for me but I highley recommend it! :D"
14241,"Cool story, Unc.

A Story About My Uncle is an adventure/platform game; it offers an interesting concept, but was it exploited well? Let's see.

The story starts with you, telling to your daughter a bedtime story about an adventure you've experienced as a child. Of course, you get to live the adventure.
A kid of not specified age finds some sort of space suit into his uncle's closet. This suit looks just made for him. He then decide to wear it and place himself into a strange teleporter. This shoots him into another dimention, made of flying rocks that he can swing on with his special [strike] Spider-man web [/strike] magic glowie beam that he can shoot out of his [strike] Iron-man suit [/strike] glove.

First thing you will notice about this game: the stunning environments. Each stage haves a different one, and they all looks very interesting. Well, maybe the last one won't be looking really cool, because it's just a ice mountain, but we'll get to the final part of the game. Oh boy, we will.

The voice acting is pretty decent, not the best quality you will find, but still enjoyable; same goes for the music, appealing, but not very memorable.

The gameplay works very well, M1 to shoot the beam that will drag you around, M2 to load up your super jump, and later on, spacebar while in the air for rocket boots (also, expect a dumb brony reference after you'll get them). The first person model animations are very well made, but the camera angle doesen't make me look like a little kid at all. And having an adult grunt when the character fall from a huge heigh doesen't help.

But here is something that bugged me a little: the level design. 
Much more I was going on, much more it felt a little bit repetitive. Sure, the story was proceeding, but I didn't really been following that because was pretty clich√© and expecially they whould spoil you pretty much all the biggest twist with some question that the character made to himself. Is like that guy that while you watch a movie says ""oh, I bet now this is gonna happen"", and that actually happen. Is kinda frustrating.
Anyway, about the level design, it wasn't only done pretty badly, but also there was no sense of progression. You can take the first stage and then pass to the last stage, the level of difficulty is pretty much the same. And expecially, [u] there could be way more  gameplay elements then the one we got. [/u]
For exemple, at one point there will be a giant monster. They could have added a way to actually fight it, but nope. We got Red Light-Green Light game. Great.

And then the last problem with this game: [b] THE F*CKING RUSHED FINAL. [/b]
If there is something that I hate more, is the feeling of not have achieved something in the end. And this game passed that line.
After a boring normal puzzle, you finally get to the ending. You will then take part of a scene (pretty much like Half Life 2, there is no actually cutscenes into the whole game) and then the game ends. There is no boss fight, no final time trial puzzle, nothing. Just a 2 minute stupid, [b] stupid [/b] dialog.
Words cannot express how much I hate this kind of finals, and this really makes me even more angry, because I want to like this game.

But still, I would reccommend it. 

[h1]Final score: 6/10 [/h1]

It's fun, it has an interesting concept and the 3-4 hours long doesen't make it way too much boring. Still, the game fell with the final. 
13‚Ç¨ may be too much for this game, I would suggest getting it for 5-6‚Ç¨ on a sweet sale.


Even Goat Simulator had a better ending then this, damnit."
14242,"So far, so beautiful. This game really is wonderful. I'll write a complete review once I am done playing the game."
14243,"A Story About My Uncle is a very beautiful game with very nice visuals but also a very nice story. It's one of those games where you forget time and play for a little too long. Although sometimes the controlls aren't what you hoped it would be, it's the gameplay and story that make up for it. It's a short experience, but it is really one you will probably want to do in a single go."
14244,"AMAZING 
Fell in love the first second i put on the power suit. Worth the money definitely"
14245,This game is beautiful. The physics are amazing. Totally recommend playing this game from start to finish!! It's short but seemed like the perfect length. Can't wait to do some Time Trials!
14246,"This game is well made first of all. Graphics are amazing and it really emerses you in the story. Saying that, there is one major complaint I have about one of the levels. (mild spoilers)

The cristals on the walls of the icecave used to recharge the grapling teather are just decorations in some spots. After you repair your rocket boots in the narow stalagmite cravas you really need to recharge but the decoy cristals on the walls and difficult turrain makes it nearly imposible to pass. If this is just a glitch then please just tell me how to fix it because it is quite frustrating falling to your death every time you try to recharge. Thanks."
14247,"""Winter was coming"" - MC. 11/10 But no seriously it's a great game. Amazing visuals and beautiful controls. I would reccomend this to anyone. This is one bed time story I won't forget anytime soon. I cannot wait to see the next game these guys make. A beautiful game for a beautiful story. Take care uncle Fred"
14248,"amazing story, fun gameplay, reccomend."
14249,"Absoutly wonderful little game. It's short, I finished in one four hour sitting; but the story is charming. A Story About My Uncle is a wonderful game where a man is telling his daughter a bed time story. In this story, he tells her of a time he went to see his Uncle. Instead of finding his Uncle, he finds an ""Adventure Suit"". This suit is equiped with something similar to Anti-Fall boots, and a very cool grappling hook. In the game you also find Rocket boots to add to the suit. It's a short, First-Person Platformer with a wonderful story. I highly recommend this game."
14250,It had awesome gameplay and an awesome storyline. GET IT!!!
14251,"Awesome first person action platformer. Oddly enough by the same studio that made Goat Simulator. :) Check out my video review below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM-xeopl0Bc&index=1&list=PLdJR9VtKIPWDGZXJZrl-Lfx_8uKCR0G3t"
14252,"This is a Beautiful game, with a set of inventive and well done mechanics that leads to some pleasing, challenging, and dissapointingly linear gameplay. The story begins great, and builds an interesting imaginative world, but unfortunately goes no-where and ends far too early and abruptly. I heavily encourage the game developers to create a sequel and include a longer story, with a better ending, hire a writer. If it was an open world game, with combat mechanics, it could be truly wonderful. 

TLDR: Lots of fun, but very short."
14253,The game's environments are incredible. The search for Fred will lead you to the most amazing of places that will challenge you to find a  way to traverse the chasms of the world you have now found yourself in.
14254,This game has beautiful graphics and the storyline is amazing. However there are some parts that take along time to complete. But overall this game is AMAZING and i totally recommend it.
14255,"A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer that mixes elements from Mirror's Edge, Portal (momentum jumps) and Bionic Commando (grapple hook). Later on you find jet boots, which allow you to dash mid-air. Some of the later levels are pretty challenging, and a game with this type of moveset hasn't quite been done in first person before. It feels great to chain grapples together and propel yourself high up, then hold your breath as you struggle to reach the landing platform.

Unfortunately the game tries to shoehorn a story element in, which doesn't work at all since the voice acting is abysmal and the character models are atrocious. Luckily these elements are not essential to the game, but it's a shame they couldn't polish this aspect more.

In the end though, it's all about the high speed jumps, grapples and mid air dashes. Fans of Mirror's Edge hungry for more first person platforming should check this out."
14256,"A Story About My Uncle. (ASAMU)


When I saw this game on the Steam frontpage it was love at first sight. Normally I wait for a discount, and then just tuck the games I find interesting in my backlog, but ASAMU was different: I bought it at full price, downloaded it and finished it in one sitting. Even though I throughoutly enjoyed the game, admired the visuals and find (most of) the story interesting I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, I'm not sure if I can even say that it's a good game. Third person platforming is one of my favorite game genres which is sadly neglected, ASAMU much like Mirror's Edge offers the thrill of leaping through huge depths, and the feeling of freedom (have you ever dreamt that you can fly? well it's a bit like that) Let me elaborate:

1. Graphics:

Pros:
+ Beautiful scenery and landscapes.
+ True feeling of depth below you.
+ Smart camera movement making the jumps and movement more immersive.
+ Perfectly optimized, runs flawlessly on a mid-spec laptop maxed out.

Cons:
- Low-res immersion-breaking character models.
- Somewhat inconsistent art-style. 
- The visuals don't really support the story. 

2. Gameplay:

Pros:
+ Interesting equipment upgrades like ""laser grappling hook"", ""rocket-boots""
+ Smart platforming puzzles. 
+ Constant sense of adrenaline-rush and challenge. 
+ Intuitive/easy to learn controls
+ The lack of any violence, and death when falling makes the game unusually soothing and relaxing. 

Cons:
- Unintuitive checkpoint system where the distance between the chekpoints grow larger and larger.
- The fast-paced gameplay slows down and stalls in the later levels.
- Unfair difficulty spikes. 
- Trial-and error puzzles (you can't do it at one try, you should die 5-50 times before you figure out)
- The hardcore precision-platforming requirements at places may scare away newcomers to the genre. 
- Short gameplay time (I finished it in around 6 hours in my slow-pace most people finish it in 2-3 hours) 

3. Story

Pros: 
+ Sort of interesting premise
+ Interesting narrated gameplay (like Bastion), however it becomes inconsistent and scarce as the game progresses.

Cons:
- Terrible, terrible ending (oh god why), I just stared at the screen feeling cheated. It would have been better to not have a story at all!
- Uninteresting characters, clich√© dialogues. 

4. Music/Sound Design

+ The music is cool, but nothing to write home about.
+ The sound design gets the job done, nothing impressive either. 

Verdict:

If I'd be objective I'd give ASAMU a score of 60/100. It was sort of a financial flop, and not a commercial success either (according to Steamcharts 166 players played it the most, currently has 2 players active).  It has an interesting concept but sadly it falls short in delivering, the story feels terribly rushed (like they wrote it 20 minutes before released) the gameplay although fun has it's flaws which combined with the story (in a supposedly story-rich game) just can't make it.  

However I still recommend it, why?

Because I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game, I mean I finished it in one sitting that's something right? It's just a lovely short game that I recommend to pick up on a -60%+ sale, and you will enjoy it if you are aware of it's limits and lower your expectations accordingly."
14257,"Beat the game after 4 hours, was mad about the ending. The over all game is good. but the gam is to short"
14258,"[b]Short Version[/b]
Relaxing, visually appealing and a decent challenge. Ending is a bit anticlimactic, but it's about the journey right?

[b]My full review[/b]
http://youtu.be/WGhow0ecAHg"
14259,"Totally recommended. Although short, this game delivers unique visual and gameplay experience, which fare preceeds its price.  I'd classify it as an instant relaxing experience, where you can (literally) jump into mesmerizing world like from children fantasies.

Gameplay introduces one or two simple, yet entertaining mechanics, that guide you throughout the game, and (literally) propel the exploration aspect high to the sky.

There is no fighting in this game, so be prepared for that. But I do≈à think this is a minus. But in my opinion, there should be ore puzzles. Hopefully Gone North Games will deliver more and better pieces in the future. I like them."
14260,"the game is short and at some points mind boggling hard, but it's worth it to get the feeling you get when flying through the air and hearing the amazing story. just. its worth it"
14261,"Relaxing narrative-based platformer. For the Unreal 3 Engine this game looks fantastic, lighting and level design really show lots of effort. The story itself is interesting, although it is let down by the very average voice acting. A short game but worth the price. Buy it!"
14262,"This game is infuriating.

It's good, but it's infuriating.

It is deceptively simple, giving you most of the abilities very early on in the game, and then asking you to get from A to B with those abilities, then adding in different environmental situations (spinning things, falling things, collapsing things) and laughing in your face as you redo the same sequence 10 or 20 times before finally getting it right, hitting the checkpoint, and going through the process all over again.

There will be portions that you breeze through with no issue, but these are just lulling you in to some false sense of security, making you think that it's all gunna be easy from there on out, then blam...collapsing things with no checkpoints for ages.

It's good. The storyline is fun, and cute, visually the game is appealing, the mechanics are simple enough to get used to, but hard to master.

The achievements are seemingly impossible at this stage, so if people are looking for a challenge then yeah...it's totally worth it."
14263,"A great little game. Not much in the way of story telling, but what it lacks there it more than makes up for in satisfying viuals and gameplay mechanics. Each session is sure to leave you shaking your head and pumping your fist."
14264,whats up every one my name is pewdiepie
14265,if you like miros edge you will like this
14266,"And a story it is. This is a fun game, albeit painfully short. I had quite a lot of fun with it...but be warned! If your timing and platforming skills are a bit off, this may be a frustrating experience for you. Overall, I'd give it a solid 7/10."
14267,"I get a little freeked out when falling in games. This game had my butt clenched, breathing stop, bug eyes, hope you make the platform 87% of the time. The story was good, simple, good. Spent some time just staring off into the distance, very pretty scenery. Seemed a bit short, but after a number of parts that had me ready to rage quit, then ""HELL YEAH I MADE IT FINALLY!!"" I did fully enjoy the game. I would say top notch recommend to everyone."
14268,"I wanted to like this game, I really, really, really did but unfortunately I couldn't. It look's great, the scenery is beautiful, music excellent and the voice acting isn't half bad either, but it stops there.

The core game play is first person swinging physics, you have a grappling hook with a limited number of grapples each time you jump to get from platform to platform. This starts out as a lot of fun, but quickly spikes in difficultly. Your grappling hook only has a limited range and limited uses between jumps, this isn't a problem at first but after one or two levels, the surfaces you need to grapple to start to become only just in range to the point of Limbo difficulty where if the jump/swing is not done perfectly you will fall to your death, a lot.

The swing physics are fairly tricky as well. Quite a few times I found my self clinging to surfaces around me to try and build momentum, letting go when I had speed, only to slam into what I just let go of and fall. You also receive upgrades however they do not make it any easier as the difficulty again increases. This makes sense but it would have been nice to have an area or time to just enjoy care free these features. 

It's not a bad game, but it quickly becomes frustrating and I can't help but think it would have been better with a little more polish and better placement of surfaces to grapple to.

I wanted to swing from platform to platform with ease, get lost in the world and while I'm sky high look down and watch everything become bigger as you slam into the ground like iron man; but I just couldn't."
14269,"This is an interesting game.  A very cool story with a beautiful landscape.  The game can get really frustrating because it's hard to aim and grapple onto objects in some areas.  It is very rewarding though when you finally get to the next checkpoint after failing tons of times at a particular junction.  I found that turning down my resoultion to a point where I didn't get lag in game really helped though, so keep that in mind.  It's a short game, so I recommend waiting until it's on sale.  It's a good game for anybody who loves non-traditional platformers.  Beware of the eye... a 4 out of 5."
14270,"This game is fun, relaxing, visually pleasing, and all around awesome! A very interesting, and intriguing story that keep me playing. simple to learn the machanics, but a little trickier to parkour around how you want to. very fun and highly recomended."
14271,"This game is really quite innovative and well worth looking into if you are looking for a different type of first person platformer/puzzle game. It's one of those types of games that is very easy to get into but takes quite a bit of time to really master how to use the grappling hooks. 

I think what I like most about this game is that it is primarily story driven. As the description says, it is truly non-violent but that doesn't mean you won't run into some monsters. Overall, highly recommending and well worth the money.

14272,"Awesome game! Not hard to play and a very fun storyline. Never played a game like this before. You feel like spiderman, but with tractorbeams and super awesome rocketboots, and in a world way cooler than New York ofcourse! Totally recommend it!"
14273,A fantastic game based on both story elements and exploration.
14274,Wow. Thats all ive got to say. is Wow. This game is an experience worth having. It's more or less like a movie rental but its one of the best Movies ive ever seen. The story is the draw and while you get into it and look at these stunning visuals you soar through the air with the grapple. It's awesome. Extremely highly recomended.
14275,Cool time
14276,"I heard about this game once, but only got my attention while playing goat simulator. So I decided to watch the game trailer and really got impressed from there.

What is awesome about the game is that you see how upgraded this game was (this game began from a class assignment), look for in youtube for the early version of it. You'll get impressed how Gone North Studio put a highly effort into it.

Now talking about the game itself.
The story is pretty good, but for me kind of missed more about the experiments of uncle Fred and a bit more of Maddie could be explored creating more connected story what would keep more the players. 
THIS DOES NOT SAYS IT HAS A POOR STORY, IT IS SO DAMN GOOD, just could explore a few more points.

The voices, this is where the game did take care. It fits perfectly with the characters.
Soundtrack really is remarkable and brings the right emotions when it is needed. One of the best points in the game. You can hear the complete soundtrack at their website.

The gameplay is easy and sounds good enough with keyboard. I tried to use the controller but fast enough I quit because it was kind of hard to play with it. I wouldn't put the power jump and grapple over the bumper and trigger, for me it was difficult to play this way. While there was three buttons available 'B', 'X' and 'Y'.

In a few moments I got lost but nothing compares about how lost I could get through the ice stage. There was a moment where I thought: ""Holy s***! Is it really there?"" and it was. This is why I could consider it kind of a puzzle game.

While jumping on a few platforms some bugs would appear where I got stuck or sometimes I could stop over something that really wasn't the platform and use it for my own benefit to restore my grapple.

I know that I've said a few cons but what everyone has to know is ""THIS GAME IS AWESOME!"". Bugs happens and can be repaired, but they don't make A Story About My Uncle look less than it should. It was not frequent for them to happen, they don't affect gameplay constantly.

For me A Story About My Uncle was a huge surprise and would totally recommmend for others to play because the studio deserved it. Great story and gameplay creating a new way to play games."
14277,"Visuals are perfect, same as the catching atmosphere. Story itself is simple but even a bit touching. Game isn't long if you don't explore or try on the challenges, but if you wan to rest from your favorite rpg or shooter this thing is perfect."
14278,"A Story About My Uncle is an Indie Platformer created by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. 

Not much explaining is needed here, the title basically says it all. A man‚Äôs daughter wants to hear a bedtime story - something about an adventure - and you‚Äôre thrust into ‚ÄúA Story About My Uncle‚Äù. 

The gameplay is simple enough, you rely on a jump, a power jump, a sprinting jump which feels like a leap of faith, and a grappling hook to maneuver your way through a series of obstacles in order to move on. The movement is exhilarating from the start, and I felt like a bad-ass taking one hundred foot leap of faith after another. Even falling to your death provides a rush. While they definitely aren‚Äôt the same game, the movement in A Story About My Uncle bares a bit of a resemblance to the parkour of Mirror‚Äôs Edge. 

The obstacles at the start are a piece of cake, and the game eases you into the mechanics at your disposal. About halfway into the first level, players collect a power shard that enables them to grapple to any object in the game, within a certain range. Collecting more of these power shards allows for more individual grapples while in the air, up to a limit of three, until the game nears its end. 

Exploration from the main path is also encouraged, as five hidden collectables in the form of measuring devices left behind by your uncle are littered throughout each level. Collecting them leads to things like being able to change the color of the grapple beam. You can grapple around like a member of the Sith, or Mace Windu. The other unlockables are hilarious and I‚Äôll leave them out for spoiler reasons. But they go literal when they say Goat mode, Midas Mode,  and Acrobat Mode. 

An added bonus to the fun platforming is that the world is beautifully crafted. From the opening cinematics, I really found myself enjoying the graphics of the game. The varied colors and environments keep the game fresh and give extra motivation to carry on. I stopped plenty of times to take screenshots whenever I found a great view. From open chasms to dark caverns  to Pandora-like floating rocks and icy caves, almost everything looks fantastic. Even minimalistic things like wind the wind soaring by your face as you hop from one giant boulder to the next engross you further into the experience. I consistently felt like I was really flying through the air. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt a few hiccups, like the fire animations leave a little to be desired, and frozen static on a GPS? But hey, I for one personally forgave these little minor hiccups when I realized that I‚Äôm hopping around in a city full of gigantic frogs that just happen to speak incredibly fluent Swedish. And also apparently worship Shia LaBeouf. I was a fan of Disturbia too, good taste. 

The sound is also minimalistic, but satisfying. I wish every time you hit the ground could sound like what it sounds like when you fall from a high height. The soundtrack isn‚Äôt particularly memorable but it‚Äôs nice to listen to in the background as you traverse the levels, and it hits the right spots when it needs to. 

I won‚Äôt go into the story too much, but it‚Äôs intriguing the entire way, and the mystery of finding out just what the hell happened to this guy‚Äôs Uncle had me excitedly waiting for the payoff at the end. 

The voice acting is solid, but at times leaves a little to be desired. 
It does it‚Äôs job though of keeping the story charming, and I genuinely cared about the characters, besides the lack there of. 

The mechanics are fun throughout, but there is a bit of a lull in the gameplay when I really wanted something new to mess around with. Ask and ye shall receive, apparently, as the rocket boots were thrown in. A press of the space bar and you‚Äôre sent rocketing through the air. They‚Äôre a fun, albeit difficult addition to the already great components of the game. 

With that mention of difficulty, the game steadily picks it up as it moves on. At first, I felt like I was on a honeymoon, everything was pure bliss. But I started getting further and further frustrated as I went on. I‚Äôm not sure if the game was blatantly becoming punishing or if I just flat-out sucked at it. Probably a bit of both. But the increased difficulty also leads to an increased feeling of reward and accomplishment, which I loved in the final level. In fact, it was hands-down my favorite part of the game. The stiffer challenges lead to greater feelings of, again, just being a flat out bad-ass. This game does that a lot.

Why couldn‚Äôt this have been narrated by Liam Neeson by the way? Listening to him for the 2 to 4 hour run-time might have made this the greatest game of all-time. 

And why the hell am I running so close to the ground? I felt like I was 4‚Äô2‚Äù the entire time. 

All thrown together, A Story About My Uncle is a highly enjoyable platformer with great mechanics and a solid story, with the added charm that so many indie games seem to carry with them. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs a fan of the genre or in need of something new and creative to sink a couple of hours into."
14279,"A very enjoyable unique experience. I played this when it was free to play (when the game ended after the first boss) and i fell in love instantly. Im currently trying to do speed runs (not very good tho), maybe one day ill be as good as Twikax ill see!"
14280,"This game is, at its core, a very unique platformer with quite fun movement mechanics that allow you to swing across floating islands and caves. And it's as fun as it sounds, but it gets more and more fun as you advance and discover more abilities to traverse. However, around this core there's also an ultimately enthralling and touching story of what wonders you may encounter as you set off to adventure.... and what you may have reluctantly left behind.  

At first you'll think it's one of those games where it's only you in a lonesome and desolate place, namely a cave... but as soon as you exit the caves, you'll discover that this world is ALIVE, full of beautiful open vistas and even living people who live there! And that is truly where the story takes off, providing emotional reasons for your adventure and even someone to join you in your exploration. The contrast is breathtaking, and very welcome, although some people may have given up before reaching this point, and they shouldn't have. 

Like I mentioned, although it starts off with simple swinging abilities, it gets much, much more fun further along, providing you with even more ways to fly across chasms and just have fun advancing. You may end up falling to bottomless chasms more than you'd like, but in the end you'll just enjoy figuring out how to fly across the next set of obstacles and actually making it. 

All in all, this one is a wonderful adventure well worth setting off to."
14281,"The game was very intersting and fun, however it was very short (i beat it in two hours). The grappeling was phenomenal  and for when it lasted the game was great, but it was to short to be worth buying. Of corse if you want to you can redo stages to try to beat a section in one attempt, and they do have a time trial mode;however, as it stands no its not worth it."
14282,"Very good game, though it only lasts ~3 hours.  The way you move around is amazing and really fun, and the levels are very atmospheric.  I found myself doing some parts more than once just because a certain part was cool or interesting.

You don't encounter any enemies in this game, so it's pretty casual.  The best way to describe it is as a first-person platformer.  Some parts are a little frustrating, but no part takes more than ten minutes to figure out.  Although some parts of the game are extremely open, the game does a great job of guiding you in the direction you should be going without showing a waypoint, something I wish more games could accomplish.

My only gripe is that I wish the game had more content.  What's already there is amazing.. but I definitely could've gone for at least a few more hours."
14283,"I liked it!  Warning: [u]this game is somewhat childish, but it is still fun to play[/u].  This game is a 3D platformer - just like [b]Mirror's Edge[/b].  It's a cute, quick, and fun game, and it's made by [b]Coffee Stain Studios[/b]; the same company that made [b]Goat Simulator[/b]!

[b]80/100[/b]"
14284,"A Story About My Uncle:

Pros: this game has good story, fun and diverse levels to explore,nice graphics, amazing soundtrack that suits the game perfectly, fantastic ending.

Cons: some of the english sentances in game can be a bit wierd. for example: I never imagined a creature sounding as terrifying.‚Äù Shouldn't that be 'so terrifying' instead?

Anyway, A really good game overall and since its Gone Norths first game im really impressed at how good it is and i can not wait for what else they will create in the future! hope theyll stick to more adventure platform games!

warmly recomend this game 10/10!"
14285,Dude!
14286,Its great
14287,i love this game it is so beautiful and really good details
14288,"THE GOOD:
A charming, 100% non-violent adventure. Lovely environments. Grappling hooks. Short enough to actually finish in a couple sittings (though see below). GRAPPLING HOOKS. 

THE BAD:
These guys never got the memo about how first-person platforming puzzles are infuriatingly awful. I am an exceptionally patient man, but the last two stages reduced me to profanity. The narrative doesn't really go anywhere terribly satisfying.

THE VERDICT:
A more engaging story would help justify the challenge. Less challenge would justify a fluffier story, suitable for all ages. As it is, it's probably too challenging for very young players, and too fluffy for older ones. It's not awful, but it's not great. Ultimately, I can't recommend it unless you have an even bigger grappling hook fetish than I do."
14289,"The best game I've played this year.

A Story About My Uncle is a great linear adventure game. The mechanics and voice acting was great! I could fly and jump around that world FOREVER! Great plot and wonderful nararator!

pros
Great voice acting
Great mechanics
replay value 7/10
great sound effects

cons
not so great character models or animations, besides the character you play
no real music, it was mostly ambient sounds
some graphical glitches, not game changing type

I loved this game.

I reccomend this game to anyone.
It would be fun to speed run.


"
14290,"This games biggest flaw is its length. Once you feel you're finally getting absorbed into the world it ends. Would only reccomend if you get it on a sale because the price isnt worth.

Update 5 years later, never played it since."
14291,"Pros:
-Everything looks beautiful
-i liked the story
-i had too much fun
-great ending
-theres a goat mode
-almost all of the enviroment is somthing you can stand on
-its published by the same people that made goat simulator (coffee stain studios)

Cons:
-i beat it in [u]4 HOURS!!![/u]
-sometimes i felt like i was playing super meat boy (platforming occasionally hard {especially in the [spoiler]ice cave[/spoiler]})
-the achievments like to play hard to get

Summary:
It only lasted 4 hours but those four hours were amazing. $13 seems like a bit too much so I'd wait until it goes on sale.
A Story About My Uncle gets a 8.568747864385746875643057/10"
14292,"An incredibly lovely experience with solid grapple swinging gameplay HOWEVER - It should be noted that a normal playthrough is only about 2-3hours, which just feels incredibly short, this can either be an advantage or a disadvantage. The Story is a quite simple one where the focus lies more on the actual gameplay & Scenery then anything else."
14293,"This game is amazing. I first heard of it via goat simulator, because I was looking at the other games Coffee Stain Studios had made so far. I looked at the Sanctum games i didnt really think much of them, so I then clicked on A Story About My Uncle and I thought it looked pretty cool, so I bought it. When I first opened the game, I thought that they could have made it fullscreen, but that didnt bother me at all, So I immediatley pressed play. Long story short, I found the gameplay amazing. 
P.S it kinda reminded me of portal."
14294,"Too much bouncing, u can say the controls r too smooth.
bugs and glitches r uncommon but there still r some.
good game overall, but no i do not recommend it."
14295,"It has been a long time since I have been so engaged in the story of a game.

A Story About My Uncle is a visually beautiful game with very unique gameplay. Told as a bed-time story to a daughter, the game is played as an adventure whilst the narrator recounts what you are going through. There are no fights or battles (as a no good bed-time story should have) which can leave some players wanting more, but there are enough extras to collect which add further gameplay to levels and elements to the story.
With the exception of perhaps Mirror's Edge, I don't know any first-person interfaces that worked as fluidly or as naturally as this one. Running, jumping and grappling all seem natural and normal and the sense of speed and motion are well conveyed.

The game isn't overly long to finish, but I think that adds to it's replayability.

Highly recommended."
14296,"really short, but very good. i suspect there is more content in tryiong to get 100% completion"
14297,"Great game. awesome controls. long jumps, sprint jumps, grappling hook & stuff, it all is marvelous."
14298,Amazing game ..Played it several times through xP
14299,"An absolutely charming game to say the least, this is an excellent example of a 3d platformer done right, let alone a first person platformer (never even though it was possible). The gameplay is addictive and fun, the characters are memorable and the overall art style is just so charming.
The story falls into the background at times, but it's sure to leave you very satisfied despite the short length. The moral and message behind the whole game will leave butterflies in your stomach."
14300,"A great game with great graphics for a very early acess. This may shock you*wispers* its made buy the people who created goat simulator. The game mainly focuses around speed, aerodynamics, and grappling, yes, grappling. If you like Parkour or just high speed fun, this is the game for you. And coffe stain? PLEEEAAASSSEEE add ocolus(incorrectly spelled) support."
14301,"I have to say this game is now one of my favorite games. I loved the grapple mechanic in Tribes Vengeance and it's story, even if it's multiplayer was weak. The grapple mechanic in this game is very good. I really enjoy games that make you think and predict your actions before you make them. The power jump is delayed so you have to time your jumps instead of just ""mash mash"" to success like other games I have played.
I have played a mod called ""Call of the Fireflies"", a singleplayer Crysis modification. 
What they did in this game with the visuals and design was close to that Crysis mod, but with power jumps and energy grapples!
The one thing I love about this game is that my 9 year old nephew can play it in that there are no guns and therefore no killing people or other things.
In a way, this game is much like portal, not in it's core game mechanic, but in the way it makes you think and solve problems without throwing ammunition at it.
Thank you for putting this title out and I hope so see competent sequels. 
One thing I would love so see in a sequel is maybe a co-op version with more complex puzzles ... ""A story about my Aunt, Fredricka"" --- anyone?
:-)
One more thing: I was suprised to see this game priced at $10-$15. It is worth twice that easily for the amout of creativity and thought put into it."
14302,"This is an incredibly beautiful game, and i would enjoy seeing more done with this concept of the grappling hook in the future. 10/10"
14303,It was alright.  Gets repetitive and it's not very challenging.  It had a pretty interesting story and it controlled well though.
14304,what 3d platforming should be. play this game
14305,"Great game, very asthetically pleasing, with some pretty difficult puzzles, although most are pretty easily cheated (using the term cheated lightly) though."
14306,"This game is amazing. Yes the price tag is a little high but its worth it. I beat the game in little under 3 hours in one playthrough. But that's all you need because the narrative is great and it has a real feel good ending. Plus the platforming is super fun and the pacing is perfect. Right when I got tired of one level it's throw me in a new environment with a little gameplay changer.  Awesome game, I definitely recommend"
14307,awesome game with unique machanics
14308,"Pro:The gameplay is fantastic for the first 20 minutes or so (it kind of grows stale after that). The jumping and swinging was really well crafted, however the whole game relies on that one action. There isn't all that much progression in gameplay throughout the adventure.

Con:The voice acting and writing are pretty cringeworthy.

Just play it and find out for yourself. 7/10"
14309,"I love the story and movement-based gameplay of A Story About My Uncle, but it is far too short. I beat it in only 2 hours."
14310,"Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I have to admit it even had me a bit teary at the end. I can't even begin to describe the gorgeous colours! The story was so heartwarming and the little extras you found if you searched hard enough had me smiling even more than I already was. My only complaint was the [spoiler]chasm where you had to use your grapple device and rocet booster boots to get across this cavern that gave you no chance to rest and recharge either[/spoiler] a minor complaint but it made me rage quit for a couple of hours which made me upset because I really wanted to enjoy this game the entire way through.

I'd give this a 9.5/10. Beautiful crafted and beautifully written."
14311,"The premise is good, the gameplay is fluent and fun, but the game is too short to warrant the price, took me 2 hours to beat it."
14312,This is an amazing movement game and I would love a sequel
14313,"I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately this game really wanted to hate me. On paper it's everything I like: first-person movement, no unnecessary combat, good art design and music, a mysterious short story with heart. But if you can't get the hang of the controls-- after three hours, I certainly couldn't-- the entire game is nothing but frustration. If I was playing it improperly, the game didn't give me any clue as to what I was doing wrong. Or right, for that matter. If this game wants to be about swinging, why does the main grapple mechanic yank you to ledges you can't grab? This is A Story About Hitting Your Head And Falling A Lot. At least the music is nice and calming... though that makes it seem like it shouldn't be so infuriating to play.

I think the problem is that most of the gameplay environments are tiny platforms suspended at maximum distance in empty space; with no quick way of judging relative depth, perspective, target size or distance, there's no reliable way to know how fast you're going or in what direction, or how close you are to your destination-- moving platforms are particularly hard to judge. Maybe some floating stationary particles in the air, or some kind of on-screen meter would help? The stationary skybox, while pretty, only helps you know what direction your head is pointed. Your body is only a disembodied hand. Speed lines and subtle wind clues are all you get to calculate 3D physics trajectory with precise timing. Checkpoints are the only mercy. At one point, your only friend in the game will taunt you for using your best tool... it's really defeating. If you buy this, just hope you're ""more hardcore"" than me, I guess.

I've beaten Mirror's Edge on every difficulty and I can finish Jumping Flash without dying so I'm no stranger to first-person platforming-- maybe it's just that those protagonists had visible feet?-- but this game never clicked with me. I'd try dozens of times to pass one checkpoint, agonizingly almost-but-not-quite-reaching the next one, only to land on it the 35th time with no idea what I'd done ""right."" There are no difficulty options. I got to the final level, tried for a half hour without even seeing the first checkpoint (let alone reach it) and I gave up. This makes me wonder if the game was artificially made more difficult to disguise how short it is. It also makes me think that if you get the hang of the controls and find a good flow, this game's less than an hour long. I would have preferred an easy hour than three hours of nonstop frustration. Or at least some sort of aim assist option. I don't even think it's priced too high... I just don't want to pay any money to feel that frustrated.

Maybe if I played more twitch-based super-demanding multiplayer games, I'd be used to this sort of pixel-perfect trajectory-based movement, but this game presents itself as a child's bedtime story in a peaceful world and then asks you to have the reflexes of a lifelong speedrunner. If your favorite thing about FPS games is rocket-jumping and exploiting glitches, give this a shot. As for me, I can finish Half-Life 2 in less than four hours but I couldn't finish this game at all. So I watched the ending and it turns out I had already guessed it; the developers spoil their own story by getting cute with 'hidden' text and a simple letter-substitution cipher that they show you the key for early in the game. Oh well. (They also hobble the story with some clumsy writing and awkward voice acting, but I assume it's a small team for whom English is not their first language.)

I really appreciate that they tried for something unique and emotional, but in the end the nice art design couldn't hide a super-hardcore frustration-fest with fiddly controls. Make a sequel with a main character who has a visible body and can grab ledges, and test out its difficulty curve on a wide range of gamers before you ship it, and I'll be on board. This game, though, was just too much frustration and not enough fun."
14314,It's like Spideman meets Mirror's edge but extremely relaxing. Very Pretty with no enemies besides gravity.
14315,"This is a fun, and very interesting game. The visuals are gorgeous, and the gameplay and characters are wonderful. I seriously recommend you try this game. It's got a bit of a portal feel to it to boot! The story ended rather satisfyingly, leaving you with the void feeling - where you feel you won't see anything as good for a long time, if ever."
14316,"Addictive gameplay, fun mechanics, seamless narrative and great atmosphere. I recommend this game to everyone who likes to have fun!"
14317,"Best ""Iron Man"" movie yet!"
14318,"A Story About my Uncle is one of those games you don't see now adays. The story telling of the game is as a father telling their child a bedtime story, with wonder and adventure. It very well made and the graphics look very nice. Believe it or not, this game was made by the same guy that made Goat Simulator, so for making a game like that, this is so amazing."
14319,Good A bit short i love the voice acting.
14320,Puzzle Plaformer based on movement. Plays kind of like a TF2 jump map. Lots of replay value via time trials and challenges.
14321,ONE OF THE BEST INDIE GAMES OUT. A Story about my uncle has an amazing story plus the graphics
14322,"Great first person platformer, with amazing story and grapple mechanics...  definitely worth the money."
14323,"A nice quick game with a heavy focus on story, unless you really care about 100%ing it and getting every achievement you'll probably get about 3 or 4 hours out of it (1 or 2 play throughs). I enjoyed it and loved the physics puzzles, but there is no way to change outcomes so replayability isn't very high."
14324,"This is probably the most lovingly made and beautiful game (art direction not polygon count or any dumb stuff like that) that I have ever seen. Bioshock Infinite was my favorite gaming world before this and I still love Columbia for its Steampunk beauty but this is something else. The effort and dedication put into each level and set-piece is astounding coming from an Indie developer. Also, there is no combat so far so there is more time to let the beautiful setting take you away (unlike Bioshock Infinite where almost constant combat did not leave enough time to enjoy the beauty of the city). Before objectives you can run free and explore the villages and whatnot where every little detail put into the world makes it worthwhile. Also, there is no stress of combat put upon the player so this is a truly relaxing experience. Now for the gameplay itself. The gameplay is simply platforming and grappling hook puzzles that manage to be challenging while not too punishing. Certain puzzles may leave you frustrated at times but when you overcome the obstacle you feel accomplished. However, one small mistake leaves you to die and a slightly miscalculated jump will end your life. Thus, the game becomes slightly challenging. Furthermore, the game is beautifully narrated as a father telling a child a bedtime story and the childhood mysticism with foreign lands and new experiences is beautifully realized in an almost Seussian manner. In the story, I noticed subtle commentry by the narrator on topics such as racism and over-pollution of earth which I found very interesting. Throughout the narration, you feel the narrator pining for love from a father figure, even going as far as to relate to other species, which he says shouldn't be normal, being as they are, frog people (thus the commentry on racism). Overall, ""A Story About My Uncle"" is an absolutely amazing game from very skilled developers with many endearing qualities and is absolutely worth every single penny and more."
14325,"wonderful game! beautiful graphics, wonderful gameplay, great story, the only problem was it was too short!"
14326,"Armed with an ethereal grapple, rocket boots, an a childs' curiosity ASAMU is a compelling and well build puzzler told in the form of a bed time story."
14327,"ZOMGODZ This game is pretty darn good. I wasn't expecting to be as entertained from the simplicity of running, jumping, and grappling as I was. It's a beautiful game that's only flaw is that I wish it was longer."
14328,"I saw this game and remember thinking: ""that looks neat"" so I bought it, and A Story About My Uncle will forever be one of the best gaming experiances I have ever had. The story drives you on pure curiosity, the gameplay mechanics are fast but smooth as silk and challenging, and the vast scale of the world put infront of you is awe inspiring. I can't recommend this game enough."
14329,"It was excellent, but outrageously short. If I knew it'd be that short, I'da waited for it to go on sale. It needs player-made content, Workshop compatability with a map building tool."
14330,"While very short, A Story About My Uncle has a great story with awesome controls. I honestly didn't expect too much coming from the guys who made Goat Simulator, but it turned out to be a very fun and enjoyable game. The characters were very colorful, and the story was kind of tragic, but happy at the same time. The puzzles were great, and all the levels were equally beautiful with great detail.

The only con I do have, is the voice acting. The nordic accent on the characters really throws me off some times.

I definitely recommed you buy this game when you can!"
14331,"if you can stomach the frankly terrible voice acting, this game does web slinging better than any spiderman game ever. 
would impulsively buy again"
14332,"  This is a non violent first person platformer, wich is a rarity in this day and age, is a short game, you can beat it in less than four hours, its replay value is in the time trials and in the exploration, so it may not be for everyone if you don¬¥t like exploring and the search for the optimal path this game may not be for you, but if you liked mirror¬¥s edge you are gonna like this one, even tough its mechanics, setting and atmosphere are quite different, but it can elicit that same feeling of flow you could find in ME, and none of its interrumptions, and i personally find the mechanics in this one more easy to grasp, faith could be a little finicky sometimes.
  You can play this game while listening to your music, a podcast or even an audiobook letting yourself fly trough the environment, and if you have children of small age, this is a game they could play safely, and as a father of a daughter myself, like the protagonist, i could not agree more with the final words of this game.

 If you liked mirror¬¥s edge and  want to play something different, you should play this one."
14333,"Amazing idea, story telling and graphics. The whole concept of the game is interesting and the gameplay is thrilling. Very good game which should everyone give a try. 10/10"
14334,"Pretty looking game. Cute story. Funny Easter Eggs.
But so far its a lot of jumping puzzles. Jumping puzzles are the least favorite part of any game for me. And maybe they aren't really jumping puzzles. They are more like extremely twitchy physics puzzles. I know where I have to jump to, but the controls are so convoluted that I just don't have the timing to hit three keys within nano seconds of each other. This seems to be the main point of the game so far. And I die / fall...a LOT like 10 times for each successful jump. But it seems like if the jumping physics get more forgiving, then there'd be literally NOTHING else to the game. Except story (which Telltale's success tells us is fine.) But unless you are a total twitch or LOADED on adderall, don't bother."
14335,"About 1¬Ω hours of real gameplay in this game.
Fantastic world and I was stunned by how much care came into crafting it.
Using the tools that you get your hands on are easy and fun. Grappling is real fun and powerjumping is makes everything a little bit more interesting.
I didn't particularly care about the rocketboots since they can make everything easier when somethings are doable without them.

Story is interesting but didn't stand out too much. Didn't really care about the characters themselves except for the main character/narrator.

Considering it a game you are able to play in an evening I think it's good. and the price is reasonable.
7/10"
14336,"Short review for those interested, this is one of the best games I have ever played. Beautiful world, amazing story and heart-touching elements, this game is thoughtful and creative, and its mechanics are second to none for what they are trying to achieve: adventure!
I reccomend this game to anyone who wants some adventure and a great story, with challenges all along the way"
14337,"A beautifully written, voiced and scripted game. The story of the boy searching for his Uncle Fred kept a hold of me throughout the game, not letting me feel like the story was being pushed aside for action as so often happens in games these days. Some top-notch graphics and the worlds are breathtaking. The physics platforming was fluid, not frustratingly difficult and was constant throughout the game. 10/10 would highly recommend this to anybody. (just so you are aware, it is a short game. 118 minutes for me to complete it)"
14338,"A Story About My Uncle was developed by Gone North Games, and puts you in the role of a young boy. Well that's not exactly it, but its something close to that. The story opens up as a father is telling his daughter a bedtime story, a story filled with adventure, and about something that he did when he was young. He has an uncle, a great explorer, who always seemed to find himself in a position of wonder. Now as the story begins you find yourself in a first person view in your uncle's house. This is when the game truly begins as you now step into your younger you shoes, and get to play the adventure story you are telling.

Graphically this game really gave you the feeling of movement. Sadly for me it was mostly falling to my death, but that's alright. So as I was saying, in this game you are going to be traversing your uncle's house and world beyond a portal which will take you through several different environments. To be honest with you, teh environments looked amazing, especially later in the game. The only thing that left me wanting was the character designs. They looked like a last minute push into the game. You have these amazing environments with lighting and contrast, and color, and then when you look at the characters you are interacting with its like something wasn't complete, the look flat, and rough around the edges.

I do have to say that I really did like to voice acting, sure the majority of the characters were talking in strange mumbles, but it made the game feel that much more alive. I also think the narrator, the father's voice caused that warm feeling and show of love as he unfolds the story to his daughter.

The controls in the game are very straight forward, you are going to move, jump, and grapple. There are ways to enhance all of these actions, thanks to the power of your suit that you find before going through the portal, but for the most part you are going to be doing one of those actions.

So you are a young man trying to find his uncle. You are worried because he hasn't sent his usual postcard. You decide to go look for him, and find that there's a suit that fits you like a glove. You then put the suit on, find the workspace that your uncle usually keeps hidden away, and then get thrusted into another world. Ironically this is where your uncle has been jettisoning garbage for a bit. The interesting thing is that the inhabitants of this world are utilizing the trash to create a better world for themselves. There are definite signs that your uncle interacted with these creatures, and it becomes clear that you are going to have to push further into this world if you are going to find him. You will be faced with caverns, darkness, monsters, and more. The majority of the game is spent centered around the grappling mechanic of your suit. You have a finite amount of times to grapple, though later you find that it is possible to recharge mid-grappling session, so that you can actually get through areas.

I have to say that for the most part I really enjoyed this game, though I have to say that by the end of it I was thoroughly done with wanting to grapple. There are just too many times where some of the camera angles that I was getting was giving me a sense of false depth. There were other times where you could see that certain things weren't acting exactly correctly when it came to depth as pieces of a windmill like blade would flip axes. There were definitely some parts to this game that were beyond unforgiving if you deviated from the intended path to get from point A to B, but there were a couple of times where I felt smart having beaten the game at its own game by going a route I'm not sure I was supposed to take. 

If you like a game that centers around a grappling mechanic, that has a bedtime story centered around looking for a lost relative, then this is the game for you. If you find that you get frustrated easily if you accidentally have a tendency to double click, thereby exhausting an extra grappling chance, you might have some choice words, much like I did, for this game at times. At the end of the day, this is by no means a perfect game, but there's something about it that was inviting enough that I wanted to know what really happened to the uncle. So with all its little blemishes, its huge dependency on grappling, its still a game that you might want to check out. I give this game a 7.4 out of 10."
14339,"A Story About My Uncle is an incredibly fun and challenging platformer.  The grappler mechanic is a lot of fun, and it's really neat how the present new mechanics to you slowly.  On top of that the story, visuals and music are all incredible.

The only downside is the game is a little short.  I understand, though, because the game doesn't overstay it's welcome.  With each new mechanic and puzzle you are given just enough time to appreciate and get used to the new mechanic before they then present a new one. The game took me about 2 hours to complete one playthrough, but at the same time, I only got one achievement.  There is still plenty of room to go back and really master the game.

For some people $13 might be a little steep for a 2 hour game, but I had a ton of fun with it, and I highly recommend it."
14340,This game is so fun. you can grapple on to giant floating rocks and has a really awesome storyline.
14341,"Strong narrative, fun platforming, and overall a great experience but somewhat short."
14342,Anyone looking for a cool adventure with no violence really and a overall cool message should look into this game. It is short but worth every dollar!
14343,"A beautiful and charming game. Like the original Portal, it revolves around a certain platforming mechanic... in this case, a special kind of grappling hook (and something else, although that would be a spoiler) and also like the original Portal, it is short, sweet, and does not overstay its welcome.

It is an innocent, childlike adventure, completely appropriate for all ages, which is a refreshing change. Do not, however, take this to mean that no skill is needed. While I found the game rather easy for the first few levels, no one who has seen the ending would say that it is easy in the final stages. (On a side note, I dare anyone to get the achievement for getting through the last level without ever falling... I predict that no one will do it without hacking... and I double dare anyone to get all of the time trials at gold level. Good luck.)

A lovely experience from start to finish. Bravo."
14344,Absolutly stunning game. Played straight through it without stopping a was pretty impressive. Simple story line and highly enjoyable to see the level design and how amazing the levels look.
14345,Really cool playformer. Thats all that can be said.
14346,This game was very beautiful and touching... One of the best games I ever played!
14347,"Games like this are seriously under valued! The story is sweet and the characters are well thought and just. I recommend this game to everyone, i really hope people give this game a chance, alot of fun and mixed emotions to go through!"
14348,"A Story About My Uncle is a great little platformer game that only lasts an hour or two, three. But one that deserves your attention.

Your character's daughter one day asks for a story and you start telling about your uncle you were once looking for, a long time ago. So, the game starts with a younger you, trying to find your uncle. 
The story isn't deep, it's even simple, but it's told in a way that it's realistic, you know, like how one would tell a story to his or her child.

The graphics are beautiful, and the attention to detail in the environments is sublime. The characters are a bit off, but fortunately, there are only a handful of characters you'll meet. There are some citizens to be found here and there, but you won't likely see them up close.
These sharacters have excellent voice acting, even if there aren't that many conversations and they all sound like one would expect. No problems here.

Gameplay wise the goal is to work your way to the end of the level by using a glove/device that allows you to traverse great distances. You can attach it to certain surfaces and that way swing across the many platformers you'll encounter.
Sometimes it's a little bit unclear where you have to go to, but by looking around you can usually figure it out quick enough. 
It can become a bit frustrating because -although there are checkpoints- there's also a bit of skill and luck involved. It's not always clear how far you're away from a certain object and that ocassionally results in you falling to your death. Thankfully, death has no real penalties and the game doesn't need to reload anything. You're instantly transported back to your last checkpoint.
Later on you'll earn upgrades that allow you to recharge while traveling, the ability to jump, use a jetpack or to use more charges.
There are several worlds to explore, with different settings and physics but in the end there are only a handful of them (not even that I think). There are also some secrets to be found in each level (each level lasts about an hour or so), but I have no clue if it adds anything to the game or story or if they're just there for the challenge of it.

A Story About My Uncle is a clever game with some excellent gameplay mechanics. It could've benefited from a little bit more narration and a couple of extra levels/worlds, but what's there is already lots of fun (mixed with some minor frustrations).

14349,Great casual game with an good story and narrative.
14350,"A unique platformer and storytelling experience, not unlike Portal. Recommended for anyone who wants to experience a deep, non-violent game rather than play/win it."
14351,Amazing!  I love this game the story is awesome and action packed.  I love it up until the final part where you must go a mile with two turns and thats all that I can see.
14352,"Simply beautiful.

The way the story progresses in this game is intriguing. You're telling your daughter a bedtime story and it turns into a surreal adventure through a mystical land that, to me, is reminiscent of the floating mountain area from the movie Avatar. Grappling feels wonderful and soaring through the skies only to grapple onto the next big rock and swing like Spiderman is endless fun. I am not too terribly far, but I have spent so much time just exploring the very first village area. I reccommend this highly to gamers of all tastes. There truly is something for everyone in A Story About My Uncle."
14353,"This was an awesome game-experience for sure! It actually didn¬¥t even feel like an ordinary videogame, but more like a story-based... piece of art in a way! :D There is not much to say besides the fact, that the graphics are stunningly beautiful and the gameplay feel unique as well as innovative and fun! The only reasonable criticism on this work might be the length... I¬¥d like to play much more of it so badly! :o You really did a great job guys! ;)"
14354,This is a great game that puts you deep into the story with great ambiance and dialouge. I am greatful that MArkiplier did a review on this game because it is an amazing game
14355,"10/10

Amazing game."
14356,"TL;DR: One-eyed monster in a tunnel. 10/10!!!!!

This is what innovation looks like. A Story About My Uncle brings many new and interesting things to videogaming and furthers the genre described as ""walking trail"" games. I highly recommend this to anybody who tires of consuming the samey, prosaic videogames.

The story, though sparse, is quite unique. It's about becoming a father, of all things. Plot points lay scattered around the long paths. As you stumble upon these nuggets the narrator, a father telling a bedtime story, exposits about his uncle Fred or the given situation. By searching out your uncle, you get a glimpse of person your character grows into. Pretty sneaky.

Controls are tight, if a little counter-intuitive at first. Jumping platforms requires a mixture of spacebar for regular jumps and right mouse button for bigger jumps. It is very disorienting, and I expended a good deal of grey matter mitigating this scheme the entire game. Swinging fom exposed rock like Joey Ramone works much easier, however. Factoring in some rocket boots from the later stages and getting around proved to be fun.

Fun, yes. Miles and miles of fun streching out along corridors textured very much the same. Fun swinging puzzles repeated with tiny variations over and over again. Hmm. My sarcasm button must be broken on this board. A Story About My Uncle paces itself poorly in places. Too often, the reward for solving a challenging puzzle is another puzzle or a small, mute walk to the next row of platforms. A tiny gripe, but I can't count the number of times I'd wished to just reach the destination.

Overall? It's new. It's different. It's Indie. It's rough around the edges, sometimes literally. You could carve glass with some of these pointy character models. However, A Story About My Uncle brings something new to the party and we're collectively richer for it.

10/10 Suitable for snobbery."
14357,"This is a great game.





Dat voice acting tho."
14358,"One of the Best games ive played


story 10/10

grphics 10/10

everything 10/10
"
14359,"This game has a LOT going for it, and I'd really like to recommend it -- but I can't. The first-person platforming works well at the start, but 1/3 of the way through the game, it becomes overwhelmed by its own clunkiness. 

Take one look at one of the NPCs and you'll know what I mean: The developers have some good ideas, but (for whatever reason) they just don't execute them well enough. Beaming to rocks is neat, and the sensation of flying through such tremendous space is exhilirating. But you'll fall to your death over and over as you realize how tricky the mechanic really is. 

I came really close to rage-quitting 3/4 of the way through, because the stalactite-jumping scene is simply TERRIBLE. Beam, beam, recharge, all while falling, all while trying to maneuver around falling rocks -- who needs it?

Worst of all, this tedious flinging of oneself (and it does get tedious toward the end) is rewarded with almost zero payoff. I'm sorry, devs, but the story here is just paper-thin. I felt no sense of accomplishment or awe when I was done.

This could have been the next MYST, and I really wanted it to be so. But it's not. 

I enjoyed parts of it, and in general the mechanisms are okay. But the lack of satisfying story (or really any story) nudges it over the line into a thumbs-down."
14360,"This is the best platformer I have ever played, to date. By far, the mechanics in this game are so responsive, fun, and a blast to use. You feel incredibly good with how you pull out your grapple and start pulling from place to place. While a nephew of the Uncle Fred talks about his story that he once found a suit made for him, he narrates the game along, with you playing, as a bed time story.  Is it true, however? That's up to you to finish the game and judge from yourself.

The story is absolutely fantastic and heartwarming. The enviroments feel so good, and the scenarios are amazing to take a look at. It is however, not a difficult game at all, but there are many challenging parts I have failed various times, but when I pulled them off, I was incredibly satisfied.

The sense of speed, height, the falls, it's all really good, you will feel, as I said, great while you play the game. You get new gadgets for your suit along the way, and they add new concepts to learn, but not hard to master.

The checkpoint system is fairly balanced, not too many nor too few, a good amount, thought, I do wish there were some in some parts, specially in the ice level.

Really good game overall, and worth it's price, even though it might be a bit short, but for me, it was a good game to play.
"
14361,"Lovely story, a simple adventure really enjoyed it.

The game mechanics give a real sense of freedom flinging about."
14362,Great story and a great feeling through the entire game. I do recommend trying this game out!
14363,"Amazing Adventurous game, but a bit small..

Still too good to play and buy ^_^!!

Loving it!!"
14364,"Amazing game, great experience and really immersed myself in it, haven't had this much fun with any of my other 200 or so games, thank you so much for this!

10/10"
14365,This game combines incredible atmosphere and great gameplay mechanics to creat a short but memorable adventure. I enjoyed every second I had with this game and would recommend it to everyone!
14366,"The swinging, good.

The story, not so much.

Recommend."
14367,"If you like first-person physics-based puzzle platformers, you'll like A Story About My Uncle. It's got some interesting mechanics and a touching story. My only complaint is that it seemed too short."
14368,"Yes, it's a first person platformer, but it's made as well as conceivably possible for a first person platformer. Delightful narrative, pretty graphics and new game mechanics introduced throughout the game. First and foremost though, jumping around just feels insanely satisfying. A real hidden gem of a game and well worth picking up at full price.

Edit: Finished the main story of the game. Pretty short - clocking in at under 4 hours. Above review still stands though - great game. There are time trials and other challanges to extend the lifespan of the game."
14369,"Fun grappling game, somewhat short though."
14370,This game is such an amazing game I would recomend this game to everyone the graphics aare amazing and the story is great
14371,"Beautiful, charming, fun. So good."
14372,puzzles are as fun as solving portals but with a magic grappling hook 10/10 would play again
14373,"Fairly entertaining, a little short and sometimes figuring out how to progress can be tricky. Also the hidden collectables are a little too well hidden at times. Overall though a very well made game that is worth getting."
14374,"It gives a kind of nostalgic feeling. The ""bedtime story"" idea is so awesome, and the ""other dimension"" seems like those fantastic dreams you have and you don't want to wake up. Although it is short (I beated it in 4h without rushing) it worths every second of gameplay. The story is very immersive and the ambience is very nice. You can replay for the achievements and time trials too.

For those who like games without violence and that only your skill can prevent you of going further, this is a great game, and of course, with a very good narrative (IMHO, the voice acting is great)."
14375,"I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!
http://youtu.be/ktfuiPRcJvo
I hope you enjoy!
Martyr"
14376,"this game is awesome but short 
"
14377,"Omg is this game mother fucking fun,interesting,plot based, action packed and all around amazing.

First of all the mechanics are very fluent and work into the story amazingly.

Secondly the story of it all is breath taking and fun

Finally this game has the perfect amount of challenge too it expesially whith maddies challenges.

Overall this is possibly my game of the year and has no bad elements to it. It is definately a must buy especially for its low price of only like 12 dollars. Flawless game and i love it."
14378,"This is a fantastic bedtime story to play through. The only thing that disappointed me about it was how quickly I got through it, and that was even with numerous repetitions of some of the trickier puzzles. The game is a beautifully rendered, first-person platform physics puzzler...of a sort. I would have never recommended a first-person platformer before this game, but A Story About My Uncle pulls it off with unexpected grace and polish, and has quite a lot more story than anything I've seen Coffe Stain put out so far. I got a good satisfying three hours or so out of it before I beat the main story (which was great!), but the time trials, and hunting down all the collectibles didn't really tickle my fancy, so unless more main game content comes out for it, I'll probably never pick it up again, sad to say. I really wanted to explore the beautiful mysterious world this game is set in; a world inhabited by an infant race and strange monsters. I wanted more story, dad! I could have seen this easily being a series of bedtime stories about the father's adventures in his quest to find his uncle, but alas, can't have everything I suppose. In short: Great free-flying grapple-beaming rocket-booting fun! Might not be worth more than ten bucks for only a couple hours of main gameplay, but certainly pick it up if it goes on sale!"
14379,doesn't take too long to beat but the gameplay is so fun and unique it makes it worth the price
14380,"Great-looking art, a simple fantasy setting, and the fact that it's 2 hours long aside, A Story About My Uncle's gameplay mechanics would please anyone looking for a 3d platformer and, oddly enough, anyone who likes rocketjumping in TF2. Air control and momentum are key in this game where you're more often airborne than grounded. I found that the physics involved are a far cry from realistic but are very fun to master."
14381,"Played several times absolutely loved it. Smooth flow throughout the game, not a very indepth story.

8/10 would recommend without question"
14382,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, highly recommend although it's not the best in terms of time/¬£$   I got a few hours out of it.
Environments are gorgeous, gameplay uses similar mechanics to Goat Sim (same devs after all) but it's executed wonderfully. Some of the obstacles are quite challenging which I wasn't expecting, nice surprise.
Don't look them in the eyes!"
14383,"The only critique that I would put out on A Story About My Uncle is that the character models/animation could do with a bit more work and it's a bit of a shame I can't interact with the people. Apart from that, it's a fairly good story-driven FPS platformer, I had fun just power leaping, grappling and just soaring through the air like I'm Astro-Spidernaut! :)

7.5/10"
14384,"Hooking game, I wish there was more level to explore during the adventure. Simple gameplay, simple story, but well done it makes this one, a touching and fun game to play."
14385,"I was growing increasingly bored with the videogames that presented themselves to me as of late. Ever since gta5 came out there wasn't anything that really even seemed worth looking forward to. At one point I went so far as to go outside, and it was there on a fishing dock where I found a youtube video of this game on my phone and it intrigued me greatly. My first impression was that it was some mashup of portal and mirrors edge and looking at it I actually assumed this game must have dribbled out of the sweet teets of Valve themselves. When I found out that the true creator was the same ones that put out goat simulator, that drew me in even further, finding it on sale was the final straw; I had to buy it... 
As I swung through the caves on my adventure, I became lost in the story. I'd been playing lesser games for so long that I had forgotten that unlockable cheats were a thing and that at one point they were meant to be be FUN, other than just spawn vehicle and infinite ammo. I realized that this game did not only have an excellent concept but it contained genuine heart as well. Some of my friends predicted this game would have a short playtime but i was actually able to get almost 6 hours out of it and I know I haven't explored most of the amazingly open levels. this doesn't mean it can't be speedrun however in fact it has a great deal of potential and even challenges you in the extras menu with an optional timer. I'm very glad that this game was able to come to a full release and as an indie gamer I feel confident saying that the developers very much deserve money for this game. Again, I've been showing this game off like a bad rash, but as I said before; I recommend this game most to those who feel the gaming world has grown a bit stale lately because it is a wonderful refresher on what a good game is suposed to look like and it reasserts the idea that games can also be presented as a form of art... 8.9/10 and thats with classic masterpiece portal representing about a 9.5 on my scale.
 -if any more proof is needed keep in mind that this game was worth writing a review which should say alot right there and I even proofread it briefly :p"
14386,"Wonderful, touching story meets gameplay that gets jumping, grappling and exploration so very right. It is hard to find flaws in this wonderful first work of Gone North. Outstanding voice acting, loveable characters and impressive visuals are among this games many strength, and I can only recommend you experience the story it has to tell you.

Be warned though, it will leave you all warm and fuzzy inside."
14387,"I came into A Story About My Uncle not knowing anything about it, and left the game amazed. Everything from the story to the graphics to the seamless grappling of your amazing magic crystal powered glove all seem to mold together into one fantastic journey. 

The story is literally that, a bedtime story. Told to a small child and imagined from the person telling it. Every time you find a new spot in the game the game that is story related the game takes a step back from the action and lets you enjoy the narrative and remember that this is all an amazing story, and not just a crazy physics journey using grappling and platforming. 

My MOTO score:
Graphics: 10/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Story: 10/10 

The game will keep you on your toes until the end to see what really happened to the Uncle. Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you have been on the fence. It is well worth it!"
14388,"Though a fun and interesting game at its core, Uncle Story only has about 2 hours of gameplay and a horribly unsatisfying conclusion. I find it extremely difficult to recommend this game to anyone, even to those who have been craving something different."
14389,Almost as tasty as giant star fish.  Definitely nom nom!
14390,"Great story, great graphics, great atmosphere 11/10"
14391,"This game was well worth the money, in my opinion. Controls were great, graphics were fantastic (minus the characters, but it wasn't about them at all). I guarantee if you buy this game you'll finish and still want more. Really addictive gameplay.
If I had one beef, the story telling. It was such a cool idea, to narrate something like this, yet I didn't feel like it added to the scope of the game. The accent was heavy, which lead to a bunch of grammar mistakes.
BUUUUT I'm rambling. I really enjoyed this game and have recommended it to everyone I know. If you like first person adventures at all (think portal mixed with bioshock's grappling mixed with dead space zero g) I'd try it out.
SUPER excited to see a sequel to this, I would buy it instantly."
14392,"This honestly was a pretty good game. The flow of the controls felt nice, as well as other mechanics of the game. The story and idea was also quite interesting as i wanted to press on through the game. Now with that said, there are somethings to take into consideration about this game also. I won't complain about the voice acting critically because, hey, I got for what i paid for. It's not that it was bad, but the cuts sounding like some parts were read line by line instead of flowing into on another was a bit of an issue. but nothing to complain about really. Another one was some animations, but hey, as a early gaming company who worked on this, I would say they did quite a good job for the rest. Now we get into what really gave me a little bit of an issue, and that was the grapple mechanic. one of the particular levels has a bit of an issue with hit detection when I aimed at a specific point. I believe this was the 4th level that this happen, and this occured twice. I was able to make it by the skin of my teeth and high percision shots and good timing. even so, it indicates that you can aim there when you can't really hit it. All of that aside, the game itself is quite good. The story is short, but that's the charm of it due to how the story is portrayed. (forgive me if this all sounds like riddles, but i'm trying not to spoil any levels or story parts). The characters are enjoyable enough. The ending threw my thoughts out the window with how it played out.

 All in all, I would rate this a 8.5/10

pros:
- good graphics and design
- nice hidden messages and secrets
- nice free flow like control
- a good story with a good amount of challenge to the game also.

cons:
- (minor) the cuts between sentences during dialogue.
- some areas need a bit of a fix in where the grapple mechanic works. (mainly level 4)
- animations of some actions of character such as the walk cycle. (example: maybe give them a bit more of a animate presence, like glancing at the main character now and then, but i won't hold that against this)"
14393,Short and sweet with very nice movement mechanics.
14394,"Sehr sehr nett gemacht. Etwas kurz. Aber vom Spielmechanismus her fantastisch. F√ºhlt sich ein wenig wie Portal an, aber doch ganz anders."
14395,"A Story About My Uncle is an incredibly enjoyable experience that is sure not to disappoint those who are fans of unique and well-polished experiences. First-person platforming isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but for those who enjoy it will certainly find something very special indeed as the movement mechanics are fluent and well-polished, although the rocket boots were the only mechanic I really had any issue with, but its usage is fairly limited so it wasn‚Äôt a huge concern. The levels are well designed and the world is simply stunning. A Story About My Uncle is one of a few games I whole heartedly recommend that everyone tries.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryitlsXq-6c

Summary:
+ Movement system is incredibly fun and well-polished.
+ Beautiful world design and environments. 
+ Well thought-out level design.
+ Charming and engaging narrative.
- Rocket boots feel ‚Äúthrown in‚Äù.
- Texture quality varies substantially."
14396,"Nice game, but much too short - first run finished in 2 hrs. I'd advise buying it on sale."
14397,"A mixture of narrative game and platformer, the platformer part is fun but the storytelling is kind of flat.
I beat it in 3 hours, so actually it's not a long game.
The graphic is amazing as an indie game, except for the character mods.
The story itself is not that fun, and the storytelling doesn't create strong moods. But it's a nice try.
The levels are challenging, but the difficulty is not disgusting at all.
And... I think it's way too complicated to be a bedtime story for a kid.
7/10, I do recommend it for it's a nice try of mixing narrative game and platformer up."
14398,"The good - Settings look beautiful, platforming has its moments, collectibles require full exploration and then some (a plus for me because im tired of games handing all their stuff out, coincidentally, I had the most fun platforming when I was going for collectibles)

The In-between - Voice acting has its moments just like everything else, the accents can be ridiculously heavy at times and the translation messed up, if thats what they were going for then they hit the nail on the head, otherwise....), 'Immersive' gameplay, the fact that it is a bed time story and you cant die or have any death animation does take away from the feeling of imminent danger when you are leaping through the air, but there were alot of neat touches they added to counter it, which is nice

The bad - Platforming isnt platforming really (the platforming is clunky, in a way I cannot find the words to describe, not that its really bad, just, something is off and I can't put my finger on it except for the fact that it didnt feel like a coherent and enjoyable experience), character models are ugly (I'm sorry, but they really are :C )

The ugly - The game is extremely short and can easily be finished within an hour to 2 hours if you dont stop for collectibles, as has been said before, even if you do, it adds about an hour to the gameplay, for the pricepoint ( and i bought it on sale at $12). I do not think it is worth your investment for the pricing on it and as a special note to that statement, here is why, it is because not only is the game short, but the filler content in  it to make the experience seem more lasting gets boring extremely quickly and is used pretty much as soon as you get to sky gardens and the ice cave

Do I look forward to seeing more games from the developer? Yes, bump up the content and production quality, and I would buy another game from them

Should you buy this game? If you plan on speedrunning it, or it is on sale for under $8 then yes, otherwise, I would not recommend the investment"
14399,"At first I was slightly sceptical, but when I tried it out, my mind was utterly blown to shreds. The levels are simply beautiful, yet can be a real challange. If you let go of your grapple, or use your rocket boots too early, you'll miss the platform or your next grapple target. So your mental calculations must be precise, lest you fall into the abyss below. The story telling is another thing I love, there are none of those pesky ""flashbacks"" or ""flashforwads"" you'd expect from something like this, its just a very smooth game all round. One I'd enjoy for manny years to come."
14400,"An excellent game and a must play for all those who enjoy a good platformer. Although the game is fairly short it makes up for it with good story, good platforming and an awesome world to travel through.

While the game starts of easy enough towards the end it begins to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, although experienced gamers probably still won't find a huge amount of challenge.

The games main drawback is that sometimes it is difficult to find out why you failed a jump as for all intents and purposes it seems like you timed everything correctly.

The only other negative in the game is the voice acting, although the acting itself is good the actors mispeak some of their lines which can break immersion slightly.

Overall, an enjoyable game and well worth the purchase, but if you don't like platforming this game isn't likely to convert you."
14401,Ok. So I just finished this game and all i have to say is WOW. The story is so amazing and the chracters are loveable and enjoyabe. The only thing I was not happy about was the amount of content that it had. I went through the story in about 3 and a half hours. So lets cut to the chase. Just buy this game for $12.00 its worth it trust me.
14402,"Update: Beat the game. 2.5hrs...for the price, not worth it. Imagine going to a theme park as an 8year old, having a really fun time, within 2.5 hours your parents say it's time to leave. That just about summarizes my experience with this game. They told me what all the rides are like and I was expected to just accept it. It was a fun game up until the end. There should have been at least another half an hour worth of content (without providing spoilers).

Cons:
- Models almost seem like they were developed for the Xbox; and
- Script is simplistic and voice-overs are awkward at times (Odd pauses and tone changes).
- Game ends abruptly

Pros:
- Environments are fantastic;
- Neat story-line concept;
- The game is challenging; and
- Movement is synergistic.

I'd wait for it to go on sale."

14404,"This game is beautiful. I enjoy ambient games, but this one was really well done. The only problem I had was, near the ending, there was a part that was pracitically impossible. Either way, it has a great plot and beautiful scenery."
14405,"this game is absolutly amazing, the feeling you get when you swing from platform to platform is amazing, this is a must have for every gamer. i cant stop screaming yaaaahhhooo at the tv everytime im in the air."
14406,"tl;dr- is rly gud, buy dis gaem

Plain and simple, I loved it. The game is a fantastic first person platformer.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""But first person platformers are usually awful! They're hard to control and land, and in general don't feel as good as sidescrollers!""

This game blows that assumption out of the water. The controls feel great, the atmosphere feels great, and the ability to move around freely feels great!

Overall, the game starts out with a bit of a Portal-meets-Dear-Esther vibe, in that it starts out with a paced narrative in a beautiful world, which follows through seamlessly into the actual puzzle game where you use some out-of-this-world technology to think quickly in ways you hadn't thought to before, allowing 

The game does have a few issues here and there. First of all, there is a small problem with depth perception. Granted, that's going to happen in a first person platformer, but sometimes all it does is net frustration. Then again, that does tend to happen more often than not in a puzzle game designed to legitimately challenge you. In the end, that frustration can lead to some wonderful moments of, ""Oh thank god I finally got that.""

However, one MAJOR issue I have with this game was one point where I had just barely almost made it to the next platform before falling off. The game shoved a hint in my face, then cheated me onto the ledge. I understand why they might do that, but I felt cheated in that the game basically took the controller from me and said, ""Okay, we'll just spawn you there."" I didn't feel that I earned it.

Another issue ends up being character design. Some of the characters feel... awkward. While this is reasonable seeing as what they are (you'll understand), they didn't feel like living characters in a real world; they felt like VIDEO GAME NPC #37. Especially the few ended up talking to you, whose heads would spin around in order to keep their eyes on you, their necks snapping back and forth should you walk behind them. Granted, you could have it a number of other ways, all with their own flaws, but it takes you out of the experience of the game when that happens. Of course, the exception to this is the character Maddie; it felt like the developers spent time and effort in animating her every expression and motion, and she felt much more alive than any other character.

The attitude the game takes towards you wavers as well. In the beginning the game is chocked with wonderful experiences and delightful gameplay, but about halfway through, I felt the game calling back to my early childhood games, where, if you were lost, the game would whistle at you and point you in the right direction. Simply put, I felt like I was stuck in a game intended for children 8-12. I would have been fine with that, had the game decided to stick with that emotion; the challenge of the game seems higher than that needed for an 8-12 year-old child. Maybe I'm just overestimating the skill required to play this game, or underestimating the skill of a kid, but the two just don't feel like they match up. (Or maybe I'm just bad at vidya gaemz.)

Despite all of this, the game does do what's most important for a game to do: Introduce a skill/challenge, teach you how to use/overcome that skill/challenge, then apply that skill/ability/challenge to future situations in combination with the previous skills/challenges.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

--This section touches a bit more on what I found wrong with the game, but requires describing aspects of the game that would be considered spoilers. You have been warned.--

When I had mentioned depth perception being a problem, I also had issues with the grappling hook. Sometimes, something would seem close enough to grapple, but the crosshair wouldn't light, meaning that you have to restart and try again, because maybe you just weren't close enough, or maybe you're going for the wrong rock entirely. A perfect example is the area just after  you leave the village: you head out, and jump across to some huge rock. You attempt to grapple it over and over, and for whatever reason, your crosshair won't like up, and won't hit it. You figure, ""Oh, that must just be the problem with the distance."" However, later on, you come across a rock which is undeniably further than the aforementioned one, and yet the crosshair lights up when aimed over it. It could have just been a matter of perspective, but over all, it tended to confuse me.

Again, the characters seem awkward. I understand, they're frog-people, but... if you're going to do that, do it right. Maddie was perfect, in that she appeared significantly inhuman, but still behaved in very human ways. At no point did I think, ""Oh, she's just an NPC integral to the plot."" Every moment I was with her, she felt alive and existant. She felt like a person! In contrast, almost every one of the villagers felt... dead. Sure, they were whistling, they were dancing around, they were lounging, but all in all, they didn't feel alive.

Despite all of this, the game still feels fantastic. When you're swinging flawlessly from rock to rock, when you take a huge leap and get a resounding ""THUD!"" on landing, when you climb your way around the map with every tool you have, you feel... free."
14407,"If you like Portal, and you like Spider-man, you'll love this game. Once you get the swinging mechanic down, there's nothing more satisfying than hitting your mark on the first try. Indie feel and terrible voice acting, but regardless I can't wait to find out more about this story, too. Recommended, especially for the price."
14408,fun parkour game
14409,"[b]Scroll to bottom for final verdict[/b]
A Story About My Uncle is a first-person adventure platformer. The main gameplay involes using your grapple hook, power jump and rocket boots to advance through the level. The gameplay feels very fluid and smooth, and sometimes even challenging. The grapple hook is my favorite game mechanic in ASAMU because it feels amazing to zip through the air grappling from rock to rock, but it only has up to three uses before landing on the ground. The limited amout of uses creates another challenge for the player, where you must strategize how you will get to the other floating island before running out of charges. Most of the time this is easy to see where your grapple makes a mark on everything you hook on to, so you're able to see how your uncle made it across because of his marks on floating rocks. The power jump is exactly what it says, it gives you a very powerful jump. Combined with the sprint key, you're able to shoot out very far. The rocket boots don't feel very powerful to me, but they're useful nevertheless. 

The story revoles around you, a father, telling your daughter a bedtime story. You tell a story of your uncle Fred and his adventures and how you always wanted to be just like him. You stumble into his house hoping he is home when you find an adventure suit, custom made for you but your uncle never told you about it. It seems that he wanted you to find out yourself. You strap it on and it's equipted with a grapple hook and power boots. You enter his gigantic 'garbage disposal' and you're shot into the sky, leading you to an unknown world. Naturally, you feel ready for the adventure, and continue moving through this strange world with one misson: find Uncle Fred. The story seems a little cliche, where you need to go out on this big adventure to find someone, but it's not horrible, it's quite alright.

The game includes no violence and no action, but it is better that way. The game focuses on the gameplay and narrative. As your progress through the world, you narrate what you saw and what happened. The game is very beautiful, with the textures very high resolution and the enviroments are mind blowing. Overall, the graphics are amazing, besides the people. The characters looks outdated the their animations are a bit strange. The audio is fantastic as well. The music always fits the athmosphere, ambient noises are soft and charming, and the landing sound is great. Another thing though, the voice acting isn't the greatest. You can tell the VA's first language wasn't English, but it's all right. The father and daughters voice acting is the best of the bunch. Maddie's is strange.

[b]FINAL VERDICT[/b]
While the graphics and gameplay are great, the story and voice acting falls behind just a little bit, but what are you going to expect from a company's first game?
[b]8/10[/b]"
14410,Short but sweet.  A great first person platforming experience.  Had a lot of fun with it.
14411,"Beautiful world, interesting story, smooth mechanics. What else could you ask for? 

I actually ended up finishing this game in one sitting. Exactly two hours. But I enjoyed every minute.

One thing I wish this game had was a longer story mode... as with a lot of games these days. Anyways, I think Gone North and Coffee Stain aced the futuristic excitment of discovering something new.

Definitely purchase this game while its on sale. :)"
14412,"A game with the depth and beauty, only matched by its childlike art and form. It brings back memories of old stories and tales from our childhoods, yet brings the difficulty and challenge adults crave. With a very unique playstyle and form, this game brings back nostalgiac memories of times past..."
14413,"While short, as a debut from Gone North Games, this is a fantastic indie game. It has a simple yet touching story and the platforming mechanics of running, jumping and using the grappling hook and rocket boots are simple yet effective. This is what makes a very fun and immersive exploration game. The level design is great, and the art direction is fantastic, with abstract and fantastical levels. I hope that the success of A Story About My Uncle brings more titles from Gone North Games, which I await with anticipation!"

14415,Game is worth it's prize. Also had great fun completing this game and searching for secrets / easter eggs.
14416,Interesting little game. Definately worth a few hours of your time.
14417,"Well worth getting. Maybe not the most polished game out there, but fricking hell its fun and engaging to play. What was supposed to be half an hour playthrough turned quickly into two hours or more. 
Would recommend!"
14418,"Awesome Game..
its a great story driven with alot of platforming involved.

from what i played so far i noticed the game has changed alot since its early prototype from back in 2012 aswell.
"
14419,"Unique, first person, fantasy adventure platformer. Narrated by our older self we live the story which we tell our daughter one night when our uncle Fred went missing. Que in the Pandora like world (from Avatar!) in which we traverse to find him, discovering new things people and lore along the way. Visual masterpiece given its style of graphics, design is  gorgeous. This non violent game is suitable for all. I'm starting a series on ths game and invite everyone along! - Check out my video on the demo to see how far its came! - Search for 'Zinthus game' Thanks!

14420,The story and gameplay is unbelivebly good
14421,"Story is whatever, NPC models are meh, NPC animations are stiff, voice acting is bleh.

NONE OF THAT SHIT MATTERS. THE GAMEPLAY IS FUCKING AMAZING AND THE ENVIRONMENTS ARE GODDAMNED BEAUTIFUL, AND THE AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK IS CHILL AS SHIT. BUY THIS GAME."
14422,"Out of nowhere, this little gem comes along. It‚Äôs a very short, but fun parkour game set around using a grapple hook to swing through gorgeous environments. Buy it!"
14423,"you are a apurture science version of spiderman who went to the world of avatar to tail bang some blue things but instead find uncle ben is there and you have to find him.
10/10 would bang"
14424,"This game was amazing. I was a bit short, but I think it was well worth the money."
14425,"An excellent puzzle game with breathtaking atmosphere and beautiful visuals. In less than 3 hours, it tells a poignant story of a boy's search for his uncle, narrated by the boy to his daughter many years later. Most of the characters are not present for long, but you genuinely come to care about them and feel sad when they leave. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone."
14426,"Fantastic Game!  Extremely well thought out story line and gameplay mechanics!  I highly recommend this to anybody looking for an inexpensive game that forces you to think a little bit.  It will sort of remind you of Portal, and maybe a little bit of Spider-Man, all wrapped up in an Alice in Wonderland type world.  I hope to see more from this company in the future!"
14427,"This is a fantastic short story with amazing mechanics and extremely high replay value. While this is a very short title, it is still very much worth the money. If you enjoy FPS games or parkour games with great stories and awsome voice acting you will definantly like this game. Also there are frog people. 10/10"
14428,"The first few minutes of the game left me speachless. You play the part of a boy looking for his uncle Fred in a world where rocks float and friendly frog people exist.
Beautiful surroundings, amazing attention to details, relaxing music, great gameplay feel.
No violence, just jumping, running, grapling, at either fast speed or you can take it slow if you want.
I really really love the fact that you always know where to go, what to do. And if you can't see the solution, make the leap of faith and the solution will be there for you to ""grab on to"".

I was running through the frog people's village and in the path there were two distinct beautiful flower pots, which even if they were randomly generated by some level editor constructor, the complexity of the objects I mean, someone actually thought it was a good idea to put them there. I could have just ran right past them, but I stopped and stared for about three minutes, I kid you not, nostalgically appreciating the attention to details. 

This is the best first person, adventure, single player, casual game I have ever played, by far.
I wish could think of a negative aspect of the game, but simply can't, there is none.

Can't wait to see what these guys come up with next. Great job guys!"
14429,"This game is an absolute work of art.  The atmophere is amazing, the music is nice, and the plot is fantastic.  The gameplay is also fun for a game without combat.  A great escape and a game I would definitely recommend if you want something different for a few hours."
14430,"The Good: All the travel mechanics this game is based arround are quite fun. You run fast, jump high and swing from place to place like spiderman.

The Bad: Dialogue is flat and boring, and worst of all there is quite a bit of it for a game of this type.

The Ugly: When you trigger events you lose all of The Good (you are forced to walk, slowly), and are forced to suffer The Bad.

As it stands I have no plans of replaying any of this on account of The Ugly ""feature""."
14431,"Good Game, Beautiful Scenery, Short Game."
14432,"Awesome fun! Great scenary fun platforming, interesting narrative. Voice acting could be a litte better and the music could be a bit better as well. Worth the money!"
14433,I saw a trailer of it on youtube so yesterday i bought it Great game if you want a mirror's edge game with grappling hooks i would suggest this game 10/10
14434,"Great moments ^^ very pretty game, worth it."
14435,"A very fun game, but I had some issues. First, it's short. It took me about 3 hours of gameplay tops to complete the whole thing.  There's not much more to say on that. Second is the gameplay. While the mechanics were great and gameplay was often fluid, it was very repetetive and tedious. Third and in my opinion, most important is the story. The game is called A STORY About my Uncle, and the story was lazy at best. The world that Coffee Stain created for this game is beautiful and incredibly atmospheric, and you can tell that there is a lot going on lore-wise. But the game doesn't elaborate on any of that. There is so much that is just so unexplained. Then there's the narration. The game tried to tell the story as a father telling his daughter a bed time story. Cute idea, and the basis for the whole game, but was executed poorly. As in, he hardly spoke. I think a Bastion-esque narration would have made a lot more sense here. And the actual story progression kinda sucks, but I feel it would have been better if the game was longer, as there would have been more character development, plot, etc;. 

Pros
Fun gameplay
Intuitive mechanics
Beautiful/Atmospheric world

Cons
Repetetive
Short
Lazy story
Boring characters

I recommend this game, but wait for it to go on sale, as the $12.99 pricetag (even discounted to $11.69 for me) is a bit high for what you are getting."
14436,Amazing game really really well done very nice to play looks great at has a good feel to the the controls *i used a controller* the  grappling hook is awesome and all the paths and routes you can take are really fun especially if you run and grapple everything fluently. it gives a massive sense of accomplishment when your about to fall and you pull it back at the last second. the narration and story are really nicely done and the music is very good and calming although it does lack a bit of the old epic running music at some points but its still nice to listen to. 8/10  buy it now and play it takes around maybe 2 - 5 hours depending on if you look at the beautiful world as much as i did :P
14437,"Although the game is fun with tight controls and a pretty world, it is too short. If the game was maybe $5 instead it would be worth the buy. I suggest playing the game but only when it goes on sale."
14438,"I'm usually really skeptical when it comes to platformers, there's rarely anything new thrown into the mix which makes each and every other platformer have the same feel about it. 
This game isn't like other platformers though and I mean that in the best of ways. The core mecanic is the same as other platformers, traveling from point A to point B, but the feeling of adventure and freedom while doing this simply sticks out from all the other platformers. 
The tools you get to proceed makes you soar through the air in different kinds of ways, making for a great flow and it makes you feel really free in this amazing world. Add a cozy story, hidden collectibles, a nice chunk of achievements and beautiful music that always hit the right spot and you've got this amazing gem of a game."
14439,"it was a great game good graphics few glitches and almost no bugs, but it was missing some stuff, it was a very short game, bad storyline, and the whole game just seemed the same in each part. over all i would give it a 7/10. (and the only reason i bought it was because it looked good and had a discount at the time) In my opionion i woudnt buy it if i didnt have much money but if i did definatly buy it :D"
14440,"This is poetry. This is a fantastic world open to you. This game is finished in a bit less than 2 hours but, to be honnest, it's one of the best 2 hours I've ever lived in a game. Thanks for this. Awesome."
14441,"I love this game. It has a brilliant story to it, and the layouts of levels are absolutely amazing.
It's not a very long game, but I do have my fingers crossed that there will be some sort of sequel, or maybe DLC... I love this game so much!

It took me 3 hours and 11 minutes to complete in total while streaming, but I'm definately gonna play this off-stream at times. It's really enjoyable.

Perhaps custom stories would be a good idea for this game? I'd like to see that.
9/10 score for this game!
Great job Gone North Games!"
14442,"This game is really fun. I've completed the story to it and have to say it was just amazing. If you're a fan of first person games like Mirrors Edge or Portal, or love jumper mods from Call of Duty. You're really gonna enjoy this. Flying throught he air with the grapple and the ability to jump great distances makes this feel like a futuristic pakour game. The graphics are up to par and the story is great as well, there is also a Time Trial mode which is really fun, and aggravating, haha. I highly reccomend this game. Even after I've completed it, I'm still playing it.

14443,Most beautiful bedtime-story ever!
14444,This game is amazing. As a previous reviewer mentioned the dialogue is forced is some areas but that is my only negative. I love the music and I hope this gets the same treatment as Portal. I hope this game sells well and they do a sequel that is much longer. Funnest game I have played in a long time. All the great stuff has already been written. Buy it to support and original idea.
14445,All im going to say is this game had me crying by the end of it. This is one of the best story based games i have played. I highly recomend it.

14447,"A great game that does well in all aspects. The platforming is fun and enjoyable, the story interesting and well told and the in-game exploration is great with tons of small secrets to find. Besides gameplay the visuals and sounds and both amazing to look at and to hear. An overall fantastic game, definitely worth your money and time."
14448,This game is amazingly awesome. The game's difficulty is offset by it's stunning visuals making it hard to put down.
14449,"A Story About My Uncle is a game about a kid who sets on to find his lost uncle. He finds one of his uncle's inventions, a suit that protects him from fall damage and alllows for powered jumps and comes with a grappling hook that allows him to reach great distances and higher places. Using this suit, he follow his uncle's steps unto a wonderful hidden world.

The gameplay is very fluid and smooth, and I would say that is a mix between Mirror's Edge and Bionic Commando. The game continuously introduces new mechanics/power-ups throughout the game(like a rocket-powered boost), keeping the experience fresh, and it gets more and more challenging as it goes(but not too much), keeping up a good pacing between challenge, the introdution of new mechanics and the getting used to those mechanics.

The art direction is great, beautiful scenery and atmosphere. Great sights to check out.

The story is told as a bedtime story, narrated by the nephew of the ""Uncle"" to his daughter. It can feel somewhat rushed, with some things happening with almost no lead-up to that outcome. However, In general, it entertains well, there are some side characters that add up some variation to the narrative and keep it interesting.


Easily one of my GOTYs of this year. 8.8/10"

14453,"A game based solely around platforming. Where the platforming is terrible.

That about sums up this game. Which is unfortunate.

When I saw this game I had visions of zooming through levels at high speeds. Never slowing down. Letting momentum carry me from one platforming challenge to the next. 

If this is what you're looking for here, look elsewhere. 

The levels are designed as a multitude of platforming puzzles. So after each puzzle you need to slam on the breaks, stop and observe, and then getting going once more. Moreover, there is no turning while grappling. So no spider man style swinging. Once you begin pulling yourself along using the grapple, its a straight shot only.

Never before have I seen so many systems in a game that scream player freedom, so hampered by level design and bad controls in order to immediately limit that freedom. The game is creative and different and the world unique. I like those facets of the game.

But the controls and level design conspire to frustrate any sense of fun one might have derived from the platforming."
14454,"A Story About My Uncle, pros & cons.

Pros :
- Amazing graphics!
- Great movement system, all aspects of grappling, boosting just work so well!
- A very peaceful game, something to relax.
- Amazing ebb & flow.

Cons :
- A very short game for 12‚Ç¨
- Rushed story
- Lack of interaction with village characters (I think it would add some spice to the game)
- A companion who spams you with ""Hey! Hey! Over here!"" until you reach her. ( HEY! LISTEN! )
- Game builds affection between main character and a companion in less than 2 hours. 
- Some dialogues tend to be a bit dull.

The game looks great, movement features work wonders and there is no trouble in finding the correct path, good map planning. However, the game is simply too short, I feel like a lot of content could have been added. More topics should have been explained and developed. Game feels rushed when it comes to story : beginning of the story seems fine but its later execution went poorly.

The point is, it would be fantastic if the game was cheaper or longer (or both). Get it during cool sales  so you can have a proper length to price scaling. Otherwise, a game worth playing."

14461,"For as much as I hated the prospect of having to sleep as a child, the allure of a bedtime story almost completely put the displeasure of ending a day out of my mind, replaced with a rapid interest in what adventure I would hear about that night, which regardless of how flimsy the tale may be always held a sort of fantastical quality to it. A Story About My Uncle is itself a bedtime story, albeit one not constrained to mere words but created in vibrant detail allowing you to explore it for yourself while still retaining that magical quality that only comes from a friendly voice telling you a story before you inevitably shut your eyes.

While the title may lead to believe differently, ASAMU actually focuses on the titular uncle‚Äôs nephew; a daring young lad who, taking after his uncle, has an endless curiosity about the world around him and an irresistible urge to explore it. So it would stand to reason that upon visiting his uncle‚Äôs workshop and finding it empty, save a small futuristic suit in just his size, that he would strap it on and set out to find where his uncle has made off to.

Aside from the quick opening taking place in a setting resembling the one we ourselves live in, ASAMU is firmly planted in a marvelously imaginative world of its own creation. Huge floating rock structures populated with glowing foliage and villages of frog like inhabitants paint an enchanting local to explore, or simply admire from a standstill for its beauty. For as straightforward as the narrative is, the further I progressed the more intrigued I became about the place I was exploring, and longed to learn more about what had sparked all of it into being.

Unfortunately, ASAMU hasn‚Äôt anywhere near enough time to explore everything it presents before you, or in fact touch on anything for more than a brief moment before the end is before you after only 2-3 hours. It‚Äôs incredibly disappointing because developer Gone North Games achieves so much in this time in getting me interested in the world and lore it created, but ends the experience well before it has a chance to expand on any of it leaving me with a distinct lack of closure. It‚Äôs like having an amazing dream, and just as you‚Äôre beginning to get into it you‚Äôre woken with a start and no matter how hard you try can‚Äôt find it again.

When you art admiring the locals (or deploring their brevity), you‚Äôre soaring through the air using the prior mentioned suit, the abilities of which grant you an incredible amount of agility. The foremost of these is a grapple ability which lets you grab ahold of structures and use them to propel you forward. Combined with a super jump and sprint ability this creates an exhilarating means of travel, making you feel like a parkour running that‚Äôs made off with the claw from Bionic Commando as you rush through levels swinging from point to point. When you get into a flow it feels like little else I‚Äôve ever played, and has me wishing more games attempted to do first person platforming this way, but here is you come up against a bit of a roadblock.

While the tools to string together grapples and jumps are all within your hands, you‚Äôre shackled with severe limitations on how you can use them which quickly turns to frustration as you find yourself repeatedly falling into bottomless pits. You are given a set number of grapples you can perform before landing, but levels are designed in a way that requires you to take a specific path through them jumping and swinging at just the right moment, essentially removing all form of experimentation from the player. There is so much potential here that for the developers to make such an easily remedied mistake is a huge shame, and one which greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game. I‚Äôd have even accepted an unlockable cheat which removes these limitations, as being able to traverse levels without constantly having to plan each moment out would feel incredible, but instead the mechanics hurt themselves by over restricting the player and taking away a lot of what could have been an amazing platforming system.

Even had it not come from a small studio, I would have been very impressed with the graphical work achieved in the environments and especially the sparse use of color to outline paths and present a contrast to the various areas you visit. Though largely taking place in caves, each level feels entirely distinct to itself, from the suffocating darkness of a deep chasm to the breathtaking vistas of a world existing above the clouds. Almost every moment offers an amazing view, made all the more exciting by the speed you typically move through them, and the fact it was accomplished by an indie developer makes it even more unexpected.

I do wish I could say as kind things about the voice acting, which unfortunately is among the worst of any game in recent memory. Full of awkward inflections and strange pauses, the cast does a rather poor job masking the fact they are almost certainly not native english speakers, and the strange disconnect between them and what they are saying makes it hard not to groan whenever someone opens their mouth to try and deliver a line. I don‚Äôt mean to be so hard on a group that seems to at least have tried really hard to give a good performance, but I can‚Äôt gloss over the fact that it‚Äôs just abysmal all around and had me tempted to turn it off entirely and get by on subtitles alone.

A Story About My Uncle is a hugely ambitious game for an entirely new developer, which almost inevitably didn‚Äôt manage to quite hit the mark. It‚Äôs riddled with flaws from almost every angle, which when piled upon each other make it a rather hard sell. Poor voice acting, frustrating gameplay design, and a shockingly brief length left me wondering if I could really recommend it to someone else. But for all its faults I still enjoyed the experience, for reasons I find hard to put into words. There is just something inherently charming about all of it, and perhaps I wanted so much for its mechanics to succeed that I kept going despite my annoyances. I can‚Äôt speak for others, but I suppose a lot of it harkens back to my love of bedtime stories in general, which no matter how lackluster they were I ate up with a ravenous desire for more.

In a lot of ways A Story About My Uncle left me feeling the same way as most of the stories I was told growing up; not entirely displeased with what I got, but saddened it had to end so soon.

14462,"A Story About My Uncle is a great first person adventure game that looks beautiful and has a simple, charming story with lovable characters. The gameplay is what's really fun about the game where you use a suit that let's you super jump and swing through levels using a sort of energy hook, which really gives you the sense of speed, flying, and freedom. But the game isn't long, it's about a 2 hour long campaign. After finishing it you can replay the levels normally or as a time trial. For me the game was worth it, the experience was great, fun, and heartwarming. 
The game would really benifit from a level editor to keep the game going with a lot of user created content, so here's hoping they add one.

14463,"I wrote a full-length review over at What's Your Tag? (www.whatsyourtagblog.com), but long story short, A Story About My Uncle is a beautifully designed game with a charming narrative and ferociously precise platforming that was a blast to play through. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect in the beginning, but the end result was not only a welcome surprise, but also the best game I‚Äôve played so far in 2014. Sure, Watch Dogs and Mario Kart 8 release this week as well, but A Story About My Uncle is the game you should be playing instead.

Full review, 9.5/10 - http://whatsyourtagblog.com/2014/05/27/a-story-about-my-uncle-review/"
14464,"A story about my uncle is a beautiful game with amazing scenery and gameplay. I had so much fun going through the levels and I love that you can go through the level in so many ways with some challenges along the road. This game is a combination of Portal and Mirrors Edge and I see nothing wrong with it. Mechanics are done really good and you really have a feeling and a burst of adrenaline when you jump, run or do a leap of fate. It takes you around 3 hours to finish it if you explore every bit of it or 2 and a half hours if you want to just run through the level. Design of the levels and the overall map is beautiful. Also even when you finish the game you can go for another run becuase its a lot of fun. I recommend this game to all of you and if you want to know more about this game check out this review with gameplay of course.

14465,"A Story About My Uncle is a narrative focused, first person platforming adventure developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.

The story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.

The game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast; flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.

Like I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time; using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.

The sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The ""Whoosh"" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.

[b]Additional Notes:[/b] This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.
